Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed the online course. I thought it was well planned and layed out, easy for me to follow. The work load(h.w. & test)was just enough, so i could finish everything with enough time, learn about the topics and not feel over loaded and rushed. Overall I really like this class because all lectures, assignments, and tests are straight forward. 
I really enjoyed this class and the format it was presented in. For me, I learn and retain much more through an online class due to the fact you can do the course as an open book. This really makes me search for the answer and in return, I retain more information.  I found it relaxing to be able to turn the work on the assignments and test at my leisure and when I had the time.  I liked the fact you were very clear that more internet research may be necessary for some assignments To be honest, there is nothing that I disliked about the course. I will definitely be taking another online course from you!"
Freshman,5,"The best thing about the University of San Francisco is its location, in the heart of San Francisco. I absolutely loved my first year at this school. I really enjoyed the fact that this school is focused and committed to providing a high quality education, whereas with other schools can at time seem to focus too much on school spirit and sports teams. I had some amazing teachers, met some life long friends, and cannot wait to continue the rest of my college career at this school"
Junior,5,My online learning experience at USF has been really good. I still feel like I am getting the same learning experience when though it's all online. The professors have done a good job of communicating with us via Zoom and email.
Junior,5,"So far I have really enjoyed my time at USF. All the staff and faculty are super nice and helpful, the students are friendly and kind. I really like the environment of the campus, definitely would recommend people go here!"
Alum,5,I did not take courses online however I did have to do homework online and that experience was manageable and overall pleasant.
Alum,5,"The opportunities at USF are endless. The school is always offering ways to get connected with major companies throughout SF and get connected wit USF alumni. They teach you the importance of networking all 4 years of your college experience and how it can help you in the long run.

The people who attend ar kind, passionate, and always willing to help out a neighbor. I have not only met some of my best friends, but I've met my family."
Alum,5,"I didn't take any online classes during my time at USF, but the in-person classes are fun, educational, and riveting."
Junior,5,"I love that the school is at the epicenter of San Francisco, has a welcoming environment, and nice people. I wish there was more diversity at the university, meaning larger representation of minority groups."
Graduate Student,5,"Many students simply sign up for classes, show up, do the work, and go on with the next degree requirement. When I was in school, my mom became unemployed and I had to start working full-time. My grades suffered, but the staff at USF did everything possible to try and help me to the finish line. I owe my degree to the professors and student support staff, because without them I wouldn't know how to overcome academic obstacles. The challenges faced at USF helped prepare me for real life, and USF understands that every student has a different path to graduation."
Graduate Student,5,"USF utilizes Canvas, and it's quite helpful knowing everything needed to complete the online course on Day 1. It helps you gauge how much time you need for each assignment, as well as check out if you can stay ahead of the class."
Sophomore,5,"I had to take my nursing courses online halfway through Spring semester of 2020. Although it was challenging as nursing studies are mostly hands-on, my professors did their uttermost best to provide the necessary tools and information to help us along the way."
Sophomore,5,this school is amazing. the professors here really want to help you succeed. they're so helpful and caring.
Sophomore,5,this is one of the best schools in the country and for good reason. they offer small sized classrooms so you really get to know your professors.
Sophomore,5,I love the people at USF! Everyone is very friendly and you have a lot of opportunities to meet new people and explore new places.
Senior,5,"USF professors were thrown into a online learning platform due to the COVID-19 pandemic and were able to still provide an excellent learning environment. All my professors worked to provide us with an education we expected from them and they understood the shock of the students and vice versa. For not being designed to be online, all my professors were able to give us the resources we needed to succeed and learn the material efficiently."
Junior,5,Chill campus with chill people + you’ll always find someone who has similar interests as you. The only downside are the LoMo steps they will make you sweat on hot days
Junior,5,Honestly can’t see myself going back to normal classes the transition has been great. Can’t say the same for international students
Sophomore,5,Teachers are always very responsive in emails so feedback comes back quickly. They are more flexible with deadlines now that it is remote learning because they understand that this is a stressful time and that there may be a time zone difference.
Sophomore,5,Super diverse and the professors are really passionate about what they teach. They really are there to provide you the service you paid for in a private school and they are always willing to help you 24/7!
Freshman,5,"The University of San Francisco provides its students with a different type of education and environment. As a freshman, I was afraid of not being able to receive enough support from my college. However, coming to USF, support is seen through every part of the university, from its faculty to its students. USF's Jesuit tradition is emphasized in terms of helping us become good people so that we can do the best and impact the world after our four years. Everyone is super caring and loving and the USF community acts as if it is a family. USF has honestly. been the. best college decision for me and I truly feel happy there! 100% an amazing school!"
Senior,5,"I LOVE USF. A lot :'). I'm going to be a senior this fall and I am so sad it will be my last year. I have been able to be a part of so many great opportunities like being a campus tour guide, an orientation leader, and in a sorority! One of my favorite things about it is the campus community that students are able to create from themselves, but also the San Francisco community. USF is very good at integrating aspects of the city into the school where it allows students to make their college experience however they want it to be. If you like the city and being in the center of it, USF is perfect for you :)"
Junior,5,"I enjoy attending the University of San Francisco! As a current Junior business major, USF has opened my mind to new opportunities whether they are professional and social. The USF's core value of caring for a whole person shines within each classroom, professor, and staff. I feel like they really want me to succeed and feel supported in my college journey. I enjoy how class sizes are small enough for me to get to know my professor and classmates. Overall, the campus culture is inviting and a tight-knit community"
Freshman,5,"USF is an amazing university! One of the things I love most about the campus is the positive environment between students. Everyone you meet genuinely wants to help you succeed and see you succeed. One thing that's great is that USF doesn't do ""rank-based"" grading and we have direct-entry programs, so it really fosters an environment where you don't feel like you're competing with others. 

Professors really care about seeing you do well in their classes too. Many of them encourage attending office hours and the small classes means that it's not packed all the time. 

The city has tons of amazing opportunities too! There's lots of options to build your career."
Freshman,5,"After my first year at USF, I can truly say that I have found the best university for me. The students, staff, and faculty are absolutely amazing. Additionally, the location of the university allows for unique opportunities like one of a kind internships and life experiences such as running across the Golden Gate Bridge or taking a walk the Golden Gate Park. There are also so many departments dedicated to helping students with academic, emotional, mental, and physical health."
Alum,5,Amazing! Being in San Francisco gives you many opportunities to network. Most of my friends had jobs afterwards lined up.
Niche User,5,I like the amount of resources the school provides for you and the support you get from the faulty and staff. What inspires to do better are my companions and peers who are also going to school there. Overall the process for me going there is great and I cant wait for what the future holds.
Freshman,5,"The University of San Francisco offers excellent opportunities in an extremely influential city. With its fast-paced environment and commited proffessors, you are bound to find the help you need. The school does offer a large amount of merit aid to academically successful students like myself. Despite this, the remaining cost is huge. I woud like expand the amount of scholorships and financial aid available to students."
Freshman,5,"I really like the environment and culture here. It is very diverse and everyone respects each other for their own opinions. I also like how the professors care about their students success and make time to form bonds with their students. It is however, relatively expensive to attend this school."
Graduate Student,5,One thing I liked about the university of San Francisco is the diversity. It is very user friendly and the  staff and students are really friendly easy to communicate with. I would like to see better food selection.
Sophomore,5,"Absolutely love this school! 10/10 recommend going if you get in! The students  are so nice, the professors are amazing, and the city is our playground."
Graduate Student,5,I went to Graduate school here at USF. I got a masters in Nursing. I went to Cal State East Bay then went to Valparaiso University in Indiana.  By far USF was the best school as about mentioned. I recommend anybody to attend USF. The teachers are all smart and approachable.
Niche User,5,USF is a very diverse campus with a lot of access to plenty of things to do around the Bay Area. it is located in the middle of San Francisco and easy transportation to surrounding cities.
Sophomore,5,"It’s not a very big university so I love how all the buildings are close by. USF holds awesome events for students including concerts with popular artists, seasonal events (like Winter Wonderland and Fright Night) and tons of other fun stuff!"
Alum,5,I really liked how open the campus was and how many available resources they have all around. The school really helps you reach your goals in graduating on time. The professors are also very helpful.
Sophomore,5,I love that USF makes you feel connected to the community. The staff are nice and resourceful. I am learning a lot from my classes and professors.
Sophomore,5,"Great School! Placed in the heart of San Francisco. Strong Biology, Nursing, Business and Computer Science Programs. Great Liberal Arts program."
Graduate Student,5,The directors are more than willing to help you in anything you need and will go above and beyond to help. The only big downfall is that the school is a private school and therefore does not offer a lot of financial aid options and is quite expensive.
Sophomore,5,"I became well-adjusted right after I transferred here at USF. My first semester was a great start for me seeing how people are approachable and nice, having a very decent library to use to prepare for exams, and having insightful and great professors I learn a lot from. Overall, it's a wonderful school to be in."
Freshman,5,I love the diversity and the open-ness of the community here. I always feel like I have a home on campus.
Sophomore,5,beautiful diverse private school! Beautiful location and wonderful professors and staff who care about their students! price is a little much but it is worth it
Freshman,5,"From viewing the campus so far, the students and staff create a welcoming environment and strive to make all of their students receive the most out of their education."
Sophomore,5,"After completing my first year, I can say that USF provided me with the best experience I could have asked for as a first year student. The nursing program here is outstanding. Class sizes are very small, allowing professors to get to know you and help you 1 on 1."
Freshman,5,The greatest school of all time. You can’t beat it. It has the location. The people. The food. The sports. The atmosphere.
Sophomore,5,Really great school and there are lots of opportunities to get involved on campus so take all of them.
Freshman,5,"It is a really small campus compare to big schools like UCLA or UC Berkeley. By the end of freshman year, I almost recognized most of the faces I see in the cafeteria. The perk about being small is that the classes are smaller: only about 15-20 students per class, and you are part of this tight little community. Everyone knows each other and therefore help out each other. Also, the campus is breathtakingly beautiful, especially Lone Mountain. You get the view of the SF Bay and Golden Gate from Lone Mountain. You get to live in the heart of San Francisco where you can get access to internships, jobs, recruiters from the top of your fingertips. The university is very diverse and liberal although it is considered Catholic school. Definitely a life-changing experience. CHANGE THE WORLD FROM HERE."
Freshman,5,"I love the school, although they need to not raise tuition, I love the school a lot and enjoy the environment provided. Also there needs to be more help for undocumented students."
Alum,5,USF has so many well diverse students and professors. Professors are well educated and are truly dedicated to students. A small school but provides great education!
Niche User,5,"University of San Francisco became my top choice of colleges through touring and meeting some of the professors. I absolutely fell in love with the beautiful campus as well as the location, and cannot wait to practice my fine arts major in the incredible art department."
Sophomore,5,"I attend USF and I've been very satisfied with this college. The campus is beautiful and just the right size. Class sizes are like high school, around 25 students, which is great to retain all the material from lectures. USF offers a lot of resources such as psychological & counseling services, academic and peer advisors to help you with classes, schedule, and registration, the study abroad center, and even field trips around the city depending on the subject. Even though it's an expensive private school, they're generous with their scholarships. I've loved all my professors; very motivated to teach, with great qualification, and always available. They'll know who you are and remember your name."
Freshman,5,"I really love it here! Despite the very cold weather here in San Francisco, the campus is beautiful and the community is just amazing. The only thing I would suggest for change is for the cafeteria food to improve in quality and quantity. It's all very expensive yet we don't get much on a plate which doesn't make any sense. Other than that, an amazing college."
Freshman,5,USF is a great school that really tries its hardest to get its students involved. It is great academically and offers a lot of great resources that are available on campus. The professors are extremely accessible and very nice. There is not much variety in the cafeteria and the food is really expensive. Everything other than the cafeteria is amazing.
Freshman,5,"Being in the center of such a diverse and technological city, University of San Francisco makes sure that all of its students have easy access to the many opportunities around us."
Freshman,5,"Their motto is to ""Change the world"". They are a Jesuit university in the heart of San Francisco. They have changed my life entirely."
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student from another 4-year university, and I truly prefer this university over the last one. There is a strong support system for students which made my transition here easy and has also encouraged me to access more resources. There is so much diversity on such a small campus and a resounding mission for social justice. It does not hurt that this campus is beautiful. I am so happy to be here. I know that I made the right choice."
Junior,5,"Great school in a fantastic location right in the heart of San Francisco beautiful campus. Great professors and students, incredible class sizes not too big and easy to find. Lots to do outside of the classroom as you are in the center of San Francisco just blocks from Golden Gate park."
Senior,5,I love that USF has small classes and its always easy to access professors. I never feel lost and the faculty and admin always is helpful with resolving any issues I may have. Its a small but warm and nurturing community.
Senior,5,"I love this school especially since it is right in the middle of a city. However, the social scene is pretty weak on campus, so you have to make  sure that you love the city life and going out rather than frats and sorority life."
Junior,5,"So far so good! I enjoy the look and feel of the campus. I also like the location, in the middle of the city!"
Graduate Student,5,I loved the small classes and the approachable teachers. All the students there are relatively friendly and easy to talk to. There is always something going on on the campus.
Sophomore,5,"So far I love my time at the University of San Francisco. I am thriving not only as a student, but as a community leader. This school has great academics and community support. I believe anyone who attends this school will get a good return on their investment."
Alum,4,"USF has a credible reputation throughout the Bay Area as a respectable school. My professors were wonderful and cared about my education personally. I think overall, the value of education is worth the pretty penny and I hope to continue to see great things from USF in the future."
Graduate Student,4,This is my second time attending University of San Francisco. The instructors are great and very supportive.
Graduate Student,4,The instructors are really responsive and the course work aligns great with the program. I recommend this program.
Alum,4,"Small and personable class sizes, opportunities to become involved with campus life, can't beat the city location"
Alum,4,"I did not take any online classes, but my colleagues who did didn't have any issues.  The school makes the most of the technology that is available."
Senior,4,"The school cares deeply about the students- abundance of resources to use for academics and outstanding ones for you to launch your career once you leave USF. They understand the price you pay to go to school so they want to give the best of the best. That includes teachers, faculty, counselors, resources etc. The thing I would like to different is them helping students who have faced heavy financial burdens and giving my grant money, the want for students to succeed disappears when asking for money to support your education."
Senior,4,"My teachers have ben able to adapt, some hiccups but we are all learning. Some have made it as hands on as if in a classroom where some left you more to do your own learning. For some who do not have the discipline to run a course for themselves it can be troubling but there is still a lot of support. Tons of ""office"" hours and resources to help you still succeed and be a great student even from a distance."
Freshman,4,I really like the location of the campus. The campus is very near downtown San Francisco so it is easy to have access to everything you need.
Sophomore,4,"My experience with online classes at the University of San Francisco was challenging. My professors were understanding and helpful. However, I learn better in a classroom setting."
Sophomore,4,"I love the University of San Francisco. The location is fantastic! There are always things to do around the city and the education is exceptional. The professors and school administration are very supportive of students. I feel a personal connection with my professors and the staff at the university. There are many campus resources  that have helped me with classes, mental health, employment and so much more. I would recommend this university to anyone who is looking for an education that personally caters to the individual. I would also recommend this school for people who enjoy exploring places and trying new things."
Junior,4,It was well executed. Even dance classes were done well through zoom. Some classes were also asynchronous.
Junior,4,"All the professors I have had have been nothing but kind and are always willing to help out students. The campus is not that big, so it is really easy to get from class to class. There are a lot of ways to get involved on campus and they really encourage students to do so! There is also a lot of student diversity. I wish there was a more diverse range of classes, but I guess that comes with being in a smaller institution. Also, stay away from the cafeteria food!"
Junior,4,"During the pandemic, in person classes switched to a remote delivery. Though not the same as in person classes, the professors tried really hard to give us the best experience possible. We did the best with what we could and professors were more than willing to accommodate to students' needs."
Sophomore,4,"Being in San Francisco as a young person is an amazing opportunity. That being said, the cost of living will lead to a painful existence. The university has a very competitive process to try and get housing after freshman year, so most upperclassman are left living paycheck to paycheck trying to afford housing in the city. Other than that, facilities are great and there are many opportunity."
Sophomore,4,University of San Francisco is a diverse school which has students and faculty from all walks of life. USF promotes Jesuit values as they believe that through education people can change their communities on a microcosmic scale. USF's faculty and other employees are supportive of the student.
Sophomore,4,"Many of my professors switched to a self-paced kind of learning process. One of my professors actually had mini class sessions where we spent time discussing and sharing ideas with each other, which made me feel more involved and active."
Sophomore,4,"Overall my experience at USF has been a positive one. The copious amounts of academic and professional resources have provided me great opportunities for success. I am extremely satisfied with my academic achievement and personal growth I have gone through since attending USF. For the most part all of my professors have been kind and are willing to put in the effort for my success. The campus and neighborhood are beautiful and unmatched to every other school. The student life is what you make it and does require extra effort than you might find at other schools. This school is not a typical 4-year college experience as many start working/interning freshmen year, live in an apartment by sophomore year, and go to clubs rather than frat basements. While many scholarships are afforded to students tuition is back breaking and is a main reason students end up transferring. The price is the only reason I would personally contemplate another school."
Senior,4,University of San Francisco is in the perfect location for students to experience the world while obtaining an education. It strives to give students the best education on a diverse and technologically advanced campus. Students are from all over the world allowing students to broaden their horizons and form friendships from all aspects of life. I believe USF can improve their campus by updating their current dorm buildings and finding a way to engage students for more campus involvement.
Senior,4,"USF mirrors the surrounding City of San Francisco, it is diverse, vibrant, and constantly evolves with the times. The schools location is unparalleled, with opportunities every where to get professional experience."
Freshman,4,I love the University of San Francisco because of the crazy amounts of diversity in people and in food. Living in San Francisco is such a blessing and I'm thankful for choosing the University of San Francisco for my 4-year university.
Freshman,4,"So far it has been a great experience since I have made some great friendships not only with fellow students but with professors who I know truly want me to succeed. However, besides that, the entire board does not keep the student body informed especially in the case of safety issues. There have been at least three cases in which we were not informed and my specific safety was in question so much so I did not know where to go so I had my boyfriend pick me up and take me to his home since I could not go to my dorm. If I did not have him in my life I do not know what I would have done or where I could have gone."
Niche User,4,the school is liberal and is very open to all. Being located in the center of San Francisco there are so many places within walking distance. If you ever need to get some fresh air you can just step outside into the city or go to the parks nearby. since the school is located in a city you can make the city yours and decide what to do. With the classroom size being smaller than most you are able to have better discussions with your peers and the teachers too. Something that I would want to change is the interaction between others as sometimes you have to step out of your comfort zone but it helps build up courage too.
Niche User,4,"USF is a very diverse campus which is great! Everybody is so nice. One thing that I really like about the school is the study rooms. In order to get into any building on campus you must have your campus ID that you scan at the door. The library is decent, but it is much better than having to study in a dorm or at home. I really enjoy the comfy couches, chairs, and moveable clear whiteboards that is accessible to all students on campus."
Niche User,4,"I think that so far I have liked everything San Francisco University has to offer. The education level is amazing as well as the professors. Everyone is just so kind to each other! However, if I had to change one thing I would say that the dorms could be bigger. Sometimes I feel like it is a little cramped in there, but overall everything is good!"
Niche User,4,I loved the environment. It was a great university and really supported me to get closer to my career.
Freshman,4,"I love being a student at the University of San Francisco. The student body is very diverse and everyone is open-minded. I am absolutely grateful for the class sizes, they are relatively small and allows me to be better acquainted with my professors and peers. The campus is beautiful and located in the heart of San Francisco, which I am able to explore with the muni pass that is included in tuition.The main thing that I find disappointing though is the food in the UC, it's always the same meals."
Sophomore,4,"As a sophomore at this university, I feel like I've had a great experience overall. I made great friendships, professors here are really accessible, the campus location in the city is also great. Although I feel like your college experience is highly dependent on the students' attitude, USF is really easy to fall in love with."
Freshman,4,"My experience so far is really good while staying on campus. The bathrooms on my floor are fairly clean and the maintenance of the bathroom are also very well. Although I was very confused when arriving on campus, the one thing that I appreciate are the maps scattered throughout the campus. One thing that I am disappointed about is the variety of food in the Student Center. Every time I go to purchase a meal, they are always serving the same entrees."
Sophomore,4,"I'm currently a sophomore at the University of San Francisco, and the best part about the University is that they allow you to be independent and emphasize city exploration. I expected a stereotypical college experience coming out of high school-- going to a UC/State School, rigorous coursework, great social life, living on campus most of the time. However, going to USF has made me appreciate everything that I didn't think I would. My classes aren't all that challenging, I live off campus and have loved being in different neighborhoods daily and just walking around the city, and as for social life, I've come to love all the bars, clubs, small stores, and local business community that the city has to offer. I definitely did not expect this coming out of high school, but I'm glad I got this unique experience at one of the most diverse colleges in the world."
Sophomore,4,"It is in a very good location, with lots of job opportunities and internship help. However, there is some lack of communication between staff and students."
Junior,4,"As a nursing student, I am very impressed with the organization that the program has demonstrated to place us all in the appropriate classes and clinical rotations every term. There are some instances in which plans fall through, but frankly, I'm surprised that doesn't happen more often. I have had the pleasure of learning from some amazing professors there, who are knowledgeable, compassionate, and seem to be happy working there. I would recommend this school to a prospective nursing student."
Freshman,4,It's a great school with excellent academics and professors! It's pretty expensive so I would recommend scholarships. Campus is very pretty and right in the heart of SF; because a MUNI pass is included in tuition I can use it to go anywhere in the city.
Senior,4,"It took me a while to appreciate the campus and its resources. At this school, you have to go out of your way to try and challenge yourself and seek guidance from Prof./admin that can offer you great opportunities. I had the opportunity to have great professors that are dedicated to their fields of work and will expand your understanding of relevant social issues. I also have had great job opportunities come out of my experience.

The school is expensive, the student body is diverse, the opportunities are there if you look for them, the campus is small, and the area is killer (but expensive). This school is NOT for you if: you want/expect rigorous academics, a large student body and campus, a collective student identity, a large party scene, and affordability. This school IS for you if: you thrive in smaller classrooms, enjoy the city environment, don't care about school spirit or sports, want a rough but manageable workload

Any college experience is what you choose to make of it."
Junior,4,I like how diverse the university is. I met a lot of friends from around the world and this gave me a chance to know more about different cultures. I also like the class sizes here. The classes are small so this certainly helped me to be more involved in the class.
Sophomore,4,"I LOVE being at the University of San Francisco. Some aspects of USF that I love is how the class sizes are fairly small. I am able to meet with my professors whenever I need, without having to compete for an appointment slot. Since the undergrad population is around 6000 students, the resources on or off-campus can be reached by all students. There are a lot of immersion/retreat opportunities where donors/the university provides a lot of scholarships for most students in need!"
Niche User,4,"The University of San Francisco is a cuddled inside the large and lively city of San Francisco. While the school is amazing with great degrees, it is very expensive. 
The expenses of the school are far too much for a medium classes student to be able to make it through a year without Financial Aid, a job or two, and Scholarships to help them. 
Some may say it is worth the while for the beautiful architecture, lively city, and astounding view. Other's may say it is far too crowded, expensive, and cold to attend this school."
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere and the location. A lot of great opportunities and an overall great education!
Sophomore,4,I would like for there to be a focus on housing for students in real need for housing and were not guaranteed for on-campus housing. It is very unsatisfying to finish a school year without the guarantee for housing the following school year.
Senior,4,"University of San Francisco lies in the middle of San Francisco. My overall experience with the university is good. I'm currently in the BSN nursing program and the school provides me with amazing opportunities from volunteering to clinical sites. However, tuition and books is quite expensive and its always increasing. I wish the school understands how expensive it is and provide us with some sort of alternatives."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy university of San Francisco. The schools professors really care about your progress and there are substantial outreach programs to help academically struggling students. Unfortunately there aren’t many opportunities for low income students and there isn’t really a pro-sex education idea because it is a private school, but living in San Francisco one can find those programs outside."
Junior,4,"Overall, I have loved my experience at USF. I have met amazing people and have lived in the most beautiful city."
Graduate Student,4,"San Francisco itself is a beautiful, diverse, imaginative city. It be able to attend college there was a dream. The students and the professors really embody the culture of the city. USF is flooded with passion for social justice and cultural diversity from students and faculty alike. I was incredibly lucky to have professors who were engaging and enthusiastic about their field of study. I am eager to see USF grow in its student diversity and mission to enact positive change."
Senior,4,"Very expensive but pretty good academically. Campus is very small and doesn't really feel like a real ""college experience"". Class sizes are very small, which is good for getting individualized attention, but it makes it feel like a high school. Some majors do better than others, accounting is successful but computer science students have a hard time getting internships."
Sophomore,4,"There are lots of ways to get involved on campus. The courses challenge you , and you are given a multitude of ways to give back to the world outside of campus. The professors generally work closely with students."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the small classes. It's makes the learning experience more intimate and focused. There are more times to see professors during office hours and the professors always remind about the resources available on campus to help me succeed through my classes.
Freshman,4,"What I enjoy most about the university is that it is very focus driven— in a city as popular and busy as San Francisco spit can be very easy to become distracted from your schoolwork, but the institution does a great job of maintaining an environment that pushes you to be the best you can be."
Junior,4,This school for me is good because you are able to talk with professors after class and get help to understand the course material. The school is focused on helping provide valuable skill sets for future careers and have quality professors.
Niche User,4,The upmost important trait from University of  San Francisco was being able to noticeably see the amount of diversity within the school and as well as the diverse education that they offer. This is an important thing for me coming from a family of minorities and living a low middle class life because there was immediately the sense of acceptance.
Freshman,4,USF is an amazing school with amazing faculty members and amazing students.  The university takes pride in its Jesuit values and emphasizes it all of the courses being taught one way or another.
Freshman,4,Overall USF is a pretty good university considering that it’s at the heart of SF and the professors are so down to earth.
Sophomore,4,"Its a small college with a lot of diverse people, not much goes on, doesn't really have anything for transfer students. Makes you feel left out."
Freshman,4,"There are very small classes where students are able to actually have an intimate connection with each professor. Another thing about USF is that there is a range of clubs, organization, and programs that benefit each student. Moreover, the Business program here is also amazing as there is a committee that works to connect the different School of Business Administration together and allow them to experience each field of business throughout the four years. Furthermore, there are also several financial aid programs that students can get for four years. In fact, 75% of the student who attends USF are under the school's financial aid. This provides an opportunity for students who cannot afford the full amount. However, a disadvantage of USF is that there are not a lot of on-campus housing options as housing is only guaranteed for only freshmen. But, the school has a department dedicated to helping students to find off-campus housing that fits their demands and financial state."
Senior,4,University of San Francisco may be a small school but they are very dedicated in wanting the students to succeed and they provide many opportunities for students to improve their academics or finding job opportunities.
Sophomore,4,"USF is located in the heart of the beautiful city of San Francisco. The location is almost perfect. They have great sports teams, especially the Men's basketball team! It is a very diverse school, both the students and the professors."
Sophomore,4,"The University of San Francisco has given me opportunities that no other college has given me. This university has opened doors for me, like working at the Graduation Center everyday. What I most enjoy about USF is the diversity and how everyone gets along with everyone. In your small classes, there are people from all kinds of backgrounds. That goes to say that the professors are amazing and the academics here are exceptional. Most professors take time out of their days to help their students with any material that they don't understand. USF was a good choice because it's at the heart of San Francisco."
Graduate Student,4,This is the university is at a very good location. It offers lots of opportunities that helps your career and futhure improvements.
Niche User,4,University of San Francisco is a great college to go to. I really love the professor to student ratio in the classes. I also really love how many of the professors really care about your education and success.
Sophomore,4,"My favorite thing about USF is the class and overall population size. With less people, there's less pressure when it comes to registering for the classes you need, and there is a greater focus and attention towards each individual in the classroom. It's easy to meet and connect with people in your major and those who fall within your interests outside of academics. The only downsides I've experienced thus far are the high costs (due to USF being a private school and the fact that it is located in the city) and the cafeteria food, although campus food is generally not that great anywhere. All in all, I feel as though I'm getting the education I need, with tons of support and resources if I so need them."
Sophomore,4,Great school and well placed. Could improve on food but wonderful out reach and great teaching and growing skills.
Graduate Student,4,"A private school situated on one of San Francisco's hill. The facilities are clean and technologically up to date. There are a mix of professors who are great at teaching. The tuition is high because it is a private school, but worth it. Food on campus is great and their gym is wonderful. My only negative complaint about the gym is the lack of air circulation."
Sophomore,2,"If you are indigenous or far left politically I'd stay away. For all the diversity they tout it's exceptionally white and full of performative liberalism. It highlights a lot of the problems with the upper class of SF, and the administration is inefficient and dismissive. I am transferring. The best part was the area and easy access to some central muni lines. Don't eat the chicken."
Junior,2,"Everything was great - an anazing, caring teacher, classmates in a small cohort becoming a family and learning so much. Thenthe class quality went downhill after that 1 class, things got VERY redundant with the exact same information in most classes. If you fall behind on payments, they don't care abkut you anymore and don't check in like they used to. Theu forgrt about you and the same person will e ail you every day asking for money. They tricked me and acted like they cared. So expensive for repetitive common sense information."
Junior,2,"Overall, this university is extremely expensive considering it's lack of resources and dedication to students. It's a very nice and warm campus but raises tuition annually. The architecture program at this school is very poor and doesn't provide the right resources, professors, and curriculum to prepare students for the field. I wish it provided these things in order to compete with other Architecture programs in California."
Freshman,2,This school has decent academics. The housing situation is awful and if you live in Gillson it has terrible living conditions. The student life was terrible as there were very little events and there was nothing to do. The party scene is absolutely horrible and there is no such thing as a party scene at this school. This school has no athletics and even though we made the CBI playoffs for basketball no students showed up to the games. This school is for someone who wants to stay in the dorms on the weekends and not go out. The meal plan is absolutely awful as many run out of the meal plan money quick and are left with nothing to eat for two months. On top of the meal plan the food here is also awful and is not worth the price. The students here are ok however everyone understands that there is nothing to do if you are underage or if you dont have a fake id. The only way to even make this school bearable is to join a frat. I do not recommend coming here.
Alum,2,"During my short lived year at USF I faced discrimination by the housing, academic, and student life departments due to a medical disability. I was asked to take an LOA despite the fact I was current in all of my classes. I have epilepsy and they were considered a ""disruption"" to the faculty and my right to learn was violated. The majority of the students are from affluent households and have that general silver spoon mentality. The only thing I appreciated about this school was the quality of academics."
Sophomore,2,"I am hoping to transfer out of University of San Francisco. I have not been getting the college experience I have hoped for. There is a lack of community on campus, making it feel like everyone is only here to take their classes and get their degree. No sense of ""college"" whatsoever."
Freshman,2,I feel really secluded here apart from the niche I've found for myself. People here are rude but my education keeps me here.
College Senior,2,"The dorms are small and overcrowded. Some dorms are close to classrooms while others are a 10 minute bus ride away. Overall, I expected better dorms at a private university."
College Senior,2,Greek life is not prominent
College Senior,2,Detrimental to health and success at USF. It's a city campus with a surprising influx of students inclined towards drug and alcohol use. I would not recommend family or friends to USF.
College Senior,2,"USF has a promising school mission but lacks in campus culture and affordability. If you're not cliquey, it's easy to fall through the gaps in the community. Found myself conforming versus ""finding myself."""
College Senior,2,Go to another school for Greek Life. 3rd-rate here.
College Senior,2,"Very liberal, cliquey commuter school."
College Freshman,2,It's pretty much a unicorn
College Freshman,2,Greek life is alright but it's not nearly as involved or serious as greek life elsewhere
College Sophomore,2,Housing is only guaranteed for Freshmen.  I wish USF will build housing enough for all its students.
College Sophomore,2,There are no houses and a very small percentage of students participate.
College Junior,2,Greek life is extremely small at USF. We do not have the space for more fraternities or sororities. There is also no housing.
College Freshman,2,"If you want a school with a lot of activities to do on campus, don't come here. Most people are independent/hipsters that go out to the city to find fun. This leads to no sense of community on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"This year I have fully made the conclusion that my school simply doesn't care in the slightest way unless there is some sort of monetary or PR gain involved. I have been neglected by the administration and my department several times, and couldn't even in touch with my program director because not only was the program director listed online, on paper, and in person not actually the program director, but the ""real"" program director had no real established methods of communication. Classes in my major are poorly structured (professor was hired last second to teach my class and has never taught university before...ill give you a hint about how its going........terrible.) Aside from the administration's hypocrisy regarding their values and social justice and their general apathy toward the student body, this city is a beautiful place and I've met a lot of great people. So, the words I would give to anyone considering going here would that its an awesome city and you will never have more growth and fun in your life, but the fabric of the school which you attend is simply not their. You may not notice it on the tour, you may not notice it within the first month of classes, but soon enough you'll notice the school has no spirit, no life, and really, no care for its students. the education is decent though, and if you can swallow that and still want to live in an awesome city and have some life changing experiences, go here."
College Sophomore,2,Finding off campus housing is a huge struggle. The school doesn't really help and living in the city is expensive.
College Sophomore,2,"The school lacks diversity in food. It's the same stations breakfast, lunch, and dinner."
College Junior,2,Overpriced and unhealthy; same old food with no variety
College Sophomore,2,"Health Promotion sucks! Parking is hard, but its SF"
College Freshman,2,"Because there is little on campus housing for anyone other than freshmen, the off campus housing situation is very competitive. Also, just by virtue of being in the city, housing costs are very high."
College Junior,2,its very hard to find a place off campus. usf does not help
College Freshman,2,greek life is not significant on campus
College Sophomore,2,"While I am still a freshman, I understand living off campus to be quite an ordeal. Finding an apartment in San Francisco is tough!"
College Freshman,2,70/30 girls to guy ratio. Off campus is best to meet people
College Freshman,2,It doesn't matter if you're involved in Greek life or not.
College Freshman,2,"It comes with the city, housing is outrageous, and the campus generally doesn't allow you to live on campus past freshman year due to limited space."
College Senior,2,Getting through to someone at One-Stop is a total nightmare with hours of wait time at certain times of year. Once you get through to someone they are very helpful.
College Junior,2,"My experience the first semester has not been great. I didn't have an advisor to guide me to scholarships or loans. the people at the financial aid office were really mean and seemed like they didn't have time to deal with financial issues, probably because since it's a private school you should have money to attend it."
College Sophomore,2,"From a girl's perspective, dating can be pretty difficult at this school. The majority of the student population is female and at least half of the male students are gay. The rest are either taken, immature or not so appealing to the eye. Of course, there are a good looking few (emphasis on few), but in general you won't find many girls swooning. For guys, this school is probably heaven. Lots of pretty girls ranging from the ultra-hipster types to the sorority girl to the athletes and any other type of girl you can think of. And if a guy isn't into girls he has a lot of male options to choose from as well. Basically it's a terrible situation if you're a girl and a fantasy come true for guys."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no way students can have a party on-campus. The dorms are way too small and the RAs will stop it before it's even begun. That being said the only way to party is to find one happening off-campus. So unless you know people, odds are you won't be partying at all."
College Sophomore,2,"The location of the school can be amazing at times, but limited on campus housing forces many unwilling students to live off campus. San Francisco prices are sky high and students struggle to live relatively close to campus while not having an out of this world rent."
College Senior,2,"USF is a very expensive school to attend, and the financial aid is not great. I need loans every semester to cover the cost of tuition."
College Freshman,2,"USF has some strict policies, especially when it comes to drugs and alcohol. Every weekend public safety sweeps the floors of the dorms looking for anyone up to something not permitted. Overall, students are held to a pretty high standard but...its college."
College Junior,2,"USF accepted too many incoming freshmen this year and it flooded the on-campus housing market so much so that at least five of my friends were still homeless by the start of the semester. Wonderful people will try to work with you for off-campus housing in SHaRE, but they only suggest overpriced things. ($1200 for a shared room? Nooo way!) They do have temporary emergency housing available, but it's pretty much a fable that no one mentions. You'll have to ask about it and seem incredibly desperate. 

Craigslist or word-of-mouth are really the only ways to find housing in SF. It WILL take a while to find a place, especially if you're not looking during the traditional times (like at the end of Spring sem.) with friends. Start figuring out your list of favors to call-in when you inevitably couch surf."
College Junior,2,"Transfer students beware!! USF is a great school, but with their greatness comes a degree of stinginess unlike any other. Every year I have extremely unpleasant experiences with the Financial Aid Office and it takes months to even get a small portion of what I need. Most of the scholarships aren't for transfer students (I would save $40k if I could get the freshman scholarships I would've qualified for), so be prepared. Consider living off-campus, working 25 hours a week, and taking the scholarships they give you to pay tuition only."
College Junior,2,It is extremely difficult to find housing with possible rent.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I started out with great financial aid my first two years and received virtually no aid my third year. The school pretends to be helpful towards low-income students, but I have received little help to my financial aid dilemmas. With tuition rising every year, make no mistake this school is a business."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Rising rents in San Francisco make finding off-campus housing difficult and expensive, with on-campus housing being just as bad due to the limited nature of dorms and housing options. Students who live closer to campus normally have more money to allow for the luxury of convenience to school."
College Senior,2,"Maybe I'm biased, I just feel like the system of financial aid overall, not just USF, it's confusing. USF is EXTREMELY expensive and financial aid is important to a lot of students, but it seems like the One Stop office is less than accommodating. They try to be helpful, and I've never had rude service, it's simply that the university itself doesn't give enough money out. Sometimes, the amount they say they're giving you after filing out the FAFSA is a lot, but compared to the price of the university tuition, it truly isn't enough. I'd really appreciate it if they would just stop raising the tuition fee every year. Maybe if they spent money in the right places, we wouldn't have to be paying so much."
College Sophomore,2,"It's San Francisco. It's expensive, crowded and crazy. Living off-campus can be extremely difficult. Not necessarily because there is no where to live, but because the rent here is TERRIBLE. On average, a studio will cost $1500/$2000 per month so just imagine the rent for a 1-2 bedroom. This is why students rent an apartment together so the rent can be split between 3-4 people, but still expect to pay at least $1,000/month. That being said, living off campus is nicer just because there is more freedom and you're not forced to pay for the school's meal plan. The area around USF (richmond/sunset) is relatively cheaper than other parts of the city, but don't bother bringing a car even if you rent an apartment. No matter where you live, public transportation is the way to go. Off-campus housing will be a nightmare for everyone because the school is awful with providing on-campus housing past Freshman year."
College Junior,2,"The social scene isn't too great, it feels a lot like a commuter school- kids come for class and leave after they don't stay on campus to get to know other students. The student environment isn't as friendly as it is on other campuses. 

The library is kind of small and doesn't entice me to study there. There aren't a lot of places on campus that are comfortable or available enough to sit and study. 

The gym is alright. We have an olympic sized pool but the gym itself isn't big. 

There are a lot of campus events but not a lot of students attend them and they aren't well advertised. Mostly freshmen attend campus events."
College Junior,2,Student involvement is relatively poor for athletics. I believe it is due to the fact that there is no football team and therefore not much school spirit for the sports at school.
College Junior,2,I walk or take the bus to school. There is almost no parking for students with cars and they have to leave class to move the car every 2 hours.
College Freshman,2,"Drugs and alcohol was one of my main worries before leaving for school.  I wanted no part in it and was worried about peer pressure and its constant presence.  However, I was able to find a group of friends who shared my same values and this helped me stay on the right track."
College Freshman,2,"Dorm life can break or make your college experience.  It is important to remember that you shouldn't be confined to your dorm room.  There are many other places on campus to study, relax, and meet other people.  My advice is to not sit in your dorm room all day, but instead, to explore the campus you have access to."
College Sophomore,2,"It's San Francisco, so the parking sucks altogether!"
College Junior,2,There is not much going on at all in the way of greek life. The frats are mostly academic.
College Freshman,2,The meal plan is very expensive and the food isn't that good. It's usually all the same stuff so there isn't much variety. I think the worst though is that it isn't very healthy. You can see that the vegetables have been dowsed in oil. There is a salad bar but we all know salad is boring and no one wants to eat that everyday. Plus they jack up the prices on everything because they know that campus is the only place that you can use flexi.
College Freshman,2,"I don't have a car, but parking in the city is difficult. Also, there are some good places available but you have to move your car every two hours. If you aren't living at least a mile away from campus, you can't bring a car anyways. And if you are living far from campus, you can get a parking permit in which it would then be easy to get parking. But USF provides Muni Passes which are great for getting to and from campus so don't worry about bringing a car!"
College Sophomore,2,"It's San Francisco, the housing market is ridiculously competitive and expensive. However living off campus is still better than living on campus. You have more freedom and get more for your money's worth."
College Sophomore,2,The facilities are old and not worth the amount of money you are spending. Phelan is the only good dorm but very hard to get as a freshman.
College Sophomore,2,"Since the school is in the city the level of security/strictness is pretty high. That being said, you can move off campus after your first year and not have to deal it with. Public safety is way stricter than actual cops on the city."
College Junior,2,"The most important factor in living anywhere is the cost, which is outrageously high in this city, especially near a school campus. Apartment garage spots are worth gold if you are lucky enough to have one. Availability is okay, but it is very good to know a landlord, or else the process of finding a place can be stressful. San Francisco buildings are of very low quality. Electrical work in buildings is horrible, especially for the price we pay."
College Freshman,2,My program has no attention to it. They say it is good but in reality it sucks. There are some professors that are amazing however.
College Freshman,2,The school says it's diverse but all there is is an abundance of Chinese students with rich parents.
Senior,1,"eh, I hate all institutions. I just really hate realizing how much money drives everything and everyone, and USF is no exception.  Don (the mascot) is a colonizer. The administration of the institution has handled it's many years of deficit very poorly, and have relied on the students (by increasing cost and housing) to fix their financial inadequacies. COVID has only made the school more financially unstable, and they're still charging too much for this Terrible online education."
Alum,1,The university of san francisco does not offer online courses for its students nor do they allow students to take summer courses at local hometown community colleges.
Sophomore,1,"They transitioned us into online classes which were much more difficult to learn in. Not to mention they still charged us normal tuition for bullshit online courses, whereas other large privates have refunded portions of tuition for the online classes, since they didn't have a robust system for online classes that rivaled their in person classes. USF, however, continued to keep the money and still charged us for on campus health insurance, gym charges, and the transportation fee, when WE WERENT EVEN ON CAMPUS. 

What a great school smh."
Senior,1,"My senior year at USF begins next week and I honestly am considering dropping out because of how much I am dreading another year here and how needlessly distressing it is to deal with this institution. Tuition has risen every year while my experience has been consistently infuriating, stressful, exhausting, and disappointing. The financial aid office is unhelpful and unresponsive. The Center for Academic and Student Achievement is out of touch, often uninformed on relevant academic matters, and useless. 
I've had 2 good professors during my time at USF. Several professors have been just fine, the rest have been horrible. They make it as hard as possible even to get the classes needed to graduate-- I'm not asking for anything beyond that at this point, and even that takes a Herculean effort on the part of the student while the institution does nothing to help. The idea that they apply Jesuit values is laughable."
Junior,1,"USF has raised tuition 3 times in the three years I've been attending. Campus is boring and you rarely see students smiling. No one is friendly and it's very difficult to make friends. The food served on campus is 3-4x the prices at the grocery store, all USF wants to do is take your $$$"
Sophomore,1,"So far my time at USF has been terrible, filled with bad professors, terrible campus life and horribles dorms and food. I believe that for the amount of money I am paying and for USF being a private university the student life should be way better. I will be trasnfering out next semester."
College Sophomore,1,"In Fromm, the all girls campus housing, the RA's were insanely strict making it very hard to have a social life or feel like the dorms were a safe space. Furthermore, my experiences with the student conduct office was extremely poor and unjustified."
College Sophomore,1,"So your first year on campus is great.The living facilities at the university are pretty good. However, housing is nearly impossible to get after your first year and the housing staff is unreasonable and don't help you find a place off campus. Very frustrating!"
College Junior,1,Hardly anyone goes to the school games. I think not having a football team plays a role in low attendance and student involvement.
College Junior,1,Students do not go to games because there is no school spirit.
College Sophomore,1,Finding places in SF sucks. Too much $$ for no room
College Freshman,1,Booooooooooo. You'll find things to do but any parties get shut down pretty soon because everything's so close together.
College Freshman,1,Pretty much non-existent or worse than your high school parties.
College Sophomore,1,The only good major worth studying is Nursing.
College Sophomore,1,The school is not good in academics as much as it says it is.
College Sophomore,1,"It's san francisco, overprices and poor quality."
College Sophomore,1,Lack of options. Rude staff. Poor quality.
College Sophomore,1,There is lack of parties at this school who brags of having a nightlife.
College Freshman,1,"We have only a few frats and sororities, they are mainly academic and barely anyone participates. Its easy to forget that they exist."
College Senior,1,"There really is very little greek life at USF. There is no greek housing because, there's barely enough housing for the student population let alone the tiny population of sororities. I believe there is two fraternities. If greek life is something you're looking for in college, you won't find it at USF."
College Junior,1,The cafeteria on campus sucks! It's SUPER expensive and the food is terrible. The cafeteria is pretty but small and dirty because college kids are gross and no one is there to clean tables. Students that live on campus and have meal plans always have extra money because they don't eat in the cafeteria. USF uses Bon Appetite as their food service and they're the absolutely worst.
College Junior,1,My program has only 3 men in it.
College Junior,1,"If you live in the city, your best bet is to take public transportation. Commuting will add a lot of stress because you have to get to school early and hope to find a spot."
College Freshman,1,"They say ""Academic Standards Steeper than this hill"" However the academics suck. The classes are too easy and I do not feel challenged."
College Freshman,1,The school once had a good basketball team but now the athletics sucks. The basketball team is infamous on campus for sleeping with every girl that will let them and the basketball coach scouts girls out for the boys team to hook them up which is completely inappropriate. However everyone overlooks it because they're the only thing that is somewhat good about the school. USF fails to address this issue and leaves the students feeling like all they care about is their money.
College Freshman,1,"Campus housing is the worst. There is never any toilet paper in the stalls, the restrooms are not kept clean daily, there is no soap, and the staff is very rude for the price you pay."
College Student,1,"We are in SF, so obviously it's super expensive for parking"
College Freshman,1,I don't get aid. Please give me money. Please
College Freshman,1,"This school is beyond expensive, and even though I have very legitimate reasons for needing financial aid, I still did not receive any financial help. It was a terrible process and a long one at that, too, but I still was refused any aid."
College Freshman,1,There really is no parking at USF because no one here drives. 
College Sophomore,1,"Coming from one of the best athletic high schools in the nation I've had a tough time transitioning to the ""athletic"" life here at USF. USF doesn't have a football team so we don't get the traditions that come with that. The soccer team is decent for and the basketball team is okay. Athletes do get priority when it comes to registration and student housing but fan support is low. Some athletics are packed but on average only freshmen really go, School spirit is low."
College Senior,1,"Parking is nearly impossible in the city, but if you're commuting I highly recommend applying for a parking permit, which allows for easy parking if you arrive to school early enough in the morning (before 9am). Otherwise, parking is a nightmare, you're lucky if you find 2 hour parking near school. I don't recommend bringing a car."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking isn't all that great because there are only two parking lots that you have to have a permit to park in. Street parking is very limited. I wouldn't recommend bringing a car in general, since public transportation is way easier and more accessible."
College Senior,1,"There are a few sororities, and only one ""big"" one, Delta Zeta. It is mainly for girls that like to dress up a lot and do occasional community service...but no one really likes DZ girls, except DZ girls. 
There are very few frats at this school, and no one really even knows about them. Overall, no one cares about Greek life here."
College Junior,1,"I'm pretty sure San Francisco has the most expensive housing in the nation. However, not only are apartments expensive, they're very difficult to find - (a decent one at least). Start your research and begin applying for apartments at least three months before you think you need it. Be aggressive and have all your paperwork ready! The market is super competitive!"
College Junior,1,"The city of San Francisco has a very pervasive drug scene and students come here knowing that. While I personally know some students who stray away from drugs, I think the majority of students on campus, or at least 60-70% have sampled with marijuana. Drinking is more common on campus."
College Senior,1,Pretty dreadful. Most spots are 2 hours only and are always hard to find. You're not only fighting fellow students for the spots but also residents of the neighborhood.
College Sophomore,1,Difficult to find parking space. Expensive. Not recommended.
College Senior,1,"Our basketball team USED to be good. But we aren't at all a sports focused school, not as much as I would like it to be. In fact we don't even have a football team. But it's ok, SF official teams make up for it."
College Junior,1,Extremely limited with 2 hour time limit most days until 8:00 pm..
College Senior,1,Trying to get food at USF is like being hungry and stuck at an airport; everything is expensive and terrible quality. Chocolate bars are $3.50. An 8oz. smoothie is $6.00. Just pack a lunch and save your money for something decent.
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek life. Yes, there are Greek organizations but do not be fooled. They are really more like clubs, a few of them are tied to academics such as the business clubs. The Greeks don't throw parties or have exciting rushes or anything, they're pretty mellow. It really does not make a difference if you are in one or not, nobody cares."
College Freshman,1,"Overpriced, doesn't taste good, few locations, closes early, same thing everyday."
College Freshman,1,"The greek life is pretty bad here, there are no greek houses and for the most part seems like any other club. Which takes the fun out of it."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking pretty much sucks for everyone, the professors, the staff & the students. You'll need a permit (which there is a generally small amount of) to park in the designated lots. If you're lucky enough to find street parking, you'll have to move your car every two hours. There are officers patrolling the streets ready to give tickets. So really your best bet is probably public transportation."
College Freshman,1,"It's San Francisco, parking sucks all over the city. It's no different here. I think you can get a permit to park on campus though."
College Junior,1,If you have a car you may need to come to campus as much as an hour earlier. But when you do find parking it is almost always great parking.
College Senior,1,"There is never any parking around the campus. There are spots blocks away, with a time limit, so you can park but get a ticket."
College Senior,1,"The Worst – USF is the most awful place I can imagine going. The school is terrible, the administrators are rude, the faculty is always out of reach, the cost of tuition is grueling, and the student body is lacking diversity. The school costs too much for what it offers. The education is not on any level that could garner even a sense of prestige. USF, overall, is a waste of good real estate in San Francisco. My expirence at USF has made me into a very bitter person."
College Junior,1,"Parking at University of San Francisco can be pretty near impossible.  Unless you get one of the fifty or so street spots surrounding the campus, you are looking at 2 hour parking across the street in different neighborhoods or a pricey parking permit that really is not worth it.  I recommend taking BART or MUNI to school.  It can take a while at times, but use the time to catch up on reading or homework."
College Freshman,1,"Things to Consider – If you like the food in the cafeteria and are friends with your neighbors, living on campus is both fun and extremely convenient. However, the student body at USF is pretty diverse, and most upperclassmen would rather live on their own than in the residence halls. Food on campus is extremely expensive and on-campus freshmen are required to have the meal plan."
College Freshman,1,"Below Average – This school to sum it up is boring. There is no spirit. The social scene is very very limited. If your not into drugs or raves and don't have a fake ID, there is nothing to do. Come to this school if you love drugs and if not don't come. As for parties, there are virtually none. The daily routine is get up go to class eat and sleep. Even on the weekends. Even if you some how manage to text everyone you have once met at school and find a party to go to, you have to first figure out where it is and it is more then likely that it is pretty far away from school and have to take 1-3 buses to get there. Talk about when you arrive you're already sober from the amount of time spent getting there. You would think San Francisco is the place to be and there are so many different things going on. The truth is if you don't like to spend a bunch of time walking in the cold weather and taking buses with a bunch of people and putting yourself in sometimes dangerous situations and if you are use to driving everywhere yourself, chances are most likely that you will not like this school."
College Senior,1,"USF is super progressive and socially conscious. And by that I mean, it's a bunch of rich white kids who are super progressive and socially conscious. The faculty is also mostly comprised of white men."
College Senior,1,"Parking at USF is a hassle and is not worth it!  Most of nearby parking has a 2 hour limit (that is enforced) so you are either late to class or have to leave early!  Parking permits are very expensive, and do not even guarantee you a spot!!"
College Freshman,1,"Great but Costly – The school just raised tuition, which they only acknowledged by sending out a casual e-mail that was conveniently sent right after all the deadlines for other colleges had passed, making it too late to transfer for next year to a school with cheaper tuition. I love the school, but they aren't doing anything to help students support their education."
College Freshman,1,Early Wake Ups – if you park overnight you have to wake up wednesday morning at 6am to move your car for street cleaning. its not worth it to have a car since you have the bus passes
College Junior,1,"Greek life at USF is a joke. The few ""fraternities"" and ""sororities"" are really just clubs or centered on academics. Most of the fun things associated with Greek life do not exist."
College Junior,1,"Parking? There is none. If you get a spot, then it's most likely only valid for two hours before you have to move it. There are about 100 parking permits that get drawn out in a lottery. Come early if you expect to find a spot."
College Junior,1,"Get Your Tinfoil Hat – Finding a fraternity or sorority at USF is like searching for Bigfoot: plenty of people claim to have seen them, but no one's ever managed to prove that they actually exist."
College Sophomore,1,"Very limited on-campus spaces available and only for off-campus students. In an urban city, there is never enough parking for everyone and the 2 hour limit is difficult."

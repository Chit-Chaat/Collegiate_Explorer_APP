Alum,5,Hands-on learning with caring faculty. Classes are hands-on from day 1. Super affordable and right on the beautiful coast of Maine.
Sophomore,5,Great atmosphere with wonderful professors. Specifically in the Arts! The learning is personal you get to form real relationships with everyone due to the smaller class sizes which I think is absolutely amazing and there's more learning taking place.
College Sophomore,5,"What parties? I don't even like parties? I love not dealing with any parties! Even getting caught beyond the dorm room alcohol limit (two six packs of beer, two bottles of wine, or one bottle of wine and one six pack- no hard liquor) is a fairly serious offence. Students abide by the rule and support it 90% of the time and those who don't are those who got caught over the limit, and no one cares what they think about a rule they just got caught breaking."
College Sophomore,5,There is almost no danger on campus and the town is safe to walk in at 2:00 in the morning (then again there's nothing to do and nowhere to go at 2:00 in the morning in Machias) so long as one stays clear of Skywalker's and the Thirsty Moose (both bars open only in the late night and early morning) which are right next to each other and easily avoided. Sexual assault is so actively prevented that students passively complain about the campaign going just a little too far because there is not a sexual assault problem on campus.
College Junior,5,Computers are always available at the University of Maine at Machias.  Computers are always open as well as computer labs if they are not being used for a class.  IT support is really great.  They will help you get any help that you need. The WiFi usually works great.  There are times when it can be spotty.
College Sophomore,5,Really Safe – I feel pretty comfortable with the campus security because they are really easy to talk to and they want the same thing as you: not causing trouble.
Recent Alumnus,5,Always Present – Machias is home to the county sherriff's office so even during the hours when security isn't present the police are either or campus or just minutes away. Security will always answer your calls and offer rides around campus if requested. During the overnight hours a security officer who lives near by is on call and can be back on campus immediately.
Alum,4,Many online classes have an on-campus version so you can customize your learning experience based on your schedule.
Niche User,4,"I went to the University of Maine at Machias about 16 years ago. It was an amazing experience at the University because of the diversity of students, the campus beauty and the overall Downeast Maine atmosphere. Here I sit today going back to the University of Maine at Machias in my early 40's. I decided to change my major and return to school. I am an online student now, however I stay connected in various ways through the school. What I find the most appealing that even after all these years, the same professors are still working at the college. The school has a home like feel because of the atmosphere the campus offers. I highly recommend the University of Maine at Machias if you enjoy the outdoors, especially oceans. There may not be a lot of things to do in town because it is very rural. However, there is an abundance of outdoor activities that will be a once in a lifetime experience. Whether it exploring Jaspers Beach or The Bluff."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life affects the social atmosphere of campus by just having someone to talk to and the competition between each Greek is entertaining. Greek students are viewed by non-Greeks by telling rumors about what they do when people pledge but they are all just rumors. Other then that they view them as fun, educators, and friendly. There are currently 8 greek organizations. There is Epsilon Sigma Alpha, Kappa Delta Phi, Kappa Mu Alpha, Omicron Delta Phi, Phi Tau Phi, Psi Delta, Sigma Chi Lambda, and Kappa Alpha Kappa."
College Freshman,4,Students always go to the tailgates and support our soccer team. Soccer and basketball are the most popular sports here. Everyone dresses in green for support and go out and watch them play. I personally have never attended their games but I would like to attend one sometime. There is a gym near by and they welcome athletes and non athletes to come and use the facility if needed.
College Freshman,4,"My favorite experiences so far would be the classes and activities that they have planned for us. I love my psychology class and I currently got back from a Blind-182 concert, where I had the best time. What makes my school unique is that we are a small campus and could easily help out the community with stuff like volunteering. We also live near the east costal beach. If I could do it all over I would choose this school again because of the small class room and I could easily learn in a small atmosphere. The only thing that I would change differently is the housing. I would rather get an apartment then live on campus."
College Freshman,4,"very small campus and town, but overall love it"
College Freshman,4,School policies shouldn't and don't really affect the students academic or social lives. The campus is pretty lenient with most things unless they ARE illegal.
College Freshman,4,"The dorm rooms themselves are pretty decent. A double in Sennett is spacious and plenty of room for two people, and the singles in Dorward are great! At first they seem kinda small, but once everything you have is actually put into place its absolutely perfect. The heating is nice, on occasion it almost feels like a window could be opened, which is much preferable during the winter season that freezing. Though Dorward is a little farther away from Torrey and the classrooms it's perfect for those who don't get out much and physical activity. The social atmosphere is pretty good, it's best to stay away from the sororities and fraternities though."
College Sophomore,4,"Things that don't really matter like occasional excessive noise (so long as one does not do it constantly or purposely) or letting parents visit dorms are not kicked around with strict rules, but things like illegal alcohol and drug use are not found tolerable and the limit on alcohol on campus is both reasonable and beneficial."
College Sophomore,4,You have either the galley or the cafeteria and both have a pretty wide arrangement of food
College Sophomore,4,I do plan to have internships it is a key role in earning a degree in my area of study
College Sophomore,4,Plenty of off campus housing around for any students
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy that our Greek Life isn't incorporated like it is you see at other schools. Greek Life run events every now and then and it really does not matter if you're a Greek or not. Most of the school population is either Non-Greek or purely Social-Greek (non-affiliated, but attend events for a particular Sorority/Fraternity)."
College Freshman,4,"I'm fortunate enough to have been given the opportunity to pursue a double major with two majors that are cohesive with each other. My first major is English with a concentration in Literary Studies, and my second major is Secondary English with a concentration in English. I know students who are pursuing a double major that are having difficulty figuring out how to get all the credits they need, without having to go over the graduation requirement (120) too much - very few students at Machias have the funds to pursue any additional credits beyond the graduation requirement. 

I love both of my programs, but other than the incorporation of the book arts, there's probably not much to them that makes them unique in comparison to other schools."
College Freshman,4,"Machias has a really diverse choice of majors. The English program itself has three branches. It's not difficult to get into your program. You get to know your fellow students and your professors really well. Machias is a liberal arts college, so there's nothing ""extraordinary"" about getting into any of the programs, as far as I know (Pre-Med might have something, but that's not a hugely popular major). ""Getting into your program"" consists of getting into the school."
College Freshman,4,"Machias is probably one of the most diverse schools you can get, considering the very small population. Everyone has something that makes them unique and nobody fits the ""majority"" mold that you see in a lot of other campuses - there are very few white, testosterone-filled, heterosexual,, rich, conservative, cis-males and very few white, ""cheerleader""-esque, heterosexual, rich, conservative, cis-females. Most of the soccer team are Hispanic, most of the basketball team is African-American, and there are just as many homosexual/bisexual students as there are homosexual. We're a small school, but the diversity is abundant. There are just as many liberals as there are conservatives, but your political and/or economic background do NOT make you who you are."
College Senior,4,i personally feel comfortable and safe at my school
College Senior,4,so far good! it meets my need and help me with my education
College Senior,4,the athletics at my school is awesome. i personally love it and i am also involved in a varsity team.
College Student,4,"For all people going to school here you can get a parking permit for free. If you are the kind of person that can't do the same thing for weeks on end it would probably be a good idea to have a car on campus, but if you don't you can usually find a ride pretty easily."
College Sophomore,2,"Not worth the trouble. The price of room and board and having someone else do the cooking for you beats out any apartment they've got in Machias, that is, when one is available."
College Sophomore,2,"Maybe I should say certain aspects are bad actually. Basketball and soccer receive a lot of attention, but there are no spring sports at all and teams other than soccer and basketball are not taken seriously. The XC team does not even have a coach currently."
College Freshman,2,There's only a couple different kinds of restaurants
College Sophomore,2,"The Greek life is very interesting. They are well known around campus for selling baked goods and throwing parties, but everyone I know who decided to join their brothers or sisters are very glad they did. It brings people together to create a new sense of friendship and family on what can be a scary new feeling of being at college. However, Machias isn't all about the Greek life. We have quite a few sororities and fraternities, but whether you're in or not it's not that big of a deal here. Everyone socializes and is friendly to Greek and non-Greek."
College Junior,2,"I did not enjoy a lot of my experience at UMM. I was an out of state student, and I attended for two years. If it wasn't for my friends, I would not have survived at the school. UMM is located in a rather poor area, with absolutely nothing to do. Literally, there is nothing to do. 

The people may seem friendly at first, however give it some time and you will see just how clicky everyone can be. Although, don't let this intimidate you, I'm sure it is like this at any small school. 

The academics are easy. I found nothing challenging. Some of the professors are very intriguing though...a lot of the time I found class to be fun and worth attending. I just wish the professors were stricter, and actually put emphasis on helping the students succeed. 

As for the dining, the food is like any other cafeteria food. It's not the best. I'd stock up on groceries if I were you."
College Freshman,2,"The computers are okay, but they seem to break down quite often"
College Senior,2,"No Greek housing available.  Greek life is there for parties and some other events, but it doesn't dominate.  It's not a big deal if you are in a frat or sorority, and it is not a big deal if you never set foot in one. It's nice because you can go to frat parties, which can be fun, but it's not a status thing."
College Senior,2,"Machias is pretty secluded.  Having your own car is key.  The University is within walking distance to ""down town"".  But if you'd like to go home on breaks, you can use your own car or use West's transportation, which is a small bus and can bring you to the airport.  The nearest airport is in Bangor, about 2 1/2 hrs away from Machias.  There really are some awesome scenic hikes around so having your own car will enable you to explore the area more freely."
College Freshman,2,"I don't participate in most activities here. Other than class times, I am in my dorm because I don't like most of the people here, I have nothing in common with them."
College Sophomore,2,"The guys and girls are mostly nice. Their is a lot of drama at this school because it is so small, but mostly between girl and girl. Most of the time you can get along with everyone. The school is split up into groups though. If you are not in t a clique or group it is sometimes hard to hit in."
College Sophomore,2,"There are two dorm buildings, one of which is dry. It's not immediately apparent, but if you listen to the right people or just follow the loud music and noise on a weekend, you'll find out about the on-campus drinking scene. Dances and certain events tend to end up involving alcohol. The school supposedly put a smoking ban into effect last year, but it doesn't seem to have made any difference."
College Sophomore,2,"It's a small school, so the Greek housing is limited to a few suites. There are about six groups on campus, all with under fifteen members. They are known for their bottle collections and baked goods once a week. Hazing is prohibited, but it's pretty sad to see some of the pledges in the ""social"" sorority, and even the chem-free one is known for partying, just not during pledging or in their colors."
College Freshman,1,"In my opinion, 99% of the students at this school participate in drinking/drugs on a regular basis. It makes it very difficult for those that want to stay on the straight and narrow. I feel very out of place in this school."
Recent Alumnus,1,Upperclassmen: Move Off – First and second year students who live further than 50 miles away are required to live on campus but after that I would suggest moving off campus. If you can try to live in Dorward Hall. This is the newer building and has the suites and singles option. With that said the heating system in both buildings is terrible. One room could be a blazing sauna while the one across the hall is an ice box!

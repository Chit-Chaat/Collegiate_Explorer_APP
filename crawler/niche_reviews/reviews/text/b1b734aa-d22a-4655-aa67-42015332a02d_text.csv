Sophomore,5,There were a lot of ups and downs during my first year of warner but one of the things that made it easier was my volleyball team. I really enjoyed having a since of family. They also have a really good RA and RD team that makes sure you aware that you’re never alone. It’s something that I came to appreciate when I was having a hard time. The school overall is very family oriented.
Junior,5,I love the professors and the people at Warner. Everyone is so friendly and it's just a good environment to be in.
Sophomore,5,Warner University has been a great college and campus for me. All the teacher and staff members are all fantastic and the campus is very simple and small. Warner University has a great sports program but I believe could improve much more. Something I wish Warner University had was more activities and entertainment for students.
Niche User,5,"I haven't started yet, but from the tour of the college the atmosphere is great, the people are extremely nice, as well as the administration."
Freshman,5,I like the fact that warner has a lot of activities to keep everyone close an soon enough you will know almost everyone
Freshman,5,It's a nice christian based college with awesome teachers and help you achieve your goals in life the staff at warner help me alot be accepted into the school they showed me how to get my dorm early and guide me in all the things I need to do before going on the campus it was a good experience for me.
Freshman,5,Love the faculty and staff. The classes are great and it’s a great experience all around. Warner is a Christian college and I love that the bring students together with the lord.
Niche User,5,I took a visit and I felt like I'm at home and the athletics even though there football team is naia they are still pretty good
Niche User,5,I live by Warner and when I go to visit its full of happy people and I love how it makes me feel like I'm home.
Junior,5,Warner University is an excellent school to attend. The staff is very helpful and the teachers do all they can to help students succeed. The online program is great because it offers students the flexibility to get a quality education while still working full time.
College Junior,5,Education is at it's best
College Sophomore,5,Being at such a small school had helped me with more one on one time with professors. The courses that are offered have a variety of how difficult they are but that's great in order to keep you pushing to achieve a higher levers of education.
College Sophomore,5,I personally feel that our campus's health and safety is taking very serious and we are kept safe at all times and informed in any situation that may take place or is happening on campus.
College Sophomore,5,Our Admissions Team does an amazing job with the admitting process to the university. The team also hires on students that helps out in a major way in seeing students have the best process and transition to the college life.
College Sophomore,5,"I love my Warner University Family and the University as a Learning Institution as a whole. There is such a sweet spirit amongest the people, as our focused of making Jesus Christ known is lived out daily. I encourage everyone to apply to this school and also, check our royal days and/or royal round ups."
College Freshman,5,I play softball at Warner. I love the sports program
College Sophomore,5,This is Florida always hot even if there is no sun. Even on the cold days its beautiful.
College Sophomore,5,I have not had a problem yet. I can print all I want and I have not had a problem with the speed.
College Sophomore,5,I would still choose my school because of the faculty and administration. I have not been to school in 20 plus years and the staff are very patient with me. 
College Sophomore,5,I have been going to school at Warner University since August 2013. Even though I go online. I have spent a lot of time there due to nervousness about going back. The children there easy to talk to. There are no visible drug or alcohol use at all. 
College Senior,5,I'm rating the Majors at Warner University an A+ because they have just about any major a student would like to be apart of. For example Business Administration has its own school and own deans and advisors who are all hands on with their students. They have people in different offices around the school which they divide the students up and handle every need of each student. Also the professors are hands on even if they are the online professors they answer each student need reagardless. Every since i have attended Warner University i have been well taken care of.
College Senior,5,The Computer Labs at Warner University are not crowded and every student there is respectful of one another.
College Sophomore,5,I am really happy with Warner University. They havent been able to help me with aid as of yet but I think they are going to work something out. As far as cost they are really good for a prvate university. If I could do it over again I would 100%!
College Senior,5,Security drives around campus and close locations where off-campus students live. I never feel unsafe leaving the library or the gym late at night because security is always there.
College Senior,5,"Public transportation is extremely good at Warner. They offer free shuttles to anywhere students need to go; including grocery stores, doctor appointments, and practice for the athletes."
College Freshman,5,I received a good amount of financial aid. At the beginning it was a huge process and it wasn't easy but the staff at Warner were very helpful and they helped me get a good amount of financial aid. My advice is to make an appointment at the financial office on campus and stay on top of things and they will gladly help you with anything you need.
College Freshman,5,"There are three places you can find computers at Warner University. In the library, and in one of two computer labs. There usually isn't a wait time for the computers because they are so available. During finals week, however, you may want to bring your own and find a quiet area in the library."
College Senior,5,"As an elementary education major, I spend a lot of time in the library.  The librarians are wonderful and know most people by name.  The secretary at the front desk of the teacher complex is the same way.  I do not live on campus and do not participate in a lot of on campus activities. However, I hear about a lot of great things about different events from those who do live on campus."
College Junior,5,There is always parking spots on the campus. Plus the parking permits are free.
College Junior,5,Financial aid at Warner is very helpful. I got all of the financial aid I needed plus more. I got money back. Most people who apply for financial aid and/or loans at warner get lots of money back. The staff in the financial aid office will help you get the maximum funds you need so that you do no have a balance on your account.
College Freshman,5,I give the drug scene an A+ because I don't see people using drugs on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"The Athletic Program – The athletic program is very strong at Warner University,our fan base is very strong also. The student body is very supportive of one another."
College Freshman,5,Extremely Good Safety – Waner University is certainly excellent in their drug safety!
College Freshman,5,the school don't play at all and try there best to keep us safe.
College Sophomore,5,Plenty to Go Around – We have a Mac lab on campus for students in specific classes that need them but in the library we have plenty of DELL computers. The computers in the library usually get pretty crowded during Mid-term and Finals week but other than that its not too hard to get on a computer. We also have a computer lab which has around 40 computers which is always open for use.
College Sophomore,5,"The dorms here at Warner are pretty nice compared to some of the dorms at other colleges. I stay in Williams Hall and it is the under classmen girls dorms. I love how our dorms arent co-ed. I also love how we have a little kitchen area in our room. Every week our RAs have what's called Manic Monday where we all hang out together either as a whole dorm or just halls and have fun. Each week there is a different theme for Manic Monday as well. Also every year Williams Hall have a theme for each hall. My Freshman year is was seasons and each hall was decorated based on with season they were and this year, my sophomore year the theme is Doll House. Each hall is a different Sorority."
College Freshman,5,Im Looking Forward to It – well this is my first year and i cant wait to jump into my major education
College Freshman,5,Love Learning – at warner university the teacher to student ratio is 18:1 small class size learning more one on one time
College Junior,5,"Since I began life on campus at Wrner University in the fall of 2010, I have meant a variety of different people from different diverse backgrounds and areas. I have foreign exchange students as friends because we have taken the time out to get to know one another whether its personal or on a academic professional level. I have met people from Japan, the British Virgin Islands, Haiti && etc."
College Freshman,5,I am not sure about the dining - I haven't started my on campus learning yet
Graduate Student,4,My online experience was very good. I like how the professors require student introductions. It makes the class more personal and helps us get to know the student a little bit more. I like how the professor contribute to the class discussion by providing articles and videos and asking for our opinion on the sources that they provide. This allows for good responses that others may elaborate on. I also love when the professors provide feedback on my online assignments and leave comments. This allows me to identify weaknesses in my writing and helps me avoid repeating the same mistake in my writing.
Graduate Student,4,"My experience at Warner was fantastic. Warner University had implemented the marching band program in 2015. This new change helped build on the school spirit and made Warner so much more fun to me. The band members helped me feel more included and gave me a place where I felt I belonged. The Royal Beyond Belief Band made the games exciting and the performances were enjoyable and the sounds were very magical to experience. The one thing I would fix about Warner University is communication specifically in the financial services department. Students need fast communication to make sure that they can apply for school and have the necessary funds to continue their education. When the school does not effectively communicate with the students, it produces financial stress on the students, gives them anxiety, and stalls their ability to keep pursuing their education."
Sophomore,4,Well before COVID I didn’t take any online classes but Warner moved to online in order to protect their students. The transition to online only was a little rocky at first but the professors eventually figured it out and it was an overall good experience.
Freshman,4,Its really good its just you know we got to pay the some things for the year and stuff so we need all the scholarships that we can get.
Junior,4,"The sense of community that they have is absolutely amazing. The fact that they have God in everything that they do. They pray, they have one on one conversations with you it is an amazing experience at this school. The only reason i am leaving is because other opportunities have opened up for me."
Junior,4,"Laidback environment but suits people who are not adventurous but can also fit adventurous people. Can be boring most times but it’s what you make it. Food is great and staff in cafe are amazing. Teachers are willing to help in class as well as out of class, even provides free tutoring if needed anytime."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the professors and facility. I enjoy the small town feel. Everyone welcomes you with open arms and a warm smile. You are accepted immediately there and have a family always there for you. I would change the programs available for more creative students and make creativity more accessible
Senior,4,My experience at Warner University has been very  positive because of my classmates and professors. Each class has given me the opportunity to challenge myself and also learn from others. So far this year I have excelled above my expectations due to the wonderful support system here at Warner. I am excited to graduate by this year fall.
Freshman,4,"Great basketball, tennis, golf, and volleyball programs. Needs better choice of food. Could use another gym. Needs a football stadium. Great teachers willing to help"
Junior,4,"Warner university is a great university filled with loving and caring professors and administrators. One of the things i like the most is how diverse this university has become, there are people of many different cultures and backgrounds here."
College Senior,4,The health and safety at Warner University is great.
College Senior,4,The experience on campus at Warner University is great.
College Senior,4,Living on the Warner University campus is a great experience.
College Senior,4,Greek life at Warner University is great. All students are encouraged to participate.
College Senior,4,The athletics department at Warner University is great.
College Senior,4,Warner University is a great school to attend. I am learning so much from the professors.
College Freshman,4,It's a Christian environment so there is christ like values
College Freshman,4,Well I actually duel enrolled at the college I will be attending here soon. Warner university is a Great college.
College Sophomore,4,There is no other school that has the spirit like Warner does when it comes to athletics.
College Sophomore,4,Warner University.... where could i begin it has shown me that the Lord is still alive in the human hearts today! the student body is welcoming the classes are even better and we can not forget the athletic department outstanding i overall love the school and cant wait to be more apart of it!
College Sophomore,4,Many students go to different sports games and show their spirit and encourage the teams. The gym and workout room are very well put together. They should have different equipment in the workout room but the athletes except it.
College Sophomore,4,what makes me school unique is that we are a small Christian school that focuses on Christ and wants to make him known everywhere. I would choose this school again because it helping me become closer to Christ and it's making me a better person daily.
College Sophomore,4,Our Campus Housing is constantly being updated. We just added the two new Men Dorms the Fall of 2014 and now adding the New Women Dorm the Fall of 2016.
College Sophomore,4,Our athletic programs are improving and to God be the Glory for that!
College Freshman,4,"The courses and professors at this school are good, i like the class sizes because it offers an easier environment to get help in."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience so far has been that the community warner has is great with a lot of great people to connect with, but i do wish there was more of a campus life and more to do around campus."
College Sophomore,4,"The security on campus is okay, they are best known for giving out parking tickets to students and nothing more. But I guess if the time came to it they would be well qualified to handle something."
College Sophomore,4,"My professors are all very caring and smart. Class size is moderate fits about 30 or more students. The professors really make you learn something, I'm doing really well in school."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm a volleyball player at Warner and I can say that we almost usually have a full crowd whenever we have home games. Sports is a big deal at Warner, everyone has school spirit and participates. Our basketball team made it to nationals and made it past the sweet 16, and went to the elite 8 but sadly lost. The volleyball team made it to the conference championship but lost due to a fluke. Our men's volleyball team is currently ranked #2 in the nation which is a big deal."
College Sophomore,4,"I believe that Warner University is a wonderful and special place. I've met some of the best people in my life there, and the atmosphere is very different from any of the other colleges I've visited. Warner has a great and competitive sports program with some of the best coaches I've had. The professors are caring and actually want you to succeed. Warner Univeristy is a wonderful college that has shaped me into the women I'm meant to be some day. Warner keeps me balanced and focused on the important things in life rather than partying, being reckless and having fake meaningless friends. However, the only downfall is that it's just so expensive, I'm not super poor by any means but its just gotten too hard to pay for and I'm not ready to let go of sports and my friends just yet. But if I had the chance to do it all over again I would in a heart beat."
College Freshman,4,I love the enviornment and the professors. Everyone is really easy to get along with and the peers are all so friendly. I believe that I will get a great education here at Warner
College Sophomore,4,So far the school has been really easy to deal with. The staff has been nice and very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"I would not know, I have not started at the school yet. I am only going off of what I have seen or heard from other students at the school. I do look forward to going here. It is the only school I applied for after moving down to Florida from Maine."
College Freshman,4,I love my school! I love how the classes are smaller and I can learn more without being distracted.
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at school was an amazing one. I loved the activities on campus and I was always involved in most of the festivities. One of my favorite activities on campus was dishes around the Caribbean, where different Caribbean students would bring foods from their country for everyone to enjoy. What made my school unique was the amount of diversity amongst students and teachers. I would choose my school again because, throughout the year I have learned and experienced so much and I wouldn't trade that experience for the world."
College Sophomore,4,"Almost every student here is an athlete, the campus is primarily made up of them. This college is proud of it's students, but its made goal is for the sports teams."
College Freshman,4,Evryone is friends with each other it doesnt matter who you are.
College Freshman,4,The professors are great and very helpful with whatever you need. 
College Freshman,4,The professors are very friendly and helpful and interested in how you are doing.
College Freshman,4,There is a little bit of everything and everyone is very accepting.
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of restaurants you can enjoy around campus.
College Freshman,4,The school has a shuttle system. If you call them they will take you where you want to go.
College Freshman,4,I love it so far. the people are great and so are my classes.
College Freshman,4,There is not much crime and everyone usually gets along with eachother.
College Freshman,4,There are not much people who do drugs at the school or they just hide it very well.
College Freshman,4,The school is great. There are nice fields and the gym is really good.
College Freshman,4,The majors are great and they have great professors who are with you along the way.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are great. They are pretty good size and they are very nice. It's great being around the other people that attend your school. Everyone gets to know each other.
College Sophomore,4,"The local town is quiet. There is the Donald Duck orange juice factory down the road. You can go in and tour where you are given oranges and orange juice. Lego World is about 10 miles up the road, and we have Bok towers. We also have a mall that is about 7mile up the rode. So there is something for the students to do."
College Sophomore,4,I was able to get fafsa and the money they allow for being a Florida resident.
College Sophomore,4,Every time I go to the school no matter what time it is I can always find a park. I don't live on campus or have to report to a class room but I frequently go to the school for library access.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school! I love the administrative staff, they really try to help you all they can. The only thing I would add is online tutoring."
College Senior,4,"Warner University can be very strict when it comes to the student handbook and it is required to know once classess began, rather you are a on campus student or off campus, even the online students have to know it regardless. The professors enforce it as well"
College Senior,4,There is a lot of parking room on campus. The university is big enough for visitor parking and student and faculty parking.
College Sophomore,4,The freshman girls dorms are really nice and comfortable.
College Sophomore,4,It depends on the times of your classes. Morning classes you're good evening classes may be a struggle. Know what your getting yourself into and plan to be early :)
College Senior,4,"It's usually really nice out. Sometimes when it rains too hard, there are puddles and it makes getting out of your car a real hassle."
College Freshman,4,"The weather here is almost the same throughout the semester, windy and sunny. Sometimes we do get big thunderstorms but hardly do classes ever get canceled. The weather is also good because students are always hanging outside on campus."
College Freshman,4,The computer labs at Warner university are usually open and easy to access. If you are having problems their is someone always their to assist you.
College Senior,4,Drugs are everywhere and there's nothing that can be done about that.  Warner has been doing a good job at stopping this issue when they are brought to light.
Alum,2,"The good was that the class size is small and the professors seem to care about the students.  

The bad is that the lifestyle agreement that you have to sign at the beginning of your career at the school isn't for everyone or enforced to everyone like it should be.   Numerous times I know that the people that we gay/lesbian got kicked out, but their partner was not.  The ladies were kicked out if they were found to have a baby, but the dad is allowed to be at the school."
Alum,2,"Warner University is a very close community. The professors are extremely helpful and really care about their students and will do whatever it takes to make sure you as a student are successful. I would like to see the staff be a little more lenient with the students as far as dorm and student life goes. Even though I never experienced dorm life, is was always one of the biggest complaints. Also, about 80 percent of the campus is athletes. I would appreciate to see them cater more towards the athletes in that the gym should be better taken care of in terms of cleanliness and should be updated and expanded in size. Although, I was an athlete so I am biased!"
College Junior,2,We don't have sorority groups but we need them!
College Sophomore,2,Nobody cares about the Greek life. Everybody is treated the same. There is no special housing. Just be prepared to go through a stupid rush week and gain nothing in return. Only thing they do is community service every once in a while and have lots of drama.
College Sophomore,2,We do not party. There is to be no alcohol ever. Go hang out at the lake or Taco Bell if you want to do anything at night.
Recent Alumnus,2,"our school is pretty small,it consists of 1200 students with the girl/boy ratio being  3 to 1 ."
College Sophomore,2,You have to catch a shuttle which only comes every 30min or have a car.
College Sophomore,2,again its horrible if you have no car you feel stuck
College Sophomore,2,without a car it is very hard to get around. and even with a car there is nothing around the area. most students end up leaving for the weekent to head to Tampa and other areas i Florida
College Sophomore,2,"The cost of going to college or any university is pretty expensive as we all know. Waner beeing a private school and all its tuition almost doubles the price, if that were not true I would not be here at this site applying for more scholarship."
College Freshman,2,The food at Warner University is not the best. But sometime the food don't be cook all the way..
College Freshman,2,not very good they pretty much leave you on your own to get loans and grants.
Niche User,1,Discriminatory school and policies that interfere with students’ education. Difficult to excel when policies like these are in place.
Niche User,1,Complete discrimination against LGBTQ students. Their “Christian” values say to love one another and share Christ’s grace but discriminate entire groups of students??
Freshman,1,Nightmare with warner university after all was taken care and square out when we meet with FINANCIAL department at the beginning  of the year we were offer grants that were giving and we were told it was approved ..our decision were  all made base on the grants and  offer that were offer to my child and we were told they were approved. After talking and  calculating number.. Now everything changes...and i have hear about few more kids even some that transfer out because. Of the same or similar situation..so we need to git our kids ready for these kind of surprises more been a Christian college..
College Junior,1,Well if you want to party or go out you'll have to drive about an hour. If not go hangout in Walmart!
College Sophomore,1,"Warner is a Christian school, so rules are strictly enforced."
College Sophomore,1,This is not the kind of school that you go to for the night life. Seriously its a Christain University! If you want night life go som eplace else. On the other hand Tampa isnt too far way but seriously get your life together dont look at Christian schools wondering what the night life is going to be like!
College Sophomore,1,"The Night Life – The nightlife is pretty quiet at warner, most student find something productive to do like playing basketball or studying in the library."
College Freshman,1,Very dead not a lot of thing to do the mall in lake wales suck

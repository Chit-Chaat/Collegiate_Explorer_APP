Alum,5,"I had the best 4 years of my life at DSU. I met my best friends there and the school was my 2nd home. DeSales set me up with Internships and job connections that led to my first job with a starting salary just under $60K.  I also had a first-class study abroad experience that had a huge impact on me.  DeSales is caring, empowering and provides everything you need to success academically and socially in a beautiful setting."
Alum,5,My online experience was limited but nevertheless it was outstanding.  The professor had a lot of support from the IT department and the classes were recorded if you needed to review or missed a class. I had a lot of fun in that class because the professor used humor to teach and it made it fun to learn. At the end of the class we had an in person reunion and had food tied to the cultural lessons that we had learned. It was amazing.
Junior,5,"I enjoy DeSales University greatly, I feel very welcome and like I am a part of their community which is a wonderful feeling."
Sophomore,5,"Although the campus is hidden, its a diamond in the rough. The community within DeSales University's Campus is unmatched to any institution I've ever seen. The campus life and the professors are almost all pleasant and excited to not only be on campus but share their knowledge with character, showing their true interest in the subject. The surrounding area of the campus is a short drive away from Bethlehem and surrounding properties."
Sophomore,5,"The university is small, but this is an added benefit, as you get to see more familiar faces more often. The staff is very kind and helpful, and the atmosphere is very supportive."
Niche User,5,"I visited DeSales and followed a student around for a day. All of the teachers were very nice, understanding and cooperative. The campus is easy to navigate and I felt safe while walking around. The admissions staff worked around their schedule to make me feel welcome and to make sure that I saw the building that I would be studying in. They gave me tons of information about the program and I immediately knew I wanted to attend their school. That experience is what convinced me to go to DeSales."
Freshman,5,"my advisor is very helpful. great adult program makes it easy to juggle school, work, and family! great online, classroom, or hybrid options"
Sophomore,5,Every professor at DeSales loves what they do which makes teaching easy for them and learning enjoyable. The school goes out of its way to make sure students feel comfortable and enjoy their education. It is a great school to get an education from.
Alum,5,"I adored my four years at DeSales University! The professors I had the opportunity to interact with in the natural science department were both personable and extremely knowledgeable. I received the most valuable education within the classroom and outside the classroom. The focus on Christian Humanism and Salesian spirituality is one of the reasons I chose the university, and campus ministry did not disappoint! I will be forever grateful to DeSales for the education I received and the memories I made. I was sad to leave after graduation, but DeSales prepared me for life and anything that could lie ahead for me."
Freshman,5,"I like the atmosphere of the environmental setting and the feeling that ""I'm at home"". This is the place where you can relax and focus on your studies without any distractions and connect with nature in general. It's welcoming and soothing as well."
Sophomore,5,DeSales University is great school that prepares its students for their future careers. It is a very welcoming environment and great professors.
Niche User,5,"As an access student it has been a wonderful rewarding experience. The professors are great, understanding and have the desire to teach. The access program allows you to work, have a family and attend college all at once."
Junior,5,The best part is the personal experience with the entire university community. The professors truly care about your education.
Freshman,5,"I will be going to DeSales in the spring semester in the ACCESS program. They have have been very helpful in helping me complete everything that is required.
I am very happy with my choice and can not wait to attend in the spring."
Sophomore,5,Great college! Campus is beautiful. I don't live on campus but it seems far away from things and you would definitely need a car to go on a target run. Lots of options for on-campus dining and the food is good. Everyone is really nice.
Junior,5,DeSales has provided with an experience that I would never have thought I could have at a performing arts school not in NYC
Junior,5,The quality and passion the professors have is amazing & a big factor in engaging the class to actually stay focus
Niche User,5,Great school. Wonderful campus. Great ideals and virtues. Very safe and warming campus. Great administrative.
Freshman,5,DeSales has provided me a great learning experience. Student Life is great; Professors are attentive and helpful. Overall a good experience.
Niche User,5,"Beautiful campus, wonderful people, and great academics.  DeSales is the perfect college for all those interested in attending a small Catholic College. The students are very welcoming and by the time you leave you feel like part of a large family. The professors are very willing to work with on if you have any questions or concerns. In addition, if you are a student-athlete the professors are very considerate and will work extra time if you miss class.  The dorms are very spacious and even as a freshman you only have to share a bathroom with three other people! There is also in-house cleaning that comes once a month to make sure your dorm is nice and clean. I would recommend the school to anyone."
Freshman,5,The people are friendly the change that I want to see happening is dorms to be a lot more comfortable
Sophomore,5,Desales University is a great choice for anyone looking to further their education while simultaneously getting away from the distractions of many modern cities and towns.
Niche User,5,"DeSales University has excellent accounting and business programs. The professors are kind and knowledgeable, as well as care for the students. DeSales has a beautiful campus in Center Valley."
Sophomore,5,DeSales has a great community feeling that helps everyone feel welcome. The professors are wonderful and very skilled. All the staff is very helpful and friendly.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love it here. The student body is incredibly friendly and the professors are (mostly) above average. They have a really big emphasis on getting involved, so everyone has a really awesome support system. Orientation was one of the best weekends of my life. The sports games here (however few) are really fun to attend. It's a relatively small campus here, so most of us mind our own business, it's never really a judgement zone. The most popular majors here are nursing and theatre (or so I've gathered). The only downsides that I can see are that it gets REALLY windy here in the winters, and if you don't have a car on campus be prepared with gloves and hats and coats, etc. The food is also okay, it's usually hit or miss some days. We're really close to a shopping center and a movie theatre and a bowling alley, and there are frequent trips to nearby cities and events, and sometimes beaches when it gets warmer. So you're never bored. I absolutely love it here."
College Freshman,5,There is close to absolutely no crime and everyone feels completely safe on campus. The only time there is typically an emergency is when a bear happens to pass by the university.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus. We have on campus police and they do a great job of keeping everyone safe at all times. The campus also has blue boxes which you can press if you are ever in a situation and help will be immediately on the way.
College Freshman,5,"Since completing my freshman year recently, I have really enjoyed attended DeSales. It is a fun and welcoming environment that everyone is a somebody. I can always find someone to help me with questions in any field or department. The opportunities at this school are endless."
College Freshman,5,There is a variety of courses on campus and the professors are extremely helpful and truly care about your education and well being. Class sizes vary from 20-40 kids depending on what class. Most are around 25-30.
College Freshman,5,"The career center is extremely helpful in finding internships, jobs, and volunteer positions. They work with you in making sure you are fully prepared by holding mock interviews and building your resume. Every student takes advantage of the career center at one point in time while on campus."
College Freshman,5,"Living on campus has been a gift. The dorms are well up to date and in close proximity to academic buildings. The cost i very reasonable for a private school. The housing process is extremely simple. When you live on campus, you meet so many people and you bond with them over food, tv shows, studying and more. Living on campus has been the best experience of my life."
College Freshman,5,"This past semester the first greek organization was formed on campus. Alpha Phi Omega, is a service coed fraternity to help better the community. As a pledge class member, I have made a ton of new friends through APO and have found my place on campus. Everyone on campus seems to like the idea of having greek life on campus, but as a Catholic School there will not be a great deal of normal greek activities, such as a house and things like hazing."
College Freshman,5,"The overall school spirit is extremely strong here, each and every game there is always a huge crowd of students cheering on their peers. The sports teams work extremely hard all season long and play their very best game each and every time. The gym and student union are both equipped with the best equipment for exercise and weight training. Everyone has access to the equipment, and if you not sure how to use a certain machine there are plenty of people who would offer you some help and guidance."
College Freshman,5,Being a student there gives me the courage that I will succeed after I graduate. The professors are willing to go out of their way and help guide you along the next 4 years here. The push you to your full potential and want to see you succeed in all academic classes. If i was to go back and choose my college decision again I would still choose DeSales as the place I would spend the next four year to guide me into my career choice.
College Student,5,The worst that has happened is a deer went through a window.
College Student,5,We do a CourseEval at the end of every semester.
College Student,5,I love it at DeSales.
College Freshman,5,DeSales University is basically in the middle of nowhere so safety is not a problem
College Sophomore,5,DeSales is the safest school you will ever see. Everyone helps everyone. The only danger is deer.
College Junior,5,"I would choose DeSales every single time because my professors truly care about my success. I am a work-study student in the Biology lab and some of the science center staff members approached me and said they considered me part of their professional staff. They proceeded to discuss what I had done for the science center and how grateful they were to have me as a student. I have never felt a stigma against me because I am a woman in the Biology field, nor have I ever questioned whether or not any professor cares about me. I would always choose DeSales; not just for the program, but for the people."
College Sophomore,5,We're fine. We were second safest school in the nation until a dear broke in through a window.
College Sophomore,5,We place a good number of our students in most fields.
College Sophomore,5,"Can't complain, we have maids!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"The school is what you make of it. (As is any school) if you work hard, you will succeed. If you get involved, you will feel a part of campus."
College Sophomore,5,There is something for everyone at this school. The people who say that there is nothing to do simply have not looked hard enough.
College Sophomore,5,"I never have a problem with administration, they are always kind and helpful."
College Junior,5,It's easier to receive a full-tuition scholarship here than at most schools. Check it out.
College Sophomore,5,Career services is wonderful in helping score jobs
College Sophomore,5,"Small class size, excellent professors, amazing."
College Sophomore,5,"Very green, outside study spots, beautiful campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Many courses, many work study/lab opportunities."
College Sophomore,5,Science programs are the best here; difficult.
College Student,5,The entire process was very easy and all the people were very attentive and helpful.
College Student,5,I was surprised that the field I was interested in was available.
College Freshman,5,"Awesome, the nursing program here is great! Definitely a good pick!"
College Junior,5,No drugs are permitted on campus.
College Junior,5,They do a great job
College Student,5,there's plenty to do. The scenery is beautiful
College Freshman,5,"I love doing the online courses at DeSales, it is great. They do not offer the program that I would like to study so I will have to transfer to another college. I received 18 credits so far and I loved the professors and the advisor's they were all great. I would def. recommend going there is they have what your looking for. :)"
College Freshman,5,"My career goal is to go into Health Information technology. It was marketing, however I want to do a career change. "
Junior,4,"I had to take certain classes online, but it was difficult for me to keep up with them sometimes to no fault of my professors."
Sophomore,4,Due to COVID-19 I had to attend the remainder of my second semester after spring break online. Although it is not what I planned for my college experience at DeSales University I still managed to stay connected with my professors due to their hard work for producing an online environment that was conducive to me excelling in the virtual classroom.
Niche User,4,"I did not take any online classes.
Online utilization between professors varied, but the experience was always great in my experience.
We used Blackboard I think for class pages and information.
Pages always worked flawlessly.

Some professors never used it, some posted files or the class notes or recorded lectures online, whereas two gave online quizzes here and another had discussion boards.
Overall I though they worked very well."
Niche User,4,"I am transferring out of DeSales firstly because I did not feel challenged enough by the coursework there for my major in Computer Science.
In my major classes, they often felt very slow and worked much from the book.
However, all classes not in my major's focus, I loved with my whole heart.
And I wish I did not leave because the professors I had here are some of the best teachers, friends, and people in general I've met anywhere. I wish I could stay just for them.
I am transferring secondly just because there are a few very specific majors and course focuses that they don't offer which I'd like to explore.
Overall, it's an absolutely great place to be with the most amazing teachers, but I am looking for something more challenging."
Junior,4,Great school to improve your further. Wonderful masters programs. Yet Teachers are rigorous and campus life isn’t a highlight for this school
Junior,4,Taking online cathloic courses is not recommended. However the Access program they offer is great and has been a help with my schedule.
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful and feels bigger than it actually is. The academic programs are great and the professors are always willing to help the students.
Freshman,4,The professors are dedicated to their work. They really know the information being taught and most of them are open to feedback.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman nursing student at DeSales University. This school is a great place and you really feel at home here. Everyone is so welcoming and the academics are outstanding. The food is better then most college food, but certainly not moms home cooked meals. Housing here is fantastic the rooms are very spacious and the private bathrooms are a blessing."
Niche User,4,"The moment I walked on to the campus I felt like I was at home. I was so comfortable and happy. There is not anything major that I would change about the college because it good how it is. But if I had to pick something, the long walks to and from class in the cold are a bit tough but other than that the college is great."
Senior,4,"I love how small the school is because it provides more opportunities in leadership, academics, and activities than any other larger school would on a one-to-one ratio with advisers and professors. The professors take their classes very seriously for every subject and they really focus on pushing students to succeed. There are many opportunities on campus to build your resume and network with others."
Sophomore,4,"DeSales University has a very good environment and very friendly staff that are willing to talk to you. Everyone is very approachable and it feels like a small family in ways. They make it very easy for students who are spending their first extended period of time away from home with fun, engaging activities."
Sophomore,4,"Great teachers that are passionate about the material. The area surrounding the school is a bit boring, but the school offers many trips."
Sophomore,4,"I love the Diversity at Desales . I’ve met students from all walks of life . I am currently studying Theater and Performimg arts . I used to be very shy but being at this university, I’ve come out of my shell and learned to be comfortable in my own skill . All of the staff are very welcoming and have made my transition to college very enjoyable"
Freshman,4,DeSales University is a great college to attend. The campus is lovely and is large but not too big so its not likely to get lost. The food is good but not amazing of course. The professors can be difficult but are focused on teaching their students the best that they can.
Niche User,4,My experience at Desales was a wonderful time and I never wanted to leave! Desales is a great place to be at and an amazing work zone. I encourage a lot more juniors and seniors in high school to check out Desales and maybe just go on a visit or even just check out the website.
Freshman,4,"At Desales University, all the people are so kind and helpful. I didn't know how to handle my financial aid sheet and the lady at the desk was so helpful and patient. Everyone makes you feel at home here!"
Junior,4,"I love this school, but it's tuition is too high. It makes it difficult to continue my nursing education."
Freshman,4,What I like about DeSales is the courses they offer. What I would like to see change is the amount of required courses.
Junior,4,I have enjoyed my classes and look forward to graduation. Paying for my classes has been stressful though.
Freshman,4,"DeSales University has been a great experience for me so far.  I am a freshman lacrosse player in the 3+3 PT program. I believe this school provides a lot of opportunities for students not only academically, but also physically and spiritually. The professors are all very supportive and available. All the students are extremely welcoming. The small number of students who attend the school gives the school a very familial feeling. Everyone knows everyone, your class sizes are small."
Senior,4,Overall experience has been great. Academics here are difficult but professors are highly trained and specialized in individual areas. The campus is calm and the party scene is not very active. 
Freshman,4,"Overall, Desales University has a very beautiful campus. The professors along with the curriculum provide a high quality education for all students. Although it is a smaller school, many activities and clubs are provided in order to keep the students busy. The desserts are fantastic and the meal plan in general is great. The campus is extremely safe, therefore there aren't many parties either. However, there are many universities in the area where parties can be found. The dorms are very comfortable and all the other buildings are nice as well. If you put the hard work into your education at Desales, you'll definitely receive a return on your investment."
College Junior,4,I guess they're okay. Some professors for Gen Ed classes take their jobs way too seriously
College Junior,4,"Alcohol is the biggest thing, sometimes people smoke but it's not overly present"
College Junior,4,Cops are pricks about parking but there's just about no crime
College Junior,4,"For housing, DeSales isn't too bad. For freshman, you share a bathroom with 3 other people so it's much better than a communal bathroom"
College Junior,4,So far so good with registration and information on school policy.
College Junior,4,My experience with registration was good.
College Freshman,4,My overall experience with everything at DeSales has been wonderful - the professors want you to succeed as well as everyone else you come in contact with at DeSales. It is such a fun and safe environment and I will be recommending the college to all rising high school seniors looking for a perfect fit.
College Freshman,4,"DeSales' program is designed to get you a job right after graduating - in fact, you can't graduate unless you have completed an internship to prepare students to move into the real world. The career center is such a huge help and will do anything on their part to ensure that they will have success."
College Freshman,4,"Part of the reason I chose this school (along with academics and the whole package), was because of the dorms. I LOVE the fact that my hall does not have communal bathrooms, instead I have three roommates, two rooms, and one bathroom. I find it to be a cleaner environment and more fun to have three roommates."
College Freshman,4,"As the school is still somewhat renovating and amping up the facilities for sports, it is still great. The turf fields are brand new but athletics are not the most important thing on campus. Coaches understand and encourage that school comes before sports - and that is the greatest thing for any student to hear."
College Freshman,4,"My first year here, I wasn't sure if I was ready for college but everyone here made it such an easy transition. The people are so friendly and the campus isn't too big to get around and figure out. Playing sports has also opened an opportunity for me to make friends more quickly, as did the freshmen orientation program that allowed us to ease into becoming more familiar with the school. Love it!!"
College Freshman,4,"Overall experience at school has been great, the teachers want you to succeed just as much as you do. Classes are rarely cancelled and professors always show up ready to teach!"
College Freshman,4,students who graduate seem to always find work shortly after graduating. The campus career center does a great job in helping  with internships and students finding work.
College Freshman,4,"On campus housing is great. There are a lot of dorms to choose from and more options come as you get older. The upper class housing is more expensive, such as a villa. But the come with more to offer."
College Freshman,4,The small school atmosphere allows me to get the most out of each course and the professors. Every professor you have knows your name and will say hello to you outside of class.
College Student,4,We only have a chapter of Alpha Phi Omega.
College Student,4,We're going to be building stadiums soon!
College Freshman,4,The sport facilities are all state of the art and new.
College Freshman,4,I love the dance program and the professional people they bring to the school to show us different styles of dance.
College Sophomore,4,It is a great school for those who want to attend a smaller school. People are very friendly and are always willing to help.
College Freshman,4,Always there when you need help
College Freshman,4,Very confident I will get a good job
College Freshman,4,Love the housing but so hard to life where you want
College Freshman,4,Hard classes but worth it in the end
College Freshman,4,Classes are easy to get into and are pretty small which makes it easier to focus and ask questions when needed.
College Freshman,4,"Tons of room, large rooms. Very well kept the house keeping is just wonderful. The RAs need work."
College Sophomore,4,"It is the perfect size for students who want to have only a small amount of people at the college but not feel like it is so small. The campus is spread out enough that I don't feel like I go to a school with maybe 2,500 people there."
College Sophomore,4,"We do not have a football team, but that is what makes every other team recognized. Our women's soccer team just won their conference. Everyone supports each sport and attends the games when they are available. We just had a new sports facility built and it is beautiful!"
College Sophomore,4,"I am a Nursing major so my classes are basically made up of the same people and same teachers, but these teachers are all willing to help and want you to pass. No teacher wants to fail anyone. All courses are interesting you just have to put the work in and do the work like any other college. The class sizes are like high school classes aver of about 35 students and every professor knows their students names."
College Sophomore,4,The alumni network at DeSales is great. There are so many around the school that you are able to connect anywhere. I don't know any student that was unable or had a hard time trying to get an internship or job. The career center really helps you out in finding a job for you.
College Sophomore,4,"DeSales University is a great school for academics. The classes are very challenging, but the teachers are all willing to help if you put in the effort. Every major at DeSales is considered excellent here. The sport teams all encourage each other and everyone attends every event. The school is small, but that is what makes it great!"
College Junior,4,"I don't usually attend sporting events, but they are a big part of campus life. The athletic facilities are in the process of being upgraded, so it is clear that DeSales cares about athletics and the facilities the students are using."
Recent Alumnus,4,"DeSales gave me a great education.  The classes force you to look beyond your ""major"" and develop a complete world view.  I truly grew as a person during my time there.  Their Catholic Leadership Institute was outstanding.  I chose DeSales for the Physician Assistant Program but feel I received an excellent education all around."
College Student,4,"I really like this school. The people are very nice and always willing to help. The class sizes are small so they are not overwhelming, and it is actually possible to talk one on one with my teachers. My favorite part is how helpful and welcoming the staff is! You can really tell the teachers care about you individually, not as just as a whole. They also make it clear that they want you to succeed, and will do everything in their power to make that happen. All in all, I am very happy I chose DeSales University."
College Junior,4,"DeSales University is a great school. The staff is always their to help their students with classes and making decisions towards their future. Being a smaller school, the classes aren't large and allow for individual attention with the instructor if necessary. Overall I think I made a great decision."
College Junior,4,The school is great! You can take a break away from your laptop in the library for awhile and return to your spot with nothing being touched. Also the night crew in the McShea cafe are good to befriend.
College Freshman,4,DeSales is a very safe campus and there is almost never any problems with safety.
Freshman,2,"Small, conservative, difficult to make friends, below average academics, middle of NOWHERE. Did not like it and I am transferring for sophomore year"
Freshman,2,"The staff talked about all the events planned for students, all the benefits that students would receive, and all the help students could ask for. When I attended the school with the hopes of all that I was told, I found out that nothing really happens on campus. I was not given the help and benefits that were promised to me. The school is boring and not worth going to unless in a specific program of study."
Alum,2,I studied Television and Film from 2007-2011. The professors that drew e to the program left and were replaced my new inexperienced professors
Freshman,2,Suitcase school with little to nothing to do on the weekends.  Still feels like a high school because of all the rules and restricted internet.
College Junior,2,don't go to DeSales if you're looking to attend fun parties. most drinking will occur in someone's dorm room. If you wanna go to lehigh or to something like the baseball house you have to have a DD or uber and that's annoying
College Junior,2,"Overall, terrible. I guess if you're into the whole small school, lots of people are assholes, not doing much on the weekends then DeSales is for you."
College Junior,2,"Not a good school to go to if you want to if you actually wanna enjoy your college experience. I transferred out after my freshman year and it was the best decision I could have made. Too small, too catholic, too cliquey, the people are too judgemental, I could go on forever about reasons why I was unhappy. The best thing that came out of my experience were some of the friendships. Definitely not the kind of school I pictured as being ""college"" in my mind and maybe that's why I was unhappy. But if I could start all over I would definitely not have chosen DeSales."
College Freshman,2,There is no Greek Life.
College Freshman,2,Basketball and soccer are the main 2 sports and they are not very popular to most of the school.
College Senior,2,No one gave a hoot and I could not get any answers or help getting some aid.
College Freshman,2,PA major- 18 credits a semester really gets to people. It's very demanding and has a heavy workload. Great facilities though.
College Freshman,2,People are very unaccepting of others and to be quite honest it's repulsive. Multiple times there has been sidewalk chalk everywhere about abortion and what not. I wouldn't come to this school if I could do it all over again. The school revolves around athletes thinking they're the best and it can be hard to make friends with all the cliques at DeSales.
College Freshman,2,The school is definitely not for me. The school is small and full of conservative catholics. There's about no way to avoid someone on campus because it's so small. Class sizes are nice and small which is nice. Gambet is a great building. Professors vary and I wish I would have used ratemyprofessor.com before choosing classes.
College Freshman,2,Everyone on a sports team at this school thinks that the world revolves around them. They think that they're in the major leagues but they're at a small time D3 school. Most teams aren't so great and not a lot of students attend games.
College Freshman,2,DeSales is not the type of school to come to if you want to party. The heights have parties but they get cramped and aren't the best. The baseball house is the only consistent off campus party place and you need a DD always if you wanna go off campus unless you want to pay for a taxi.
College Freshman,2,"Food is always the same. Hard to eat healthy when all the veggies are drenched in butter or cheese, etc. Sandella's makes me sick and their chicken is repulsive. Food is very overpriced and is nowhere near the quality it should be."
College Freshman,2,There are frequent parties but since its a small school you see the same 30 people packed into a small room or height house and usually shut down by 1
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is non existent.
College Sophomore,2,The Athletes walk around like the rule the campus and like they are demi-gods; also they are only friends with their fellow athletes. All the athletes are very clique-ish.
College Sophomore,2,The prices of the food are ridiculously expensive. It costs $2 for a small single serving of cereal; when you could get $2 for a large box of cereal at a local grocery store.
College Junior,2,"Center Valley is cornfields. It's near Bethlehem and Allentown, which prevent me from rating CV a 1."
College Senior,2,"Listen, both sexes here look alright. There are some really hot guys and girls but maybe a good 2/30 per class. Some girls dress great, others like slobs. Its college. Most girls don't exercise. Most guys here are snots and understand the girl to guy ratio. They feel entitled to women, so really its about how many girls they can get, a lot like to/will cheat. Even the ugly guys will do it. Some girls are straight loose and some are super christian, polar opposites. 

Social Life: Trying to get a group to go out to party on a saturday is like pulling teeth."
College Senior,2,"Its not that great. Some dorms are big, others closets. You can't have candles or toasters or microwaves or anything really. The dorms are far from class, its a hike to every building, not to mention interaction between dorms is small. Chances are you won't know who is living next to you but if you do you'll barely see them."
College Senior,2,"The worst thing that ever happened here was the dooling deer. Violence occurs at parties but its only when kids act like 3% alcohol does anything, I've only heard of 3 assaults on campus no sexual assaults."
College Senior,2,"the school seems to be strict about things that are not as important, such as parking, and less strict about more important things, like underage drinking."
College Senior,2,"there are plenty of off campus dining options, but most are not very good. mainly fast food and gain restaurants. not very fitting for student budgets."
College Student,2,I live at home so I'm happy with my situation.  Most students either commute or stay on campus.
College Freshman,2,Always problems printing and the WIFI is very slow!
College Freshman,2,There are not very exciting parties and you tend to know the same people and the parties are over early.
College Freshman,2,There aren't too many places that are that close to campus and if you do not have a car you won't be able to access them.
College Senior,2,I never see any buses on campus
College Senior,2,"Being a conservative school there are many rules on how late the opposite sex can be in a dorm. Any time another student or a non student sleeps in someone's room, it must be documented. Many students feel the cops are there to get people in trouble as opposed to keeping them safe. As for academics, it is good."
College Senior,2,"The food is rarely good, many times I have found hair in my meal. They have virtually no healthy options besides a salad bar and a small gluten free section. The prices are outrageous and not worth it."
College Senior,2,"There are not enough spots for all of the students at the school. Students who live on campus are only allowed to park at their dorms and commuter students can only park at the library, cafeteria, and two academic buildings. On top of this, the law enforcement on campus spends the majority of their time handing out parking tickets. It is very frustrating. "
College Freshman,2,There is no Greek life on this campus
College Senior,2,"Its average. The copper head is close, but other restaurants are a little farther."
College Sophomore,2,"The Copperhead is the one place you'll go without a car. With a car, you'll find a couple of places around 309, but nothing seriously special."
College Sophomore,2,"I can't speak for myself, but I can say that DeSales shouldn't be your first pick if the nightlife partying is a top priority."
College Senior,2,"Few Options Within Walking Distance – Since DeSales is a ten-minute car trip from the cities of Bethlehem and Allentown, there aren't many restaurants close to campus. However, we do have The Copperhead Grill and Bar a few minutes' walk from campus. Many students take their guests there to eat, since the cafeteria fare gets boring after a while. Also, it's one of the favorites for students on the nights of their twenty-first birthdays."
College Sophomore,2,"Desales is well somewhat well diversied, I am use to every background being present at my high school. Here it is all caucasian basically with the 5% other races. It is a catholic college but all religions are accepted and acknowledge."
Junior,1,"Academically, your teachers and professors will strongly encourage you to do your best if you take the initiative. They are willing to help you succeed if you stop by office hours. They do have the experience and knowledge to help you grow as a person. If you don't have a conservative background, people can be very judgemental with their own biases against you. There isn't a football team so the athletics life is almost nonexistant. You run into alot of familiar faces which can be good or bad, but it almost removes the college experience in the traditional sense. The food is decent but not much choice in options. It seems like a ""bait and switch,"" with a high school atmosphere."
Freshman,1,"HUGE MOLD PROBLEM and when reported repeatedly was given the run around. They said they cleaned AC units but meanwhile vents were still dust & mildew covered. I developed Asthma and could barely breath the entire time there. I was in PA program and teachers could care less that I had become so sick. NO HELP AT ALL!!! Only students passing chem class were repeating the same class! Head of PA program didnt care AT ALL!!!!! Oh! and you cannot get a meal anywhere on campus after 7:30pm so, stock up on the Ramen noodles!"
Freshman,1,"Im transferring and I couldn't be happier to leave. Desales is too small, too catholic and too cliquey. Theology classes are extremely hard if you do not come from a conservative background where all you do is read the bible. People here and very closed-minded and not welcoming towards people of different religions. It is ridiculous how they refuse to have a LGBTQ club or a Gay Straight Alliance Club. I have found that people are not accepting and are judgmental towards others. Theres ABSOLUTELY nothing to do on the weekends, everyone goes home. Few to none parties. While I could go on and on about the negatives of this school, I have found some positives. My classes are educational and the curriculum is challenging. Ive loved my professors, majority want to help you succeed and challenge you to the best of your abilities. However, don't waste your money and come here unless you want an extremely catholic school with closed minded people who aren't accepting of others."
College Junior,1,There is absolutely no Greek life at DeSales to speak of.
College Freshman,1,We do not have this at DeSales University
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek life and I'm glad we don't.
College Freshman,1,This place is safe but its almost too safe they treat you like babies
College Freshman,1,We don't have football homecoming game is the boys soccer game and about 50 people showed up.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life here
College Freshman,1,Awful there are like 2 choices.
College Freshman,1,It sucks there is nothing around this school.
College Freshman,1,It sucks its the same 20 people at every party and every party I mean baseball house. That is the only house that has parties. If you want to try and have a good time you have to go to lehigh. if you are looking for a good time it is not at DeSales.
College Freshman,1,It is so strict you feel like you are in a prison. Don't go to this school if you want to have a balance of fun and schoolwork. You get yelled at every second if you are having a good time ON THE WEEKENDS. And there are curfews for guys in the girls dorms and vise versa. I get it is a catholic university but it is COLLEGE. We are adults. This school is terrible
College Freshman,1,The campus food is disgusting they only have the main dining hall which has awful hours. And sandellas which is the same food every day. THATS IT there is no other places to eat. And you are screwed if you do not have a car.
College Freshman,1,"The campus is too small. It is like high school all over again. Don't be fooled! They are really good at drawing you into the school and they act like they care but once you get there you are just another person. There is nothing to do, you feel like you are in a bubble. I am class of 2018 and I am transferring but I am not the only one. There was a handful of people who transferred after the first semester and that is a lot for a small school more than half didn't have roommates the second semester. Social life is important and you don't have one if you come here. I get that school is important but they act like it is a full time job here. You are supposed to have some fun. If you don't have a car on campus then you will be bored to death."
College Freshman,1,There is what you would call literally no greek life at desales
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life on campus so there is no description
College Senior,1,"The gays keep quiet or transfer out, you won't see any gay couples on campus. There is little diversity, out of 1500 kids i would say 50 are of another race and thats pushing it."
College Senior,1,"it's all sodexo, it's all stale and totally unhealthy."
College Senior,1,"No greek life because we're lame and it could ruin our rep as a catholic school. Also no football team for the same reasons. DeSales doesn't like rowdy kids,severe extroverts-- especially kids that like to have fun and party."

Freshman,5,"I love everything about Marist!! There is such a warming and friendly community filled with great people, professors and administrators. I have loved my time at Marist so far and cannot wait for my years to come here!"
Freshman,5,My professors have been great and are very accommodating through this online learning experience. I like the hybrid model Marist has in place so I can still safely attend classes in person. When I am online I feel included and engaged in class and feel that my professors are doing a great job to educate me.
Junior,5,"Transferring to Marist was the best decision I have ever made. The faculty and staff at Marist are amazing and genuinely care about their students, and are always willing to help. The many valuable resources at Marist allow students to have An opportunity for success that they would not find elsewhere, and the Marist College community is unmatched. Being a part of this community has allowed me to find my home away from home."
Junior,5,"The Marist College community is like no other, and has allowed me to find my home away from home. The faculty and staff are absolutely amazing and genuinely care about their students. Marist also offers so many resources to it’s community which provide opportunities comparable to large universities while also providing the personal experience of a mid-sized institution."
Sophomore,5,"I love Marist. They make each student feel like they’re the most special. Professors really care and students have so many opportunities to grow inside and outside the classroom. Student life is always great, lots to do on campus and plenty of clubs to join! Marist has proven to be such a great fit."
Freshman,5,"Due to Covid, some of my classes are online. Although it isn't the same experience as in-person, online is just fine! The professors are easy to contact and flexible to set up office hours with and again truly want the best for their students. All around, you still will be getting the education you deserve because Marist is committed to that!"
Freshman,5,"Marist truly is a step above the rest! I am so glad I came to Marist because Marist truly does have something for everyone! From the moment you step onto Marist, they are dedicated to seeing you succeed! They truly do offer so much and they want what's best for all of their students! The professors are extremely personable and create relationships with their students regarding job and internship opportunities and want to see you succeed! I truly can not say enough positive things about Marist! Marist is a family and every day is a great day to be a Red Fox I can guarantee you that!"
Junior,5,Marist is everything that I wanted in a college. Small class sizes allow for professors to make a real connection to students. There are also so many things to get involved with on campus!
Junior,5,"Online learning is not for me, but Marist professors have done a great job! So willing to help because they know we are all struggling."
Freshman,5,"Marist is awesome! There is countless opportunities to get involved! It is located near multiple major cities so you get great internship opportunities. New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia are not far. It is safe and secure campus. There is plenty of close by restaurants. I joined CenterField the Marist sports newspaper which has been great. Freshman can get in and get right started. I joined the Marist College Television too! Freshman can get write on air there and articles can be written for the sports newspaper right away. Across the street there is a Home Depot, Ocean State Job Lot, Giacomos, Salsa Fresca, Starbucks, McDonalds, and Applebee’s. There is also two Starbucks on campus. There’s is many many eating options on campus. Multiple dinning halls, multiple food spots. There’s a ton of lounges and quiet work areas on campus too. Overall, Marist has a little bit of everything. The river is close by and you can go and relax by the river. There is a Marist college access"
Freshman,5,It’s been good. Teachers are very flexible and understanding. The learning environment is not much different than regular. Teachers who are interactive are still very interactive. Students can get sent to breakout rooms where they associate with each other. I personally don’t find it much different. Teachers share their screens so it is like your like at the board they would use if you were in class. Online schooling sounds challenging but only half of the class is online (1 day and the other in person). Not all classes are live online either. Some are asynchronous where they only meet in person one time a week and they other online day is independent. Hybrid is when you do both. Both ways are good! Everyone will have their own preface I like the independent version slightly better but neither are very stressful. The environment is relaxed but your are still getting the academic aspect which is the reasons you attend college!
Junior,5,"Marist College is the perfect mix of a small and large university. Classes are small enough that teachers know student's names and faces, but you won't know everyone on campus. Marist is beautiful in the fall season, being right on the Hudson River. Professors are generally more than happy to help students and class sizes are generally on the smaller side. The course load at Marist, being a liberal arts school, allows for a rounded education, making students take classes outside of their major."
Junior,5,"Online classes are the perfect alternative when one has a busy schedule. Generally professors will post a weekly module, to be completed by the next week. They often include, activities, assignments, lectures and/or notes. Some will record and upload lectures as though they are still teaching in a classroom setting, while others will upload slideshows of text. With COVID Marist has created the opportunity for students to take online courses, but still meet face to face with professors and classmates over Zoom."
Freshman,5,"Marist College's campus is incredible! The sunset over the Hudson River is something I look forward to every single night. I also find myself spending less and less time in my dorm the more time I spend at Marist. That's not to say I don't enjoy spending time in my dorm–I love my cozy room! However, I have found numerous spots on campus where I like to sit down with a cup of coffee from Hancock Brew and get some work done. As for the size, I think Marist perfect–I am always meeting new people, but I still see familiar faces all around campus which is nice. Marist has such a great sense of community–everyone is very friendly and welcoming!"
Sophomore,5,"Choosing to come to Marist was easily the best decision I’ve ever made. Not only have I been receiving a quality education (and I have no doubt that I will be thoroughly prepared for what the real world has to offer), but I have additionally met some the kindest, most genuine people that I have ever come in contact with. Marist College promotes intelligence, of course, but truly prioritizes being a good person first— which is something I think this world needs more of.  I’m so grateful to be attending a school with so much authenticity and wonderful student life."
Freshman,5,During these times classes are split. Some are in person some on zoom and some hybrid. Even both that each teacher is committed to us succeeding. There’s opportunities to learn about everything and anything. From Philosophy to finance to fashion the education opportunities are endless. Marist also gives each is us the chance to travel and learn ANYWHERE in the world.
Freshman,5,"When looking at schools, I was very cautious with my selection. I wanted somewhere that would feel homey while still fostering my education. I also wanted a school with international programs, exceptional internships and a ski club. Now that I’m here at Marist College, I know I’ve made the right choice. Not only is Marist absolutely beautiful, but it is full of opportunities and activities. Even during COVID, the staff has worked unbelievably hard to ensure that we never have a boring day on campus along with teachers still fully committed to each student succeeding even through zoom.  In such unsure times, it feels so comforting to have a place that feels like home."
Sophomore,5,The professors have been incredible about making sure they are available to help the students during these unprecedented times.  They have extra office hours and are available by email practically 24 hours a day.
Sophomore,5,"The resources of a large school, with the personalization of a small school.  The small class sizes ensure a personal relationship with professors that lead to incredible networking opportunities.  The unique classroom experiences and numerous clubs and organizations create a one of a kind college experience."
Junior,5,"The hybrid learning environment has been a transition but a really smooth one for me. I love this school and even though it is not the same as last year, I am enjoying it."
Junior,5,"Love this school! Great teachers, classes, and friends. Marist is such a welcoming place and everyone is so nice. My professors know me by my first name and really want to see me succeed."
Alum,5,Marist gave me the tools I needed to enter the workforce. Marist does a great job getting student internships for all studies. Every student is required to complete 3 rounds of interning before graduating. Marist also supports their students and helps them find jobs and opportunities are they have graduated.
Alum,5,Online classes were easy to navigate. Marist uses Ilearn for online classes as well as classes on campus.
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my Freshman year at Marist College, and I will be returning for my Sophomore year in the fall. As with any new experience, I did not know what to expect when I attended Marist in Fall 2019, but I was completely overwhelmed by my experience. I committed to Marist on Accepted Students Day -  I just knew I belonged there. After my first year, I can say that I still feel the same way. Being at Marist is like being at my second home - I have met some of my best friends there, made some amazing memories, and met some of the most inspirational and successful faculty ever. I never would have dreamed I would be taught and mentored by such successful and caring people. Marist has strong academics, and an even stronger faculty. They have incredible resources and are truly a diamond in the brush."
Sophomore,5,"I have to give credit where credit is due - Marist did attempt to create as smooth of a transition to online learning as one could, mid-semester. Though encountering some slight hiccups, and some professors who proved unable or unwilling to adapt, I was able to successfully complete the semester with a GPA in the mid-3.8 range. Though I was hoping for higher, considering the circumstances, I believe my GPA stands testament to Marist's quality of faculty and their dedication to their students."
Junior,5,"Such a great experience! As a transfer student coming from a community college, everyone at Marist always made sure that I felt like home. I can't wait to start this semester!"
Alum,5,My overall undergraduate experience at Marist college was amazing. I loved that my professors were very knowledgeable in their field and readily and easily available.
Alum,5,I loved the campus and the student life. I was on the tennis team and thought the schools athletic programs have a lot to offer and there is a lot of money within these programs. The professors are mostly all very nice and there to help you. Overall my experience at Marist College was very good and i couldn't have asked for a better place to go to school
Alum,5,"What first drew me to Marist was its beautiful campus, the diversity of the student population and the talented faculty. Marist prepared me for the real world by allowing me to have hands-on experiences, meaningful internships and classes that nurtured my growth. My business degree provided the foundation needed to succeed in the business world."
Niche User,5,"Amazing college campus, it is so beautiful and the environment couldn't be more welcoming. The academics allow you to challenge yourself and the teacher are there to support you."
Freshman,5,"Great community, everyone is so kind. The academics are great and the teachers are always willing to help you succeed. I definitely recommend Marist."
Niche User,5,"I really loved the school. It was beautiful, and had very modern technology. Everyone seemed very nice and friendly there, and the educational facilities were incredible."
Niche User,5,Gives of a welcoming atmosphere. The campus is beautiful and gives a new experience for those planning to go to school out of the city.
Niche User,5,The experience is great at Marist college and I would recommend it to many other people. From academics to the arts Marist has everything and anything anyone could want.
Niche User,5,"Marist is a diverse campus where students are able to not only focus on their education, but participate in social groups."
Senior,5,Marist is a well-known school in the area and has great programs offered to many types of students. Their alumni network is huge and Marist regularly schedules events to connect students to alumni to encourage connections and potential internships and job opportunities.
Niche User,5,Marist College is a wonderful campus. It is located in upstate NY with beautiful views of the Hudson Valley. The students at Marist are supper welcoming and it becomes such a close knit community. The moment I stepped on campus I felt a sense of security and safety. They also have so many educational options and opportunities such as great internship and study abroad opportunities.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus and everyone is very friendly. The professors, for the most part, are very helpful."
Alum,5,"The campus is beautifully located along the Hudson River. The history of the campus is extremely and some of the Marist Brothers still teach. Academically, the college offers many different programs and continues to broaden the subjects covered."
Senior,5,As an incoming senior at Marist I can say that I'm very happy and sad that I'm going into my final year. Marist is an amazing college. I have loved every second of it.
Niche User,5,"Love it! Great campus, great people. I feel at home there, just would want more diversity. There is clearly a majority race."
Junior,5,"I like Marist College because I always feel safe, as well as always having a good time. I have met life long friends there, and I would recommend this school to many."
Junior,5,The first semester I struggled and I was top of my class in High school. College was a major change but my professors as well as advisors worked hard in order to allow me to succeed and they kept checking on me as well. I made great connections with professors that have paired me with tutors and it turned around after one semester. The school provides all the resources and have a great choice of clubs which was great to make connections especially with people in the same study field as me.
Freshman,5,"I live in the area and I transferred this year as a commuter student. Couldn’t be more happier so far. I wish it wasn’t so expensive, I would like to put more time into my studies and campus life but I need to work. Other than that, it’s great."
Alum,5,"Love everything about Marist. Beautiful campus located on the Hudson River. Class sizes are small, allowing each student to have individualized attention and promote their best selves."
Sophomore,5,"Marist College has given me some of my best friends and provided me with some amazing opportunities to advance both my personal life and career. The campus is beautiful and the professors, faculty, and staff are all incredibly welcoming and helpful. I am so happy that I chose to spend my 4 years of college at Marist."
Freshman,5,When I applied to college Marist was not my first choice. Ultimately I attended Marist over both Fordham and Villanova and I couldn’t be happier. There is a true sense of community.
Sophomore,5,"Marist College has been and continues to provide me with the college experience I always wanted for myself. Between the small class size, beautiful campus, and prime location its the perfect place for me. The Hudson River is one of my favorite places in the world thanks to Marist. I would not rather be anywhere else."
Niche User,5,"I love the opportunities that Marist college has for all of its students. they really care about the success of their students and want to see them grow into successful adults. Also, the campus and the view of the Hudson are breathtaking."
Sophomore,5,"One of the best things about Marist is that it sits on the most beautiful campus, and is still only 90 minutes away from NYC. As a Fashion Merchandising major and an advertising minor, I have yet to find a class or professor that I didn't enjoy in some way. I feel as though all my professors are dedicated to their students' success, and I love that! Classes are small (25-30 people at most) and it is a very collaborative environment. Students are expected and encouraged to be authentic and share their thoughts. The campus is wonderful and the classes are great!"
Freshman,5,"I love being a student at Marist. It is situated on the most beautiful campus. The class sizes are small, usually capped at 25 people. As a Biomedical Science major, the class sizes has been integral to my success here. I am able to voice questions without fear and have been able to form close working relationships with my professors. The professors are always willing to make time to help you if you are struggling with material. The proximity to the city is amazing, too. The school offers $25 Broadway tickets (transportation included) usually every two to three weekends. Just in my first year, I've seen Kinky Boots, Come from Away, The Book of Mormon, Dear Evan Hansen, The Rockettes, The Lion King, Chicago, and The Phantom of the Opera. I love it here!"
Sophomore,5,"Marist is the perfect medium-sized school located beautifully on the Hudson River. Marist has great classes, professors, and focuses on building your network to land you your dream job."
Sophomore,5,Marist has given me lifelong friends and extraordinary opportunities.  The small class sizes allows me to interact with my professors and cultivate worthwhile relationships.
Freshman,5,"Marist College is the full package between welcoming people, great academic opportunities, and plenty of extracurricular activities."
Sophomore,5,"Overall I have loved my time at Marist College.  I have met wonderful people and have had amazing professors.  My professors always have plenty of time to help me whenever I need it.  My first semester, I was struggling with a paper and my professor worked one on one with me for about a week until I felt comfortable with my finished product.  It may have been one of the most challenging papers I have ever written, but it was one of the most rewarding because my professor and I put in so much work."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the beautiful Hudson River campus! Theres nothing better than smiling at and talking with familiar faces in the context of this beautiful campus each day.
Sophomore,5,Marist College has a stunning campus that truly feels like home from the first step onto it. The students are so friendly and welcoming that it did not take long for me to adjust as a terrified freshman being away from home for the first time. Marist has offered me so many opportunities through community service and required fieldwork to verify my decision of wanting to become a teacher. The professors are wonderful and are always a quick email away outside of class. I have loved every semester so far and I can't wait to see what the second half of my college experience has in store.
Sophomore,5,My experience at Marist College has been extremely positive. I love the size of the classrooms because you really get to know your professors. The food is decent and there are plenty of options on campus for dining. The area around the school is not great but there are things to do on campus and you can get into Manhattan really easily.
Sophomore,5,"- professors are very well educated, always willing to help 
- sense of community, very friendly students
- beautiful campus, very well kept 
- food can be better
- dorms are amazing"
Freshman,5,"Coming to Marist was the best decision of my life. The community is truly like a family. There are enough people that you do not know everyone, but there is always a familiar face in the crowd. I met my best friends here and am truly receiving a top of the line education."
Sophomore,4,"Marist has done a great job ensuring students have time in the classroom for in person learning, all while ensuring the students who are online still are getting a strong education as well. No matter how you’re learning through Marist, you’ll get a great education."
Freshman,4,"Online learning is always kind of difficult because it is such a change. However, I think Marist has done a really good job with classes and COVID safety. For most of my classes, I have the class online once a week and in person once a week (the class is split in half). My professors set up a Zoom meeting like it's a livestream, so I feel like I'm sitting right there in class. I think incorporating that one in-person class has really helped to keep students motivated because classes aren't 100% online."
Sophomore,4,"Many of my online classes were for music courses, which you can imagine would be incredibly difficult to conduct on Zoom or over a video chat. However, all of my professors worked very efficiently with myself and my classmates. Despite having to make music as a group whilst online learning, my professors were very patient with us, and allowed a ton of time for practice. As much as everybody would prefer and enjoy an in person class more so (especially at such a wonderful place such as Marist), I can say with certainty that I absolutely got what I paid for out of the entirety of my online classes."
Freshman,4,My classes are blended synchronous so some classes are online while others are in person. The in-person classes are all very safe and the online classes all work well. Professors hold meetings over zoom but are still very accessible and helpful!
Freshman,4,"I have found it very easy to make friends here at Marist, even with the COVID precautions in place; the campus is very safe as a whole and everyone is following the guidelines. All of my professors are fantastic and are very reachable during their zoom office hours and during class. I love the area around here; the Walkway Across the Hudson is a fun place to go to as well as the many other great hiking places near by!"
Sophomore,4,"My journey with Marist College began in Florence, Italy, where I attended Lorenzo di' Medici as part of Marist's Freshman Florence Experience (FFE). My time in Italy was amazing. I was able to travel, be submerged in another culture, make amazing friends, and learn valuable life lessons, both in life and in the classroom. Since coming to Marist's New York campus as a sophomore, my love for the school has only grown. My professors are amazing, everyone is incredibly friendly, there's always something to do, and the view is incredible!"
Sophomore,4,"Currently, I am taking several hybrid classes and one online class. My hybrid classes are held online via Zoom or WebEx, with half of us online and half of us in the classroom. My online class is a mix of short videos, readings, and powerpoints. All of my professors have been doing their best to adapt to the current circumstances."
Sophomore,4,"I have had nothing but the best experience at Marist. I am a commuter and worried that I would not feel included as a student, but that’s not the case. Marist offers so many fun activities and ways to keep us busy. I feel like I am getting such a good education."
Sophomore,4,It was a surprisingly smooth transition to learning online and Marist ensures the needs of every student are met.
Sophomore,4,"I had loved my time at Marist, until we went online. While professors were extremely helpful with online learning, they were encouraged by academic chairs to not have synchronous classes via zoom or webex. This made it extremely difficult to try to learn and did not work well for me. This upcoming year there is a plan to maintain synchronous learning assuming online is necessary, and I am hoping to find this method better."
Junior,4,"I have nit taken any courses online, however.. All the staff members are always just one email away and making sure they answer in real time."
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful and you can tell the money you are paying is going towards the school and activities they present. I do feel the registrar office and financial aid office could get some help. I have found going to either office for help doesn't do much unless you are consistently on top of them.
Junior,4,"I personally love Marist, primarily because I met my best friends there. One of the main reasons why I chose Marist was because of there abroad programs. I got to take full advantage of that by being apart of there Freshman Florence Experience my freshman year. My transition from Florence back to the main campus was a bit rocky, but once I started to fully join the Marist community I found myself having the time of my life!"
Freshman,4,"I love Marist College. The academics are very good, and the quality of education is proficient. The beautiful campus and constant renovations make the experience 10x better, and every staff member in the College is always smiling. The surrounding area of Poughkeepsie, yearly cost, and the party scene are not the best, but Marist College makes up for it with their academics and constant efforts of improving themselves."
Niche User,4,"I had taken a tour there whilst visiting, the campus was gorgeous, the environment seemed very friendly, and I loved that they were constantly making changes to the campus and outside of it to make it even more beneficial for the students"
Sophomore,4,"Marist is great if you want a small school without much greek life, but still a prevalent party scene if you are into that. Truly you can't beat the view, and for a  small school, the food is not that bad. The dorms are actually quite nice, there is even a bigger option, Midrise, for freshmen."
Freshman,4,"If you want to be involved there are so many opportunities. Great place to meet new people, create new memories, and ready yourself for the real world."
Sophomore,4,"The college is pretty great. There is a wide range of specific majors, concentrations, and minors. The teachers and staff are great, very friendly, always invested in the students' needs and interests. The students are friendly as well. Everyone treats everyone else like family. The students are mostly white middle-class Americans, but the school is increasingly becoming more diverse each year. whether the new students are colored, poor, or foreign, they are accepted as part of the community and are not discriminated against. Marist takes bullying, discrimination, and type of violence or threats on or off-campus very seriously. It is a safe and peaceful environment. I am a commuter so I don't know much about the dorms, but the food, celebrations, activities, and clubs on or off-campus are always great."
Freshman,4,I love the campus. It's insanely beautiful; I even have a view of the Hudson River from my dorm room as a freshman.
Junior,4,As a whole I like Marist. However I think the school lacks student engagement at times. The small classes makes it really easy to make connections with peers and professors. I would like to see more diversity on campus.
Junior,4,"Marist treats the land well, they are constantly putting out fresh flowers, mowing the lawn, and creating different areas on the campus that students can gather in. They just finished building new student housing that looks like ""Harry Potter"" land, and are continuously updating the academic facilities in order to provide students like me with the best educational opportunities. I would change the freshman roommate survey. The survey is about ten questions long and asks very superficial questions like ""what time would you like to go to be on weekdays?"" All of my friends who are going to other schools took very extensive surveys that asked them questions about religion, sex, the LGBTQ+ community, along with when they like to go to bed and they got placed with great roommates who they were actually compatible with. Marist has a pretty big transfer rate, and I strongly believe that with the alteration of this survey the transfer rate of first semester freshman will decrease immensely."
Sophomore,4,It is a college where it can feel fake but if you are real can find others with the same mindset. The snow and cold are bad for first years.
Sophomore,4,"Marist College has a very positive atmosphere and professors who really care. The school always has events for students to have fun at while also giving them plenty areas and resources for studying. There’s always something to 
do whether it’s a weekday or weekend. I felt very welcomed and comfortable at this college from the second I moved in as a freshman. The school would not be so great without the amazing people there. All the students and faculty are extremely friendly and everyone’s willing to help one another. If anyone is on the fence about Marist College I can ensure you it is a great place to spend the next four years."
Freshman,4,"So far, Marist has been great. Most professors are supportive, it's easy to make a friend or two, and the campus is beautiful."
Freshman,4,"Marist offers several interesting programs, classes and extracurricular activities.  Regardless of your interests or major, I can guarentee you will find something at Marist that appeals to you.  Unlike many other colleges I've seen, these options aren't just reserved for upperclassmen.  For example, I was given the opportunity to study abroad in Italy for my freshman year, and I found the experience to be incredibly enriching and I highly reccommend it!"
Freshman,4,"It's a beautiful campus on the Hudson, though a bit sectioned off from anything much to do. Need a car or Uber to get anywhere to do anything really. Professors are great and really make time for students, housing is nice."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the academics here and classroom setting. Knowing that my professors know my name and I am not just a number in a lecture hall is really comforting. It allows me to develop relationships with my professors that will benefit me once I leave Marist and enter the working environment. In addition, students at Marist are given amazing opportunities for internships, as well as study abroad."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy my experience at Marist. The classes are a great size, the professors are great, the campus is beautiful, and the people are very nice. I only have a few suggestions for how Marist could improve. Better food on campus, more academic opportunities, and better internship opportunities. Other than that, it is a great school full of genuinely kind and caring people and the staff is amazing and very nice."
Freshman,4,"I really like the people at Marist, they are inclusive and friendly and overall just nice people. I think Marist has a lot of opportunities if you are willing to seek them out and a lot of resources to help people academically. I think diversity could be improved, and I know that is a hard thing to do and they are working on it, but I think working on expanding their international students wold also be good. The location is a little hard, but the on campus safety is very reliable and I have never had any issues or felt like I was in danger. I have had a great experience with the housing and I would rave about it to prospective students as well. I am a part of Marist Ambassadors, which is a group that talks to prospective students, gives tours, and does shadow days, and it is a really great program if you like the school."
Sophomore,4,I love the campus at Marist! The sunsets and river views are beautiful especially in the spring when you can do your work outside on the campus green. I love my professors within my major. They are committed their students and make sure each one knows that they are more than just a number or seat filled in a classroom.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Marist College has been extremely positive. The college brings a sense of community throughout the dorms and the classrooms. There ample learning opportunities in the classroom but students are also encouraged to attend lectures and gain career experience off campus like in New York City. From sporting games, to outdoor activities and of course college parties, there is a lot for the students to also look forward to on the weekend."
Junior,4,"I am halfway through my third year at Marist, and I am very content with my college education thus far. My journey at Marist began in Florence, Italy, where I spent my entire freshman year. The opportunity to study abroad as a freshman was one I could not pass up. In addition, I was drawn to Marist's highly popular communication program and the stunning campus overlooking the Hudson River.

Students must not forget that no college is perfect; every school has its pros and cons. There have been professors at Marist that have not presented material in a particularly interesting way. The food in the dining hall becomes repetitive. And the school lacks the diversity I wanted. However, the good at Marist certainly outweighs the bad. Marist has led me to some incredible internships, lifelong friendships, and meaningful connections with professors. During my initial visit at Marist, I felt comfortable and welcomed. To me, that spoke volumes and eventually pushed me to choose Marist."
Senior,4,"I have been here for a year and have had a good experience so far, the campus is beautiful and the school is well-connected and offers many great opportunities to students. I can't think of a better school where I could be studying what I am and getting the experience that I am."
Senior,4,The campus is beautiful. All of the buildings are up to date. The housing is very accommodating and comfortable. There is a lot of student life and involvement whether you are into the Division 1 athletics or greek life. There are lots of opportunities made accessible to students for internships and recruiters hold the school in high regards. I would recommend the school to any family or friends. Go Red Foxes!
Senior,4,"Marist College offers amazing abroad programs. They have options that suit everyone's personal and academic interests and work closely with their students to ensure everything goes smoothly. 
Marist could do a better job helping helping students gain access to their community outside of the college campus. For example, there are internship opportunities available that can be accessed by train, but transportation to the train station from the college campus can be very difficult for students who don't have a car."
Alum,4,"Great professors and study abroad opportunities. I was a transfer student, and a common feeling among many transfers seemed to be difficulty adjusting and integrating at Marist. I think this was in large part being placed in housing five miles from campus. A huge part of living on campus is the convenience, so I am happy to see that the school seems to have addressed this for transfer students by expanding their on-campus housing."
Sophomore,4,I like the close community at Marist college. There are many clubs and organizations to join to make you feel like you're apart of something and giving back to the school. I made some of my best friends at Marist who I know I'll be friends with forever.
Junior,4,"I give it a 4 because I do love this school overall. However, it is way too expensive and they make us take courses that have nothing to do with our major only because they want to get money out of you. On the plus side, there is a lot to get involved in, great night life, and they are updating the campus so things are becoming brand spanking new."
Junior,4,I love Marist. Only thing is prepare yourself to live in an enviorment filled with rich preppy kids.
Freshman,4,"The campus is really beautiful and many renovations are being made to the campus to keep it up to date. Class sized are small, which is really nice, and the teachers really care about you as a person and a student. Overall I have loved my experience at Marist and I look forward to finishing my time there."
Freshman,4,"Great school. Ive really found my group of people here. You pretty much need a fake as an underclassmen if you want to go out. The academics are manageable if you stay on top of it. Great career connections, especially being so close to the city."
Senior,4,"Marist is a good return on investment for certain majors but not all. Their connections to the workforce in those majors are strong and if you find the right people, you can get the job you want or something similar."
Junior,4,My experience with Marist has been overall good and very beneficial. I had experienced new things by being introduced to new people and a life that I was not used to before.
Sophomore,4,"Marist college has an absolutely amazing fashion program, which is intensive and truly prepares its students for the real world. It is highly competitive and the classes are highly rigourous. The professors are mixed. The majority of full time professors are very knowledgeable and interesting, however many of the adjunct proffessors arent really the best. In terms of social climate theres really not much to do at Marist, if you're not into going out to the bars its hard to find something to do. Parties are nearly non existant, as marist is a bar school so a fake ID is a MUST. Despite being a D1 school, people dont really go all out for sporting events other than maybe 1 or 2 big basketball and football games. The food in the dining hall is pretty bland and very processed however, most housing after freshman year does come equipped with a kitchen so you can make your own meals."
Junior,4,"I am a Fashion Merchandising major and I have really enjoyed all of my fashion classes and professors. All of the professors have worked in the fashion industry for some time, therefore, they are are able to give me great advice. Also, it truly is a beautiful campus - walking to and from class is not so bad when you have a view of the Hudson River."
Freshman,4,I wish that there was more to do on the weekends other than bars. If you can't get into a bar then it feels like you can't do much at all. I love the campus and the professors. All the classes I have taken have been great! I definitely recommend Marist to people who want a small-medium sized school.
Freshman,4,"I am a current freshman here at Marist and I am really enjoying it. My classes are good, teachers are accessible and there is always lots of stuff to do on campus. While some groups can me a little closed as a whole its a friendly school. also, free printing which means the world to me now. "
College Sophomore,4,I really have enjoyed my time at Marist. I feel that Marist really does set students up for success upon graduation.
College Sophomore,4,My school offers fantastic job/internship opportunities that do not compare to other schools. Marist is so much farther ahead than other schools in this area.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing is fantastic. While it may be much more expensive than living off-campus, it is worth it. The only issue is the distance between housing for upperclassmen and academic buildings."
College Sophomore,4,I feel that my college is preparing me for the real world much better than other schools. I have enjoyed my time in college and learned valuable skills and lessons.
College Junior,4,"The courses and the professors have been mostly good. Because of the liberal arts requirement, there is a wide variety of courses to choose from. The class sizes are usually small, which I enjoy because it allows the professors to know their students on a more personal level."
College Junior,4,"I feel safe on the campus. There have been instances and threats on the campus in the past, but they have been quickly addressed by those in charge and the nearby police."
College Junior,4,"The housing process is based on a points system. Points are earned by joining activities and programs on campus, which encourage students to participate so that they have a better chance of choosing the housing of their choice in the future. There are several housing options and styles to choose from, which is very convenient. The cost is pricey, however. Meal plans are pricey too."
College Junior,4,"The students are actively involved in sports and attending sporting events. It is evident that the students truly support the sports teams, which is encouraging to see. The athletic facilities are state of the art and are available to those who do not belong to a varsity team. Overall, this area of the school is great!"
College Junior,4,"I enjoy my school because it easily helps students find their sense of belonging there. I have found my sense of belonging by joining a few of the countless clubs that my school offers. I participate in the Gospel Choir, the Singers Choir, Campus Ministry, and an art club called Red Ink. In addition, I like that my school is a liberal arts college. Because of this, I am able to explore several other fields while exploring the one I currently major in. I believe a liberal arts background is important because it expands one's knowledge in various topics, which is essential in the multi-faceted world we live in today."
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is great because you get the opportunity to make friends with residents in your own hall or residents in the other halls. The campus is very small, which makes communicating a lot easier and makes it a non-hassle to travel from dorm to dorm"
College Sophomore,4,Marist College has some of the friendly people attending.
College Junior,4,We have some D1 sports. Games are attended by a fair amount of students.
College Sophomore,4,The school does engage students with internships and job prospects around the area and outside of that area
Freshman,2,"Do not go here. Marist offered me a lot of financial aid at the last minute just so that they could get money from me. The food is terrible and the workers do not care about the students, sometimes I didn't even get my food because they forgot. Me and my roommate have been stuck in our room starving and depressed for 2 months. They don't even clean our bathrooms, when they promised they would be cleaned 4 times a day due to Covid-19. Its so far of a walk just to get decent food that you feel sick after. Advisors here are non existent and aren't even trained to do their job. Marist also closed the campus so that parents could not come to see us because they would see how bad our living conditions are here but they let random tours go on with a bunch of outside people. Marist also wont let us do any sports while a bunch of other schools have football. I am an outgoing person and its 10 weeks into school and my only friend is my roommate."
Junior,2,The experience for commuters is not great. I live 35 minutes away and Marist makes it very difficult to get work done on campus. In the past year the college has removed all the printers from the library and plans on moving them into the dorms common areas. Before you could just walk into the library and print whenever you needed to. Now you have to make an appointment on the Marist app and book an appointment to use a printer in the Donnelly computer lab. This is a prime example of fixing something that is not broke.
Sophomore,2,"When we had to abruptly go online for the 2020 spring semester, professors were encouraged to assign work, and not hold lectures. This made it extremely difficult and I found most of my assignments were not helping me learn they were simply a grade."
Sophomore,2,"My decision to go to Marist College was probably one of the worst decisions I have made in my nineteen years of life.  My experience at Marist is not one I will cherish, or hope to remember."
Sophomore,2,"Marist is not what it seems. They are excellent at drawing people in, but no one tells you the honest truth. Transfers beware: It's only a good school if you come in freshman year or know people before coming. From the horrible social scene to the terrible professors, this college is basically high school part 2. Most people are from New York and New Jersey, and if you don't conform and dress in leggings everyday, you won't make friends. These students are cliquey as hell. If you don't like your roommate/s or anyone in your dorm, you're screwed. The dorms are really nice. Weekends are totally dead and there is NOTHING to do on this campus. The clubs suck and the food is average. If getting drunk at a disgusting Poughkeepsie bar is your thing, then you'll have a good time. If wearing black leggings and acting like a highschooler is your thing, you'll like it. Overall, this place makes me depressed and I'm applying to transfer. So long, Marist."
Freshman,2,"I first heard of Marist when a student in the grade above me decided to enroll here. My mom pushed me to see what they had to offer, since I had no idea it existed. When I first arrived on campus, I fell in love with it. The tour gave a good overview on what Marist is like.  But it was only the superficial layer. I was so excited to call myself a Red Fox and thought I'd have the best years of my life here, but that was a fantasy. 
From being here a bit over a month, I cannot picture myself graduating here. Marist is an extension of high school for many students, since not many people know of it and therefore there are many LI and local kids who already know each other. It's very cliquey in the respect that the fashion girls, along with the D1 teams, all walk together in a herd. This is contrary to what they say on tours, ""We're all a family!!""  The girls are very concerned about their looks. Also all anyone wants to do is go to the bars, which is so expensive and gets boring."
Freshman,2,"I'm a freshmen with a fashion merchandising major, I'm someone who likes to travel, explore and down to do whatever but here I've never felt so restricted in my life. I thought being closer to the city would mean being there all the time when really the train ride feels like forever so it makes me second guess going down. The town Marist is in is extremely run down and there's really nothing to do unless you have a car. The people on campus are always in cliques I've never seen a big group of people all hangout together. There's also no common area on this campus so I feel as though it's extremely hard to meet people especially because it is a bar school. People here are snobby and one of the main reasons why I applied early decision was because I thought it was a warm welcoming community. There's also rarely ever house parties."
College Sophomore,2,"There's really nothing unique about this school.  No one knows what it is, and they like to think they're a better school than they are."
College Sophomore,2,"Marist is a very polarizing school. If you were popular in high school you will fit right in here. If you exclusively wear Vineyard Vines you will fit in here. If your family is rich you will fit in here. If you are Christian you will fit in here. If you like high school you will like Marist. However, if you weren't really about high school and have some sense of individuality you will not fit in."
College Sophomore,2,"Freshmen dorms are tiny. Bathrooms are usually destroyed or covered in puke. Securities guards are nearly omnipresent. They like to give you a hard time and go through your things. However, if you brown nose the guards you could walk in without even presenting an id."
College Sophomore,2,Frats throw some parties. Sororities post on insta.
College Freshman,2,Sometimes there are frat parties on the weekends.. but those are rare and weather dependent. Bar school.
College Freshman,2,Very limited diversity on campus. Majority of students come from similar socioeconomic backgrounds. Handful of international students who typically only interact with each-other.
College Freshman,2,"Typical freshman dorms. Not particularly clean or spacious but livable. 

The freshman dorms in a nut-shell:

Champ: large amount of partiers, athletes, socialites/preps...LOUD but fun. There is not a good sense of community. Connected to dining hall and student center, which is great during the winter. 

Leo: chill/friendly people, moderate level of partying, good sense of community--people make friends easily here, a good place if you're looking for that happy medium. 

Sheahan: Less outgoing people who form small friend groups and stick with that friend group for the whole year...There is a stigma that comes with living in Sheahan but you can break that stereotype so long as you are not a total introvert who refuses to socialize. Close to rec center/gym but far from classes and dining hall.

Marian: People who live here are generally pretty friendly and form strong friendships with other people in the building. Triple rooms. Very quiet in comparison to other dorms, almost as quiet as Sheahan. Closest to academic buildings and library....(but not by much).

Priority point system is obnoxious and ruins friendships...would prefer a lottery system. Housing is not guaranteed all 4 years which is also a concern."
College Sophomore,2,We have a mostly white campus; there isn't much diversity except with athletes and international students.
College Freshman,2,"This school is extremely cliquey and feels just like high school. It's ridiculous how immature some of these kids are and the drama that happens. I graduated high school and went through four years of that bull, I don't want to go through that in college."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life here is pretty low-key, not everyone's a part of it and so if you're not Greek you're not seen as an outcast."
College Junior,2,"Marist is such a small school Greek life isn't really necessary to meet people, but is available if someone really wants to rush."
College Freshman,2,"Marist is an ok environment, but it certainly isn't all that it is hyped up to be. The campus first and foremost is absolutely beautiful, one that is second to none.  In terms of the people here, they couldn't be nicer. The professors however, are very hit or miss to say the least. Many of the full time professors are very well qualified and do a great job, but the adjuncts are for the most part very mediocre, even bad.  The food is average.  Sodexo (the food company) does a decent job, but it is sooooo repetitive and the staff isn't very friendly.  In terms of classes, I have found that they are easier than my high school's classes, but do require A LOT more work if you want to do well.  The freshman dorms aren't bad, laundry can be a pain in the neck sometimes especially considering half the washers are usually broken.  The campus is small which is a benefit because it doesn't really take more than 10 minutes to get to any place on campus, unless you are living in the upperclassmen housing across Rt. 9. Off campus food is pretty good. There's a wide range of places very close by.  Athletics are not very well attended, which is something that kind of upsets me, yet it's understandable why people don't support the teams, as most of them are mediocre at best.  The last thing I will comment on is the party scene. Not sure how this school got an 'A' for this category. The parties are awful. Marist is a huge bar school, so the majority of partying happens at local bars.  Not only to these bars get packed to the brim with people, they can be very expensive. Going out more than once a week can really take a toll on your wallet. I'm honestly filling out transfer applications and potentially considering leave Marist and attending another institution in the Fall of 2016, because Marist just isn't quite what I thought it would be..."
College Freshman,2,"A classic example of an institution run on incompetence and indifference. Most of the clubs on campus are pretty bad, and some have been dropped altogether due to lack of interest. Teachers and professors are very friendly, and I've never had any real problems with any of my classes, which is good. The student body is pretty un-diverse, however. Mostly preppy, overly-happy, rich white kids who spend most of their times out at parties. I'm not much of a partier, so I've ended up spending a majority of my time here on my own. The energy from most of my roommates and dorm neighbors hasn't been the best either. Many kids love listening to their music way too loud, and even more don't seem to have much respect for anyone's personal space or privacy. Unless you're a big time athlete or a theater kid, Marian Hall (which is the dorm I live in) will definitely take you out of your comfort zone. The overall energy in the building is overly loud and extremely flamboyant. Looking back, I think I picked this school just because many of my family members from the past came here, and said they enjoyed it. I'm sorry, but I'm just not seeing anything that outstanding here. I wish I had put more time, care, and thought into picking the college I'd be attending for the next four years of my life. Oh well, everybody makes a mistake that costs them every now and then. The real downside this time, though, is that this mistake is gonna cost me for the next 20-30 years of my finances."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Don't let a pretty campus fool you, Admissions just shows you the nice parts. Tuition keeps rising to ridiculous rates yet the mediocre professors get more jaded and bored every year. Marist only cares about enticing future students while current ones (especially commuters!) are ignored, e.g.: parking gets more strict every year to accommodate new buildings. They keep accepting more freshmen, downplaying the fact that housing is NOT guaranteed after the second year. Administrative offices are slow, bloated, and bureaucratic. Some buildings (Gartland, Donnelly, Dyson) badly show their age. Sodexo food is very hit-or-miss and badly overpriced ($9 lunches are common), but of course, they bring out the good stuff on parents' weekend. Poughkeepsie is a miserable, crime-ridden ""city."" Most students go out to bars, school clubs stink because people are only there to get housing ""priority points."""
College Freshman,2,"Pretty terrible...i basically live on grilled cheese, pizza, soup, salad and pasta.  The meat/protein options are pretty gross, and I (and many friends) have gotten food poisoning on multiple occasions.  Recommend going to the Caberet when you can, but it can get expensive on the freshman meal plan...."
College Freshman,2,"Mostly white, upper/upper-middle class females. They are usually stuck up and act like ""rich kids"""
College Sophomore,2,The people here are NOT fun.
College Freshman,2,"I am currently a freshmen and I will start off by saying that your freshmen year, it is unlikely you will have any issues with housing what so ever.  After freshmen year you have to consider priority points for housing, which is a real pain.  Priority points are earned through doing various things throughout the year and are also derived from your GPA.  Although I am in a decent position for housing, for the money I pay to go there good on campus housing should be assured for all four years if you want it."
College Freshman,2,"Personally I would never join a frat here.  Chapter houses are very run down and not nice, certainly a far cry form the greek homes at other universities.  They pretty much serve the purpose of giving underclassmen a place to drink and that is all."
College Freshman,2,"Very little diversity. If you're not preppy or from long island, you will not find your group of friends immediately as others do. It may take a week or two to find people who you click with. More minorities are needed as well as people of different economic levels and different sexual orientations."
College Freshman,2,"Don't do it if you don't have to, unless your in a sorority, frat or on a sports team and decide to live in that house."
College Junior,2,Getting off campus is pretty difficult because the town is sketchy… even during the daytime.  But if you go on the school mall trips on the weekends it isn't so bad.  And the hiking down in Beacon is fun and the foliage is beautiful.
College Freshman,2,The greek life is not popular since we only have a few soroities and frats
College Freshman,2,Greek life is not big on campus at all. People definitely participate in it but its not at all necessary. They're mostly just for networking and community service. Most of the frats have their own house and throw parties on the weekend which are fun but thats really the only way greeks and non greeks get involved with each other
College Sophomore,2,"The meal plans are good and the little cafes are great, but the dining hall food is terrible. I would suggest skipping the dining hall food and using the little cafes around campus."
College Sophomore,2,The area is not the safest
College Senior,2,"This college is so pricey that diversity is hard to find, but it is not like they seem to be making much of an effort."
College Sophomore,2,"We can only walk to three places that are worth mentioning: starbucks, applebees, and a pizza place.  We need more of a real ""town"" area.  It will be better when I'm not a freshman and have access to a car."
College Freshman,2,Financial aid package is later than any other school I applied to.  Other school need answers before Marist's package was even available.
College Student,2,"There is only 2 or 3 different places to eat at other than the dining hall. There are multiple pizza places but how much pizza could you eat and a quiznos and mcdonalds, but they are a decent walk. During the winter months the mcdonalds and quiznos are to far to walk to in the freezing cold."
College Student,2,"The house parties are just scams for your money and to have a decent time regularly you will need a fake id.  The bars are fun in the beginning but since there is literally no alternatives, they become super repetitive and very expensive, almost to the point where its not even worth going out anymore and it is hard to pre game in the dorms without getting in trouble."
College Student,2,They are way too strict for college. If you get caught drinking in the dorm they treat you like you just did something that is actually a legit crime. The staff has the expectation for some odd reason that none of us should ever drink until we are 21 and make it clear. Compared to other schools I have visited the rules here are way over board. We are adults but we get treated like we can't handle ourselves.
College Student,2,You need a car to do anything off campus but there are taxis that everybody uses when we go out. Taxis get expensive though.
College Student,2,Usually fun but it gets repetitive and boring after awhile. Every night out includes going to a bar. No good campus parties because of security.
College Student,2,Everybody is pretty much the same at Marist.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is not what defines your social life at Marist College at all.  Unlike so many other schools, it is completely unnecessary to join a fraternity or sorority (although they do exist) in order to meet friends and partake in social events.  Only a small percentage of the student population is Greek."
College Sophomore,2,Varsity sports do not play a big role at Marist.
College Freshman,2,There's nothing to do in Poughkeepsie except a lame mall. Not to mention it's a bad are with lots of crime
College Freshman,2,same thing every day and it closes at 9pm. Late night snacks will be exensive
College Freshman,2,"As I said before, drinking, especially underclassman, is somewhat of an issue."
College Freshman,2,"I live in the biggest freshmen dorm on campus, and I don't like it. Some people like it because it's known for being loud and rowdy; plus it is connected to the dining hall. I don't like a lot of noise, especially at night. Also, I feel like the housing process should've been more comprehensive."
College Freshman,2,"Because I am a student of color, I wish there were black sororities on campus for me & my peers to join."
College Junior,2,"I'm a city girl so I'm used to being able to hop a train, trolley, or bus and finding tons of places to have a good time. Here, not so much. There are things to do on/off campus so you are not bored, but I would not say there is much of a nightlife. You have your bars/clubs (all 21+), but they are nothing special. I haven't been to any house parties due to so many mixed reviews about them. Explore a bit and see what works for you."
College Sophomore,2,"If you don't enjoy school or you're not the sharpest knife in the drawer, you will enjoy your time/do well here. If you like being intellectually stimulated, this is not the place for you. "
College Sophomore,2,"Academically speaking, the school is lacking. There are some campus activities every so often, maybe once or twice a semester. Library is nice, campus green is very lovely, Freshman housing is awful. No unique opportunities."
College Junior,2,"As far as social rules, there are many for Marist. Because it is a private institution they can make up whatever rules they deem appropriate. If you get caught drinking in a dorm room, of course you get in trouble. But, if you are not drinking and are just ""in the presence of alcohol"", an innocent bystander staying in for the night in your PJs while everyone else goes out, you get in trouble. They get a little carried away with the dorm room Security checkpoints. For instance, they may randomly search your bag. If a friend that is visiting you bring a bottle of alcohol they are kicked off campus and not allowed to return until a specified time, regardless of how far they traveled.
Overall, they are strict on campus with policies and rules."
College Freshman,2,There are not very many choices for transportation. On the weekends the college supplies a bus that brings students to the nearby mall for $1. There are also zip cars that students can rent for their desired period of time but the cost can become expensive depending on the amount of time a student rents it. Other than that there aren't really other forms of transportation that the campus supplies. Many students need to call cabs in order to get places unless the student has a car of their own. Students are allowed to have a car on campus after their freshmen year as long as they are registered to the school and buy a parking pass
College Junior,2,"There are only a handful of frats and sororities on campus. The frats all live in random houses throughout Poughkeepsie and have pretty fun parties almost every weekend. The sororities are not allowed to live in a house together so they are more focused on community service and friendships within the sorority. I do know that they are very time consuming, for my close friends joined but then quit do to the commitment."
College Sophomore,2,"Mainly White Students – As far as ethnic background, I would say the campus is not that diverse. You can find international students, black students, etc. if you look, but it's not like they are around every corner. Most of the students are white and have more of a privileged background, which is understandable considering the cost of attendence, but it's not all like that. Plenty of us are in  the financial aid's office once a month or working around campus. No problems with acceptance as long as you are open-minded. Your personality and your interests is the key."
College Junior,2,"Taxis Are Only Option, but Expensive – Since Marist is mainly a bar school, taxis are the main form of transportation for going out. They can become expensive though. Right now it is $3 each way (depending on the taxi sometimes). So if you go out to one bar, it's $6 round trip. If you decide to bar hop to another, that's another $3. Sometimes people who have cars will drive but you need a DD."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Don't Live Off Campus. Off campus housing is not safe... most people I know had their houses broken into. Most students live on campus because of this PLUS the on campus housing is great. Most of it is brand new. The freshmen dorms suck, but it's like that everywhere. Upperclassmen housing is amazing."

College Junior,2,All of the sports teams are terrible. people go to very few games
Freshman,1,They are a joke and professors just leave you in the zoom waiting rooms. Marist decided to randomly make us do Saturday classes to force students not to leave campus. You don’t learn as much online. It is a joke.
Freshman,1,"All I can say is STAY AWAY FROM MARIST! This school is an absolute joke. I know so many people who are transferring out (including myself). This school offers very little academic support, the sports are nonexistent, and the food is horrible. Not only that the school is super cliquey. I’m usually super outgoing but I feel so left out and am lacking friends at this school. The school is in the middle of Poughkeepsie and lacks security. Advisors are not properly trained and have no clue how to do their jobs. The school has little to no school spirit and there is nothing to do on campus. Please do your self a favor and don’t bother applying to Marist."
Freshman,1,"Terrible, theres no academic support and professors only show up when they feel like it. Theres Saturday classes so you only get one day off a week. One of my professors said that Marist didn't even give teachers their contracts till the first day so half of them don't even know if they work here. Faculty only answer their emails during the week (if they feel like it) and you cannot get any help on the weekends."
Junior,1,"The Tech Team at Marist loves to make the wifi worse every year. They are constantly adding security methods making it increasingly difficult to sign into the wifi, making it slower and less reliable. Yes security is good but at this point I believe it is over kill. The Tech team should focus on less on security and more on reliability at this point. The wifi is always going out and when it comes back on it takes forever for you to sign back into your accounts. To get back onto iLearn (Marists online Classroom), first you have to connect to the schools set up wifi. This wifi allows you navigate Marist home page only. On this page you have to download a file that allows you to use the main wifi. After this is installed you can connect to the main wifi. You can the navigate your way to iLearn and sign in using your school credentials, after you sign in you will then have to complete a two factor authentication. Finally, after all this, you will be able to continue your online work."
Junior,1,"This was the most heavily marketed school i have ever been too. They try to sell you on the closeness to the city and the campus. Yes, the campus is pretty. However, what are you going to do every weekend? Sit on the grass and stare at it? There is nothing ever going on, if you want the college party experience stay away.. Kids aren't that happy here and its obvious, its extremely extremely repetitive and the weekends are exactly the same. Very mediocre professors for the price and the career services brings in below average companies and puts zero effort in to helping students. Without a doubt would not attend if I had to do it all over again."
Alum,1,"Prospective students beware! Don't be fooled by the charming campus when you visit. It’s small & gets oppressive quickly. Poughkeepsie’s a slum. Most students don't have cars and your options on a weekend are: sitting around a cramped dorm room, eating overpriced snacks from the only open cafe, studying (might as well), taking a cab to a bad Poughkeepsie bar full of creepy old local dudes (IF you can get a fake ID), drinking at a terrible house party if there is one. If you're from the tristate and enjoy Greek life, watching sports, drinking, and being generic, then go here. Forget about arts & culture. I transferred and left behind a group of disenchanted friends who wish they left. OH, and no one knows what or where Marist is, as much as they’ll try to convince you otherwise. Pick a school in a better place (Boston, Montreal, or Europe even). Stay away from myopic small schools like Marist – you can do better!"
College Sophomore,1,"This school has a legitimate drinking problem.  If you don't drink, you will feel left out because there is nothing else to do.  Administration at Marist does not seem to be concerned with the volume of students that regularly get drunk on and off campus, although they'll act like they don't tolerate it."
College Sophomore,1,"Its the worst. Why? Ill tell you.

To start the gym, is so old almost none of the machines work and theres a huge crack in the building (Mcann center) that has compromised the safety of the building. Sports teams are overworked and always lose (besides swimming & womens bball). 

The games are bad, really bad. Like nobody goes probably because nobody even knows about them."
College Sophomore,1,This question was repeated. This question was repeated.
College Sophomore,1,I hope you like grimly and dimly lit bars with really loud pop music blaring. 100% need a Fake ID if you want to participate in the party scene. 95% of the nightlife is going to bars.
College Sophomore,1,99.9% of students are rich white kids. Probably 75% of students are Christian in some capacity.
College Sophomore,1,"I mean everyone drinks in college but in my experience, as someone who drank before college, people go way too far. Routinely people are a mess and way too drunk for their own good. Few handle their alcohol well. Some smoke weed and are good about it. Any harder drugs are rarely come by and those you use them do not practice harm reduction."
College Senior,1,"The greek life on campus throw parties, hold bake sales at least once a month out of obligation, and act like they care about the community."
College Freshman,1,"I hate marist because the school is filled with un-cultured white kids who think they are spoiled and rich because they can buy generic name brands. All the girls are essentially the same as one another and the boys are all douche bags who aren't as hot as they think they are. Vineyard vines and sperries is all you see around here. All the fashion majors think they are couture for wearing juicy, Michael Kors, Coach, etc... Poughkeepsie sucks as well. The bars are so bad, don't take song requests and play top 100 artists like Justin Bieber. The frats are irrelevant. This school is not lit at all yet everyone thinks they are so cool."
College Freshman,1,No one goes into Poughkeepsie. Although I did hear that the little town that Vassar is in is nice.
College Freshman,1,"Almost none, eliminating chances to bring diversity to campus."
College Senior,1,There is no Greek Life that I am aware of.
College Student,1,Once november rolls around you will not see warm weather until the week before finals.  Due to being on the Hudson River this school is much colder than most areas within a few hours. I personally love winter and when I came here and had to walk .75 miles to every class in 5 degree weather almost every day for 6 months it was so miserable.  It was 30 degrees for a few weeks in the middle of april. It snows a ton and when this happens there is literally nothing to do.
College Student,1,If you are looking for greek life. Marist is not the school to go to. There is barely any frats and the sororities do not follow the rules.
College Student,1,There is no where to go off campus. It definitely not the safest thing to do because poughkeepsie is not a great area at all.

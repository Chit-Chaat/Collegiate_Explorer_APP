Sophomore,5,Even with being online for the past semester is went very well. They offered one on one even with the online experience. They did not neglect you if you needed help with anything educational or if you had questions for any other office in the school.
Junior,5,"It is a great university, I love it there. The professors are really understanding and they love to help students. Personally all of my professors have been great. Also, the staff at the wellness center is amazing and I couldn’t have done it without them."
Graduate Student,5,"Online learning was great, there was a good interaction between student and teachers. Despite being online, we were able to learn the material in ample time"
Graduate Student,5,"While I joined as an international student, the environment felt like home. Being a student who live on campus, I enjoyed and learnt a low. I am grateful for the experience at Rutgers, forever grateful for the professors."
Freshman,5,It was okay but I rather having classes with the teachers like one on one but dude to cov-19 it was impossible for us.
Freshman,5,It was an amazing experience I got to have many friends and teachers. The campus was small so everyone knew each other and we had fun studying and preparing for our tests
Junior,5,"At first I was worried when I had to finish out my courses online because the course work is not easy.  Fortunately, I quickly got the hang of the online classes and they were not that bad.  The professors work very hard to insure everything for the course is clear and coherent."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Rutgers University!  The people are very diverse and welcoming I felt right at home there.  Such a great environment for learning, achieving goals and making new friends.  I was expecting hard work and it definitely is not easy but as long as you try your hardest you should do great. I can not wait to return to campus because it is honestly an amazing college.  This university offers a lot of activities, events and even free stuff to students.  Many of the events and activists are also educational because at Rutgers the learning and research never ends.  Research is always in the back of every Rutgers student and faculty. No single college or university is perfect but when it comes to Rutgers University - Camden it has to be one of the best universities around."
Sophomore,5,"Honestly, Rutgers Camden did a pretty good job, in my opinion. For only having such a short time, online classes were created smoothly and promptly. I never had any issues with my online classes and I still felt a good connection with all my peers and faculty. So thank you to the Rutgers staff, professors and everyone who kept everything running smoothly."
Sophomore,5,Rutgers Camden is always really good. There is an array of diversity between staff and students and all the educational aspects are amazing because I've never had one bad class.
Sophomore,5,"Amazing, Honestly the campus is quite small but at the same time very lively. There's always something to do and the city of Philly is just 5 minutes away. Take advantage of this opportunity because you get the most out of your buck and you get amazing professors with amazing connections as well as a Nice party life too because the Frats always host one every week."
Senior,5,I am a transfer student and there is nothing like Rutgers University-Camden.  I love the atmosphere and the people here are my second family.
Freshman,5,I think the school is very diverse. The professors are great. They are always available and really helpful. The campus is very easy to get around. The people are nice to everyone. Campus security is always present and makes students feel safe.
Sophomore,5,"It is obvious that there are many professors at Rutgers University - Camden who strive to improve their students’ education. Many of the instructors use various tactics to grab the attention of their class. Some professors take themselves more seriously than others, so their course ratings do not match the correct level of difficulty presented on the syllabus."
Junior,5,Rutgers University is a University that welcomes all people around the world they treat all students from different backgrounds equally. They are committed to help you succeed emphasizing in the students.
Junior,5,"I enjoy the small campus setting and close services. The cafeteria is a great place to work on projects with ingesting calories that will be burnt off throughout the day. Academic counseling is always readily available to students who may need advice in decision making, whether in regards to life or education. Students are friendly and seem to support one another with the development of careers and education."
Junior,5,The school accommodates non-traditional students with flexible schedules and online courses that go at a comfortable pace. I confident taking classes at this school because the professors are very supportive even when it is challenging. I am learning and enjoying my experience. I honestly feel like Rutgers university was the best choice for me. I am so thankful for the opportunity to attend here and my GPA really reflects all the hard work it took to make it to this point.
Freshman,5,The university is very diverse. The professors are willing to teach anyone who is willing to learn. The campus is very welcoming.
Freshman,5,At Rutgers so far the Professors and Staff are always there to help you with what ever you need assistance in. The Campus is full of diverse people and there are always things to do. Especially the security on campus are everywhere making you feel safe.
Junior,5,"Very diverse school with incredible greek life, very easy to get in contact with professional staff and create bonds for future recommendation letters. Very close to Philly, you can hop on a train and go to China Town, Reddin Terminal and other great places in philly with your friends! Rutgers Camden also has a great Nursing program as well."
Graduate Student,5,"Rutgers-Camden is known for their diverse student population, which allows students to interact and learn from one another various backgrounds and cultures. Rutgers empowers their students to participate in their communities and network with others nationally and internationally."

Junior,5,"Before attending Rutgers University-Camden, a lot of people in my family were skeptical about the safety of the campus. I can honestly say that I never felt unsafe on campus, even after my night classes. I think that Rutgers does a great job at providing safety for the students. Rutgers University has helped the Camden community with crime and safety in certain regions."
Freshman,5,"When I went to an admitted nursing students visit at this campus, I was greatly pleased with the school as a whole. The nursing building was gorgeous and had such great technology that I will be able to utilize. All of the staff members that I talked to were extremely helpful and I am very excited to continue my academics for the next four years at this school."
Freshman,5,I love the community and academics that Rutgers offers for the students. There are so many activities and fun events to participate in on campus and get involved. I love the professors and the way everyone is so friendly on campus! It is a great price for tuition for the opportunities Rutgers offers. Its a very safe and diverse campus.
Junior,5,"I really like the online program. It helps me with my busy schedule of working two jobs. I am able to manage my own time. It taught me a lot of discipline and time management. This will be my second semester, I feel like I have made an excellent decision."
Freshman,5,"good education, good facilities, many activities, easy to transfer without many demands.
I like the local area, which makes me feel comfortable to study. I never joined student life in Rutgers-Camden before, but I asked some friends, they told me that love it. I also found some information in Rutgers-Camden, It is probably suitable for me."
Sophomore,5,I enjoy Rutgers Camden because it provides a safe environment that allows to me further my education. All staff and faculty are extremely friendly and when needed are very helpful.
Junior,5,"I am currently enrolled in the fully Online Business Administration with a concentration in Data Analytics program. After the first year, I will be applying to a dual MBA program. This is an extremely great program for people that work full-time."
Graduate Student,5,Unfortunately the school is in a bad area but the actual campus is very nice. Its prime location only a 10 minute train ride to center city Philadelphia makes it easy to access
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman entering this fall for the 2018-2019 year. I had the opportunity to take a  program during the summer of 2018 and would not have been more thankful to have taken it. I was able to get a taste of how the classes would be, professors, advisors, my counselors, etc. I know the campus better which is really important when starting this fall. Also, I became more aware with organizations, clubs, health and services, RUPD, etc. The faculty is amazing and could not have been happier attending Rutgers Camden."
Freshman,5,"Elite school that provides tons of student support. They truly work hard to make sure you stay on track and complete your degree. They are known nationwide and internationally for being a top-notch accredited University. From the enrollment advisors to the Professors, you will have all the tools you need to succeed in whatever major you decide on. Every department gets back to you in a timely manner if you have any questions. Highly recommend."
Junior,5,"I LOVE Rutgers-Camden! Some people complain, but I have had an amazing experience here. My professors are all amazing, some are a little tougher than others, but I didn't expect college to be easy. Its so easy to be involved in campus activities. We have beautiful dorms/apartments and a brand new Nursing/Science building!"
Junior,5,"Camden is a city on the rise and with that comes Rutgers Camden. The school which combines excellent education with community, and culture"
Junior,5,"I love the professors, and the school environment. It’s easy to communicate with all faculty staff and it made the circulum is easy to follow."
Freshman,5,"I really like Rutgers Camden, it’s a very good college and has a lot of majors in the four years of undergraduate. It’s good in a lot of ways too. Academically, safety, housing, food, affordable, professors, advisors, and campus. Theses are the reasons that I like about Rutgers Camden."
Senior,5,"Rutgers Camden is an excellent university.  I am blessed to be able to be part of the campus while obtaining a bachelor of the arts degree in health sciences along with two minors, biology and psychology.  Rutgers allows me to become a well rounded student.  They offer a wide variety of courses.  I am looking forward to graduating in December 2018 and ultimately pursuing a masters of science in health science as a physicians assistant.  I am enjoying every experience I am involved with here at Rutgers University in Camden, NJ."
Junior,5,"I currently go to Rutgers and so far i like it there. My professors are very good for the most part and i enjoy my classes. Rutgers administration has been extremely helpful with scheduling classes and figuring out payment/loans etc. It's always tough to transfer to a big school from community college and their staff has made the transformation easy. I'm sure by graduation, i'll receive a great education by the university and be able to use it to enhance my career."
Freshman,5,I love the fact that everyone is so nice and willing to help all the time. The only thing I would change would be the environment I don't like that it is in Camden.
Sophomore,5,"I attended Rutgers from 2011-2013, had to leave due to sick family member; however, Rutgers is an amazing diverse school with opportunity that will take you as far as you control. They have several events that make students feel at home, atmosphere is top notch and the professors are by far the best I have had in my college career!"
Alum,5,It was an easy school to commute to. It was very safe and the professors were all very helpful and knowledgable.
Junior,5,"The nursing program is by far the best around. Everyone is so helpful and kind.The student impact booth has information on concerts, campus life, food events, live shows, and so much more to keep the students involved in activities other than academics. Free ice cream is my favorite day."
Junior,5,Rutgers Camden is a nice school but could have been better. It is a very safe place and a very diverse. I wish some of the teachers take more time to care about the students and help them out but other than that it is not really bad.
Freshman,5,I like the diversity of the campus also the size. It's the smaller campus of the other two so it's less overwhelming and gives the students like me more focus. I would like to see the dorm/housing conditions change or alter a little to please those that reside there
Senior,5,"I have been on this campus for the past 5 years and this experience has been nothing but wonderful for me! I have made so many new friends who are like family to me now. I have attended so many workshops that have helped me throughout the years. I have become part of so many organizations for example Student Nursing Association, Student Government Association, Muslim Student Association, and Black student union. The changes that I would want to see on this campus would be better parking for students. Better ways to contact offices to be able to get things done on time. "
College Sophomore,5,"Compared to all my friends I've had the best housing experience. There are no communal bathrooms!!!! That's important to me because I'm a little bit of a clean freak. Freshmen tower is pretty nice, usually 6 to a room and the rooms are a nice size and include a toilet, shower, vanity area with two sinks, and a living room. I mean one could complain about the quality of carpet or furniture but it college and it was pretty decent. After your freshmen year you living in apartments which are really nice and clean looking. Its a small campus so no matter where you live, it will only take you 5 minutes max to walk to class or literally across campus. There's a great waterfront area literally down the street and a few minutes the opposite way is the train to Philly or the bus station to other parts in Jersey. Housing is great!"
College Sophomore,5,There are opening for any courses or subjects you may wish the pursue and school academic advisors are available to provide aid to the students if needed. The classes can accommodate as many students as possible and the cleanliness is a top priority. The professors are quite understanding and bear the success of their student in their heart through their teaching methods.
College Sophomore,5,"This is a very nice University.  They offer a wide variety of classes for each subject or career.  This University allows me to go to school in the day time so I can work at a job in the evenings.  I am able to take classes throughout the week and also allow myself enough study time and time to prepare for upcoming projects or presentations.  This school is very safe, it is in Camden, NJ and some people shy away from that, but it is very safe and you can always find security if you ever need it as well as, if your vehicle breaks down they are also there to assist you.  They offer a great library that has every book or resource you could imagine for every topic.  I am glad I chose to attend Rutgers University in Camden, NJ."
College Senior,5,"there are security guards every where. we also have are own police station, with the city police station only five minutes away. there are city and campus guards on duty 24 hours a day. The police surround the campus so that i always feel safe, but i carry pepper spay just in case."
College Senior,5,Attending Rutgers-Camden was the best decision I ever made. The campus is small so you really get the chance to be involved. The class sizes are smaller than my high school so you get to know all the professors which is great for letters of recommendation for graduate school. Rutgers is also fairly inexpensive so I have very little college loans which is wonderful. I strongly advise any South Jersey high schoolers to look into going here.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I love sports so I personally like to attend most of the basketball and baseball games. The baseball games are held in the Campbell Soup Stadium which is really fun to attend with your friends! Basketball game were great this past year, pretty intense and fun!"
College Freshman,5,There's lot of support services that student use.
College Freshman,5,I did not have any problems with the process.
College Sophomore,5,"We are the safest Rutgers campus statistically. We are monitored by the RUPD, Camden County Police Department, DRPA, and occasionally have NJ State Troopers near campus."
College Sophomore,5,Philadelphia is one train stop away on the PATCO. New York City is a 2 hour train ride away (RiverLine to the Northeast Corridor Train into Penn Station). Everything is close by. Two malls are within 15 minutes away.
College Sophomore,5,"As a commuter student, I didn't need any loans to attend Rutgers Camden. I have an academic scholarship and applied for a Business school scholarship, which allowed me to lower my costs of going to Rutgers. Rutgers is extremely reasonably priced."
College Freshman,5,"Cooper Grant neighborhood is right near the campus and its is amazing, also there are the castle apartment snad other rentable places very near by that are safe"
College Freshman,5,They just entered the Big Ten and the athletic facilities are amazing!! It was newly built a few years ago and it just amazing you would have to see it to understand how great it is.
College Freshman,5,"Camden has a bad rep, the crime rate has went down 30% in this past year, which is phenomenal, and there are so many different activities you can do here like the new Kroc center they built, north gate park, and victor's pub, the waterfront, and of course Philly is right next door"
Junior,4,"The experience is similar to the experience I had at community college, except I am paying a lot more for it. The professors are somewhat more qualified, but I do not feel I am learning more from them than I did from my previous professors."
Junior,4,"All my classes at Rutgers Camden have been online. My experience has been–for the most part–comparable to the online classes I took at community college. The difference is that there is also weekly zoom sessions, which I find to be an annoying waste of time."
Senior,4,Very cool experience Professors reply back to any questions I may have within a hour.  I just wish my assignments were graded a little sooner.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy going here. I've only had one encounter with a rude professor, but otherwise all of my professors have been very helpful and flexible! 
The campus is nice and casual."
Junior,4,It was hard for everyone but the professors did the best they could. Personally I had a rough time with the inline classes but all of my professors understood the situation and helped me finish the semester with excellent grades.
Senior,4,"Rutgers gave me tons of opportunities to build my level of knowledge in my field as well as my professional experience. I am forever grateful to the supportive faculty who coached me through to the next level of education. It is really a great school that offers great scholarships. I graduated without any student debt! Anything I could complain about is really minor such as campus cleanliness, slow pace of different student services, poor cafeteria service, distance and cost of parking and limited shuttles. No, school is going to be perfect and I believe they are trying. The best part of going here was definitely the connections that I have made which will last forever."
Senior,4,I finished my last semester here online due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The switch to online was impromptu but I believe that the school handled it very well.
Graduate Student,4,"My experience at Rutgers University has been incredible. It is a small campus, small classes, and easily accessible. The professors are also informative and great at their jobs. I have truly learned a great deal during my years here."
Junior,4,"I like that it is such a small campus, there is plenty of opportunities to stand out. It is so close to Philly, so many great internship opportunities."
Senior,4,Rutgers University has provided me with an overall positive experience. I only with the school was located in a different/safer area.
Junior,4,"Rutgers -Camden's online bachelors program is great for those who work full-time but also want to pursue their bachelors degree. They are a leader in online learning and almost all of my courses so far have been engaging and thought provoking. Many of the professors care and wish to see you succeed and actively work to help you do so. It's a great education for the price, PLUS you are able to work while attending."
Sophomore,4,"I’ve had a great experience so far at Rutgers Camden. Mostly great professors, excellent Rutgers education with mostly small class sizes, extremely diverse and my social life has been great. However You must be aware that many things hurt RUC. It has a safe, but uninteresting surrounding area (not including philly). Camden still has a long way to go before it can be considered a great town or place to go to college. Dorms are average and food is below average. It suffers from lack of funding, cramped atmosphere and, at times, overall disorganization. But I can confidently say that if I had to choose again, I would still go here without a doubt. I love my friends, and that makes up for most short commings."
Junior,4,"It's a smaller school and campus.  Its nice to have smaller class sizes, but the downside is they are often only offered in certain terms."
Junior,4,I believe that this is overall a great school. I love learning here and a lot of professors teaching on this campus care very much about their students education.
Freshman,4,"I love how teachers involve with students and the activities on campus. They have a great staff, and I haven’t have much problems with them. I would like to see a change in the food station. Is great and everything, but I was sick of the tasteless vegan food and all the problems they where causing me health wise."
Sophomore,4,"I like how many of the professors are more than willing to help outside of class when needed. For the most part, people on campus are pretty nice! Greek life is becoming more and more active on the campus creating more programs for students to attend. There is also a good amount off sports also, but there isn't football on this campus."
Sophomore,4,It is a very small and inviting campus. The class sizes are small enough to get to know your fellow classmates and your professors. It allows for personalized learning. There is a brand new nursing and science building that is modern and has the best technology including life-like dolls for clinical practice. All of the building are near each other and in walking distance. The campus center is a nice place to hang with friends and get food in-between classes. A lot of the buildings are older but they still are in nice condition.
Freshman,4,I liked the fact that there was an endless supply of places for you to get help if you needed it and all of the students are fairly friendly and welcoming. It doesn’t take much for you to make friends.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Rutgers University-Camden is how closely knit everyone is at the school. Rutgers Camden is a fairly small school so you tend to make friends fairly easy due to it being small. Even though, there's not much to do off campus, they always have something going on the in Campus Center. What I would like to see change at Rutgers is probably their food options. The food choices never really changed and they stayed the same year round so you would get bored of the same old stuff. Otherwise, Rutgers University-Camden is a great school!"
Senior,4,Rutgers University is a very nice campus with smaller class sizes.  The professors care about the success of their students.  The course work is challenging and really helps you grow.
Junior,4,"My experience at Rutgers University, Camden was great. It is a small campus so it is very easy to get around however, there isn't much to do around campus so it can get boring and quiet on the weekends. Overall, it was a perfect campus for me, I personally liked the professors and the size of the classes. The learning experience was so great because classes were small and the professors were always willing to help."
Freshman,4,I like the fact that they're are people around to help you when you are first coming into college and it really helps. Their are also plenty of things to do around campus for students to do in their free time.
Junior,4,"I just transferred this semester, and it has been a change, this is my first time living on my own! I love the dorms, I just wish I could choose my roommates, the food is alright, but beggars can't be choosers, the education is great, all my professors are well educated and they really care about their students. I heard bad stuff about Camden in general, but the security in the campus is really good. I didn't made a mistake of transferring."
Freshman,4,I've had a great experience so far. There are several parties every week. My professors actually cared about how i was doing and would respond whenever i had questions.
Senior,4,"Rutgers University - Camden is one of the best universities a student can attend in south jersey. With its close proximity to the greater Philadelphia area, it offers wide variety of opportunities. The professor to student ratio is at a very good rate because it provides a level of personal connection between the two. The school is mostly a commuter school and I commuted as well; hence,  I am not too familiar with the campus life but lets say compared to Rutgers New Brunswick it may lack some things students look for when choosing a college to attend. I was a part of the School of Business and the current business building doesn't meet the standard expectation of a business school in 2019. However, we had the luxury to train and use Bloomberg systems which was an absolute advantage."
Junior,4,"I like all the open opportunities that are available at Rutgers. I've discovered and been so involved in so many things that I never knew existed. This is only the beginning, I will explore more. Help me help others."
Junior,4,"I got accepted into Rutgers Camden Summer 2017 into the nursing program. I was part of the first set of the upper division program. I came in with an associate in General science from Essex county college. Coming into a 4 year college from a 2 year college was till the same excitement as if I were to be coming from high school. First day of classes, I dived right into classes, there was no slacking which I loved and admired. college is fun, but there's a lot of money going into it, so no time to waste. I live on campus, and I must say, its been an experience i'd want my children to live thru. its a very good experience, and the money is worth it. Food on campus has its days. Student's main constant is the Starbucks located at the campus center. I'm pretty sure that's where I spent most of my meal plan. Security is another things. there are cops and security always patrolling and if you don't fell safe, you can always ask a security officer to escort you to wherever you're going."
Senior,4,This university is very unique because it offers the Briding The Gap program which covers the difference between your financial aid and tuition. Due to this program I have not had to take out any private loans so I don’t have to owe as much. I’m very thankful that my school considers how difficult the cost of higher education can be for people. The faculty are also amazing and the campus is very scenic.
Freshman,4,"Rutgers University-Camden is a well-established school that provides so much for the facility, students, alumni, and even the family members of the students. While it is a small campus, It still gives the same experiences and education like the other two campuses.  Rutgers-University Camden is evince to build a stronger relationship with the student academically and socially. This is such a great school and campus and honestly I can't wait to achieve my goals and pursue my education over at Rutgers-Camden."
Sophomore,4,"For students looking for a small well organized school this is a good fit. It is a short train ride from Philadelphia which is very nice when it comes to days off and going out. The school in Camden is very nice, there are tons of resources for the students and everything is very near by. Only thing I wish were different is I wish it were a bit bigger but there is a large number of students who attend. Overall it is really a great school."
Freshman,4,Rutgers University is a great school. It offers many scholarship opportunities. That is how I was able to get into Rutgers University.
Senior,4,"Rutgers Camden is what you make of it, during my first semester here I did not enjoy it because I was commuting and I felt all the interactive activities where resident oriented,  however when I got my self a place around campus and got more involved, my whole experience changed dramatically. Overall, Rutgers is a gem if you know how to find it."
Freshman,4,"I love how open, optimistic and welcome everyone is on campus!! The professors and the university itself opens up flexible availability time for tutoring and study time, the police officers are the KINDEST people on campus, and finding your way around campus is very easy!! If I were to change anything it would be having more parties.. lol"
Niche User,4,"Rutgers-Camden is  a wonderful school. However, if I had to change anything, I would probably target the parking situation first. Due to being an urban school, parking is limited at Rutgers; as such, student lots have been moved further away from campus. Next, I would improve the cafeteria food."
Freshman,4,"Rutgers Camden is a small campus, which gives you the opportunity to know your community better and allows you and your professor to develop a decent relationship. Classes are smaller, making it easier to focus. Also, Rutgers Camden provides bridging the gap, free tutors, and themed floor housing!"
Niche User,4,My sister goes to this school and enjoys it! The nursing program is very good and so is their athletics. My sister was able to play 3 sports and take classes all at once so the school is fine with working with a bust student. Only downside I would say is the area.
Sophomore,4,"Rutgers Camden is a great school, there are small class sizes and it has so much leadership opportunities. Also the tuition is lower than a lot of colleges, but the financial aid office at this University is not the best  and makes a lot of mistakes I have heard from students and experienced it myself."
Niche User,4,"Rutgers - Camden will provide you with a sound education. The surrounding area gives you a first hand visual of what drugs and joblessness can do to a community. Ove the years the campus has made several improvements, most notably to the gym and the library. Initially, the school was built with the intention of being a commuter campus, which it still is as many of the students who attend do not live on campus. This makes sense considering it's small size. The athletic program leaves more to be desired, but with Rutgers New Brunswick being a little over an hour up the highway, and Temple being less than 10 miles away, football and other college sporting events are easily accessible. Rutgers-Camden will provide you with a great education, and continues to improve upon the student experience, but it still has a ways to go."
Sophomore,4,"I like the fact that our University is quite small which makes it easier to reach to different faculty members, get involved in various organization and get lots of academic help from the professors."
Alum,4,"Rutgers - Camden has a small campus so sometimes you feel as though you miss out on a true college experience. This also creates a more personal learning environment as most classes are held in actual classrooms rather than lecture halls. Over the years there has been a concerted effort to better the campus and make it more aesthetically pleasing (addition of grad dorms, new gym, new places to eat). The campus is pretty diverse and I never felt as though I didn't belong regardless of where I was, or who I was around. Parties are usually hit or miss, with an occasional rager every now and again. Some of the surrounding areas can be rather daunting, though I never personally had any issues.  Overall the faculty is well versed and knowledgeable, I feel as though I received great education."
Alum,4,"Rutgers Camden is favorable to commuters for the most part. The area isn't great and it can feel as though you're trapped on campus if you don't drive to class. There are a few places to eat at on campus, but it feels like you cannot stray far from Rutgers given the safety concerns. However, Rutgers is close to Philly and I never had a big commute. Overall, I feel like I received a good education given the cost and location."
Junior,4,"Rutgers University Camden campus is located in the middle of growing community full of rich culture and entertainment.  The Philadelphia 76ers and Phillys have farm league coliseums in Camden to attract new visitors, not to mention the waterside that overlooks Philadelphia.  There are newly renovated luxury apartments, an entertainment section, and lots of high end restaurants.  Camden will become a place to live with the help of Rutgers University."
Junior,4,"Rutgers- Camden is a great school. There are a lot of great programs and opportunities all around. The biggest downfall I see throughout the University is that they do not communicate efficiently with the students. Often you see students  unaware of what is going on.  There are a few hit or miss professors, as well as the cafeteria's food which is a hit or miss as well. There are other places to eat on campus, which are very good. Overall Rutgers- Camden teaches you to go out and find your own fun. "
College Senior,4,I wanted to join greek life at y school but could not for personal reasons. Greek life at this school is really big and they are very open to everyone at the school. They are super friendly and very active in the community.
College Sophomore,4,"There are lots of facilities opened to students with diverse sometimes uncommon choices and the advisors are always available in case we need help for a better choice concerning courses, classes, careers etc..."
College Sophomore,4,"So far, my overall experience has been pretty great. I've meet some interesting people and tried plenty of new things. RUC has helped me grow into a more independent, goal setting, civically engaged person. The campus doesn't provide everything but it does drive you to go get what you want."
College Sophomore,4,"The health center is great. They are effective, discreet, and caring. As for safety, Camden is definitely not a safe place to stroll around at night. With that being said the area around campus is very safe with RUPD circling the area 24 hours a day and the blue safety stations for emergency call through out the area, I've never felt unsafe on campus. It's always best to be aware of your surroundings and let someone know where you are."
College Sophomore,4,"Rutgers Camden is a pretty great school even though it gets slack for being the smallest campus within the Rutgers system. Pros: Class sizes are usually small which allows your professors to become more approachable. Professor are educated, caring, and creative. I didn't have one professor that didn't care for their profession. The library is great! There is plenty of resources available to students. The campus is very involved in providing awareness to issues that effect the community of Camden and various other civic duties. This campus helps you become aware of everything that is taking place in the world. Also housing is nice considering most other schools have communal bathrooms lol. And most importantly they give a lot towards financial aid!! Cons: It is a small campus so while during the week the campus is busy around 4pm on Fridays the campus becomes eerily empty. It is a commuter campus. To be entertain on the weekends, after studying of course, it's a great idea to explore Philly since it's literally right across the bridge. Or to plan a trip to New York or DC since they are only a few hours away. Being stuck on campus is not ideal, but there is plenty to do in the surrounding area. Its a usually friendly community, even though some people become cliquey but that's natural. RUC provides you with a lot of opportunities, but its up to you to make sure you get everything you want."
College Senior,4,The Greek  life  is small compared to other schools.  But they are great. They  always  have activities  and doing  stuff  around  campus  to living it up.
College Senior,4,It's a good schoo7. The tuition  is decent especially  if your in state  and commute.
College Sophomore,4,"There are always job fairs and internships opportunities occurring on campus from the freshmen to the graduate students. The school sgares deep interest in allocating their sources to help the students find the jobs they qualify in and the most appropriate training methods for them based on their skills, abilities, potential and performances in their majors and minors."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is surrounded by people watching over us all the time and providing comfort when needed. In case of theft or any other sort of crime, The campus is placed under close supervision and student are alerted at all times. Crimes cannot be prevailed at all times but the efforts invested to assure of safety is way more that we ask for."
College Sophomore,4,"Students are supplied with necessary trainers and equipment to pursue athletic activities and even go through fun healthy exercises such s zumba, boot camp training, weightlifting, kickboxing and so on. Not only student are allowed to  work out or pursue weight loss training but also other community members living around the school."
College Sophomore,4,The courses are designed to help us learn through our own means and if help is required we may obtain assistance from organizations on campus such as tutoring or study groups or teachers who voluntarily agree to lend their knowledge even after class hours.
Recent Alumnus,4,"My overall experience at Rutgers is amazing, Im so happy to be  part of this University. The professors are great and the student are great as well."
College Freshman,4,I think this is a good school. I enjoy it.
College Freshman,4,Rutgers Camden has an abundant amount of security. They are literally standing on every block around the campus to ensure the students are in a safe environment. Since being a student at Rutgers i have not heard of any crime issues and i have never felt in any danger. Nothing wrong occurs and we have a very peaceful environment on the campus of Rutgers Camden.
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience at school so far has been wonderful. I have met new friends as well as taking courses i would not have thought about it high school. I enjoy mostly everything about the school and it shaping me into a better person as well. Rutgers has great professors who actually help you if need be. In addition, the resources that the university provide are excellent. Rutgers is unique in the fact that it is very diverse, i see a variety of people who attend this university and most of the people i do not know. I like that about this school, i get to meet new people and its like i started my life over at the age of 18. I Would definitely not change my decision to attend Rutgers. Attending Rutgers is one of the best decisions i have ever made."
College Sophomore,4,Campus has a lot of information posted of statistics and services available they also cover everything during orientation to ensure all students are aware of health/safety services and programs that are available at Rutgers.
College Sophomore,4,Professors show genuine interest in the topics they teach and actively try to get students involved as well as inform them of available resources and research opportunities.
Freshman,2,"It wasn't the most terrible thing because of all the time you got to study, the only problem I see is a vast majority commute and for people who want to have the real college experience can't. The professors are easy to work with,  but the campus and surrounding neighborhoods are very crime filled."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not even sure what division my school is. We do not have a football team, but there are other sports. Since sports aren't big on campus we don't have a home coming or anything to bring relevance to our teams. But if you do a sport that is another group and friends and support you have on campus. The main gym is really nice though it is small. A lot of students who live on or off campus use it often. There are smaller gyms in the residence hall but they are sub par and honestly not worth mentioning."
College Junior,2,Financial aid took forever to get back in touch and tell me the amt i was receiving.  Then the aid that they gave me was originally wrong and they redisbursed the right amountt (which was more) almost 3 weeks later.
College Sophomore,2,"There is one apartment complex in town and a bunch of homes for rent. If you go outside of Camden, you have a better selection."
College Sophomore,2,"The school is in Camden - nothing really happening there. But, you can take the train into the city, which has a ton of great options."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The sooner you have your FASFA done, the better you will end up. They will not contact you if your grants/scholarships haven't gone through.. The school will drop you from your classes and will deregister you. I recommend getting that out of the way before you make your final decision. Can be so difficult at times... But they work with you."
Recent Alumnus,2,"To be honest, it sucks. The variety is slim to none. It's pretty much a high school lunch option kind of thing and open so late on weekends.

but sev (711) is open 24/7 so that comes in clutch a lot."
College Sophomore,2,"Every year since I've been at Rutgers, it's been a constant headache waiting to see if I would be able to receive the enough financial aid for school where I wouldn't have to pay out-of-pocket for my classes.  The best advice I can give anyone going to any college is to study hard beforehand yet be well-rounded.  From my point of view, it seems like Rutgers Camden favors students who volunteer or have some passion towards a charitable cause.  These students seem to get awarded more scholarships and grants.  Having a good GPA at this school (even one as high as mine) might not be enough to get the financial aid that one needs."
College Junior,2,"Camden isn't a safe place to be. There are many crimes that take place near/on campus which is why this school was not my first choice. There are many police officers and campus safety personnel on campus, but you can't leave campus and feel safe at any time of he day."
College Junior,2,"Generally, if students live off campus, they live near the Riverline, (which is full of untrustworthy people). I's not the safest area to live in, but then again, living on campus isn't very safe either. Most students who go to Rutgers Camden live at home and commute. Paying for off-campus housing is not worth it."
College Senior,2,"In Camden, there is nothing to do, like nothing.  So most students take the PATCO (which is NJ and PA's interstate train system) to get into Philadelphia.  We are right across the bridge from Philadelphia, so there is plenty to do there.  There are issues with safety outside of campus in Camden, but we have never had any problems on campus.  I've been a commuter for 3, verging on 4 years now."
College Junior,2,"It's a commuter school, so not many parties.  But there are frats."
College Junior,2,The athletics at Rutgers Camden is basically non exsistant
College Sophomore,2,"Parking on campus is dreadful.  Most students are commuters, but the only parking is about 1 mile off campus, in a dangerous neighborhood."
College Sophomore,2,"The neighborhood off campus is incredibly dangerous, so living off campus is not ideal"
College Junior,2,There is nothing around the school except subway and 7-11...
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid office wants nothing to do with students asking questions. Its hard to get enough financial aid to go to school let alone move on campus or have extra money for a parking pass or books.
College Freshman,2,"There really is no place to eat besides food carts, dining and subways"
College Freshman,2,There isn't much to do because of the small campus
College Freshman,2,There isn't much going on at such a small campus
College Freshman,2,"it is located in a bad area, but just minutes across the bridge is Philadelphia with my things to do."
College Junior,2,I have priced out the cost of parking and it just makes more sense for me to take the train. I do not have the patience to travel into Camden which can be tricky during the time of day and then searching for a parking spot like a lion in the jungle while managing to be on time for class. 
College Junior,2,I try not to connect to the campus' wireless via my phone or computer because it can be a hassle. It also isn't that fast. I wish that there were more computer labs because searching for a computer is really annoying. 
College Junior,2,"Camden is known for being an incredibly unsafe region. There is illegal/criminal activity that is seen in the news on a daily basis. I give Rutger's kudos for managing a massive student body and insuring their safety. With that said, there isn't much to do on campus unless there are events being held. I know that I would spend the majority of my time across the river in Philadelphia soaking up that scene because Philadelphia is loaded with museums, amazing dining, and tons of places to shop. There is also a drive away the Cherry Hill Mall or places near that region for shopping, events, but I believe that the proximity of the campus to other fun activities is a haul which makes the campus kind of a drag. "
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many close parking lots, and it is very expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"The wifi is hard to connect to, and slow. The library is often noisy and filled up."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many attractive girls, and places to meet and /or hangout with them."
College Senior,2,parking for off campus students is horrible..no positives from my view except that it is offered
College Freshman,2,They shouldn't fine students who are living on campus with their cars who pay $370 already for parking. Sometimes you're in a rush to go to class and forget to put the rearview mirror tag on but the other tag on the side is always there so they know you live there. Still they charge you $15 and college students are broke. 
College Freshman,2,"On the weekend, cafeteria opens at 10:30am, I wake up at 8:30 and be starving, and they close at 6pm. They should be open for longer hours because this is where live. The food variety is okay tough."
College Junior,2,There's a bar about a block away from the school. You wouldn't want to try to venture out into Camden and find any of the other bars.
College Junior,2,Lot parking is so far you need to take a shuttle and it is very expensive. I use the meters and it can get expensive and I do sometimes spend time trying to find a spot. I am worried about when it snows as the spots will be even more limited m
Recent Alumnus,2,"Trying to march through the muck on Cooper street during the rain is absolutely miserable. Additionally, when it snows, Camden rarely plows the streets so there is always an accident waiting to happen. Nice weather doesn't do much for Camden, as everyone is usually too busy running back to their cars to their air conditioning after sitting in Armitage all afternoon."
College Senior,2,The old dorms I used to live in during freshman year were not the best. Living on campus was a nightmare because students could only use their dining money in the school cafeteria and nowhere else. This restricts students to one set of foods for the entire semester mostly greasy foods and that isn't good. Plus they cost a lot too. The trash wasn't taken out when they were supposed to and the bathrooms weren't cleaned either. There were 9 students in a suite of three rooms - that comes to about 3 students per room - in my books that's not healthy.
College Sophomore,2,"There is nearby parking for students who live in the dorms, but other parking is far away and requires a shuttle to get to campus. The shuttles run pretty constantly, but it can still be a pain to factor the extra time it takes to wait for and take the shuttle with finding parking and getting to class on time. As for visitors to the dorms, parking is free in the dorm parking lots only on weekends."
College Freshman,2,"The weather is similar to the weather in other parts of south jersey, but being on the river makes the temperature slightly colder.  I would recommend having an extra hoodie in the back of your car or in your backpack so that you can add a layer when you get to campus if you need to.  Also, during the winter it snows a lot, which can be annoying as a commuter because the roads can get icy and public transport like the patco or the river line might be delayed."
College Sophomore,2,Somewhat difficult to find off-campus housing in a good area at a good price.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Being in New Jersey the weather kind of stinks but it could be worse.  It can get very cold in the winter and it rains a lot here too.  So, if you are a commuter bundle up.  The past couple of years the winters have been mild but cold."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's not strict at all. Honestly, you can get away with almost anything on campus. They really don't care."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The weather is inconsistent, but when the weather is bad they still don't cancel classes. It's ridiculous because most of the students are commuters."
Sophomore,1,"This school is by far the single greatest regret of my life. The professors often have no idea what they are talking about, or no knowledge of how to teach if they do understand the subject. The campus is small and dated, amenities are lacking, and the environment is what you would expect from one of the worst crime cities in the nation. If you plan to learn, I highly suggest not attending this university."
Senior,1,"As a student at the fairly new RU Camden Mays, a great deal of deception was involved in recruiting nursing students from ACCC for their RN-BSN bridge program. Promises of flexible scheduling, dedicated professors, and the choice of in person or online learning atmosphere soon turned out to be blatant lies. Buyer beware, this university is a business and once they get you into the program and once you pay, all of your support disappears. By the time you realize the lies you were fed to get in, it’s too late. You paid an now you’re stuck. There was so much upset in my program, the nursing board had to hold a “town hall meeting” so that we could voice our concerns. You know what they told us? “This campus does not make enough money and is barely breaking even, we can’t afford to pay instructors to be here”. Huh."
College Junior,1,"I do not live on campus, I do not know but it is right next to Philly so I am sure alot of people go into the city to party"
College Junior,1,"Camden is not the most appealing area. The locals are not trustworthy which causes students to feel trapped on campus. Due to safety issues, there's not much to do when students are at school and it makes Rutgers a boring place to be at."
College Junior,1,"There are very few places to eat at and they're all awful. After the first few weeks of school, I had decided to bring my lunch instead."
College Senior,1,Off campus dining is pretty much non-existent.  Eat on campus or bring your lunch.
College Freshman,1,The area is unsafe and dirty.
College Freshman,1,"Camden is very unsafe, especially at night."
College Freshman,1,There are ultimately no exciting attractions in Camden.
College Freshman,1,Apply for as many scholarships as you can because financial aid does not help very much.
College Junior,1,Most dangerous city in the USA as of 2014.  A commuter school.
College Sophomore,1,"the cost for the year to park is not very economical, especially on top of tuition."
College Junior,1,"Unless you have a car or are prepared to travel into Philadelphia for the many different dining experiences, I would have to say that this university locally does not offer a large range of dining options. Philadelphia is an amazing dining spot for college students because there are some regions of the city that stay open until the wee hours of the morning. However, I do not think that they acknowledge Rutger's student discounts. I think a great place to try is the Philadelphia Chutney Company or Federal Donuts. "
College Senior,1,bad weather I don't travel to school
College Junior,1,Greek students look down on non-greeks and non-greeks view greeks as snobby and cliquey- because they are.
College Sophomore,1,"Very skimpy with scholarships. If you ask the Dean's office about them, they claim you need to talk to Financial Aid. Financial Aid will tell you to talk to the Dean's office."
College Freshman,1,There are not many off-campus dining areas to choose from when attending Rutgers. We have the option of maybe three places to eat from and they are the basic places that we can eat from at home. they also do not offer student discounts.
College Freshman,1,The whether really doesnt have an affect on the school. As long as there isn't a natural disaster Rutgers will be open.
College Senior,1,Camden Crime – The police force is good at monitoring the campus but there is a very high crime rate in Camden. I feel safe on campus but I try to not ever leave campus and if I do it is always with a group of people. Homeless people often wander onto the campus grounds and it is unsettling.
College Junior,1,"Too Much Money – Lot 11 parking costs approximately $275 per year. This is totally outrageous considering how far it is from the actual campus, plus tuition increases each year."

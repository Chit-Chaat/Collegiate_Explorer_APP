Niche User,5,"I have not attended the school yet but the process has been very easy and the staff very helpful.  I really enjoyed my visit to the school!  However, I am considering not attending now that Delaware State University might take over the school.  I'm asking everyone to write to these places to voice your opposition:

Freshman,5,I haven't quite taken any online classes at Wesley College however contacting my admissions counselors throughout the pandemic was very quick and simple and no matter what she answered my texts or emails to answer any questions or concerns I had!
Freshman,5,"No matter what the admissions counselor will make you feel at home and comfortable! No matter how nervous I was she always reassured me that it was okay and she was extremely patient with me. Walking on campus, each student you run into will make you feel welcome and apart of the family. If you have any questions students on campus has no problem lending a helping hand or just being there to lead the way until you feel completely comfortable on your own. I loved being on campus and honestly its the only school my parents felt comfortable with. They get right to the point and no matter what will let you be you and take accept you for you no matter what color, race, or gender identity you can be you!"
Freshman,5,"Great school, Nice teachers, expensive but lots of financial aid. Tutoring service and counselors are good help."
Sophomore,5,"So far, Wesley College's admissions department has been fantastic.  I think one of the most important aspects of college is communication with staff, and I have been extremely impressed."
Freshman,5,"I personally love Wesley College. I have had such a positive experience while being here so far. I have made so many life long friends and the professors here are always so helpful. I love the small class sizes because it enhances my learning experience tremendously  because I am not just a number in the class, my professors actually know who I am."
Senior,5,"I love Wesley College. I do wish that they had more financial options available for students who do not have their parents help. That is the main reason I am applying for so many scholarships. Academically, Wesley is amazing and they have a wonderful Nursing program which definitely challenges each individual and makes sure that you are prepared for NCLEX. I do recommend Wesley College, I just wish there were more financial options available."
Freshman,5,"I love it there . The staff members are very helpful and everyone wants you to truly succeed. It is small so it is easy to get any type of help from anyone. The location is good with lots of places to eat. I love the flexible classes and everything. The food is okay, but better then I thought. The people are very nice and I have met some very nice people since being here. I love to come to school daily and I have thus far learned a tremendous amount, and I am glad I became aoart of the esley family."
Sophomore,5,"Very supportive and very serious professors. 
You know what is expected of you in every class. Students are polite and most if them are ready to learn. The environment is quite and condusive for learning"
Sophomore,5,Welsey is awesome.  I transferred last year for the Spring semester.  Everyone I came in contact with was so helpful and nice.
Sophomore,5,I only go to Wesley for football . Are football team makes the playoff every year . The school it self is ok .
Senior,5,"I love the campus, it's small and it is in a nice part of Dover. Meeting with the financial aid people and my admissions counselor was really easy."
Senior,5,"A very good school, I would recommend any upcoming college student attend. especially if you want to achieve. I made deans list twice and I am very happy about that. I have created unique relationships with my professors which has led me to learn to the best ability I can. Overall Wesley is a good college fr anyone to attend."
Freshman,5,I liked Wesley because it was close to home but yet far enough way. The professors are so cool and the advisors have helped me so much. Everyone is so nice and helpful. Living on my own for the first time has been the best experience at Wesley
Junior,5,"Going into my third year at Wesley College I have grown to embrace the small atmosphere that is provided to us as students. At Wesley College I have watched myself grow in many aspects whether it was mentally, physically and even academically. My first year at Wesley College I earned a 3.47 GPA and as the criteria has begin to become even more difficult, I was still able to maintain a good grade point average. Earning a 3.07 for the fall semester of my junior year. Knowing that I have found success academically motivates me to finish undergrad strong and get into the field that I desire."
Freshman,5,I like how diverse Wesley college is . The students and staff are very nice and friendly . I don't like that the nursing building is so far away from the campus . And there are no vans that run there at night so i have to walk and i feel very unsafe
Freshman,5,Wesley just seems like an all around fun experience. I haven't yet got there but I will be there in the spring smesterm0f 2018 and I am super excited. Also I will be on the football team.
Junior,5,"I think Wesley college has a wide variety of professors. They offer a lot of one on one. Most recently Wesley as a school has been so accepting. We have quite a few transgender students and we redid the bathrooms for them to feel more comfortable. The athletic program is amazing. As a student athlete myself, I know for a fact all the coaches work with you to make sure all the proper help is provided for all the students."
Freshman,5,"Love the school nice small town great teachers love it, great fans and sports teams. Great support system"
Sophomore,5,Something that I like about Wesley is how teachers are able to have the one to one relationship with students. Being a small school classes are not that big which allows the teacher to help students. It allows students to feel like they can go to the teacher whenever they need help
Sophomore,5,"I attended the Wesley College Center for Adult Studies in New Castle, De.  I was impressed with the cohort learning format.  My job at the time did not allow for me to complete the last course of my ASB program.  The professors were dynamic educators that catered to the adult learner.  The facilities, staff, and curriculum are top notch."
Niche User,5,"i loved everything about this college, from the staff to my peers i wouldn't change one thing! everyone is just so outstanding and welcoming"
College Sophomore,5,"It's a very small College, everyone from the students to the staff are very respectful to one another. Staff gives all the support needed for each student and show they care about each and everyone's grade. Pushing each student pass the course and into graduating is there number one goal."
College Sophomore,5,"Coming from a small high school, there wasn't much of a difference in class sizes, but the atmosphere completely changed for me while coming to Wesley. The professors are open and try to make the work easier to understand. I felt like I've learned more in one class my first semester then one whole year of high school, and that is the truth. The professors at Wesley teach in ways that grab your attention and draw you in. You look forward to learning those last couple of slides on the PowerPoint and figuring out why your muscles contract while doing a certain exercise, or how many bones are in your hand. Certain classes are hard to leave after only 45 minutes because you want to keep learning more."
College Sophomore,5,"One of the decision making points I had for the school I was going to choose for college was the security and how safe I felt walking through campus. While on my tour of Wesley, I was shown several security boxes that are around campus that work and connect us to the police, security and 911 if ever need be. The school also sends ""Wesley Alert"" text messages to every student if there has been any dangerous or alarming activity on campus, or in a certain radius of the campus which makes me feel better knowing. I do truly feel safe on campus due to the constant updates and rotation of Dover PD, and our Wesley security guards that want to keep us safe."
College Freshman,5,I love it here. The professors are excellent and very smart
College Freshman,5,close to everything so you can walk
College Freshman,5,I love the sports here very entertaining
College Freshman,5,"I feel safe walking around campus, always see security waling around and they are very friendly"
College Freshman,5,"You get to know professors because of being a small school. A lot of interesting classes. Liberal school, you get to try everything and find whats best for you."
College Freshman,5,very good football team. New turf field. Mostly all sports teams support each other.
College Freshman,5,It is everything I was looking for.
College Freshman,5,I love the school i can't wait to start
College Junior,5,"Wesley has some really great professors.

Now there are some exceptions (Mr. Olsen, who changes the grading scale two weeks before finals), but otherwise I have no complaints other than the usual ""I don't feel like reading old British Literature""."
College Sophomore,5,"you wont catch anyone using drugs or being on drugs

and we dont have a drug scene"
College Sophomore,5,everything is laid down and straight to the point
College Sophomore,5,It is a good place for science majors.
College Sophomore,5,Getting into any program is easy.
College Sophomore,5,The undergraduate research in science is amazing.
College Sophomore,5,there are many perople from countries i have never heard of. the diversity is very good because people interact with each other and learn new things about new cultures.
College Sophomore,5,"There is plenty of parking, freshman can have cars."
College Sophomore,5,The off-campus dining is realyy good they have many good options and it is very cheap.
College Freshman,5,"Since Wesley College is a small school, all the professors work very well with their students. They want to make sure you understand and grasp what your learning unlike other colleges where the professor teachers and leaves."
College Sophomore,5,I am very happy with my program. I would choose psychology all over again. I would like to eventually get my doctorate and open my own practice. I would also like to study the criminal side of psychology and write a book one day. I am concerned that I will have difficulty finding a job after graduation.
College Junior,5,weather is not really a problem at wesley it is usally warm here classes do not really get cancelled unless there is a big snow storm which has only happend twice since i have been attending this school.
College Freshman,5,i love living on campus it was one if the best decisions i made
College Freshman,5,good playing facilities and very focused on being the best
College Freshman,5,I love my teachers and my advisor. I am learning a lot.
College Freshman,5,Wesley's Athletics department is very demanding but ultimately encourages a greater discipline to be applied to ones life. It is a rewarding experience and takes a very passionate student to embark on the journey.
College Junior,5,"Job Search – I'm in the Hotel College, and I've been very satisfied with my education thus far. I'm a Meeting and Event Management major, and all of my professors have been out in the field and are very accomplished in the industry. I've had some of the best instructors who know a lot of important people. If you get to know them on a personal level, they can do wonders for you when it comes to networking or getting a job."
College Freshman,5,"Wesley's athletics are superior. In the gym hangs all the flags of championships won, divisions won, playoffs won etc. Wesley's reputation for athletics is good. In football games the whole school gets together in the stands representing our blue and white, going all out screaming and hollering rooting for our wolveriens"
College Freshman,5,"Zero Tolerance – College is NO joke, especially not at my school. There is a zero tolerance policy. If you are under age, you will not consume any alcoholic beverages while on campus or you will be fined! There will be no fighting on campus or you will be sent home for good! There is a zero tolerance policy for everything. College is for learning not acting crazy."
College Freshman,5,Angelo's Pizza Is the Best Spot! There are many off-campus Dining areas. College students mostly stay up all night doing any different things. Angelos Pizza is the best place to be. They deliver to or school up until 2am. There open the latest in our area & there also familiar with many students at my school.
College Freshman,5,"At Wesley College majority of students have there own labtops. The school has the library with computers upstairs and a few downstairs, the ARC for tutoring with computers, a mac computer lab with many computers. Our school has computers just about everywhere. All students don't study at the same time so it's never a problem. Your personal printer is probably the only thing that is needed because our printing fee is 0.5 cents per page."
College Freshman,5,"Wesley College leaves the living off campus choice to you. When you live off campus, all responsibility is yours. When a home is for rent or sale in the Dover are (which is our school area), the school notifies us by posting flyers. It gives all who are interested in the opportunity to apply. It's houses for rent in our area all the time which makes it even greater. We could move into an off campus home at any given time."
College Junior,5,Small Schools – The small class size really does set us apart from other schools.
College Senior,5,Most of the students at Wesley College are friendly and easy going.  Many join different clubs and various activities that are developed or planned by the college.
College Senior,5,Wesley's nursing program is truly excellent and has presented me with many great educational material.  Their program has also prepared me to become a a great future nurse leader.
College Sophomore,5,"Help from the Beginning – Wesley's admissions staff was helping me from the very beginning. I applied in early October, and found out in mid-October I had been accepted and they were offering me an $8,000 much needed scholarship to go there. They also helped me find outside scholarships, such as religious affiliated scholarships that I qualified for. They helped a lot, and they haven't lost any of my paperwork, nor have they forgotten about me if I need them again."
College Junior,5,Thristy Thursday's and Bubbas – Lockerman and Bubbas is the main clubs we go to.  Wesley students know how to party. We also PARTY A LOT in the dorms and in Greek life.  So if you like to party we have it covered. No matter the age.
Niche User,4,I am a prospective student.  I have not attended classes yet but have visited the school and spoke with the staff
Senior,4,"When COVID-19 hit the U.S. and we had to opt for online classes, the professors were really wonderful regarding how quickly we had to adapt to an online class environment. I was pleased with how flexible they were and understanding if I was not able to understand an assignment."
Senior,4,I love Welsey College. I am currently a student there majoring in nursing. I love how small the classes are. You are recognized as a student and not a number. All the professors know your name. All of the faculty at Wesley College wants to see you succeed! That's what I like most about Wesley. All faculty know you personally and I have no problem talking to someone about my issues no matter what it may be. They supply you with the right resources as well to help you well after you graduate. They set you up for life past college.
Niche User,4,My friend attends there i haven't started college yet but i'm looking forward to going to visit to see if i would like it there
Sophomore,4,My first year experience in this college as been okay. I like the college experience we get and i like the variety of activities they have.
Junior,4,"Here at Wesley College I am provided with a friendly and home like environment. I chose Wesley because of how small the school this way you get a chance to meet everyone at least once. There are no unfamiliar faces and College never seemed as scary as everyone made it. I like the fact that Wesley gives each student a chance to have their own identity. This is a school for students who want to improve themselves socially before stepping foot into this big world. I would like to see a bigger improvement in diversity here at Wesley. Students have to learn that they will not always be surrounded by people they are familiar with, a big part of life in networking. Getting to know different people who can help you be a better you."
Senior,4,"I like how small the campus is, as well as, the class size because it encourages dialogue between students and brings us closer together. The teachers not only care about students succeeding but also push us to reach our full potential."
Freshman,4,"Without question Wesley offers a lot of great opportunities, a good education, and our athletics are kick-ass for a small school.   Students take pride in being Wolverines, which is awesome.  Of course there a a few things that could be updated and changed to be better.  But, I see that Wesley is committed to us and they are always working to improve the campus and college life.   College is what YOU make of it."
Sophomore,4,My two years at Wesley College have been a good experience for me as a student and a person as well. I am learning new things from Kinesiology and I think I have done a good adapting to my enviornment and staying on my own. At Wesley I am on the football team and was selected for National Honor Society for Leadership and Success
Sophomore,4,"For those who are used to a small environment Wesley is the place to be. Although we are a D3 school, our athletics are tremendously fantastic! The professors are always there to help, and teach you new things. The food in the cafeteria, let's just say it has its days. Campus life is what you make it, only bad thing is, the administration tries to shut things down early. Security is always around, & they are really nice!"
Freshman,4,"Wesley College is a beautiful school with a very little number of people. The location of the school is just as good as the people who go there. It does not take long to get around the campus and since it is a small campus, making friends is not very difficult either. the classes I took there were very interesting and would recommend going to this college."
Freshman,4,"I love wesley college. It is such a small school which really allows the students to connect with the teacher. As a freshman, there are so many opportunities to explore on campus. "
Freshman,4,Small school. Overall pretty great.Cafe and gym has odd hours. In one dorm something always seems to be broken.
College Freshman,4,"My experience has been very positive, my school made it very easy to adjust to the new environment. My school is very small which makes it very easy to meet knew people and get to know your professors."
College Senior,4,The athletes are always helping other people out and do fun and nice fundraising events. they recruit people for sports team and always make sure they have each others back no matter what.
College Senior,4,"The diversity was great, the food was amazing and had  lots of different options. the teachers cared and helped every student that needed it."
College Sophomore,4,No campus crimes happen with the students. The area the school is in is bad which is where the crimes and assaults come about. Everyone at the school is fairly friends and know one another.
College Sophomore,4,Everything about the school is great. Not one thing bad I can say honestly. The help is there if you need it from staff members or even student tutors.
College Sophomore,4,Classes aren't to far from the dormitories. Clean once you move in and really have an option of choosing where you want to live after your freshman year.
College Sophomore,4,"At Wesley everyone supports all sport events. Fall, winter, spring sports are all a big part of the school. Majority of the students actually participate in one or two sports we have."
College Freshman,4,"I only went for a visit so far but I talked with students currently enrolled. They told me about the typical day of school, how it functions and etc. I think I will enjoy myself and get my studies done at this institution."
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy going to a very small school because the teachers and students are very personable and approachable.
College Junior,4,There is a great variety of courses offered each semester.
College Junior,4,"If you study well and develop a good relationship with your mentor, then you will find a job."
College Junior,4,Going to a small private college allows for one on one communication between the students and teachers
College Sophomore,4,"As a athlete on the Wesley field hockey team, I completely agree that sports are a huge part at Wesley. Other sports teams, including the hockey team, are fully committing for both studies and school work. The campus supports the athletes by attending games and keeping up with records and the seasons, but also students have each other's backs when we need to leave for a game and can't make it to lecture and need to have notes. As an athlete, it is hard to balance sometimes, which is good to have different friend groups so studying for different classes become easier. The locker room and the field also is a good outlet to find quiet to study, which is a perk for the athletes alone!"
College Sophomore,4,"I am very happy with my decision to choose Wesley as my school to further my education and sports career. The professors are easy to understand and open about any questions or concerns anyone may have. The professors understand that college is hard for the first year and try to work with you as much as they can as long as the student puts forth the effort as well. Living on campus was a new and fun experience and I've met some of the greatest people while being at school for the few short months of the fall semester, which made spring semester something to really look forward to. I'm happy to be returning back to Wesley in the fall and have high hopes of new things coming my way!"
College Sophomore,4,Really on their job and making sure everybody is safe.
College Sophomore,4,Love the variety of Greek organizations that's involved at the school
College Freshman,4,The new turf field they put it in last year over the summer is very nice and Wesley West which is only allowed for Wesleys students participating in the sports is a nice facility with lots of machines to work out with and to train
College Freshman,4,They make you have securitys' number in your phone and there are security posts around the campus
College Freshman,4,many greek lives at the school many to chose from if you get rejected to one
College Freshman,4,"Its great there, but it is really expensive"
College Freshman,4,"Help you find a career,"
College Freshman,4,its a typical college dorm
College Freshman,4,Most people i know are pretty great and easy to get along with
College Freshman,4,The professors are there to help. Variety of study options  are given.
College Freshman,4,The canpus is relatively safe.
College Freshman,4,The teachers are here to help you succeed as long as you bring in effort. Tgey provide great tools to help the students.
College Freshman,4,Everyone  take their jobs seriously.
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience is a lot different from many other freshman that I know. I personally believe that Wesley College is all about change and so am I so it works out. My school is unique because they do not try to label you or classify they allow you to be creative to your own ability. If I were to be where I was a year ago stressing on common application,wondering am I good enough? Wesley still would have been my top choice."
College Freshman,4,It's pretty good. college isn't over exciting.
College Sophomore,4,"My school is unique because of the diversity amongst my fellow students. We get to learn a lot from each other because many of us come from various ethnic backgrounds. Although my school is small, it is a heartwarming feeling knowing there is always a familiar face around the corner or someone I can talk to."
College Sophomore,4,"The academics at Wesley are great, but does not have many extracurricular clubs and activities."
College Freshman,4,They have been very awesome so far. Admissions was kind and informative. Same goes for Financial Aid.
College Junior,4,I was able to meet with a Financial Aid employee and found them quite helpful in the process.
College Freshman,4,"They have so many different options that accommodate almost all financial classes, and ethnicity groups."
College Junior,4,It varies with each program.
College Junior,4,"A lot of diversity, and there are so many different people to meet."
College Junior,4,"English is a great major, if you love it and if you dedicate.

We have Gibson, Clack, Bobby, De Roche, Maxson, Shipley and Turner, as well as some adjuncts. Having the top four, you'll know the struggle of writing papers and dealing with Clack's strict rules but its worth it. Even though the school doesn't care about writing or English, it is immensely worth it.

There are three concentrations and you have to be really careful that you catch all the English classes before someone goes on Sabbatical or it's only offered sometimes. It'll hold you back.

We have the 4th floor which is shared with Humanities, Media Arts and Religion. Media Arts has the nicer stuff but you can't get in if you're not in a Media Arts class or a major/minor."
College Junior,4,"As an English Major, I love my professors. I mostly deal with Music, Media Arts and English but I have taken Science and Math courses. With English, everything is left up to you. It really emphasizes critical thinking and in depth reading and I guess Lit Theory. Greto is basically the face of the Media Arts department now, and his classes are intense. As for Music, I really love it and reccommend it to anyone. Laganella is an ass but Wilson and Cass are cool.

I wish each program had more classes available and more professors. Departments are kind of small."
College Junior,4,"It's not a college town but you have Hibachi's, Yukon Bar and Grill, alot of Irish places, McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, Green Turtle and Chipotle. There are a lot of in between places that are good too."
College Junior,4,"I say it's great because we all know why we go party - to get turned up. And you get that at Wesley. If you want weed it's easy, alcohol it's really easy. And if you know enough people, you know where the parties are and where you can smoke. Most people 21 and over will buy alcohol for you and weed isn't hard to find. The biggest thing to remember at Wesley is NEVER.GET.CAUGHT. Literally ever RA will tell you how to get away with murder and all you have to do is listen.

As for parties, they aren't like the college parties in the movies. Diverse/Caucasian parties have house music/pop music/trap music and kegs. It's becoming more BYOB. Black parties are dark/and definitely BYOB with loud music and more of a dance/twerk feel. Go for the diverse parties. It's more fun and it's more social."
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of rules, vut if you obey them you can have a pleasant experience in the campus life"
College Freshman,4,The mall is close by and many restaurants.
College Freshman,4,Classes overall are good and professors are good at helping and andwering emails quickly. They are supportive in helping you in every way.
College Freshman,4,Our football team is really good. That is the only sport I have been out to see thete games. Alot of support from fellow students and parents.
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of lock downs due to criminal activity in the area, right around campus. There has been quite a few shootings around our campus. But you need to always travel with someone else."
College Sophomore,4,variety of restaurants and fast food places on the main road.
College Sophomore,4,theres lots of options to choose from
Niche User,2,"If Wesley college really cared about the safety and well being of their students, the amount of professors they have, slightly better dorms, better food, and student life. The school would be so much better. Because not as much students would be leaving the school at the rate they're leaving at if the school actually cared about their students."
Niche User,2,"I went here for one semester my freshman year and it was one of the biggest mistakes I have ever made. The school is dirty, homeless people sometimes wander through campus which should not be allowed. The food is the same thing everyday which would not be a problem if it was good, but it is not. nobody finishes here after 4 years. Everyone has to take an extra year at least because of classes. I came for baseball which was the only saving grace for the school. The party life is fun if you are old enough or look old enough to go to the bar."
Freshman,2,"Not the ideal school I had hoped for. More if anything a school for athletes, since it basically is a JUCO. Food is okay. Student life is terrible. Teachers are okay, just depends on who you got and if they like you."
Graduate Student,2,"As a former student of Wesley College (graduate of 2016) Be very careful attending this school. If you ever need to transfer be prepared, your credits won't! Some professors can be inspiring and other's make you feel like it's another day at the office. Some professors are there to collect a paycheck. The school overall is ok if you want a small school, but if you plan on graduating in 4 years FASFA says only 26%. Retaining students is only around 28%. My degree program forced me into another year (more courses) without consent which meant more money!"
College Sophomore,2,I attempted to join a greek life but it was very difficult
College Sophomore,2,The parties usually sucks here
College Sophomore,2,"Nasty, disgusting people. Terrible hygiene. Messy rooms. Overall disgusting"
College Freshman,2,I feel as if Wesley College makes us pay so much money for nothing although it is a private school it does not feel like that in the resident halls or the dorms. The room in the dorms are generally small and could be better but I'm not complaining because I learn to cope with things very easily especially change.
College Junior,2,"Everything time you go to the Wellness Center, you will get the diagnosis of Bronchitis and ""are you pregnant?"" Even when they had a real doctor they point you to every other clinic in the entire world. Go home instead."
College Freshman,2,I did receive my first financial aid package on time which was not a lot and then when i visited they told me i qualified for more which didn't even help.  Then they refused to sent me my new package after multiple times and so they wanted me to pay tuition in full.  I had to go back in person and settle it.
College Sophomore,2,no greek life. too cliquey.
College Sophomore,2,i feel like its going to be hard to get an internship at this school.
College Sophomore,2,"so much trouble changing classes, changing majors, some professors are good some are bad."
College Sophomore,2,this school is so expensive
College Junior,2,"Outdated and not worth the money. No need for sweats in the dorms, you'll be sweating just laying down. Bring bug spray!"
College Junior,2,Not worth the money at all. If you like fried greasy food you'll be in heaven. If you want fresh organic or vegan good luck.
College Junior,2,There's a list of rules. But it's basically just a piece of paper. Alcohol is in every dorm as well as drugs. Noise violations are a joke and nothing ever gets taken care of.
College Sophomore,2,A lot of the teachers have bad accents and are hard to understand. I don't feel like I learned much during my year here.
College Sophomore,2,A lot of poverty around the school that adds a lot of drugs and crime into the atmosphere. Some streets cannot be walked on especially during the night because of fear of harassment or crime.
College Sophomore,2,"The houses are pretty disgusting and seem like they are ready to fall apart. Although the landlords help with what they can, the house should much rather be torn down and/or rebuilt."
College Senior,2,a lot of cheating goes on
College Senior,2,you have to have your own transportation or car to get anywhere
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is mainly on the streets so there is potential for accidents to occur and when weather conditions occur such as snow, it is required to move your car or receive a heavy fine."
College Sophomore,2,"This past semester they have gotten strict about  visitors and different things in that nature, like you have to show your ID's its just to much sometimes. They treat us like little kids"
College Freshman,2,Not very preparing for working life after school
College Freshman,2,Dangerous and not much fun things to do
College Freshman,2,Accommodations aren't great. But it's not horrible.
College Freshman,2,The head offices are a pain to deal with
College Freshman,2,The area around this school can be a little rough
College Sophomore,2,the party experience would be better if there was a designated place for events. 
College Sophomore,2,its okay to live on campus there realy isnt enough to do but its sort of fun.
College Junior,2,"While there are a few minorities and international students come every semester, the majority of the students are African-American. Sexuality is just as underrepresented; I only know a handful of openly gay or bisexual students willing to break the stigma associated with their choice in partner."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life at wesley isn't really anything special alot of the chapters at my schools are all tool bags they dont really fit in to much with other groups like the sport teams, and there not really to big into throwing parties, mostly the sororities throw alot of the parties at wesley."
College Senior,2,"Students come from all different background, some rich, some average, and others less fortunate. Wesley College does not have a lot of international students. Most of the student body is African-American or white. Even though the school is in Delaware not a lot of Delawareans attend. Mostly everybody is conservative or liberal, not many in between. The religion is diverse."
College Junior,2,In majority of the restaurants they customer service is not the best
College Freshman,2,I seem to be allergic to everything out in Delaware.
College Junior,2,"I received some financial aid, but in my case it was not enough. The financial aid office at my school is not that helpful except for one person."
College Junior,2,"The dining hall at wesley is horrible there is no variety of food the plates, cups, forks and spoons sometimes look like they havent been washed. The food is horrible there is nothing nutriental nor is there anything that makes you want to come back the next day to eat. The best part about the campus is the wolverine and the den at the wolverine stop you can buy any type of snacks jucies fruits frozen foods that you like there is large variety. The den has good food and larger variety then the dinning hall. We are able to use our flex dollars at the wolverine stop and the den and we recieve anywhere from 150-250 depending on the dorm you live and your meal plan."
College Freshman,2,Options are limited and so are hours. My roommate and I frequently miss dinner as the dining hall closes at 7pm during the week and 6:30 on weekends.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms have upgraded with wifi, but the quality of the buildings suck. It is obvious these buildings have been here for years without any upgrades done to them."
Niche User,1,"I regret allowing my 2 kids to go to Wesley. I am sorry for those attending & pray future students reconsider. Major issues with admissions dept. &  don't support students at all. Health clinic has poor record keeping resulting in blocked transcript requests a year out. The athletic dept, a great recruiting ability & poor retention. The school wont maintain 0 drug tolerance program so use is free among students, can be found in most dorms. the impression was another way to make money the policy to fine student with drugs, increasing fines with each offence  with out notifying parents. Academics is mute subject since this school fails kids miserably. As one parent to another, dont let your kid go here!"
Freshman,1,"Honestly Wesley is one of the worst schools that you could choose in this area. The professors don't care at all, the advisors are only there to sit around and collect a paycheck, nothing in the school works, the walls are literally crumbling down around the school, and the classes are there just for you to waste your time. They are easier than my high school level classes were and if you want to be prepared for any work force you're going into, these classes will provide nothing for you."
Sophomore,1,"Wesley is a small school in Dover,Delaware. The experience at first was fun but then it became boring. There is very little school spirit shown in the campus activities. You are charged for almost every aspect at the school. The tuition is high for summer courses and it is very hard to transfer to other schools with the given credits."
College Sophomore,1,The food is not all that at all
College Freshman,1,There's always some shooting going on. It gets annoying and makes you paranoid when you go out
College Sophomore,1,"no activities. campus is dead, thats why everyone stays in their rooms after class/on the weekends, or goes home."
College Sophomore,1,There's like 10 majors to choose from and maybe half of them pay an average income. The education and nursing programs are the most time-consuming and demanding majors...you'd think they were going to school to be lawyers or doctors.
College Sophomore,1,"The floors in all of the rooms are disgusting. They look like they've needed new carpet for years. Everything in the rooms seem to be dated and there is a mold in some of the rooms on things like showers and sinks. Then when anything minor goes wrong in the rooms that should be expected, they charge hundreds of dollars for the fixes."
College Sophomore,1,The same types of food are served everyday. The food is always good when you eat it for the first time but after awhile the taste dissolves.
College Sophomore,1,Rarely is there goo food to eat beside sandwiches and salads. The meal plans are expensive. The meal plans are also based on the dorms you live in. I had a expensive plan which I barely used and was a waste of money. The food generally sucks.
College Sophomore,1,"We do not have a shuttle bus for students to get around or off campus. Anywhere you want to go to have to walk, take a taxi, find a bus or know someone with a car. Unless you are blessed to have a car. Wesley has a couple cars but they are always parked. They need to use them to take students to Walmart, the malls, to work ,etc."
College Sophomore,1,"There are not a lot of computers at Wesley. The students have to pay for printing. The speed of the internet is poor. The wireless access has became better, but there are still some problems. Incoming students should buy their own computers, and printers"
College Sophomore,1,"There is nothing really that stands out about this school. My time there was pretty miserable. Besides the occasional, decent professor and mozzarella sticks, there is not much to like. The dorms are nothing special and incredibly overpriced, along with the meal plans. The living areas always reek of pot and nobody cares. Many people at this school are extremely rude and don't care about others. The food is disgusting, and there isn't much variety. The surrounding area is excruciatingly boring and uninteresting. I tried playing intramural sports and they didn't have enough people to join the league, so I couldn't play. If I wasn't on the GI Bill I would consider Wesley a colossal waste of money. It is a pathetic excuse for a college experience. Save your money and go to a Community College and transfer somewhere nice."
College Sophomore,1,Not much to say about this.
College Sophomore,1,"Food is horrendous. When you go for orientation, they will trick you and make delicious food. Don't fall for it. I have eaten at the cafeteria four times this whole semester. "
College Sophomore,1,Food is repetitive and usually subpar. Don't recommend.
College Junior,1,"Wesley College nightlife is boring. If you don't have any friends it will be hard to have fun on the weekends. Recently, the only club that we had called the Lockerman Exchange got shut down, and this club was fun for students 18 and over on Wednesdays and on weekends."
College Freshman,1,"Dont Go Here – If you like the small school setting, and enjoying seeing the same group of people everyday...then this is the college for you. There are not alot of parties in dover at ALL. There is no student life whats so ever. the greeks are not big at all, and there parties getting kinda of boring after the first two. Im a freshmen, and Im ready to transfer to a bigger and better school!"
College Freshman,1,No Car=No Fun – Dover delware has nothing going on at ALL! You need to have a car to travel every where...even to the local train station which is 45 minutes away.The cab company is okay but the pay is some what reasonable. Some people only use there car for one thing and that is to go home!!
College Freshman,1,"Dulany Hall has everyday options like hamburgers, pizza, sandwiches, but you get quickly tired of seeing the same options everyday. The Den is the place to go for a meal when your doing work at night but the downfall to them is you never know when their schedule."

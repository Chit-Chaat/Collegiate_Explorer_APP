Graduate Student,5,"Este programa es el mejor sobre todo para los extranjeros, la plataforma virtual del nurse practitioner tiene incluido el brainfuse, con tutores todos los dias y a toda hora para corregir los papeles, esto es magnifico para los que tenemos aun problemitas con el ingles. yo les sugiero entrar a brainfuse a eso de las 4 am, alli estas casi solo y te pueden corregir un papel de 2 hojas en tiempo real. El FNP cuesta la mitad de lo que te cobrarian en florida. con ayuda militar es 23 mil y cada mes te cobran casi 400 pesos. los profes tienen doctorado, hay simulacion virtual de pacientes y casos reales descritos en aquifer, son como 150 casos y los puedes ver una y otra vez. esta 100% acreditado. casi todos se graduan."
Graduate Student,5,"I am currently a student at United States University. I'm in the family nurse practitioner master's program that is online. So far I am 2 months in to this 24-month program, and I am liking the program a lot. The program is very flexible with my schedule and the teachers are very nice and understanding. What I like most about this program is that my academic advisors are always checking up on me answering any questions that I have. I'm not the type of student that does a hundred percent of his work online come up because I feel that a more traditional setting suits me such as a classroom and a teacher. But this program is helping me every step of the way. The only gripe that I have with this program is finding due dates. The due dates are very vague and you have to click around the modules to find the due dates. I prefer the due dates to be right up front and user-friendly next to the assignment that is issued out."
Junior,5,Its been such a great experience...Online classes are very detail oriented and right one point. This is a trustworthy school.
College Senior,5,The majors that are offered at USU may not be as huge as other universitys however the one that are offered are very focused in the areas of Healthcare and Education which are two very needed areas.
College Senior,5,You will see a wide variety of diversity at USU from students to the teachers.  A wide variety of people with experiences and that is what truly makes the university unique  and makes everyone feel like that can be part of it as there is someone that they can relate too no matter their age or background.

College Freshman,5,"Dancer and Students – Yesterday, I was in class, and heard a music downtairs. Isaw dancers and singers. They were very happies, and they were dancing very good. I like my school, and I like dance."
Graduate Student,4,"I like that my graduate program offers start dates every other month. I also appreciate the payment plan they make available. I change courses every eight weeks which is very fast paces, but I feel that it works really well for me. I never thought I would be enrolled in a graduate program because of the required papers and thinking my writing skills were subpar. I have to say that I have enjoyed this program and I have doing really well. I would suggest that they work better with clinical placement coordination and keep the information consistent for all students. Initially, I was told that the university would be securing clinical sites for students. I found out that it was the responsibility of the student to find clinical sites and to get them approved. I was not excited about that aspect, but I was told early in the program so I have plenty of time to work on my clinical rotations."
College Sophomore,4,"Compared to Univ of Phoenix, this school is okay."
College Senior,4,There are so many people that come in and out of classes that you can get to know.  There is a diverse amount of backgrounds from younger to much older.  Reserve to very open and loud!  Everyone has different interests and you can strike up a conversation with just about anyone and get to know them in 10 minutes on a break and get to know an entire class!

Graduate Student,1,"I cannot recommend this school, I took on-line FNP course, some professor is MSN degree. One professor assigned 53 students, besides, curriculum is not organized, we have to group work (power point ) in whole semester of 8 weeks. Besides, Students suffered from three major tests, which are exam levels outside the scope of learning, and these exams accounted for 80% of the whole scores in the semester. I really recommend that ""don't go this school!!"""

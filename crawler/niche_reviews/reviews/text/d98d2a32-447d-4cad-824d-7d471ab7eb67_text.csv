Alum,5,"I loved my experience at Ohio Wesleyan University, I was able to participate in many activities while completing my major. The major draw of OWU is the ability to travel at a low cost."
Sophomore,5,I like Ohio Wesleyan because the professors are always there for you and its a smaller school so you can get to know more people
Freshman,5,I just finished my first semester and so far it has been a wonderful experience. OWU helps you choose the right path towards your major.
Freshman,5,"The professors are there to help you and make your experience personal. The atmosphere of the school is amazing and the campus is beautiful. It is super easy to find friends, even if you have a hard time talking to new people. Ohio Wesleyan is a school of excellence, and gives its students many opportunities to travel and get real world experience."
Freshman,5,"I love being a student at OWU!  My roommates, my classes, my professors, and my clubs have been wonderful.  I appreciate all the opportunities OWU offers and I hope I figure out how to take advantage of as many as possible."
Sophomore,5,I love it here! Everyone is very nice and there is a lot of diversity. The class sizes are nice and small and everyone is inclusive. This school has taught me that it's okay to be different.
Alum,5,"Extraordinary teachers; top-notch music department.  If I could go anywhere for college, I’d still choose OWU!"
Freshman,5,"OWU is a wonderful place, especially for STEM majors. There are many course options considering the small size of the school."
Sophomore,5,"As of right now, Ohio Wesleyan University is my favorite place to be. The campus and town areas are both really nice to walk around, the professors are all really lively, and the student body is very diverse. The only downsides are that the residence halls could use some maintenance, and the food quality can be variable, depending on the day."
Alum,5,"I loved my experience at Ohio Wesleyan. I am beyond grateful for my education, alumni connections, staff support, and faculty relationships. I LOVED living in the Honors House my senior year and Ohio Wesleyan is on the rise. The off-campus opportunities are incredible and are reflected on campus through the programs and everything else on campus. I love OWU."
Freshman,5,I believe it is the place where students can be themselves. The academics is excellent. The professors are great!!!!! Love the schools.
Freshman,5,"Small town atmosphere, safe, plenty to do, liberal arts, fun fun fun! Professors are readily available to help grow my learning.75% of all students are involved in Division 3 sports, with excellent facilities. Great coaches who want to see you grow and be better. Close proximity to state capital and job opportunities after graduation. 90% of  graduates  leave college with a quality job offer. Students are well rounded and able to overcome all issues faced to them in real life experiences . Career opportunities are plentiful, with over sees classes also."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy OWU due to it's small classroom sizes and the athletics programs. The food situation is poor, but they are making drastic changes next year. I would like to see the party scene be stronger, not that many people go out. The campus is beautiful, but it has some what of a depressing vibe about it that is caused by the students."
Freshman,5,"I so far love Ohio Wesleyan. I have visited many times, met most of the professors I will have, roomed on overnights with current students, tried the cafeteria food, went to a football game, and so much more. Since I live relatively close to OWU, I am capable of visiting much more than the average prospective student. Since I will be beginning classes in August 2018 I have been able to meet so many kind people who are so willing to help."
Freshman,5,"The classes are great and the campus is beautiful with its old architecture.  Food here can range range from very good to okay, but they have different cafes around campus. The sports teams are are pretty average."
Alum,5,"Ohio Wesleyan is a great, small liberal arts school. Student-professor relationships are very strong, and academics are rigorous. Student life isn't very vast as the school small, but it is still interesting and fulfilling."
Freshman,5,"Ohio Wesleyan is the most beautiful campus I have ever stepped foot on. The beautiful historic buildings, with very historic backgrounds! Every person I pass by has a welcoming smile, to accommodate a very welcoming school. The professors are very helpful, and can help lead you to success. I am OH-WOO!"
Senior,5,"It's a wonderful place, small and safe, to take your first steps of semi-independence from your family and not only learn about the world through academic pursuits, but also to learn about yourself. It's fairly self-contained, but a short drive away from the city of Columbus, OH, where those who may enjoy the hustle and bustle of a big city can go and explore and have fun. I would like to see more diversity in terms of some of the course offerings and areas of study related to the subject of international studies, but that may just be a personal nitpick of mine. Overall, Ohio Wesleyan is a great place to step outside what you've always known and get opportunities to travel and learn about places and people different from yourself."
Freshman,5,"I love the university. It is very friendly and there are a lot of of different opportunities, not just in academics, but in other ways as well."
Senior,5,"Ohio Wesleyan University is everything I could ask for in a university. The people -- students and staff alike-- are very welcoming, caring, compassionate, and driven. I couldn't be happier with my decision to attend this college. I have learned more than I could have ever imagined. The professors make me feel intelligent, inquisitive, important, and safe. I have learned so much about the world, too because of all the culturally diverse lessons taught in every field of study. Every day I walk through campus or attend a lecture, I feel grateful for the educational opportunities granted to me and for the worldly knowledge I gained during my time at Ohio Wesleyan University."
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman that just completed orientation at OWU! The professors care about you and want you to succeed and the community is very inviting. The campus is beautiful and looks amazing, and the residence halls are maintained well and very clean and beautiful."
College Freshman,5,School itself isn't easy but it is worth all the effort you put into it. The professors are all excellently equipped with knowledge and they are always willing to help
College Freshman,5,You run into people that you wouldn't have dreamed you would meet in ohio. The amount of diversity is crazy and i love
College Freshman,5,It is clear what goes on but it isn't in your face. If you don't want to partake you don't have to avoid parties or people there is no pressure to do what you don't want to.
College Freshman,5,I love Ohio Wesleyan and wouldn't want to be anywhere else
College Freshman,5,"The alumni alway come back to give back to OWU they have donated funds helped with projects and, created some projects for the school. A lot of the alumni become very successful."
College Freshman,5,All the dorms are nice. It seems like something is being renovated all the time to make campus more like home.
College Freshman,5,Coaches are concerned with not only the students performance but their health and classwork as well.
College Freshman,5,Ohio Wesleyan is an community type environment that supports everyone inside it. The professors and students all have a passion for what they do and it is inspiring.
College Sophomore,5,"I joined Greek life and I've loved it. It's a great way to meet people, and you get to know and become friends with some amazing people. At my school, you don't have to go Greek, people don't judge if you do or if you don't."
College Sophomore,5,"I've loved my experience at school so far. I've made a lot a friends, got involved, and I feel there is a great sense of community on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"OWU is a place where you come and you change for the better. I am not the same person that I was just one year ago, and I accredit that to the relationships I have formed in the OWU community. The professors want to see their students do well and strive to make themselves available to their students. Students are able to quickly integrate into the social culture here do to the open and welcoming nature of the people here. The experiences that I will gain at OWU are those which I will take with me and remember for a lifetime."
College Freshman,5,"I would choose OWU over again because it has given me so many opportunities already, and I am only a second semester student. I am already spending my second semester abroad in Tanzania, conducting research and studying the Swahili language."
College Freshman,5,99% of students either get into grad school or get employed in their fields - OWU is the best place for career prospects if you can just get a degree.
College Freshman,5,I have found so many oppertunities here. The exploration is limitless and encouraged here. I feel like everyone here genuinely wants to see me succeed.
College Freshman,5,I love this school they are very helpfull and there are so many opportunities for basically anything that you want to do.
College Sophomore,5,"Both Delaware Police and Campus Public Safety patrol and are readily available to help. There are blue buttons across campus. 

There are OWU alerts (text, call, email) in case anything happens near or on campus to keep students aware, but they are not often needed. I have not heard of many problems on campus. It is a very safe area, and fellow students are really good at helping with anything, even the tiny things like dropping something. It is a very friendly and supportful campus."
College Freshman,5,I love this school so much
Recent Alumnus,5,Ohio Wesleyan University is an amazing place. I would definitely go back if I had to choose a college again.
College Sophomore,5,Perfect environment to cultivate self-growth. Excellent travel opportunities. Wonderful professors and helpful administration.
College Sophomore,5,Sports here is absolutely fantastic. Students take pride in schools athletics and the athletes are humble about it.
College Freshman,5,the financial aid people continue to meet me and help me in every way they can. the school accepts aid repeals and gives out book cards and are just very helpful in trying to making the education possible.
College Sophomore,5,I have a car and i walk to a lot of places.
College Sophomore,5,Financial Aid Office is very efficient
College Freshman,5,It's extremely safe they send out many different warnings if there is something that is going down.
College Freshman,5,I'm a pledge so yeah i find it awesome
College Sophomore,5,"We have great facilities for athletics as well as the sciences. Also, all of the student resource centers (in the library, writing center, etc) are very accommodating and help students out greatly when they need it. Many students are involved in Greek life, and I think its one of the best parts of our campus, people just get together and have a great time in each others companies."
College Sophomore,5,"I enjoy my program very much, the teachers in my department are very supportive and active with the students. Since I am a Health and Human Kinetics major, most of my classes revolve around fitness. So most of my teachers are very hands on and active with the students rather then sitting the whole time, we do a lot of hands on activities that help us to know better what exactly we are doing and I think it is amazing. We are also getting a brand new top of the line facility for our department and I can not wait for that."
College Freshman,5,I am challenged and I love going to class everyday.
College Junior,5,"I am a double major and I love both programs! One of them is in the process of rebuilding and the professors are young, but they are both extremely intelligent and have a lot to offer. The other program is pretty solid and expanding which is very exciting."
College Junior,5,"There are several local places that accept our campus card. Each semester we are given 100 off campus food points and some of the local places will accept those. Its really nice! There is a variety from pizza, to burgers, to coffee, to Mexican! There is also a local farmers market that accepts our points."
College Sophomore,5,"The academics will piss you off, but they're incredible"
College Sophomore,5,I couldn't be happier after going Greek
College Sophomore,5,They do whatever it takes to help
College Freshman,5,"Ohio Wesleyan is an extremely diverse university. My school really prides itself on diversity. We have many students from all different states and countries. In my freshman class alone there are 28 states and 31 countries represented. Besides the diversity of the students, there are many clubs that discuss diversity through showing the students other cultures. Diversity is a main characteristic of OWU."
College Freshman,5,"I am a science major so my major is extremely challenging. I have a heavy work load and many expectations that have already been set for me. The prestige of our school only helps us students when applying for graduate school or jobs. There are numerous opportunities for internships and other opportunities. Although the courses are difficult, the professors are great and always willing to spend their time helping you."
College Student,5,"There is somewhere for anyone who wants to join, but no one is ever really pressured into joining. Greeks from different chapters mix with each other and with non-greeks and often people will live in suites with unaffiliated people and multiple chapters represented."
College Freshman,5,"Public Safety patrols frequently enough and you get their direct number for emergencies, RA numbers are posted in the dorms, the police/fire/emergency departments are very close to campus, there are emergency lights and phones, there's a safewalk program if you feel you need to feel a little more secure going back to the dorms after a late night study session in the library. I feel completely safe on campus."
College Freshman,5,"If you don't like to party, that's fine, there aren't that many anyway, usually a get-together atmosphere, and you won't miss out on anything. There are parties though, campus sponsored and not of course. If you do go to a party, there is absolutely no pressure to do anything that you don't want to. I go to parties to dance and socialize, no one has ever forced or made me feel pressured to do something, but they are kind enough to offer! 

Usually parties happen on Friday and Saturday nights. Get-togethers happen any night of the week of course, but the lively ones start up around Wednesday. I usually spend time with my friends in one of our dorm rooms. "
College Freshman,5,"Political affiliations are easy to find, groups in support of minorities or progressive movements, religions, sexual orientation ect. are too. There are clubs, organizations, and sometimes even walks or rallies for any and everything. The campus is very open and everyone stands on equal ground. There is no negativity towards one's views or opinions, just the wanting to grow from both understanding opposite views and sharing your own. In short, highly diverse, no judgment campus. "
Junior,4,Professors went out of their way to help students during this time and made the best of a very odd situation.
Freshman,4,"This school has a very good environment and the people are just generally lovely! Most of the professors seem like they actually care about their jobs and about students learning, which makes classes a lot more enjoyable. A few professors are terrible, but you'll find that at any university. In the first month I made so many friends, and the culture is just so wonderful."
Sophomore,4,"The school is easy to navigate, the professors are very helpful and easy to talk to, and the liberal arts travel learning opportunities are absolutely amazing."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the university as a whole.  I'm a swimmer, and I love the D3 sports atmosphere.  However, there definitely good be some improvements in terms of housing (they are in the process of renovating) and diversity on campus."
Freshman,4,"It is my first year of going here and I absolutely love it! I am currently studying zoology and music. I recently applied for a trip to Spain that is in May, so hopefully I get accepted to that. That's what I love about Ohio Wesleyan University, they have this thing called study abroad and travel learn courses that the school pays half for. It gives us a chance to experiment our majors into the fields we desire."
Sophomore,4,"When I first came to Ohio Wesleyan University, I was nervous. Nervous because it was a new scene and I was not sure how I would transition. Ohio Wesleyan made it pretty easy to get to know the people around me and to make friends quickly. Soon, Ohio Wesleyan became a place where I was able to discover myself and find who I truly was. Choosing to apply to Ohio Wesleyan was something I did after visiting one of my friends here, but choosing to stay, was something I did all on my own. This school has given me so many opportunities to be able to find out what I really want to do with my life, given me some really amazing friends, and find my true self. Ohio Wesleyan is not only a school to me, but it is a place where I can be my true self and feel welcomed. Ohio Wesleyan is home."
Sophomore,4,The professors are very helpful and understanding and the academics are rigorous. The party scene can get boring and the food is not great.
Freshman,4,OWU has so many study abroad opportunities. They have kind staff members willing to help you get acquainted with their OWU connection that way you can spend some time learning in another country.
Alum,4,Small campus but not too small to know everyone. Professors get to know you as a person and you get to work one on one with professors.
Freshman,4,Its a great school educationally and most students are very involved in clubs or sports but the surrounding area doesn't have much to offer and you do need a car to go to Columbus
Senior,4,I would like to see more diversity and involvement around campus. The professors and faculty are amazing. They are truly passionate about what they do and always willing to go the extra mile for you. I've met wonderful people including my best friend. Its kind of a bittersweet feeling leaving next spring.
Sophomore,4,"OWU has a small, tight-knit campus. The students really get to interact with their professors.
(currently enrolled here)"
Sophomore,4,"I begin my sophomore year this August, and at first, I was very unsure about attending a small university in what some people would say is located in the middle of nowhere. However, my experience thus far has been nothing but positive at OWU. In all areas, whether it is academics, student life ... etc. I've met amazing people and made significant and unique connections. I will for sure be here until my senior year."
Junior,4,I've truly enjoyed my last 3 years at Ohio Wesleyan. The small school atmosphere provides a great sense of community and I appreciate the small classroom size. The professors truly care about your success.
Freshman,4,I love OWU so far!! The academics are wonderful and my classes are very enjoyable and push me to work hard. I am happy with my choice of school and have joined many clubs and extracurriculars.
Freshman,4,"The environment here is great. There are many interesting, weirdly wonderful people that attend here. The professors are encouraging and helpful, but also tough."
Sophomore,4,"I love the small, close-knit community. The professors really want each student to excel and get to know them on a personal level that does not happen at larger schools. The range of majors is excellent for a campus of about 2,000 students. I have had such a great experience with Ohio Wesleyan so far, and I can't wait for the years to come."
Sophomore,4,"It has the best professors. On some occasions, the weather is pretty hectic due to the weather in Ohio.  If you have the chance to attend here, take certain classes with professors because they have the best and insightful lectures you can ever see and attend.  This is one of the highlights of Ohio Wesleyan Universtiy.  As a student and an investor in my education, this is one of the best place to invest in yourself due to the amount of help you can get in this school, Ohio Wesleyan University,"
Sophomore,4,"My experience my first year at Ohio Wesleyan was incredible.  The faculty goes above and beyond for students at this school to help you not only understand the material being taught, but to give you a better experience in your first year and allow students to feel more comfortable while adjusting to so many differences we have coming from high school to college.  I also became a Greek member during my second semester and so far it has been an amazing experience.  I have made countless friendships, have became more involved with the community in Delaware, Ohio and it is a great way to have study groups for all kinds of classes."
Freshman,4,"Very welcoming, it is absolutely perfect for me. The environment is very friendly, professors are very accessible. So many different groups to get involved in. "
College Freshman,4,I know the school does a lot to educate students about safety. I always feel safe on campus
College Freshman,4,I have heard great things about all Greek housing options. And I have seen them do some great things for the community . Although I am not involved it is something I consider doing often.
College Sophomore,4,Public Safety is always around and they are always willing to help. I personally did not feel comfortable walking home from the library one night and they were very nice and gave me a ride back to my dorm. They are easily accessible and friendly.
College Sophomore,4,"I like how I am walking distance from my classes. I know some halls have more community damage than others. I liked my dorm my freshman year, and I like the building I will be living in fall semester."
College Sophomore,4,"I would say people are involved with athletics at my school. A lot of people attend the games, and they have a variety of sports that people can choose to be involved in, some require experience, and some athletics can be joined with no experience at all. Its a nice mixture that allows people to be involved."
College Junior,4,"I love most of OWU, some things I would change, but I would not change schools."
College Junior,4,It really adds a lot of good times to your college life and helps develop a brighter future.
College Junior,4,There are always opportunities to get involved and people to talk to
College Senior,4,I work-out regularly with friends and meet new people there.
College Senior,4,I am OWU (Ohio Wesleyan University)
College Sophomore,4,"I have never personally felt unsafe on campus! I do tend to avoid a couple of the fraternities that can sometimes be ""sketchy."" But in general I always feel safe!"
College Sophomore,4,The science professors have all been very enthusiastic about teaching. I have taken some history classes and I found them incredibly disappointing.
College Sophomore,4,The Alumni come to visit quite often and make generous donations.
College Sophomore,4,I have greatly enjoyed dorm life. I just wish the dorms were a bit closer to the classrooms. Sometimes I also wish that the campus was more closed off (gated) from the residential homes
College Sophomore,4,The academics are amazing. The professors really try to help the students in the best way they can.
College Sophomore,4,"I've never been to a sporting event at my school, but I know they have a big draw. My boyfriend and a lot of my friends are involved in different teams, and I know they've all said it's a very rewarding experience. The facilities are also amazing, including the new gym, which was renovated just last year."
College Sophomore,4,"I love being at OWU for the people, the opportunities available to me, and the things I have been able to do in my two years there. The faculty in my department is amazing, the communities I'm a part of are incredibly supportive, and I'm constantly encouraged to do and be my best. I'm incredibly glad I chose Ohio Wesleyan University."
College Sophomore,4,"The community is very small; everyone knows each other. It's a support group of caffeine-induced, struggling-to-be geniuses being fed mediocre food but being taught by the most caring, personable professors around. I never thought I could enjoy my education this much."
College Freshman,4,"Public safety is very good, we always get email alerts when something is going on that it even slightly unsafe."
College Freshman,4,"I only have minimal issues with the campus and university. Beyond that, it's everything I dreamed of and more, and I'd do anything to make sure I get to stay here all four years."
College Freshman,4,"It's a college in America, but it knows that and tries to be better for it"
College Freshman,4,"OWU has been everything I wanted a more. The people are everything I could've asked for in a friend, the environs are perfect with everything I could need in walking distance, the professors are passionate and ingenious, and the university makes every effort to work with its budget as well as possible. The only complaint I have is that the campus itself needs better maintenance and tending."
College Freshman,4,"I have not had too many experiences with health and safety here, but when I injured my thumb everyone acted quickly and were truly helpful in making sure I got to the health center and that I would be comfortable after my visit."
College Freshman,4,For the most part I feel like the professors are genuinely interested in me and teaching me.
College Freshman,4,People love sports here and honestly most of the students support games at OWU.
College Sophomore,4,"Course are hard and push you. It is important to talk to the professor with questions or if you aren't doing as well as you life and they will help you with study suggestion, what to work on, etc. I do wish there was more class options, but there is also an independent study option I haven't taken advantage of. Scheduling can be stressful but the school and teachers work with you to figure stuff out. 

Class sizes are personal and great! It is so much easier to learn with smaller class sizes! Most of mine are like, 10-25, but it varies depending on class level and subject. 

There are many different class styles; the OWU Connection, travel abroad, Honors, labs, independent study classes, travel-learning courses (which are sweet!), and more!

Professors are great and really know their stuff! They want you to do well. You have to go to them for help, but then they definitely work with you!"
College Sophomore,4,"The school creates strong and dedicated graduates. 

They have lots of career and internship people come to campus, but I do not know a lot about it because there are not many Education internships and I have not looked into it."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms at OWU are a pretty good size. Larger than many other schools I have seen. There are two dorms with community bath, mainly freshman live there. Other dorms are more of a quad style. So you and a roommate, and then two suite-mates. Welch and Hayes are my favorite dorms but they all have perks, it depends on personal preference! For suite style with bathroom included, they clean the bathroom for you once a month. Smith and Stuy have air-conditioning, all dorms have heat. The RAs are cool and chill! Welch is the typically honors dorm and it has more quiet hours which is peaceful for studying."
College Sophomore,4,"Because sorority's do not live off campus, there is more room to mix and the girls get along with each other better because they are not stuck together all the time. I am non-Greek but my friends are about half and half. Its cool because they invite us to their service events and are not too cliquey. Nobody judges whether you join greek life or not. They do some cool, creative events on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I have worked in the athletic offices, and the coaches and athletic staff are great. Academics are stressed and they come before sports. The coaches truly want you to do well both on and off the field. Fan support is especially high at football, lacrosse, and basketball games; but other teams get support too! There is a renewed athletic workout and weightroom facility and it is amazing! Greatly improved and available to all students."
College Sophomore,4,"The diversity and acceptance at OWU is amazing. I love my coach and friends. The small class sizes are great because I get to know my professors and the people in my classes. It also means the professor is usually able to get to everyone's classes and they are really good at working with you. I am an Early Childhood Education Major and I am so glad I chose OWU, the Education program is amazing! I am learning so much and I have been able to work with kids each year to gradually ease students into the classroom."
College Freshman,4,"Science is hard. Language is ok, mostly there just because its a general education requirement. Math is good but kind of watered down to fit in a semester. Music classes are interesting as well"
College Junior,4,"There are many people with strong passions on this campus. It is difficult to attend OWU and not have your mind changed or viewpoint altered on a social justice issue. I was nervous about this being a residential campus at first but living in close proximity to others encourages relationships to flourish. I have made incredible friendships. Many of my professors, especially the younger/newer ones, are fantastic."
College Junior,4,"OWU is highly ranked by Forbes. It is top 200 in the nation, that being said there are so many opportunities here. There is a lot expected from you as a student but you can always get help. With the campus and student body being small it is easy to get to know everyone and fit in."
College Freshman,4,"I feel my school greatly challenges me, but in turn also provides me with the resources to seek extra help and ultimately succeed.  My choices were pretty small just do to not applying to that large a number of schools and waiting to late to respond to others, but in the end I still was able to attend one of my top choices in Ohio Wesleyan University."
College Sophomore,4,The administration of the school is very friendly and helpful. Most of the students are cool as well. The campus is beautiful and most of the teachers are very passionate about their profession.
College Senior,4,"Hambo is the best. It is a diner in town that we can use our off-campus points at and is open 24hrs a few days of the week. Good food and is always serving breakfast. Opas is okay. Typhoon is pricey but really good. Son of Thurman's is really good if you are not a vegetarian/vegan. Amatos is a hit or miss. Jimmy Johns is great and delivers. Mi Cerratos is good. Dragon House is really good and delivers. There is a Wendys, KFC, Burger King, and McDonalds pretty close. There are multiple places to get pizza, including Dominoes, Papa Johns, and Pizza Hut."
College Sophomore,4,We didn't attend college just to eat food. The food here is okay.
College Sophomore,4,The Campus Housing is great!
College Sophomore,4,"There are various places to eat off campus whether it's a local restaurant, subway, or a café down the street. Someone is basically always open, but some places close early. We get plenty of food points to use off campus as well."
Junior,2,"OWU has wonderful professors and I've made great friends on this campus. However truthfully the university continues to let down students and not provide enough safety. Sexual assault cases are rampant on this campus and though OWU claims to have resources for victims, those resources often do nothing for students. They avoid punishing rapists and provide little help to victims in the process.

The dorms are disgusting yet all new/updated buildings are dedicated to freshman, assumably to help with OWU's terrible retention rate. In terms of housing, you're screwed as an upperclassmen. And the university purposefully makes it extremely difficult to live off campus. 

OWU also treats its minority students as ""tokens"" in order to brag about diversity but offer very few resources to minority students and the campus itself is incredibly segregated.

The main redeeming thing about OWU is the professors. They are some of the best people I've ever met and the main reason I haven't left."
Sophomore,2,"I'm currently a Sophomore here and am about to transfer out after this semester. If you have a wide range of personality, thinking, and don't like to settle for bare minimum, then i think you should know that OWU definitely will NOT be for you. This is a school for small town, small minded people, with very little to offer. I've literally met some of the worst people at this school and some of who I thought were the best. Be wary of the classes, they present themselves to be one thing, and completely end up flipping on the head after the class changing period passes. Unless you are a serious science major, this school really doesn't have much to offer. sorry not sorry lol."
Freshman,2,"My experience here at Ohio Wesleyan University has not been the best. If you are conservative, someone who doesn't like to party every weekend and doesn't play any collegiate sports then maybe OWU isn't for you. I am all of the said things and I have made no friends here. I was extremely social in high school with friends, I was captain of my soccer team and I was on prom court. This adjustment has been horrible and I am transferring out after this semester."
Senior,2,"The professors I've had have been great: they're excited to teach and talk to students and most are very friendly/helpful if you're struggling.
There are also lots of travel opportunities. I've been able to take courses that include 1-2 weeks of travel as part of the class.
However, housing is terrible.  I've been forced to move in the middle of the year; various buildings have mold, bedbugs, and collapsed ceilings; and even though I have documented medical housing needs that the school recognizes, they won't accommodate me (there aren't any rooms left because they made half the dorms freshman-only for this upcoming year). Even the new sluplexes that they just built are in bad condition after 1 semester (leaks dripping through the ceiling, cracks in the walls, uneven stairs) because they were built cheaply and quickly. I've had such a bad experience with housing that I would have transferred if I didn't just have one more year to suffer through."
College Junior,2,I don't really want to comment
College Freshman,2,"It is not good to be in a sorority because you're not allowed to live in the houses. I am not involved with Greek life, but it seems like it is a big hassle that people are always complaining about. The sororities do not do very much and it doesn't seem like very much fun here."
College Freshman,2,"It is a small school, and the athletics are not that great simply because there is not a large pool of people to choose from. The school is more geared toward academics than athletics, but athletics are still given recognition. A new fitness center was opened this year for both athletes and non-athletes that is very nice. A lot of people participate in athletics, but it seems that it is more just for fun."
College Freshman,2,"I have not had a very good experience at my school so far because it is not very good for my major. I can't take as many classes in my major as I feel I need, and the classes that are available are not as intensive as I would like to be and I don't feel like I'm learning as much as I should. The program is not as rigorous as it is at other schools, and I fear that after I graduate I will not be as good as other people in my field. I have also had some problems sleeping with my roommates and haven't made very many good friends. The professors, however, have been very kind and helpful. All of the professors I've had have been very personable and approachable, and I feel that I have learned a lot from them. The school and the students are very friendly and welcoming, and the fact that it's a small school makes it easier to get to know people."
College Senior,2,"Chartwells is terrible here, and students frequently get sick, especially when they first come here and their stomachs are adjusting. There is a lot of fried and greasy food. They say they have good options for vegetarians, but it is really only pasta, salad, and fruit. It is even harder for vegans. Smith is disgusting, and the only real option on the weekends. Thomson Store is nice, but everything is way more expensive than at an actual grocery store, and some of the food on the shelves is expired. They do have some good things there though, and it is nice to have that easy option. The Bakery in Hamwil is the best! The workers are really nice and remember the regulars and their orders. Hamwil Cafeteria is okay, but repetitive and greasy. Bishop Cafe is good but takes forever. Stuy Cafe is good and convenient."
College Freshman,2,"OWU is considered a residential campus. Students must live on campus unless they live in Delaware, County or apply to one of the 5 exemptions. The process of trying to get off campus is long and you wait a long period of time even though you will probably be denied."
College Freshman,2,It has gradually gotten worse each year with tuition increases and decrease in admissions.
College Sophomore,2,"Right now the athletic facilities are in welch, the honor dorm, and in a garage. The actual lifting facility is under construction but will be state of the art when it is finished."
College Sophomore,2,"It honestly depends on the person, like some people really enjoy the night life, but I find it pretty repetitive and if only the walls of clanceys could talk because there has been some freaky sh*t in that bar."
College Freshman,2,I want to live off campus but the rules behind it are hard to get around. I also like living on campus so i'm bias
College Freshman,2,the area is pretty bad and the reason why i might transfer..
College Freshman,2,I did not get very much money
College Sophomore,2,The school makes it nearly impossible to live off campus. They want us to have to pay room and board.
College Junior,2,"There is little to no off-campus housing available. In order to live off-campus, you must either have a medical reason or a permanent address in the area. That basically means you must live there all year which is not easy to do, especially if you do not have a car."
College Freshman,2,"Well there is no night life, very few house parties and the bar scene is terrible"
College Freshman,2,"It's a small town, and there is not a whole lot to do.. plain and simple"
College Freshman,2,You would think we were children
College Freshman,2,"The parties are not enjoyable because it typically involves the same group of drunk kids. Once the parties fizzle out, the crowd moves to the local bar, Clancey's where students under the age of 21 have to pay to get into a bar where they can not drink. I feel the dull night life is the reason why many students drink an excessive amount and partake in drug activity."
College Freshman,2,"Many students here drink and do drugs. Some students only partake in these activities on the weekends, but some also partake in these activities throughout the week. I have never seen so many students smoke weed. I feel this is the case because Ohio Wesleyan is a liberal arts school so many students see nothing wrong with it. I do not smoke nor drink and sometimes I feel left out. I also believe the weekend scene does not help. Since we are a small university, students feel like drinking and doing drugs are there only options, when in reality that is not the case."
College Student,2,There isn't really much to do off-campus in Delaware city unless you have a car.
College Student,2,"I've never been to a varsity sport game, and I'm not alone."
College Student,2,"One day it feel like -10 and then 5 days later it will be in the 50's. Also OWU doesn't cancel school unless of a level three warning, which is when the police could fine you for going outside it's so dangerous. That means school never cancels class even if a 15 minute walk could cause you to lose your nose and ears to frostbite."
College Freshman,2,The passes are expensive ( on top of the already expensive cost of school) and it's impossible to find a spot. They give out expensive tickets to people with passes who park where they aren't supposed to because there aren't any spots for the people with passes to park which isn't fair at all. 
College Freshman,2,"None of the dining halls are open late and the variety is very limited. They recently remodeled the main dining hall and it's nice, but at the residential dining hall I've found hair in my food multiple times and the quality is pretty bad. The staff is really friendly though and you can tell that the school is trying to improve the dining quality. "
College Freshman,2,Townies are sketchy and there is nothing to do
College Freshman,2,"Its pretty f-in terrible. Nothing to do in Delaware, OH. Except Clancey's and thats only fun if you're extremely drunk."
College Sophomore,2,"The drug scene is a pretty decent size, not non existent but not huge. A decent amount of people smoke. But other drugs are as popular as drinking because both are equally accessible. However, if there are any issues there is a fire station located in the middle of the campus with more than capable EMT. Most cases involving abuse of alcohol or drugs involve freshman and most life threatening incidents involve alcohol, not drugs. But more often than not, there aren't many issues are far as I can see."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking on campus can be awful. Also, Public Safety will ticket without a warning if you accidentally park in the wrong area. Parking is not marked very well. There is also only B parking, which costs $100, while there is no C parking, which costs only $10."
College Sophomore,2,"Although there is not a lot of options on campus for nightlife because Delaware is a relatively small city, we are in such close proximity to Columbus and if you know people from various organizations, there is always something to keep you busy."
Recent Alumnus,2,Public safety is pretty strict on just about everything it seems. Not to mention DPD prowling the streets looking for trouble.
College Freshman,2,"If you want drugs. You can get drugs. There is no limitation on what kind of pills, alcohol, what have you, available to the student body. You just have to know where to look. EX"
College Freshman,2,"When it gets hot, it can also be humid which is uncomfortable. It snows a lot as well and classes are on the other side of campus so it's inconvenient. This winter we didn't get too much snow. Classes are practically never cancelled due to weather. It gets pretty windy, so most of the time it feels colder than the temperature is."
College Freshman,2,"Off Campus food points dwindle really quickly because they tax. Smith Hall's food is pretty much the same every day it gets tiring. The quality is hit or miss. Hamilton-Williams cafeteria has better options, sometimes. University Hall food cart is good for a quick snack between classes. The Thompson Store has more options but it's easy to lose food points that way because its the most convenient. Be careful with buying too much."
College Freshman,2,Theres constantly students drunk on campus every single night of the week.
College Freshman,2,"My first semester was not planned well due to a first time teacher in english department trying to help me with setting up classes for Medicine study.  I feel that it would have been better if someone from the health and medicine studies department had been my counselor.  I had to two health classes (biology and chemistry) and Latin.  I was told to take latin to help with the medicine later.  Now I am told that Latin is not used as a language, but just for body parts and medicine names which we can learn during the classes.  I could have taken Spainish and done better from my high school knowledge. I had to drop chemistry.  This has put me behind already in my first year."
College Freshman,2,"The town is around 40,000 people.  It has some shopping malls, restaurants and movie theaters. But no real sport teams or large attractions for college students.  You can get want you need, but entertainment is low."
Alum,1,"I did not take classes online, nor were they offered. However, I know during COVID-19 all classes were shifted to an online platform."
Freshman,1,"I am currently a freshman here at OWU but I'm not sure how much longer I will be attending here. If you feel like a small school isn't for you then I'd encourage you to not apply here. Socially things have been extremely difficult for me as I have not been able to find a sense of belonging. It's important to note that I am not in a sport or Greek life, and at least in my own personal opinion, if you aren't involved in either you sort of get put into no man's land socially speaking. The parties, sports, and surrounding town are nothing special. While this isn't the school for me though, it'd be unfair to say that is bad for everyone. Some people can thrive here and kudos to them. I am not one of them though."
Niche User,1,"I would give this school one star if I could. The two years that I spent at OWU were without a doubt the worst two years of my life. The campus sucks, Delaware is sub-par at best, and the parties are wayy below average. The professors and classes are ok but honestly nothing special. Not at all surprised that this school has a garbage retention rate. If you are considering attending this school I'd highly reccommend you discuss other options, unless you want to spend four years at a below average school in a shitty midwestern town. That being said, I'm happy for those who have had a good experience at OWU, just be wary before you send a deposit."
College Junior,1,depends what your opinion is
College Junior,1,Per usual to college dorms
College Sophomore,1,"OWU is a residential campus. Off-campus housing is basically nonexistent unless you live really close to the school. If you have a special issue or reason to get off campus housing, it is really hard to get it approved."
College Freshman,1,its freezing all the time
College Sophomore,1,They treat the student population like children
College Sophomore,1,The school makes you jump through hoops for it
College Student,1,If you want to leave Delaware city you need to get a car. We have carshare on campus but it cost 10$ per hour.
College Freshman,1,There aren't any clubs here and the only bars in town are sketchy. Underage nightlife is pretty bad and can get pretty boring. To get to any good bars/clubs you have to drive to Columbus which is 30 minutes away (there isn't public transportation that goes all the way to Columbus). Good frat parties are pretty rare but they can be fun. 
College Senior,1,"Ohio Wesleyan recently changed their policy and their new aim is a mostly/completely residential campus with a few exceptions. If you are married, 23+ years, or are living at home with your parents or gardians and commuting you may live off campus. Very rarely other exemptions are allowed and many students are cheating the system. These changes have decreased the wellbeing of students at OWU."
College Junior,1,"As of 2012, now almost NO ONE is allowed to live off campus. The cost to live on campus is insane. You can only get off campus if: 1) you have a child. 2) You are married. 3)Fifth year seniors. 4)23 or older during the academic year 5)some mental or physical condition that the university cannot accommodate.

Unfortunately, cost is not a viable excuse.

The actual off-campus housing around the area is actually quite nice and easily affordable!"
College Junior,1,"Juniors and seniors can buy better parking passes than freshmen and sophomores. If you have a lower parking pass, it is really hard to find a close parking spot. They tend to ticket if you are not parked correctly. I have had bad experiences with parking..."
College Junior,1,"Public transportation is very inconvenient -- it only runs on weekdays during the day, when most students are busy. Aside from shuttles to and from the airport, the university does not provide any transportation services. Though you can easily get around Delaware on foot, getting to Columbus is difficult without having a car or knowing someone who does."
College Senior,1,"Everyone's Favorite Game: Monopoly – Chartwell's is the sole food vendor on-campus, and, like most monopolizing factions, takes full advantage of the situation. While serving staff is friendly and colorful most of the time, some individuals are kinda sketchy, or utterly lack inspiration to provide all but the most basic levels of service. They attempt to be creative in offering a variety of foods, but only if you go to the campus center. The quality of the food is lacking most of the time: only the sushi provided is of merit. The dollar-to-food point system is a complete scam, and the food itself is overpriced, especially if you go to the convenience store. "
College Senior,1,"They REALLY hate to see you go. OWU wants its students to stay on campus, and they have no fear of hiding that desire. The process has become a complete joke, and deprives students of valuable experience in living apartment style while actually paying rent and managing their affairs. Also, if you want to live off-campus, you'd better have enough money to feed yourself for the year, because guess what? NO FOOD POINTS FOR YOU. That's right, the lifeblood of the OWU student, food points, and you get nothing. You lose! Good DAY, sir!!"
College Sophomore,1,"Be Ready for a Fight – Parking is pretty bad on campus. Unless you have a B pass (which is upperclassmen) or an A pass, be ready to drive all over campus for a parking spot. Parking as a Sophomore and as a Freshman can be quite the assignment all in itself."
College Freshman,1,"There are basically no off campus housing options, and it is very difficult to get one. However, I think the University makes up for it by offering numerous ways to dorm here on campus. There's your obvious college dorm room, with renovations going on in Stuyvesant. There are Frats and Greek life, and OWU has what they call a SLU. A Small Living Unit are various themed houses that put on themed activities and functions every year. They are really awesome and one of my favorite parts of OWU and I think they make up for the lack of off campus housing."
College Junior,1,Few and Far Between – The campus itself has scheduled parties at the frats and other houses on campus. They normally involve themes and can be very good or very bad. There are a couple bars but only one lets you in if you're under 21. Overall not a big party school though you could find it if you looked.

Freshman,5,"This is a great school that provides a really personalized education. The classes are small so every professor is able to get to know the students. It has a beautiful campus and a lot of great opportunities to get involved in music performance, student government, sports, and other on-campus activities."
Freshman,5,"Because of the Covid-19 pandemic, all of the professors have made transitions to online learning, and it's been really easy to track and submit assignments on Canvas. There are also office hours over Zoom, and the school gives every student an iPad and Airpod Pros to make having class over Zoom an easier experience. All in all very good."
Sophomore,5,Everything online is simple and easily navigated. The systems make sense and everything is a high quality.
Sophomore,5,"I LOVE Southern Virginia University. I have never felt more at home anywhere. The climate is perfect, the landscape is beautiful. The school has high standards and holds to them. The people who go here are friendly and clean, the class sizes are small, the professors are amazing. I love the town. I love the school!"
Freshman,5,I have been working with the admissions department to secure my finances for my upcoming Freshman year.  I have just returned from a 2 year mission and needed some guidance.  They have been amazing to work with and very understanding in my circumstance.
Freshman,5,I have only worked online with through their website for housing and enrollment in my classes.  Everything has been easy to navigate.
Sophomore,5,"Great community! Southern Virginia University is dedicated to its students and education. The classrooms are small enough to where you get to know your fellow students and your teacher. Professors are great at scheduling office hours. Overall, a beautiful campus, amazing teachers, and beautiful scenery!"
Sophomore,5,"I was very skeptical at first for the online transition SVU was taking, but was pleasantly surprised at the efficiency. Very smooth transition and very attentive teacher. If technology would get tricky, they would fix it immediately."
Freshman,5,"Their esports program is great! I already had won a tournament with their team! It's a new program, but could rise fast!"
Junior,5,"They made this as smooth as possible. Training us how to use the online platform before we left was a big help. It made everything less stressful and easier to handle. Teachers still expected you to work, but were less harsh on the grading. Everyone did a wonder job!"
Sophomore,5,I love that the class sizes are small enough that I feel like I get individual care and help on things I don’t understand. Sometimes it takes me a longer time to figure somethings out but the professors are amazing about taking the time to help me.
Freshman,5,I have had such a great experience working with the admissions directors and those who help the students to get involved and have their needs met while attending the university.
Freshman,5,"It's beautiful and the small classes help me to learn. The atmosphere is a caring, and nurturing environment. The school's morals align with mine and help me to be the best I can."
Freshman,5,"I love the diversity and the inclusion I feel at this University. I am a college freshman and Southern Virginia University is pretty far from where I am from, but I was able to feel at home because of the students there that were able to help me adjust to my new surroundings."
Freshman,5,This school has everything to offer to include my education support and safety.  SVU offers so much on a scale of a smaller industry which is great. The cost is affordable and everyone has your interest at heart. They make me feel like I'm family.
Freshman,5,"This is an amazing school!!! The teachers are amazing everyday, and make sure to show the students their passion for teaching and how much they care about you. It’s a cute little area, and there’s a sort of camaraderie about the place. Truly an amazing first semester experience. While the majors and minors may be somewhat limited, there is a plethora of classes to help you experience different areas of study. The people here truly care about the students and education!"
Niche User,5,"The university is absolutely incredible; the campus is beautiful and has a very vibrant atmosphere. One thing that I love about Southern Virginia University is the level of involvement, in a couple contexts. First off, a high percentage of students are involved in an extracurricular activity; there are many opportunities to find a passion and get involved. On another note, the university works with students to get involved in a real-world context; students are encouraged and guided to different internship opportunities to be able to give knowledge and experience. I also generally love that, as a smaller university, there is more of a chance to get to know your professors better and to really, deeply further your education."
Junior,5,"I love this school because of its small class size as well as its great teachers and advisors who take a real and genuine interest in me and my education. 

I enjoy participating in many of the extracurricular activities that the school offers and the wholesome environment the school and its students create."
Freshman,5,The campus is just overall wonderful. I love the fact that it’s small and it’s nice being able to have more of a relation with your professors. They’ve got many different career paths and they make it possible for me to attend college.
Niche User,5,The representatives who have contacted me to update me on information have been very helpful and have made sure I know everything I need to know. They have also been very patient with me and supportive of my college choices.
Niche User,5,A great and small town and perfect for a small university. The people are so involved with the school and the teachers care about the students success. The environment was pretty and the majority of the students were members of the church of Jesus Christ of latter-day saints.
Niche User,5,"Southern Virginia University is a great friendly and proactive environment, where the teachers and overall staff is dedicated to seeing the growth in every student, not only as learners but mainly as human beings."
Senior,5,I loved it! It's small and has a great learning environment with just enough social things going on in my opinion.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus at Southern Virginia University. The campus is comfortable and student friendly, a really great environment for all. If you're looking for a better teacher to student ratio or for greater understanding of each subject because of all of the one-on-one time with the teachers. The staff seems to really care about each of the students. One of my favorite parts is the nature around the campus, its very peaceful. Its perfect for studying, relaxing, and pondering about everything and anything. Its a college that adjusts to people and their needs and likes.  This is the campus and college for everybody and I truly believe that."
Sophomore,5,"I love this school. The environment feels like family, the faculty and staff work with you personally, and the classes are small enough to foster discussion and more independent learning. I have been able to pursue my interests in many fields, including athletics, music, and academics. The school strives to uphold a moral code and an environment that is accepting of ones personal beliefs, while also fostering a Christian belief system. The people are what make this place amazing."
Freshman,5,"I love SVU's educational philosophy. They really understand what it means to be a liberal arts university, and they are focused on helping us become strong leaders."
Sophomore,5,I loved the small class size and the opportunities to participate in almost anything you wanted to.  The majors may not be many but the ones they offer are exceptional.  I am only a Sophomore and an able to do internships and gain real work experience.  We are taught by the professors and not TA's.  I have not had a class with more then 25 students in it.  I can email my professors and have them email me back the same day.  I feel safe here.  There are activities for everyone.  The student life staff works hard to provide fun things do to.  The President is even very accessible.
Freshman,5,Though it is a small University it provides a low stress environment for students to be successful.  It is affordable and provides a well rounded college experience with a bit of Southern charm.
Alum,5,This was such a rewarding school to go to! I would not trade my time learning and growing there. The professors are so knowledgeable and have a lot of real world experience. You are able to have a personal relationship with them because class sizes are small. It's a great environment to learn in!
Freshman,5,I like the class room sizes . I also like that the teacher can be one on one with you.That they can send you out into the world ready for work. I wouldn't change anything
Alum,5,This school is the single most important that  got into medical school and I am now a physician because of it. The academics are incredible. At times as a student I felt the school was too academically rigorous; I now see the benefit that rigor had in my academic development. I have also seen great improvement in the way the honor code is interpreted and enforced in comparison to how it was when I was a student. They have changed to avoid judgement and allow for more personal expression.
Junior,5,SVU is awesome. I am amazed everyday of the opportunities and the desire for greatness that the campus brings. Everyone is so freindly and the professors are awesome!
Niche User,5,"SVU has an absolutely stunning campus and the college community is friendly and hard working. The music program, which is one I have been looking into a lot of recent, and interested in pursuing, is very professional, and willing to answer any questions, and invest time and effort into bringing hard working and talented students into their program. I am impressed with the quality of the student participation in answering questions specific to the music department, or questions about the general campus and living. Quality of professors is very high, and I have talked to some of them on a personal basis, and they too are willing to invest time into encouraging and helping students. Overall, a wonderful University, and I would proudly say, whether this was anonymous or not, that I consider this University one of the highest of its kind in the nation."
Freshman,5,"Southern Virginia University is a historical campus overlooking the charming small town of Buena Vista. Classes are intimate and the professors have a good relationship with each of their students. There are a wide variety of clubs, such as Mixed Martial Arts, The SVU Underground, The choir group, ""Fading Point"", the comedy troupe, ""Shenanigans"", and much more. Performances put on by the students are remarkable and professional. 95% of the student body identifies as Christian and Sundays are observed with church services and hymns. I would like to see more affordable tuition so that the students can keep coming to this wonderful campus to study and grow."
Senior,5,Great growing school with lots of exciting things happening! This has been the perfect place for me to learn how to think and learn how to be accountable for my own success. This is a place where people come to thrive
Senior,5,"Fantastic School. I'm a senior and I have loved the quality education I have received and the opportunity to participate in multiple meaningful extra-curriculars. I am a full-time student involved in the men's tennis team, student-athlete advisory committee, and part time work at the school doing actual work in the business world. The Professors are incredible. I literally texted 2 of my professors last week to ask for help on homework problems and they helped me. They actually care about you, your education, and your future opportunities. I would recommend it to anyone. Students are also nice, lots of LDS kids."
College Freshman,5,"It's a small town. so not much goes on and everyone looks out for each other. If you don't feel comfortable walking home or anywhere on campus, there is a shuttle and campus security sometimes picks you up."
College Sophomore,5,They know me by name and are extremely helpful in all that I do.
College Sophomore,5,Safest community in the state of Virginia.
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the work the teachers put into teaching and helping the students succeed.
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone lives by an honor code, and that includes chastity. I trust my peer's integrity to that code."
College Sophomore,5,"I live in The Lofts, and it's the best!  Good sized dorm room and bathroom and a lot of lobby area to hang out with friends and such."
College Sophomore,5,SVU is a relatively new school. It's their 20th year anniversary this year and they are just now putting in a football stadium. The fields are in great shape and the training room is 10/10.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The best school for your money. Will get the best education, friendly people and teachers."
Recent Alumnus,5,helped me learn a lot
Recent Alumnus,5,the best in the country
Recent Alumnus,5,loved my experience so far
Recent Alumnus,5,The professors and courses are amazing. I have one professor who is always coming and asking how life is going and what he can do to help me with my graduate school endeavors. He is a truly phenomenal man and his classes were incredibly enlightening. You always feel cared about.
Recent Alumnus,5,"This school changed my life. It wasn't my first choice and I only applied on a whim. The support and love from professors and other students is astounding. The fine and visual arts here are AMAZING. It's a pity they have to deal with such poor facilities and lack of funding. And yet, they still thrive and end up being some of the most successful students that graduate. They work hard, know how to deal with less than ideal situations and still create some of the best art that evokes emotion, thought, and provides entertainment. Truly a wonderful place for the arts."
College Freshman,5,"As a small town country girl, I enjoy the community feeling of this school. I know it is not for everyone, but it's definitely right for me. All of my professors know my name, and would help me if I asked them to. You can't get that at every school.

The variety of classes is good, and engaging. Each class is different, and the same class can differ greatly depending on the teacher."
College Freshman,5,"As a creative person, a Liberal Arts education is the kind of education that I need. I find the classes challenging, the clubs enjoyable, and the environment to be uplifting. A small town college, it is less impersonal than a community college or larger university, and I am able to get to know classmates and professors much better than if I had gone to a larger school. I am very glad that I chose to come to SVU, and wouldn't choose differently if I had the chance to do it again."
College Sophomore,5,"Small Classes, awesome teachers. I had one teacher tell the class on the first day if you miss two classes without a email to me I will come looking for you. I thought that was awesome that a teacher would care that much about their students."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel that I am very safe on campus and in the community. Small school, small town equals safety."
College Sophomore,5,"The teachers are very easy to work with, especially when you are having a hard time understanding. Every university employee that I have come in contact with during applying or attending make you feel that they are glad you are here."
College Junior,5,Its awesome I wouldn't change it for the world.
College Freshman,5,I know I choose the school that best fit my needs.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The education is phenomenal--it is personalized, the professors truly care about your success, and it is rigorous. I loved participating in a myriad of activities at a competitive level. I would choose SVU a thousand times over."
College Junior,5,It is a small liberal arts college with the best and most caring and helpful faculty you have ever met. It is a clean place and is largely LDS or religious. The campus is the most beautiful campus ever due to the fact that it is sitting in the Shenandoah valley in Virginia. It is a wonderful place to learn.
College Freshman,5,"No complaints.  Never an issue, OPSS will take care of anything."
College Freshman,5,The honor code is clear on this. It is pretty much grounds for expulsion if you are caught drinking or drugging.
Senior,4,Nice for students looking to attend a smaller university. There are a few general options for majors but the environment is nice. Professors are easier to meet with and there are health services and tutoring available.
Senior,4,"I'm not too keen on online experiences, but SVU has made it a little easier. We have a good plan in place to encourage safety of students and professors. Everyone has an IPad and meets via zoom for online classes. Communication is sometimes iffy when the wifi fails but that isnt a frequent occurence."
Freshman,4,"I have not taken class yet here, but I a am part of their esports team and I have connected with them and the coach seems very analytical and asks of his students to provide the why's behind every move they make. So it provides a deeper understanding of what we should do when we play!"
Freshman,4,So far I have loved being at SVU. I'm looking forward to the next three years that I will be there. The professors are great and really care about you because the classes are small enough that they can get to know you personally. There are more than 20 athletics teams which means that if you want to do sports than you probably can.
Freshman,4,"It went well, the professors were very considerate of the struggle that everyone is going through. I am still in an online class for the summer semester and my professor is quick to respond to questions and has made every class asynchronous so that if we can't make it to a video call than we will still get credit for the day."
Junior,4,"If you are anything like me, these reviews matter a lot so I am going to be 100% honestly. SVU is a very small school, some see that as a negative, but I see it as an advantage. You are able to truly get to know your professors and classmates. You are getting as close to a one-on-one education as you can get. The teachers really bend over backwards to help you do your best. 
The reason I gave it 4/5 is that being a smaller school, there are limited class times available and sometimes things overlap. The teachers are amazing and super understanding, it can just be frustrating to put together a schedule. It can be though!! I am a biochem major that has a passion for music and am able to take all my science classes while being in a choir and taking other courses that I enjoy. 
What really makes this college stand out is how God at the center of everything. The students here are some of the nicest people I have every met. If you are looking for a quality Christian education, this is it!"
Junior,4,I love how the classes are small. Most of the teachers are super understanding. They are willing to work with you after hours to help with assignments that you don’t really understand.
Sophomore,4,"Southern Virginia is a beautiful, small-town college with a lively student body. For people who want a quiet, but meaningful, university experience, I recommend it highly. Students can build meaningful relationships with their professors and participate in clubs that are tailored to their interests. Students get out what they put in. Getting involved in hands-on projects is what these programs specialize in."
Freshman,4,"The class sizes are very good for focused learning. The recruitment staff is excellent, and SVU brings new ideas to the table that have not been seen before. They offer a referral scholarship."
Senior,4,"The education at SVU was wonderful. The professors were always knowledgeable and open to helping. The administration was frustrating at times, especially in the area of communication."
Senior,4,"Southern Virginia University is full of people who care about the school and each student enrolled in the school. There are excellent, qualified professors, and plenty of other students and faculty alike who are anxiously engaged in helping you get the most out of your experience there. With a wide breadth of classes there are many opportunities to try out new things and participate in various programs even if it’s outside of your particular major. In many ways it is a great place to learn and grow.
However, in recent years there has been a bit of a shift in the educational priority of the school and the focus now seems to be more on recruiting and growing the size and monetary value of the university, rather than sustaining or increasing the quality of providing a well-rounded, Liberal Arts education for each individual student. 
Even so, there are still wonderful people here and opportunities to be involved in some wonderful things."
Junior,4,"It is a great school academically. There are small class sizes with professors who care and are always willing to help and work with you. Athletics are awesome and allow most students to continue their athletic career at a D3 level. The only negatives are the size of the school with only about 1,000 students and the location, it being in a very small town that is pretty remote."
Junior,4,"During my first experience here, I thought of Southern Virginia University as a ""settling"" school; the only reason I was there was because I had missed the deadlines for all the better colleges. Many of my complaints regarding the school still stand: the campus is small; the food is inconsistent at best, and the school's budget does not yet allow for a staggering variety of majors and minors. However, I have come to realize that SVU has something going for it that very few private universities can claim: the faculty cares. They really do. I have had maybe one experience thus far where I struggled in a class due to lack of cooperation from a professor. I also cannot understate that it is thrilling to be a part of a college that is growing this rapidly. I really feel as though I'm helping to build something huge. As far as small liberal arts colleges go, Southern Virginia is just about as good as it gets."
Senior,4,"Among the most amazing schools, would recommend to any seeking a great environment and wonderful professors."
Junior,4,"SVU is a great University. It’s small with a tight-nit community. The classes available are great, and the professors here are super nice. Although many people love small universities, I feel that SVU’s main issues come from being so small. There isn’t much to do in town, it’s difficult to not have a car since most things to do are driving distance but not walking distance, and there just aren’t as many classes available as I would like. However, SVU does plan on expanding within the next two years or so, as does the town it is in. This should solve most of these problems, I assume. And even with these issues, my overall experience at SVU has been pretty great."
Freshman,4,"Southern Virginia is a great school that enables you to meet many people and get to know them personally because of its small class sizes. Professors are more than happy to help students with questions about assignments, tests, and school in general. Because the class sizes are few, you are able to get to know your professors on a personal level and it makes the classes more enjoyable. If your looking for a school that has good moral values and a friendly environment, Southern Virginia University is perfect!"
Junior,4,"SVU is magnificent. the campus and surrounding city are small, so there are limited opportunities for jobs and parties, but DC, the beach, and countless historic sites are all within a few hours, so weekend trips are easy to plan. the faculty is extremely qualified and dedicated to helping students succeed instead of weeding out the ones who do not care. the building is old and historic, but beautiful and charming."
Freshman,4,"I love SVU.  It's a small school, which comes with the benefits of the professors being approachable with questions, and even being open to becoming friends with the students.  The campus itself is rather small, easily walkable in only 10 minutes or so.  The internet speed there was not so great when I was there, but I've been told they've made that faster.  It is somewhat lacking in degrees, I admit, but they've added several in the time I've attended."
Freshman,4,"Southern Virginia university is a hidden treasure among Latter-day Saint communities. While it holds the same standards as utah's BYU, the small student body and the liberal arts experience allow for effective professor-student relationships and a personalized four years."
Junior,4,My experience at SVU has been a fruitful experience. The professors are eager to engage into conversations of immense depth and meaning. The assignments that I have received have pushed me to new limits toward sharpening my work ethic. The school continues diligently to establish a solid program and they are heading in the right direction. For anyone looking for a positive environment founded on faith I say come join with us.
College Freshman,4,SVU is definitely growing so it has a ton of potential.
College Freshman,4,We have a high rate of graduating students and the career center works hard to help the students get jobs during and after college and advance onto grad schools.
College Sophomore,4,I like it. Good space and good place to live.
College Sophomore,4,I haven't really looked into a job on campus.  I have a job off-campus.
College Sophomore,4,So far I love the professors I've met.  I know that they care about me and that they want the best for me.
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone is so nice to me.  Everywhere I go people are asking me what my name is and everyone is so encouraging for me to join clubs, committees, teams, etc."
College Freshman,4,Our school works really hard to pair their graduating students with jobs in their field of study so that they have a smooth transition from school to work.
College Freshman,4,"With everyone having the same beliefs, for the most part, it feels pretty safe."
College Freshman,4,"It is a place where people who have the same standards can be together without the fear of being judged or singled out. With such a small class size, students are encouraged to participate in everything they can. The campus may be small, but it is breathtaking!"
College Sophomore,4,They offer many options when it comes to the Arts.
College Sophomore,4,The Honor Code is enforced when it comes to drugs. SVU expects you not to partake.
College Sophomore,4,"Wish freshman girls didn't have to stay in the Lofts, otherwise it's great."
College Freshman,4,Good if you are a female
College Freshman,4,"I don't actually go there yet, but I love it."
College Sophomore,4,We have a high rate of seniors getting jobs.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I'm a theatre major and music minor... there is only so much I can do if I want to go into acting. HOWEVER, they are ALL incredibly helpful when it comes to trying to find other ways to use my degree. I am now looking into drama therapy and a couple other long-term career goals that would involve theatre and  yet still allow me to perform on the side."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I feel pretty safe. OPSS is always willing to lend a hand, walk you home, etc. when you feel like you need help or are uncomfortable."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Many, if not most, students are involved in extracurricular activities. A good chunk of that is sports.  Lacrosse, cross country, tennis, basketball, soccer etc. are all really good sports that do well that I love seeing get support. Our football team is awful and yet they get all of the funding. It's incredibly disappointing and frustrating. Not many of the games are well-attended, but every sport does get some attendees."
College Freshman,4,"Our campus has a fairly low risk of anything happening, but there are still occasional incidents. Of course, we have easy access to the security, and there are leaders and teachers in place to help take action to protect victims of assault, and to stop assault.

Crime is low.

I do not like walking up to my dorms in the dark, but that is more of a concern of what could happen as opposed to something is actually likely to happen."
College Freshman,4,"Each professor is qualified to write strong recommendation letters to future employers. They are all well learned, and take the future of their students seriously. We just recently had an education group come down to campus to meet those who are looking to become teachers. SVU values a good education, and many of those who get degrees here are able to go on and do many creative things with them in the future."
College Freshman,4,"A good majority of the students are involved in sports in one way or another. Our teams, while not best in the nation, work together and are well coached. Our school spirit gets higher during different sport seasons, and there are always at least some students in attendance at games."
College Freshman,4,The housing facilities are nice.
College Freshman,4,There is nothing to worry about when on campus.
College Freshman,4,The advisement plans here are a huge help.
College Freshman,4,Love my classes and my professors.
College Freshman,4,"A small campus where everyone knows everyone  and most are LDS, it's pretty safe. There was a public safety incident not too long ago and the town and university took it very seriously and kept all well informed and safe. The worst crime I've heard of is theft, and even that is rare. it's a really safe campus that also focuses a lot on making sure students are aware of Title 9 and who to contact concerning such."
College Freshman,4,"First off, the classes are small, it's a small campus with a small student body. But this smallness makes for great professor-student interaction, the professors are able to know their students individually and help them learn and excel. The diversity in class subjects leaves much to be desired but they have great options nonetheless."
College Freshman,4,"I board in the Lofts and they are fantastic. Spacious and well furnished, not to mention the showers have good water pressure. They are clean and the rules coincide with the Honor Code so it's mostly dependant on ones own responsibility."
College Freshman,4,"Its a great school with a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere. I actually feel like I am learning well compared to my high school years and the professors really know how to interact with and assist their students. It is painfully small but that in it's self is a pro and con and the amount of diverse subject classes can be improved. But as a growing school things will change for, hopefully, the better. The landscape is beautiful and it really is a great learning environment."
College Freshman,4,"The Lofts are the girls dorms. They are fairly new, built in 2010 ish. Robey and Crayton, the boys dorms are old and out dated. They are currently being renovated."
College Freshman,4,"I love SVU. Registration is mostly simple, and if there are problems, the Registrar is there to help. The professors are all great, very passionate about their topics. All family oriented as well. Workload isn't terrible, but it can challenge you if you are working at your level."
College Freshman,4,"I love the school environment and the amazing support by all the staff, students, and professors."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a small school which I thought I would hate but I ended up loving. My school is unique because it feels more like a community than a school. Everyone tries to do their best but they don't put down other people to get ahead. I feel that that in itself is rare. The professors all really care about their students and want them to succeed. 

I would definitely choose my school again. It is where I am supposed to be. In fact, you could say I found my niche."
College Junior,4,Administration is very involved and compassionate
College Junior,4,"The housing is great, and it's easy to find what works best for you. Resident Assistants are involved and informed, and if there's a problem, it's solved as soon as possible, whether it be with the facilities, internet, etc. All campus housing is close to the main classrooms - a short walk, 5-10 minutes maximum. The girls who attend SVU definitely have the better housing - there is a relatively new dormitory with private bathrooms for each room, as well as common areas with amenities."
College Senior,4,Academics can teach you on a one on one process.
College Freshman,4,"Didn't have my major, but all classes and professors are great.  Required courses for majors are well-outlined and straightforward."
College Freshman,4,"Plenty of places, nice people, nice places (for the most part), good prices"
College Freshman,4,"The Lofts are really nice, but it's really the only option girls have."
College Freshman,4,"We have a Mac lab, which is great.  No computers are ancient, they're all nice."
College Sophomore,2,There are parking enforcers but no real security.
College Freshman,2,Our sport teams need more work and our facilities our terrible.
College Junior,2,Incredibly limited and not high quality.
College Senior,2,It's a small Mormon school in a small city. What would a person expect?
College Freshman,2,"My high school had more spirit.  Football is great.  Other sports, you can go to laugh.  We are D3 so it's kind of a joke anyway"
College Freshman,2,"Two options: cafeteria or Jonzzeys.  Jonzzeys is so good but a little pricey, caf is not so great but free with your meal plan. If you don't have a meal plan, the caf is not worth the 7 or 8 dollars"
College Freshman,2,Very strict but most students don't abide by rules anyway
College Junior,2,It's a small school. There can only be so much.
College Sophomore,2,Unless you drive to Lexington or Washington D.C. there's not much to choose from. Unless you like Mexican and Hardy's
College Sophomore,2,"The dining services here are average, they could be better. The places around campus provide a little bit better venue if you want something better then the average cafeteria food."
College Senior,2,"It is a small campus, so there is no transportation on campus. However, if you need to go into the town next to us, the school does offer shuttles."
College Junior,2,"There are very few off-campus dining options in Buena Vista.  There are two or three non-fast food restaurants, but it is a very small town.  The closests town, Lexington, has much more options."
College Freshman,2,"It's great being so close to class, but the dorms are terrible. Sometimes there is no hot water, there are bugs everywhere, they stink, and are beaten-up. I did not pay a bucketload of money to come to a school where the dorms are dreadfully less than adequate."
College Junior,2,"Very Similar – At Southern Virginia University, most of the students are of the same race, religion, political background, sexual orientation. However, there is a minority that is not, and the students are good at accepting everyone."
College Junior,2,"The only real option is to take the Library Shuttles. They take you to the nearby town where there are grocery stores and other universities you can study at. However, the shuttles only run at certain times."
College Sophomore,2,It's Really Old – Because the school was built in the 1800's it's really old. The building are really small because only 800 students go there. It is a private institution so it's hard to get funding. There isn't a lot of extra money to go towards the facilities. I would like it a lot better if the housing and building were nicer.
College Sophomore,2,"There's really not a lot of parking on the campus, but that's really not an issue. The campus is so small that there's really no need to drive to get around, and more than 90% of student housing is easily within walking distance."
College Freshman,2,"LDS Evironment – Partying is not the focus at Southern Virginia University. In order to find parties and such, one must go looking for it. Transportation is up to the individual students who own cars."
College Senior,2,"They Need More – See above.  Too many cars for few spaces, but they are planning more."
College Freshman,2,"Diversity is very limited here at SVU. There are very few people here who are not caucasion and not mormon. Since it is small you see the same people daily and it feels like living in a high school only less diverse. The dining hall does not offer that much variety and the salad bar, which is basically the only part that serves things that I would eat has bugs flying all over it. The places to walk to around here are very limited, there are a few interesting shops in antique buildings down town. The nearest department store is Walmart, a fifteen to twenty minute drive from campus out of town, all other department stores and malls are at other towns that are about an hour drive away. I would say that the good thing about this place is that the police station is infront of campus and another security office in campus. The people are very nice here and small businesses offer convinient services to students such as a haircuts for a very low price. They do not have a track here nor does the fitness area have any trendmills other than a broken one. The area can be a very nice place to run and the hills are very strenghtening."
College Senior,1,It's a small city in a small area. What would you expect?
College Freshman,1,"Activities, shopping, food, attractions, sports= nonexistent and I wish I was exaggerating.  It's 45 minutes to civilization.  Townspeople are nice to students, though. SVU students have a good rep"
College Freshman,1,"SoOoOoOo lame.  Get a car, get out of BV."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no public transportation at SVU. However, it is a small college town so if you need to get somewhere you can easily walk or ride a bike."
College Freshman,1,Small Town – Buena Vista is your typical little town. Most people that live here seem to know each other and there not very main chain stores.
College Freshman,1,"Quite Dull – There isn't really much to do here. The LDS environment and honor code limit what can be done. There are some things to do from time to time such as movies being played in they gym or other activities. The campus,as well as the town, starts to shut down around 9:00PM"
College Freshman,1,"You've got to have your own car, or someone you know has to have one.  Which means spending a lot of money is gas money.  The closest thing worthwhile near you is a Wal-Mart that is fifteen minutes away."
College Freshman,1,"There is no greek life, the campus has no parties and you can almost do nothing fun.  You can't drink coffee, tea, you can't use tobacco, you can't drink, you can't wear sleeveless shirts, and cannot use cursewords, you have to shave your face daily, and if you don't do these things you are subject to be kicked out of school."
College Junior,1,"Conservative Environment – Most of the activities at the school are more appropriate for middle school kids, rather than college kids. If you are not interested in going to the school dances (which are heavily monitored by Honor Council so you do not do anything ""inappropriate""), you have to invent your own ways of meeting people.  Our sports teams are a bit mediocre so the only support that the teams get are from themselves. Team spirit is low at SVU. The athletic facilities are acceptable, but we could use a better gym, I feel."
College Junior,1,"The Underground – the school will have some activities, but those are few&far between. the school has an honorcode which is easily upheld because it's in the middle of nowhere, but there's an underground and those parties are hit or miss fun-wise."
College Sophomore,1,"Buena Vista: a Spot of Unwanted Isolation – Buena Vista, back in its hey day, was once a quaint small town. However, after the flood, BV was sapped of what was once a place of significant importance. There is little to do outside of the campus. If a student wants to get a hot cup of coffee at a Starbucks or go to a decent Chinese restaurant, the student is forced to travel about forty five minutes out of the way to Roanoke. The artistic aspect is also severely lacking. Again, if a student, or anyone for that matter, wishes to go to a museum of any sort, they are forced to travel to Roanoke. It is an ideal spot for a retiree seeking the quiet life, but it is lacking on a grand scale for the college student who wishes to start fresh and on their own."

Senior,5,"I started and am about to finish at the University of Wyoming, and I can say I have no regrets about my decision to pursue a degree in agriculture here. Overall I have had wonderful experiences with my professors and made tons of new friends from all over the U.S. One thing I will say: If you hate the cold, don't come here. Its very cold and windy for a large part of the year, which I enjoy, but it isn't for everybody. The campus is beautiful and there are tons of opportunities to get involved on campus and make new friends. Overall I'll be proud to call myself a Cowboy alumni at the University of Wyoming in a few months, and would recommend the school to people looking to pursue a degree and career in agriculture."
Freshman,5,"University of Wyoming lays it all on the plate for you, and are really straight forward. If you are struggling they will gave you aid. To be honest it was not my first choice or second or third, the beginning of 2020 I looked up school up North bc of the environment I always wanted to live in. I took a tour before COVID-19 and fell in love with the campus, the people, and how they explained the education they have to offer. They are so involved with their students and like they say ""there is not anything you can do around here, you'll always be busy and have something to do around campus"". The support you get from other students and instructors is unbelievable. Highly recommend this University to students."
Alum,5,I loved my 4 years at the University of Wyoming. My professors were amazing and very supportive. Class sizes are small. Campus life is very active with many different opportunities.
Junior,5,Due to covid I have had to do remote learning but it is just as great as in class learning. I feel like I'm getting just as much help and knowledge as I would be getting in person.
Junior,5,"The University of Wyoming is an amazing school. The campus is beautiful, students are all very kind,  and classes are great."
Senior,5,"WONDERFUL. Everyone is working as hard as possible to make this whole pandemic as smooth as possible. It is not easy and many individuals are quick to criticize. However, we are getting an amazing price for online school. Not only that, professors are working as hard as possible for both themselves and the student to have a somewhat good and fair experience online."
Senior,5,"This is a wonderful school. There are many options for classes, degrees, research, jobs and more. The tuition is AMAZING for both in and out of state students. Our school spirit it incredible, especially in the Fall season with football (yay for D1). Laramie weather isn’t my favorite but you can make the most out of the campus. There are great arts programs and more. Also, the gym, library, and study areas, are designed for students; they are new and worth going to everyday. This school is full of poke pride and I feel honored to be apart of it. The school could work on parking, that is my one recommendation :-)"
Freshman,5,University of Wyoming is so far an amazing school! The staff is incredibly friendly and helpful. Student life is great. The campus has a great feel to it as well.
Freshman,5,I haven't taken any classes online but I'm sure they would go well if I did! University of Wyoming is excellent when it comes to taking care of their students.
Junior,5,"The University of Wyoming is a great little college! I was initially interested in its proximity as I am from Wyoming, and I also interested in its affordability. However, through the people, I've met and things I have seen i know the University of Wyoming is more than just a little college."
Sophomore,5,"I like the environment. There is a lot of nature surrounding the buildings, which is nice to see. There are people everywhere that can help and there is a lot of security and safety around the campus."
Senior,5,"I have only taken a handful of classes online from UW, but during the COVID pandemic, all the classes were online.  The professors did a good job despite the difficulties that came with having to adjust from in-class lecture to online lecture."

Sophomore,5,The online experience was challenging at first but all of my professors were very understanding and worked with me a lot to ensure I got the most out of online classes.
Alum,5,"I loved the school, community and opportunities this school afforded. I studied abroad 3 times, with funding from my college and the study abroad office. The professors were always open for discussions about class, research, their experiences, and opportunities. They do a great job at bringing in good concerts and planning fun activities. I couldn't have chosen a better school."
Alum,5,I took a couple of online courses. The University uses canvas as their platform and it's great for online classes. Everything is accessible and in one place. The professors were open for video chats and emails whenever. They made it easy
Alum,5,"I loved my time at the University of Wyoming as a student-athlete. The professors and students are all very welcoming, the campus is gorgeous, the facilities are great and continue to get better, the town is cozy, and it became a real home for me."
Senior,5,"This is a great school for all degrees, especially agriculture, business, and economics! The professors are extremely knowledgeable and care for each student and their success. The amount of recognized student organizations, learning opportunities, and activities to do at the University of Wyoming make the experience fantastic. Everybody at UW has pride for their school and can do great things after they graduate!"
Niche User,5,"Wyoming feels like a home away from home. The people there are very welcoming and upbeat. The University of Wyoming is spacious and gives a small town feel while still allowing the ability to visit shops and explore around town. The University feels like it is in the middle of nature. It feels spacious and doesn't feel crowded. Coming from a small town and owning horses and dogs, Laramie feels just like home. The University of Wyoming feels like it took me in with open arms. It has the people I want to be around that have big dreams just like me. It also has nature that I want to see and explore everyday. The University of Wyoming makes me feel at home."
Alum,5,University of Wyoming was one of the best experiences of my life. The study abroad program is excellent and is available for students in all different areas of study. I felt valued by my professors and comfortable in my environment.
Graduate Student,5,I've just been accepted into grad school at the University of Wyoming.  Throughout the process and speaking to the current students has been a great experience. The professors seem to genuinely care that you have a good experience throughout the application process.  The current students have all reported to me that the feeling of involvement with the faculty and the students carries over into their studies.
Freshman,5,"I have really enjoyed being at the University of Wyoming! There are lots of fun things to do all the time, I have created many close friends and have kicked butt in class. I am a nursing student and those classes challenge me and push me to be better."
Freshman,5,"UW is a very friendly campus and easy to get around.  The small town environment makes things not so overwhelming.  I enjoy my subjects and the people I am friends with.   The cafeteria food is good and has lots of choices.

People are very helpful around the campus and I don't feel frustrated asking for the help.

Its a great town to live in."
Freshman,5,"It's college. I keep to myself, but there's a lot of opportunities to get involved. So far, my favorite part about the college is the gym. It's pretty high class compared to what I had at my high school, and everyone there is always willing to help out. There's a lot of classes you can take, a lot of club sports that you can join, and there's also a wellness center inside the gym that puts on a lot of events. That's all I really have to say."
Niche User,5,"University of Wyoming is a beautiful campus. Everything is well organized and laid out nicely. While it is a large campus, there are tons of beautiful pieces of art as well as statues and gardening plots around to look at while going from class to class. This school has loads of research opportunities, and if that isn't your scene, the partying scene is also very lively. Sports are a huge deal around this University. The newly build High Altitude Center is incredible if sports or sports medicine is your interest. I also personally really love the nursing win and cadaver lab. This University is fully equip and has the best sense of community that I have ever seen at a school of such size."
Senior,5,"The university of Wyoming has great support and an outstanding program in place for non-traditional students.  With the exception of their bookstore being exceptionally expensive compared to other schools, UW has alot to offer."
Niche User,5,I have been the the University of Wyoming and multiple occasions. I really loved the feel of the place and just the atmosphere of the college in general. I was very pleased with how clean and well kept it was. I stated in the dorms and had a good time.
Niche User,5,"Why do i like the University of Wyoming so much? I have one simple answer for you. Their study abroad program. You can study almost anywhere in the world and get hands on experience for a very affordable price. In my experience, studying abroad can be very expensive however, UW offers a variety of opportunities that aren't out of the price range of an average person."
Sophomore,5,The greatest university that I ever can be a student. They provide everything in high quality. Sincerity is over much. I just love there.
Niche User,5,"The community and the campus at UW is super pretty, and the people are very welcoming and nice to everyone. The professors are very easy to work with, and they are willing to help each individual student with something that they are struggling with."
Niche User,5,I visited the campus in August of 2019 and fell in love with atmosphere of the school. Everyone is so kind and committed to their education and they provide an exceptional expierence through academics and school spirit. The campus is located in a beautiful valley with a lot to explore and do for a small campus town.
Junior,5,I love the University of Wyoming because the people are so amazing and the professors genuinely care about you and your accomplishments. I wish there were a few more clubs available on campus but other than that I wouldn't change a thing.
Niche User,5,"Every time I visit UW, the campus is always clean and has a very nice environment to upcoming students."
Sophomore,5,The University of Wyoming is a great environment for education. There is a hometown feel when you are here in Laramie that you don't get at any other school.
Sophomore,5,The art program has so many resources available for the students. The professors on campus are very easy to reach and interact with.
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my experience at Wyoming. The smaller campus atmosphere, while having a University stating was unlike any other college.  Before I started, I was scared and worried about college. Especially knowing that I was moving away from my family to live in a new place. That very first week, I was welcomed with loving arms, and have felt at home since. I highly recommend anyone to come here because it is an amazing University at a great cost."
Sophomore,5,My experience with attending the university has been amazing. I have made so many friends and connected with people so well. I have learned many life lessons and learned so much from my professors thus far I am excited to go back and see my friends get involved back on campus and most importantly go back to class and soak in the knowledge of my degree I intend on getting from the university of Wyoming.
Sophomore,5,"I love the University's atmosphere, although I've had a few bad experiences with professors. For the most part, people are competent, respectful, and kind. The campus and surrounding areas are beautiful."
Junior,5,"UW has a great selection of professors and instructors, and they are dedicated to helping their students achieve."
Sophomore,5,"From a wide range of majors, to endless campus jobs and incredible research opportunities, the University of Wyoming is an amazing school. I have met so many different people from all across the country and we all agree, this school seems too good to be true! It's affordable, the professors are always understanding, and if you like nature, there is always something to do! Whether you travel downtown, or go skiing for the weekend, there's always an adventure to be had. Class sizes are so small, that every professor I've had still knows my name! Overall, this is an incredible school and I highly suggest that everyone apply. The only thing I would change about UW is the dorms. They should be more frequently updated or repaired."
Freshman,5,My first year at UW has been great. I've liked all my professors and made great friends. The campus is really beautiful and there are generally activities to attend. There are parties but you doesn't feel like going to them is the only way to make friends. The town has some nice restaurants and coffee shops.
Freshman,5,I like how small and accessible the campus is for all students. The professors and staff are very helpful and only want to see you succeed. There are many areas around the campus to study and hang out and the campus is beautiful and very inviting.
Niche User,5,"The campus is absolutely amazing and everybody is so friendly. You can tell that everybody is so happy to be at this university. The students work collaboratively and everybody gets along so well; the students are able to interact with the professors, and the opportunities for each student are plentiful."
Sophomore,5,"While I have been attending the University of Wyoming  I have had nothing short of a wonderful experience. Between the activities they provide for all the students to get well rounded and the staff providing an excellent education, the school is incredible. All the people I have worked with in helping me with my educational goals have been incredibly helpful and they continue to help whenever needed."
Senior,5,I have been an outreach student and this has served my life after a full-time job very well. I am a mother of two and have a husband with medical conditions. This flexibility has allowed me to work at my own pace and have the freedom to fit my class time and research very easily. I am very grateful to have this outlet to fit my needs to be a part-time student while finishing my academics.
Freshman,5,I have loved my time here at the University of Wyoming because it's a decent size school with such a small school feel. Being a Cowboy means you become part of a family at UW and that's something I feel every time I step on campus.
Sophomore,5,"I like how supportive the people in Wyoming and at the university are. It is very easy to find your group of people and spend time with them, and all of your coworkers and peers would support you if you ever needed them to. I think one thing that I would change is how costly tuition is. It recently was raised again, and for out of state students, it is beginning to become very costly, especially if they dont adjust the scholarships to match."
Niche User,5,I absolutely love the University of Wyoming. My older brother currently attends college here and I can't wait to start my experience in Fall 2019! Go Pokes!
Junior,5,The University of Wyoming is very helpful in helping you attain your degree. Everyone is so kind and eager to help!
Alum,5,"The people, and atmosphere was amazing at the university! Whether it was enjoying the athletic events, or the smaller class sizes, the University of Wyoming is a place that I would recommend to anyone!"
Sophomore,5,"I like how the teachers are available for their students despite the numbers of students they can have. The school is modern, all the teachers use computers and projectors for classes which is very useful, especially for student with vision issues.
The campus is beautiful too. It's really green, the buildings fit in this green space.  
The communication from the school is also a good point. We receive emails for about everything that happens on campus. As the school year starts, we've been warned that some emails (like email about construction on campus)  will no longer be sent but if we need information a link is given to us."
Junior,5,I love the feeling of community and involvement. As silly as it sounds they don't call it Wy-HOME-ING for nothing. I feel safe and like there is always something going on I can get involved in.
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed the process of apply to Wyoming. The facility was so helpful in answering all questions. I can call them twenty-five times with the same question and they would happily answer. I was connected with a lot of students and they were helpful as well. The atmosphere is impeccable, the campus is beautiful, the trees are everywhere."
Niche User,5,"The professors are kind and care about the students. The staff at the university are helpful, and were able to assist with all my questions."
Junior,5,Such great staff. Very helpful and want you to succeed. They have a great program that’s not just at the main campus so students can get class time without moving.
Sophomore,5,It's a great environment. Most of the classes are small sizes. Small personal feel in your education.
Junior,5,"As an incoming junior from out of state, Wyoming is very close to the outdoors with parks and trails  being close to campus within 25  minutes. Campus is close to student housing and a short ride to downtown Laramie which is small, but comforting. The weather is usually nice and can be warm one day and cold the next, but it is the West. Denver is a close being only about 2 hours away and Chyanne is 45  minutes which is good."
Senior,5,"The University of Wyoming really is the perfect college town. Everyone is incredibly kind, my mentors are people I really look up to. Class sizes are perfect; not too small not too large. I really got to experience how the business world works and the university prepared me for future job opportunities."
Senior,4,"In Spring of 2019, classes transitioned to almost all online learning, especially for upperclassmen. Overall I do not like online classes, as I feel you dont learn as well and dont get that collaboration with classmates. However, classes havent been quite as difficult with the online format. But I would have liked to finish up college in-person. Professors have been understanding and accomodating."
Freshman,4,"With the whole pandemic going on around the world, it's the safest way possible to get the education you want. Highly recommend UW, they make sure you have what you need to succeed and just so diverse about what they have to offer. But personally it's hard for me to learn through a screen because I am a hands on learner and need to see everything in person. I struggle but sure am making the best of it."
Alum,4,I took a few online classes while at Wyoming. They were just as good of quality as in person and the professors were easy to get ahold of.
Alum,4,I experienced a number of health issues while attending UW and at one point had limited mobility which threatened my opportunities to continue pursuing my degree. I was fortunate that there was plenty of online learning available to me. Without which I would have lost financial aid and ultimate had to drop out entirely.
Junior,4,The campus has lots of historical buildings which is really amazing. The campus however lacks a parking which is difficult for students.
Junior,4,"I found that the University of Wyoming's switch to online learning was as good as it could have been. It was so sudden for everyone so I think with more prep it could have been better, but overall it was ok. All the Professors would definitely respond timely to any problem you would face and work with you."
Sophomore,4,I like the class sizes and how the teachers are available for one on one help. The campus is really awesome and I like how the campus is spread out but still somewhat small.
Sophomore,4,"I liked the small town feeling at the University of Wyoming. Everyone was very close with each other, and even campus was very organized and short distances between buildings. The tuition was also cheaper than all of the other options I had."
Senior,4,I've had to take classes online before at the University before and during the COVID-19 Pandemic. The online classes are fine if you have the self-motivation and self-discipline to be able to keep up with assignments and studying for exams.
Senior,4,"What I enjoy about the University is the unique and diverse culture that the University has. The University offers a wide range of majors available to the students. One thing that can be a little bit of a hassle is applying for classes. As a University athlete, my schedule constantly changes and having to go through many different loopholes makes the application process a little difficult"
Graduate Student,4,"Great campus! Great advisors! Great culture! 
I have really enjoyed my timbre on campus at the university of Wyoming. I have learned so much and love the friendships I've made with teachers and classmates!"
Graduate Student,4,"Online classesare ok, not my fav. I prefer in class, seeing my teachers and classmates. But unprecedented times... So if classes had continued, I'd probably give a higher rating."
Junior,4,"The University of Wyoming is a great, affordable college that more people should consider when applying for college. With smaller class sizes and dedicated professors, students are able to develop personal and academic relationships that can last a lifetime. I have learned so much at my time at the University of Wyoming and have really enjoyed myself while doing so."
Sophomore,4,"Small campus, great people. Some teachers are great and some are horrible. Winters are terrible. People outside campus are mostly friendly."
Junior,4,"Overall, I have enjoyed my experience at the University of Wyoming. I have had many positive experiences with campus, classes, professors, athletics, and much more. I look forward to finishing my final year at UW!"
Freshman,4,"The University of Wyoming is a beautiful school filled with some great opportunities, resources, and scenery at a super affordable cost. They have great professors who know what they are doing and work hard to help you, they work with you and truly care. The campus is beautiful and always has a ton of cool events to participate in! The sororities and fraternities are very lovely and aren't just partiers. UW is an awesome place for anyone, really easy to navigate, and to make friends, the buildings are all in great condition with lots of updated ones with a lot of technology. The financial aid is lacking in my opinion, but it is tolerable since they are such an affordable 4-year institute in the first place."
Alum,4,"I attended UW for 3 years and I loved it. It is in a small town but still runs like a big town college. None of their lecture sizes are too big. If you need to get help from a professor they are always available. They have lots of resources for tutoring. The gym on campus is amazing. It is included in your tuition. They also have free counseling for students too. As a full time student you also get free access to all of the sporting events and other events on campus as well. The classes are challenging, but not too hard where you do not feel like you are not learning anything. The cost of living in Laramie is very affordable."
Junior,4,"I attend the University of WY through the Casper College campus. I love the UW professors that teach at the Casper College campus! The only thing that I want to change is that we have UW admissions and financial aid rep at the Casper College campus. If I have any questions regarding admissions or financial aid, I have to call the Laramie campus and I wish there was someone I could talk to in person at Casper."
Freshman,4,"I love the tight knit community feel at the University of Wyoming. Athletic events are so much fun to attend. Also, the Half Acre gym is a nice facility and intramural sports are great."
Sophomore,4,"I've never had a bad experience with the university. I think they are very easy to work with and have rules that are understanding. My second semester of college I got put on academic probation, I was very upset with the fact I put my own self in that program. But, I've done better ever since and I'm grateful that the university gave me that opportunity to look at the bigger picture."
Senior,4,"My experience at UW has been pretty great. The teachers I've had have all been passionate about their subject and are willing to work with students if they need extra help outside of the class. Further, they are all competent working on Canvas as an online platform to communicate to students and turn in assignments."
Niche User,4,It’s a great school and has a great campus. I love this school. My only complaint is that the dorms suck. There is no heating and they suck. But other than that there’s nothing to complain about with this school.
Senior,4,I wish there was more student involvement in the big decisions on campus. The trustees do a lot behind closed doors. Other than that it’s a great school with small class sizes. Great learning environment.
Freshman,4,"I will say this very honestly that University of Wyoming as a State University is very affordable. The academic potential is very high students who study at University of Wyoming. I am majoring in Astronomy and Astrophysics at this University. We have an On-Campus Geological Museum which is my favorite place to visit during my free times. I still remember that my first true love since around 3 or 4 years old were dinosaurs. And here, very ironically be said that for a person like me with two major interests i.e the Universe and the Natural History of Earth itself, I literally walk in a lane with the Geological Museum on one side and the Department of Physics and Astronomy on another. So figuratively and factually it is a euphoric experience for a person like me.  Nothing more and nothing less just enough for me to Understand my basics and built upon them in a creative and intelligent manner is my main goal while studying at this University for a period of 4 years."
Alum,4,I loved that the class size was smaller.  Students could get one on one attention.  I felt like the professors knew me and will remember me.  Campus is beautiful.
Senior,4,"Most classes were pretty straightforward, my advisor was wonderful. Some instructors took some getting used to in order to understand what they wanted. Some classes were solely lecture based with no transcripts, which did not work well for me. Would have liked to see an alternate format for students who are not auditory."
Freshman,4,"The University of Wyoming is very welcoming. I genuinely enjoy going to all of my classes everyday because I’m learning new things on a deeper level. I don’t feel like I’m treated as a kid but as an adult by all the professors. I play intramural soccer and frisbee and it’s allowed me to meet a lot of friends. Wyoming as a state is such a down to earth, welcoming place the university is no exception. You’ll be excepted no matter who you are. I’m so glad I get to experience Laramie and the surrounding mountains. Though the weather can be unpredictable, the scenery is always beautiful, no matter the season."
Senior,4,"My experience at the University of Wyoming has been both memorable and quite the learning experience, pun intended. Though the only major University in the state, I never felt washed away in the student population. I had a voice that I was able to use that helped navigate me through every high and low once I embarked upon the college path. The campus is beautiful, albeit cold, but that is the Wyoming way. I enjoyed my classes, and freezing at football games once October hit. Laradise, as we call it, is a hidden gem that you just have to appreciate it for what it's all worth."
Senior,4,"The University of Wyoming provides some good academic opportunities for students on an appealing campus. It also has good affordable  access to mental and physical health care. However the school seems to invest far more in the athletics than its academics, research, or other maintenance. The small town and very cold weather are also not for everyone."
Junior,4,"The university of Wyoming is a wonderful place, full of character. The schooling is excellent, and the professors are very nice, smart, and understanding."
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed the class room environment, and the way the professors help the students succeed. Each professor I have had so far have all given supplemental information via Canvas to help students study on their own time. Whether it is additional problems, reading or study guides, the supplemental information helps greatly."
Freshman,4,"The University of Wyoming is a great university for me.  Everyone is friendly here. As an international student, I received the warmest welcome from the university and they gave me assistance on how to get started with classes, helped me to adjust to campus life and made my stay in Wyoming a very happy stay."
Senior,4,"The campus is very safe and beautiful, the staff so far has been very helpful for new students and usually always have a good attitude, I have learned a lot and have enjoyed all the events that the campus has put on. They seem to really try and make the college experience safe, easy as possible and fun in many ways. I can't think of anything to change besides maybe updating the advising system because I have been switched to three advisers because they keep changing the system and that has caused some issues in my scheduling which has put me behind and has caused frustration in many students."
Sophomore,4,"This University is a good choice for students that are outdoorsy or introverted. It is good for business majors and engineering majors. The Math department lacks in good professors, as does the English department. Some professors are good at helping students, others are rude."
Senior,4,Normally pretty small class size.  So far the professors are awesome.  Small campus.  Great little town to live in.  Everything is pretty affordable.
Sophomore,4,I love the small town feel of the university. I had a class of about 250 students and the professor still knew me by first name outside of class. Everyone really cares about everyone; students aren't just numbers and dollar signs.
Senior,4,"My university experiences so far have been great. I have taken diverse classes and met many interesting people. I am still discovering new things about the university with the various programs, services and events they provide. The are many athletic and cultural extracurricular actives to choose from, as well as committees and organizations to join and become a part of the community."
Sophomore,4,"The school is in a great town, the school really does care about your academic success. They have a great campus and have great programs."
Sophomore,4,"University of Wyoming is a very good value for academics. I didn't find a lot to do around town, but it is very close to Colorado which can be a fun weekend trip. When is is warm in Laramie which was very often there are some nice hiking trails. In the winter there is some nice cross country ski slopes. There are parties around if your looking for them. Overall a pretty good school."
Sophomore,4,I like the environment at UWyo a lot. The students and professors there are very kind and understanding when it comes to a life issue or just a personal issue. The professors are respectful to the students which is something you don't see often.
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at the university and I feel it went rather alright. Nothing too major and no really BIG troubles. However, one of my biggest problems was at the dorms. The internet service here was alright. My connection would constantly connect and disconnect which would make it a bit of an annoyance. Especially when I had school work to get done. Other than that, the University was a good experience. I felt I had lots of resources to be able to get things done for school."
Niche User,4,The University of Wyoming is a great place to go to school. It is located in a small town of Laramie. The school offers great education at a great price. The people are very friendly and Laramie is great place for a University. The only thing I would like changed is that the dorms are getting out of date but they are building new ones right now so this will be resolved. I recommend the university of Wyoming.
Sophomore,4,"University of Wyoming is a great school not only educationally but also experience wise. With may great ways to get students involved, I would proudly say that I am a University of Wyoming Cowboy! The school offers great educational help to all students through tutors, supplemental instruction classes and office hours with the teachers. I love the environment here,  everyone is so welcoming and nice and I would highly recommend this school to anyone who is considering it!"
Sophomore,4,"I like that it is close to my home, and it is in a beautiful area. I don't like the parking availability."
Freshman,4,"I am pretty new here, but so far I have had a great experience. Besides the cold weather, the school itself has been wonderful. The atmosphere of the school and Laramie are fun and all of the people and staff have been really friendly so far. The dorms could be updated and made a little bigger but so far it hasn't been too bad. There isn't much that I would like to change. I feel very safe being on campus and haven't had any issues from other students or staff. Overall, I have really enjoyed the school and am planning on finishing up my education here for all four years."
Senior,4,"The University of Wyoming gives students an opportunity to go to college at an affordable price. In-state students will rant about how great the scholarship opportunities like Hathaway while out-of-state students will rave about UW as being less expensive than their home colleges in the state they live in. 

Along with that, the University of Wyoming is supported by an amazing faculty and staff that have always fanned the flame of student brilliance. I've seen professors at UW that have made me feel like I was at an Ivy League school. Many of the staff went to top-rate colleges like Harvard or MIT, so students will be able to get a world class education without the cost. 

There is an amazing variety of clubs and activities to support these perks, and the town of Laramie is welcoming unto itself."
Sophomore,4,I love the small campus and that the professors are available to help you.  I don't like the cold weather.
Sophomore,4,"I love the homely feeling that I have when I am at the University of Wyoming. They were easy to work with and very invested into my education. This University offers so much help when it comes to questions you have concerning questions on homework or the material you had just studied in class. I would highly recommend this school to others. However, on the other hand, they need to give their math department a little more attention. Not great."
Sophomore,4,"I have very much enjoyed the University of Wyoming, and I have made many new friends. I will value the opportunities this University has gave me in many different ways. I enjoyed learning from my professors, some of which I connected with on a strong level. I am very excited to see what other professors I can connect with and learn more from. I strongly encourage any prospective students considering the University of Wyoming to give this university a shot. I guarantee you won't regret your involvement at this amazing university."
Senior,4,Being a student at the University of Wyoming is a great place for me to finish my career in education towards my future. Everything was easily accessible and I feel prepared for the real world after graduation this May.
Senior,4,"Professors are good for the most part. Its affordable and you get a quality education, especially in certain areas like business/marketing."
Freshman,4,I like how easy it is to feel apart of the community up there. I wish I didn’t have to live in the dorm though.
Sophomore,4,"I love the diversity around campus and the endless activities and programs that you can participate in. Everybody around campus is always very friendly, and the amount of help that is offered with coursework is incredible. The University of Wyoming offers everything you desire in a college experience!"
Niche User,4,"The University of Wyoming is a very good University, full of life and opportunity. Every one is very friendly. The professors help out a lot. There isn't anything bad about it. Its in a small town, so you can focus on your studies. But just because its a small doesn't mean that that there is nothing to do. Lots to do actually. Lots of outdoor recreational opportunities. Good class sizes, there isn't much more that is needed."
Freshman,4,The University of Wyoming is a wonderful campus full of a lot of pride and very intelligent students. There are lots of facilities that are very good and accessible to all students. There always is something to do around campus and everyone is friendly.
Alum,4,"There are events every week that anyone can attend. For a smaller school they draw a lot of students from all over the world so the opportunities to meet people are high in a small town. Very friendly staff and teachers, unfortunately my last year they cut a few of the programs in the language departments and religious studies areas but the teachers in those departments are very dedicated and put their students first. There are also many clubs to participate in, free comedy and entertainment shows, and very often free lunches are offered at many of the events!"
Freshman,4,My experience overall has been really well. I have nothing to complain about. The academics are great and there is always something to do. The campus is very safe and welcoming.
Senior,4,I like the campus and the professors. Its a beautiful campus and people are friendly. I would like to see more nontraditional students and diversity as well as making events more child friendly.
Junior,4,"So, my experience at University of Wyoming has been great! There are many awesome clubs and sports that a person can take part in. The professors are great and there is always someone to help if you have any questions or concerns."
Freshman,4,Great place to go to school. Staff is willing to help. Great counselors. Great environment with a location with great access to the outdoors.
Sophomore,2,"The largest problem with the university of Wyoming is the UW police department. The police drive circles around campus day and night, pulling over kids at will to test them and hand out as many tickets as possible. If you’d like to feel like everyone is waiting for you to mess up so they can pounce on you and shake you down for cash this is the university for you."
College Junior,2,"The school and community support is definitely above average, but the teams themselves aren't anything extraordinary. The basketball teams are fun to watch, but you don't hear about the other sports and the the football team is terrible. I feel that the school puts too much money into the football team and not enough into other sports that perform much better."
College Junior,2,This campus is 98% whites
College Junior,2,There are a lot of bars and liquor stores
College Freshman,2,"I did not enjoy the campus housing at all. I will not be living on campus next year due to not getting what I paid for. They do not have air conditioning in the dorm rooms, which is needed because I turned on the heat only two days in the year I lived in the rooms. The rooms are small, and the roommate process did not have a long enough survey to match roommates. The bathrooms were a mess and did not get cleaned frequently enough. The fishbowl was filthy most of the time. The quiet hours on my floor most of the time were not followed."
College Freshman,2,The dorms are very small. There is a shared restroom that everyone uses. The walls are also paper thin.
College Freshman,2,"The university has a bad history of frats. Most of the Greek houses work to give back to the community, though."
College Freshman,2,It's for people who need friends .
College Senior,2,We don't have much Greek-life on campus.
College Freshman,2,I personally think greeks think higher of themselves because the live in a house with other greeks. They are rude and snobby and act as if they are better than everyone else.
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are entirely out of date and when it comes to getting to class in freezing temperatures, the tunnels are of course no help since they only go to the dining hall, but not if you live in Hill hall since there are no tunnels, which just so happens to be the farthest dorm away from everything. Having to use Wi-Fi for everything school related, you can barely get a connection anywhere on campus, including the dorms, which results in everyone buying their own routers. I previously lived in the Honors House which turned out to result in me having one of the worst years of my life. Long story short the atmosphere almost made me drop out of school simply because of the emotional and mental abuse that went on in that small community.  All of the rooms are incredibly small, except for the ones in Hill hall, which of course cost an arm and a leg. The housing process is actually quite simple when it comes to choosing a place to live. When actually moving in though, it is an absolute nightmare. Mainly due to the extreme lack of accessible parking all over the school."
College Sophomore,2,Very few people are into Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"Absolutely no social life and no desire on behalf of the student body to day anything worthwhile with their time. Also, very little to do on, or around campus. I thought I would love the small town feel like what I grew up in, but this is not ""small town""... It's ""ridiculously lazy and uneventful town""."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is not very popular, the housing is not good and most non-Greeks don't like Greeks very much."
College Freshman,2,"Laramie is a small town and there is not to much going on, thus they target underage drinking."
College Freshman,2,There are very few to no options on campus.
College Junior,2,There's a ton of parties and they aren't monitored.
College Freshman,2,"Missing some really good restaurants, the dining is simply ok. Nothing more and nothing less."
College Freshman,2,Good for out of state but do not come here! Terrible academics!
College Freshman,2,"Pretty mediocre, and they're hardly ever open when you want to eat."
College Student,2,"The parties are ok, but not that great. They are best off campus, as NO ONE is really allowed on campus, not even the Greek. I choose to not go."
College Junior,2,"There is a lot of turning a blind eye when it comes to drinking, though the policies are strict. They aren't enforced."
College Junior,2,Greek life not a big factor.
College Student,2,The scholarships offered are too specific and narrowed to fit anyone's description
College Sophomore,2,I really do not prefer living in a dorm with thin walls and small space. The dorms can be good because it's so close to the campus.
College Freshman,2,The gym doesn't have much activities available for students.
College Freshman,2,Bad weather most of the year.  Small town and very inconvenient to get anything.
College Junior,2,Most landlords are slumlords and just want money.
College Junior,2,"Only got one, applied for well over 70."
College Junior,2,The people higher up don't listen to students.
College Student,2,Washakie dinning center is not a ver good place to eat. the only things I liked was the mongolian grill and the ice cream. also the only food we have in Laramie is fast food.
College Student,2,"we do not have many off dinning options when it comes to good quality food. their are mostly just fast food places. however, if we got a chick-fil-A, many others including me, might change our opinion."
College Sophomore,2,"The college town is not large, but not exactly tiny. So there is not a lot of transportation options. It would be very helpful if they came up with some kind of a WWCC personalized service option for the students."
College Junior,2,"I received the Hathaway scholarship which is for students that attended a Wyoming High School. That has gone very well, but aside from that I can't find anything else which is becoming very hassling for me; I am in my senior of school and I've just ran out of money so I'm a bit lost on what to do, hence the survey."
College Junior,2,"Most individuals drink, but that should be expected. There is heavy marijuana use, but that is definitely expected given it's college and Colorado is only a few miles away. Police heavily enforce drug and alcohol laws, but are fairly lax by letting students go at parties (which I think is good). Drunk driving has severe consequences but they seem to understand kids are going to drink."
College Junior,2,"I would never do it again. However, I am optimistic about by choice of career because it is vast in employment opportunities."
College Junior,2,"If you like winter, Wyoming is the place for you. If cold wind on a regular basis is not your thing, find a different school. It is not to terrible, but you will need a lot of warm clothing and a hairstyle that can withstand wind. Summers are wonderful, but it gets cold pretty fast. The highway outside of Laramie is often closed due to ice and snow, so don't expect to be able to leave Laramie if it gets snow."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus shuttle never runs on time, and there are no other options."
College Sophomore,2,"Very conservative, ignorant, and sometimes racist people exist within this university. There are many programs on campus to promote diversity, but we need more."
College Sophomore,2,Nowhere to park ever. Bike or walk.
College Sophomore,2,"Not a lot of places to live in this town. Especially if you do not want roommates. Living on your own is expensive, but worth not living in the dorms."
College Freshman,2,There are spots around campus but they fill up really quickly.  The only way you will get a spot is if you get to campus at the crack of dawn or someone upstairs is looking down on you.
College Junior,2,This is a small rural rocky mountain community. There are few jobs and little to do. Night life is limited.
College Freshman,2,"If you are in the resident halls, expect to be reported for petty things. Anytime drugs or alcohol are smelled on the floor, it is immediately reported and can be annoying for students. Not only do student rights get violated when given citations by campus police, they will usually harass sober students about whether or not they are sober, even if it is VERY obvious that they haven't had any alcohol or drugs. Also, my resident coordinator seems clueless as to what she is supposed to do."
College Freshman,2,"My hall has had many problems, and some of the RA's are much more strict than they need to be. There is also way too much drama on my floor as well and campus police are in the halls almost every night of the weekend."
College Junior,2,Winter from November to almost May
College Sophomore,2,"It is unpredictable, cold, and windy. I am used to it by now but it can be a shock to out of state students."
College Freshman,2,"Outside of a few house parties and jumping bar to bar, the nightlife is pretty dead"
College Freshman,2,It's super limited. Fast food and a couple sit down places. Can get pricey for the average college student. Not much variety/diversity. Few places have student discounts
College Sophomore,2,"It's Wyoming, it will be cold and windy."
College Junior,2,Summers are nice. Winters are the worst.
College Sophomore,2,"The parking closest to the University requires a city permit or a university permit depending on where you park, and those permits are taken quickly. The further back you go, the parking is free, but it's hard to get a good spot."
College Freshman,2,Diversity here is very low. There is a huge majority of white republicans.
College Freshman,2,"While there are a few options as far as lab availability, the network rarely works."
College Freshman,2,I'm not a fan of the options on campus. There is a low variety and the food quality isn't great.
College Freshman,2,I have no idea I just hear things
College Freshman,2,"being in Wyoming,  there is very little diversity "
College Freshman,2,it is expensive for what we are given and when it is open
College Freshman,2,It is near impossible to find a spot and if you do its usually a long walk to get back to your room. 
College Freshman,2,Residence halls are not great here. The rooms are very small and the only way to make them remotely large enough is to loft your bed. There are sinks in the rooms for a few of the dorms and the bathrooms have very small showers and a really dirty bathtub. There are no kitchens available to students unless you live in the upperclassmen dorm which is a major downside. Each floor has a community area which is nice for studying and movie nights but that's about it. 
Junior,1,"I was billed more money for being forced into online learning, now I have no money for rent or food because my tuition rates went up."
Freshman,1,"I ignored all of the bad reviews about this place when I was choosing a school- and now I know I should have listened. Laramie is awful, if you don't have a car it is pretty much impossible to leave campus, which makes you feel completely isolated. The weather is awful, and the campus is very cliquey, which I wasn't expecting. The dorms are tiny and constantly have issues, but everywhere that you can live off campus is an inconvenient distance from the school. The campus isn't involved at all and the school rarely puts on events, so there's nothing to do. Don't even try to party here- the RAs report anyone they even think might be drunk and the cops give out MIPs for any suspicion they have. I personally know over 15 people that have gotten an MIP here. Overall, I wish I had never come here. I am transferring after finishing my freshman year, and I can't wait to never come to this town again."
College Sophomore,1,"Alcohol is allowed on the University of Wyoming campus, which allows for underage drinking to occur."
College Sophomore,1,Housing at the University of Wyoming is very poor. The cost of room and board is often more expensive than tuition itself. The dorm rooms are extremely small; the upperclassmen dorms do not have sinks. The process of dealing with roommate confrontations is devastating. The only perk to living on campus is proximity to (some) campus facilities.
College Sophomore,1,Dorms are old & small need a change asap.
College Freshman,1,Very few options. The cheap places aren't livable and the livable places arent cheap.
College Sophomore,1,"Same people, same time, same place."
College Freshman,1,"The academics are absolutely terrible. So far at this school I have had more graduate students for instructors in my classes than professors! One graduate student was even assigned to teach a lecture of 120 students, and could barely speak English. The University of Wyoming does not care at all about academics, they care about getting your money before you drop out due to the awfulness of the school. DO NOT COME TO THIS SCHOOL!"
College Freshman,1,Absolutely terrible academics as stated before.
College Freshman,1,Currently on prohibition due to a sexual assault incident five years ago. No parties are allowed and all that they do is clean up trash by the highway.
College Freshman,1,UWPD are nazi's. They will basically kick down your door if they think you have a beer in your room. Absolutely terrible and they treat you like a criminal.
College Freshman,1,"Awful. Only fun if you're 21+ and can get into the bars downtown. UW police will arrest you for looking drunk walking down the sidewalk and throw you in jail, regardless of whether you actually broke any laws."
College Freshman,1,"This school's academics are truly terrible, especially if you are an incoming freshman. The school hires graduate students (not professor's) in large numbers to teach courses in order to save money. There is also absolutely NO oversight over these graduate student instructors and if you leave a bad impression, they have no reason not to fail you for absolutely no reason. One instructor has singled me out and decided to fail me despite my thorough effort and skill with the subject matter. Coming to this school was the WORST decision of my life. The only reason I could see for anyone to come here is if they are a Wyoming resident and cannot afford to go out of state. DO NOT come to the University of Wyoming if you are out of state. I am from Colorado and there are much better choices to be had in that state.There is no nightlife unless you are over 21 by the way. Do not expect to enjoy living here much, as there is nothing to do but sit around on campus. The real travesty, however, is the APPALLING failure that is the academics of UW. Do not come to this school."
College Freshman,1,"As an out-of-state student the price of UW is very spend compared to in-state. UW also doesn't give you hardly any help with expenses either as an out-of-state student, which I don't appreciate."
College Junior,1,Terrible. But then I have some stomach issues. My meal plan at the sorority is a waste of money.
College Junior,1,I hated dorm life. I like living in the campus apartments though.
College Senior,1,No where to park and it costs a lot of money to park on campus
College Sophomore,1,"Very small town, no city life. You have to drive at least 45 minutes to the nearest town that has anything."
College Sophomore,1,One of the coldest places in the entire United States. Beware.
College Sophomore,1,Greek life should not exist ANYWHERE.
College Freshman,1,"Have fun freezing while you walk to class. It's campus policy to stay open unless it is -60 degrees F. No, that is not a typo."
College Freshman,1,Drinking. Drinking. Hook-ups. STDs. Drinking.
College Freshman,1,It is pretty miserable. Snow. Ice. Wind. It is a brutal winter that spans from October to April. The weather is unforgiving
College Freshman,1,"The weather in Laramie, Wyoming is very cold and windy during most of the school year. On average, snow is expected from September until May which lowers students' motivation to learn."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is a nightmare! There is practically no place to park ever! If you live off-campus, I suggest going to the East or South Express Lots and riding the bus to campus. It usually takes about 10 minutes to get to campus with the bus so plan accordingly. I would suggest leaving an hour before your class starts just in case the bus driver has to stop people from getting on the bus and you're stuck at the bus stop for another 10 minutes.
If you live on-campus, either buy an 'R' parking permit or park your vehicle in the free parking lot. The free parking lot is a two mile walk from the dorms and can get to be a hassle in the winter, especially on weekends when the buses don't run. "
College Junior,1,"If you are not easily bothered by the quality of food, Washakie Dining Center will work out well for you. I find that their food makes me sick, so I try to steer clear of it. They do have a lot of variety( think sandwhich station, make-your-own stir-fry, etc), and the salad bar is to die for. The Ultimate meal plan offers  $ 50 in ""Dining dollars"" which you can spend on campus at restaurants in the Union (ie Panda Express, Pita Pit, The Book and Bean Coffee) which is very nice if you have a late class and can't make it to the dining hall. They also offer Breakfast-to-go on Weekends, which is nice because you can stock up on packaged food for the week. Overall, just realize that if you choose a meal plan as a freshman living on campus, they will not let you change it for a whole year. That's something I wish someone had told me before I committed to a meal plan."
College Sophomore,1,"Truth be told there is hardly any parking especially now due to all of the new construction. It is easier to bike, walk, or take the shuttle to classes"
College Sophomore,1,There is a huge problem with drinking and all of that good stuff. Cops are there but they dont do anything.
College Sophomore,1,Are sports teams never do anything they are really bad and are fans are disrespectful. They think there are the best but they are mistaken.
College Junior,1,There is hardly any parking for students. What we can do is far from main campus and is EXPENSIVE. All the parking that would actually be helpful is faculty and maintence parking.
College Student,1,"You have to PAY everywhere you go with a car on campus. It's pretty crappy and the fines are for ridiculous reasons (sometimes). You might need a car if you live off campus, but be sure that you can parallel park if you want a free parking spot! Also, if you can wake up early! Spots are rarely open."
College Junior,1,"The parking at on the UW campus is terrible. It is very hard to find a spot if you don't have a permit, and if you do it can still be a challenge to park. The parking is very limited. However UW does have a great bus system that has stops with a lot of parking and buses that run to a few spots on campus every 5 to 10 minutes."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is horrible. There is some on one side of the campus but not really any where else. So you have to take the bus a lot, which is always late. There is enough parking for faculty/staff, their parking lots are never full. But we always have to park on the street if we can find a spot"
College Sophomore,1,"Sororities are nice at University of Wyoming, the girls are pleasant and attractive. The frats are annoying though. They have no national connection with other frats and the school is small enough that the egos around brothers of a frat house are annoying and extremely noticeable."
College Sophomore,1,"I honestly hate the weather a lot here. It snows a ton here and it's windy all the time! classes are generally pretty far from the dorms and the tunnel system is closed. If you decide to come here, invest in some cross country skis or snow shoes..."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is a nightmare. There are four parking lots for residents in the dorms, but if you live off campus, good luck. The school has parking permits and most of the parking on campus is for school employees. The good thing, though, is that there are at least two free parking lots that are WAY off campus and you ride a bus to campus. Parking is really awful."
College Junior,1,The parking cost is outrageous and it is impossible to find an open space in the first place let alone pay so much money without a for sure spot
College Freshman,1,Unless you pay for a parking pass it is a nightmare.
College Junior,1,"Very stingy with federal aid and scholarships, regardless of my 3.75 GPA."
College Freshman,1,The university apartments fail epically. Don't go for them they're not worth your time.
College Freshman,1,"I gotta say, I hated the place. I liked the dorms WAAAYYYYYYYY better then Bison Run. Don't go there! Its a trap! It's so bad, I'm determined to get the word out there. Wanna know why its so bad? I'll tell you why! Don't be fooled just because the facilities are nice, you can find the same sort of set up with the surroundings Realtor s and way closer to campus!
A) Far from campus, sure they have buses but most of those buses are so full from the students that there is no way in hell you're getting on one. 
B) They ASSIGN you roommates. I had a good roommate so I thought that hey! This might be okay! They didn't f*** it up the first time after all. WRONG choose your own apartments, and roommates.
C) EXPENSIVE! You can find better with a Realtor and the right amount of roommates!
D) The rooms are comparatively small to other apartments that you can get! Don't be fooled because you have you're 'own' bathroom they cut into the size of your room, and f*** that s***. 
That's my opinion, you don't need to heed it, and you can consider me a crazy person for writing such a long commentary, this place is evil, and you should stay clear!"
College Senior,1,Lots of construction right now.  You are better to walk
College Senior,1,"Parking is decent for on campus residents. However, all the close parking spots on campus that permits are offered for are for faculty and dorm residents. There is one parking lot commuting students can buy a permit for but it only close to the fine arts building. There are always close spaces where you can park for $1 per hour but that can add up. A car is not really needed on campus though and a lot of students bike or take the bus (which is free). Tickets are about $20 if you violate parking rules so it is best to make sure not to do that."
College Senior,1,"Hate It – There is barely any free parking, we are poor college students!!!!!"
College Senior,1,"Not Recommended – The only reason I ever went to the University of Wyoming is because of the cheap tuition.  This was the only university I could attend without having to take out any loans and without leaving in debt (though they are trying their best to leave me in debt anyway).  I definitely didn't feel like I fit in, I didn't have much in common with the people I met, I didn't like the town, I didn't like the weather, I didn't like the atmosphere, I didn't like the campus, I didn't like being a ""cowgirl"";.....I didn't like anything about it but the cheaper prices.  Fortunately, I was a transfer student and only had to spend two years there.  For those two years, I just had to suck it up and get it over with.  I wanted a bachelor's degree without debt so I could move onto medical school, and going to UW was just one of those things I had to do to get there.  Of course, not everyone is like me, and some people may love it here.  But I was definitely not one of them."
College Senior,1,"For the entire school (and town), the biggest recreational activity is getting drunk.  For some people, that means every night of the week; for others, it means just during the weekends.  Either way, if you don't drink or party, you won't have much in common with a great majority of the students.  Everyone thinks it cool and everyone wants to fit in, so most of them end up doing it."
College Senior,1,"If you actually want to drive to campus, good luck finding a parking spot.  Most of the spots require a parking permit, which they so conveniently charge over $150 for.  UW loves opportunities to take money from students.  The parking spots, especially the metered spots, are heavily monitored and they love giving out parking tickets."
College Senior,1,"Not Diverse – I do see a few students of other races around campus, but very few.  As a minority myself, I never really felt like I fit in.  Most students are white Americans who were born and raised in Wyoming.  A lot of them look the same, act the same, and dress the same, to the point where its a little creepy."
College Senior,1,"All the Same – The most disappointing thing about the students on campus is the lack of diversity.  The overwhelming majority of the students are white American. Most everyone is very average looking.  There were a couple of decent looking guys, but I wouldn't consider any of them particularly attractive.  Most of them look the same, and they all dressed the same, most of them wearing UW sweatshirts, sweatpants, and t-shirts, especially the athletes. This lack of diversity is not only in looks, but in personalities, too.  Guys were either cowboys or athletes.  Most of them spent their free time drinking and partying, and if you don't do any of that (like me), you won't really have anything in common with them."
College Senior,1,"Drinking & Partying – The only real ""nightlife"" that goes on in this town is drinking and partying, which is usually done at someone's house or apartment.  Students usually gather at someone's place and get drunk, play beer pong, or hook up with whoever they can.  That basically sums up the Laramie nightlife.  Forget about cultural events or anything that doesn't involve getting drunk."
College Sophomore,1,I am hating it here. I love the people and the Christian Student Center. And to be totally honest that's the only reason I'm still here. The university doesn't work with you. The professors don't care. The grad students aren't helpful. If I wasn't so far in debt with loans and had the support of the CSC I would have quit this semester.
College Senior,1,"Most apartments off campus that are newer and nice are far from campus and very very expensive. Most apartments off campus close are older and a little more run down, and still very very expensive. A teepee in the quad might be a better option."
College Senior,1,"There are a few permit parking lots. The parking people sell way more permits then they have spots so you have to be there early. There are some pay to park places. Very limited free parking, and you have to be there and parked at about 2 am if you want a spot for your class at noon. The city also made a bunch of the parking close to campus by city permit only."
College Junior,1,"Not Interested – There is less diversity in the students here than there is with restaurants.  Here being ""cool"" is how often you go to bars, not how active, or well rounde dyou are"
College Senior,1,"Laramie--7Th Coldest in the Nation – Laramie is freezing.  Last semester we had a frigid cold spell and a lot of people I knew couldn't start their cars, including myself. Class is never cancelled, due to these conditions or snowy conditions. Once the campus shuttle was almost an hour late due to the weather and I missed a class.  When the weather is fine, it's a chilly or windy walk. I don't think I've ever heard of UW having a snow day."
College Student,1,Finding parking close to the dorms as a freshman is awful even with a permit. Permits are pretty expensive as well so most students park in city parking because any street near campus is city parking. If you are ticketed in City parking the ticket is $50.00 and if you get a UW Parking ticket it is usually $30.00.
College Sophomore,1,"Policies Aren't Enforced – There are a lot of rules that aren't enforced. Most notably, the university has a regulation that prohibits smoking withing 20 feet of any building, but it isn't enforced. This can be problematic for people like me, who have respiratory conditions, on days when it's warm enough for classroom windows to be kept open. I wish that the policies were better enforced."
College Student,1,"Not So Great – UW is in the middle of nowhere really, and it is difficult to attract diverse populations here. The university is not designed for international students as most teachers are unforgiving to language barriers."
College Junior,1,"Difficulties arise when it comes to campus parking. Permits cost more than many students can afford and if you park in permit parking without one you can count on getting a ticket because they are always checking. The good thing is a car is not really necessary around campus unless you live too far. It can get chilly on walks in the winter, so make sure you have warm clothes and you will save on gas all year with the campus' convenient build. If you do need to drive and you do not have a permit, count on parking at least seven blocks away because the streets are all permit parking also."
College Senior,1,"I chose UW because I feel degrees from online degrees from schools like University of Phoenix are ""cheap"" and viewed by perspective employers as such.  I was very disappointed after entering the online UW program I was told one of my classes that was required was not offered online through UW.  I would have to register at another college to take the course.  I feel this is false advertisement.  I am a single mother of two daughters, I work two jobs one full time one half time and also attend school half time.  I don't have the time or energy to spend registering in two different schools and I don't think I should have to. I would probably have my degree already if I would have went through another program."

Senior,5,"Yes I took my last semester online , due to the COVID -19 circumstances. I must say that overall my Professors were pretty fair with their leverage , considering it was a last minute decision to offer the online courses."
Senior,5,"My overall experience while attending Mcpherson College has been very rewarding from academics to my social life.I would highly recommend Mcpherson College to any future high school graduate , for all of the same reasons , and experience that I’ve endured while attending. This is my senior year, and I’m sure it will be bitter and sweet., however I am now a part of the Mcpherson Bulldog family , and soon to be alumni.."
Sophomore,5,The teachers and staff did a great job transitioning to online classes and made it very easy for students from across the country and world to be able to finish the semester.
Freshman,5,"MCPherson College is hidden gem in the small town of McPherson, Kansas. Although small it has everyone one needs to be successful. The teachers and staff are always helpful and willing to help. The campus itself has a family feel but you still have all of the privacy you need. There are plenty of activities along with Athletics throughout the week to keep you busy. I have enjoyed my first year at McPherson as a member of the Bulldogs football team. I feel as if I made a great choice when I chose MC!"
Freshman,5,"My online experience has been good. The professors posted assignments and grades in plenty of time and was available to help if I needed assistance. I have never really done online classes, so my first experience was good. I made sure I set aside time to get my work done early."
Niche User,5,On the visit I was very excited to see that everyone seemed to know everyone.  I want to be a person not just a number.
Niche User,5,"I absolutely loved McPherson College! I went to a small high school, so it had that small town community feel. The professors took the time to get to know each student."
Junior,5,"Everyone is so amazing here! The classes are small, so the professors are able to give you attention and help that you need. The staff work their hardest to make sure that everyone is comfortable, and that student life is engaged! We love our giant Bulldog family!"
Freshman,5,"McPherson college has been like a second home to me. The staff are incredibly welcoming and helpful since I have become apart of the community. The professors are always more than willing to offer extra help to student in need. Campus activities occur often, and are always fun, and most times they offer a prize."
Niche User,5,"The staff and current students make you feel welcome the moment you walk in the door, they are the only college that offers a 4 year degree in what i want to do."
Freshman,5,"I chose to come to McPherson College because of the flourishing band program, and I couldn't be any happier with my decision to come here. It has a homey atmosphere and the teachers actually care about you and get to know you."
Freshman,5,It's a very accepting school.  Good teachers.  Great environment for learning.   Lots of school spirit.
Freshman,5,"I Love the student teacher ratio! The teachers, faculty and city want Mac Students to be successful."
Freshman,5,"My experience has been great thus far. From Admissions personnel, to my fellow students, to my professors and coaches, they have all made my coming to McPherson an awesome experience. Everyone is so friendly and family orientated."
Freshman,5,"Helpful counselors and advisors. The entire staff is very welcoming and make you feel like you are part of the campus community, not just a number. Small classes allow for more time for professors to help each student."
College Freshman,5,"I love living in my dorm. Compared to the other dorms on campus, the ""Morrison"" dorm is the nicest all boys dorm, and there is another similar all girls dorm called ""Bittinger."" This dorm has the biggest floor plan of all the dorms and is the freshest smelling and nicest looking."
College Junior,5,"From what I have heard from past students and professors,  it is pretty easy to get a job with a degree from my college. In my field one can get a job as little as 3 months out of college"
College Junior,5,All of the classes are pretty small. The professors are very interested in each student and their success in the class.
College Junior,5,"Every year there is a safety surgery for students to fill out and anything that needs fixed, the staff does what they can to adjust."
College Junior,5,The dorms are pretty great. There's plenty of room and places to be social. It is however difficult to get alone time when you have to share a bedroom
Sophomore,4,"Even though the school is small and located in a small town, if you find the right people, opportunities becomes endless. The staff and faculty are really helpful and strive to make you feel welcomed. The people there truly become your second family."
Freshman,4,Great small town experience. Very nice people who come out to support the college in any type of event being held.
Freshman,4,"I’m a student athlete and I am more than happy with my choice of McPherson College. The facilities are more than acceptable, food is good, and the professors are very knowledgeable and ready to help.  It would be nice if there were more activities on campus though."
Alum,4,"Overall, I enjoyed my time at McPherson College as a Student/ Athlete and the surrounding McPherson Community. Great small college atmosphere for any student not wanting to get ""lost in the crowd"" of a major state college or university."
Sophomore,4,"I was terrified to come to college, away from home, where I didn't know anyone. However, I have never felt unwelcome, excluded, or upset in any way with my experience here. Playing basketball here along with keeping up with classes, working for the tutoring department, and participating in events on campus can keep a person very busy and sometimes overwhelmed. Yet, I have never felt alone in any of those areas; the support system with my coaches, professors, and peers has been beyond my expectations. I would even go as far to say that this little college in Kansas has become my home."
Junior,4,"McPherson College is a great school if you are interested in going to a smaller school. The classrooms and professors are wonderful. I would say a class average is anywhere between 15 and 25. Now, if you are interested in a bigger school then this is not the school for you. This school is also big in athletics and most the students that attend McPherson play a sport."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are attentive and are very invested in your education, the staff do their best to find you money and where you need to be. Overall amazing."
Freshman,4,"McPherson college is a good place if you want to primarily focus on school, or if you want to continue your sport, but you aren't DI level. It is a pretty campus with nice students, and kind staff. If you come to McPherson you have to realize that you will be an open book. Everybody knows everybody. There are a few flaws, but that comes with all small schools!"
Freshman,4,This school makes you feel welcome and safe.  The staff are helpful and very encouraging.  The campus is well laid out and pleasant to be at.  Students are very diverse; coming from all over the country and international.  Their Automotive Restoration Program is world renown.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe on campus not matter if I'm with a group or by myself. The people are kind and respectful so I don't have any worries of someone committing a crime on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I think sports is a big part of campus and the students try and get others to come to the games, no matter what the sport is. Coming to sporting events shows campus participation, which is a really big deal."
College Freshman,4,"Even though the school is small, it has a great atmosphere. The teachers as well as most of the students are friendly and willing to help."
College Junior,4,I'm not a sports person. I did however photograph shorts for a semester. The facilities are great. They are always clean and up to date. The whole campus supports the teams and everyone is encouraged to go to the games.
College Junior,4,All of the teachers and staff are so nice and helpful. Everyone is interested in seeing each student succeed. The college also had plenty of activities and shorts to choose from to keep students active in the college experience. The schools biggest focus is Scholarship. Participation. Service. They want all students to be active in college life and in helping others as well as doing well in Class. Their goal is to create whole persons by the time everyone graduates.
College Junior,4,"Class sizes are usually 15 or less, the professors all really do care. I have no real complaints."
College Junior,4,"I personally enjoy it, having that separation from home has been terrific and I've loved it. Meeting new people a lot more than just in class. Though the prices (as it is a private school) are a bit ridiculous."
College Sophomore,4,"McPherson College is a small campus which is nice with a lot of diversity. I have had the opportunity to meet all sorts of people and learn about different cultures at the same time as my roommate is from London, England. I have made so many new friends and while there are times where I miss home, I wouldn't change my college decision because of the people I have got to know."
College Junior,4,"I live off campus with relatives, easiest way to try and save a little bit of money."
College Junior,4,Parking spots are available all around campus just have to know where to look.
College Junior,4,The labs are always available to use and the tech guys are always very willing to help.
College Freshman,4,"There are many fast food restaurants that surround us off campus. Late night, and during the day. Not a lot of healthey options but everything is pretty much in a college students budget."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors really strive to help you, if you ask."
College Sophomore,4,"While it was diverse, it was widely accepted."
College Sophomore,4,There were normal check w/ fair warning!
College Sophomore,4,"Love going to the games, everyone's involved!"
College Sophomore,4,Really talk to the Financial Aid office!
College Sophomore,4,drive around and guarantee you'll find a fast food place to eat
College Sophomore,4,just have fun and do the right thing
College Sophomore,4,depends on your meal plan
College Sophomore,4,everyone is different and accepted
College Sophomore,4,focus on your major and what it takes to receive our degree
College Sophomore,4,work is good just need to study
College Sophomore,4,athletics are the main attraction
College Sophomore,4,i had no problem. just have enough credits
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy psychology. the instructors make it easy to be helped and understand the material
College Sophomore,4,The academics on campus is great. The classes are small which ultimately leads to more one-on-one time with the professor which can be very helpful. The workload is fairly average. There tends to be a lot of papers to write and the average amount of exams and quizzes throughout the semester.
College Sophomore,4,The computers on campus are not technically up to date but they work perfectly fine. The network speed works incredibly well considering that there are more than 300 people using the same network at once. The wireless is pretty amazing considering that I can use my WiFi all over the campus.
College Sophomore,4,The school athletics are very fun. Most of the student population attends the varsity games. Students tend to make posters and post them up all over the school to try and encourage others to help support our fellow athletes.
College Freshman,4,"Overall drug use here is fairly low, and those that do partake in them are both subtle and in control of their use."
College Freshman,4,"The campus as a whole is not too strict, unless it has to do with alcohol, violence, or drug use, all which are quite rare throughout the school."
Junior,2,"The administration department is laughable at times which explains why you never get the classes you need. The dorms have paper thin walls and are in need of maintenance constantly. Adding insult to injury off campus living isn't offered until you're a junior. They have off campus living through the school, but much like the dorms they are in need of maintenance. The gen eds are pretty terrible depending on the professor. I like the idea of a smaller school, but McPherson feels too much like a high school and makes me dread going to social events around the school. Everyone knows everyone, drama and popularity is important to many individuals. All of these combined has had a negative impact throuought my stay. If you have believe that McPherson is like any other normal college get that idea out of your head. It is not my goal to bash this college, but to inform others of the negative that this institution has before making a major life decision."
College Freshman,2,We do not have greek life
College Sophomore,2,"Personally the school is very expensive. We never know where the tuition money goes because the halls and cafeteria need a bunch of upgrading. The best part of the school is the size, you can actually focus on academics and get the help from professors who also guide you to be successful. 

Tuition is more expensive then bigger state schools"
College Sophomore,2,There are no parties here at the college. Off- campus parties hardly ever happen also. Maybe two or three parties and these parties are really small.
College Sophomore,2,"If you do the math, a meal a day at the college is about $9. The food is uncooked at times and has no flavor or taste. Breakfast is the same thing on the menu every day. Sometimes you can even taste the re-use flavor of the food. For example, one day they will make chicken strips then the next day you will have chicken strips with marinara sauce. You then know the food is re used. I would rate the food here a 4.5 out of 10."
College Freshman,2,We do not have any Greek life as far as I know. I have not heard of any.
College Junior,2,Thee is not much to do in McPherson. It is very remote and there is very little activities to do. There are not many cultural events on campus. Sports/recreation is not very god here. Attitude toward students is nice.
College Junior,2,During the winter time everyone just eats alot and stays indoors. Not many people played in the snow.
College Junior,2,The good thing about printing is that it is for free. The bad news is that there is no color printing so you really cannot make great copies. Network reliability is bad. The wireless network is slow and take awhile to load. The network on my computer cashes everyday.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather here in Kansas is ridiculously cold. Coming from California was a huge difference. Sweaters, jackets, and scarves are definite items that one should bring if they are going to attend school in Kansas."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not very much diversity on campus. For the most part, all athletes hangout with their teammates and non-athletes tend to hangout with people who share the same major as them. There are a small handful of homosexual males and females on campus. The females are treated as if they were straight, but the males get treated like they are contagious."
College Freshman,2,There really is no greek life at my school
College Junior,2,"I received enough financial aid to cover my tuition, but the rest of the costs that were added onto my school bill were ridiculous. They have generous scholarships but not a lot of opportunity. Dealing with the people at the financial aid office is an alright experience, but they're just after the money you can pay then and there even if you opt to pay the remainder over the course of 10 months."
Recent Alumnus,2,Easy Going – The security is not very strict unless needed.  They give you a few warnings before you are sent home/ kicked out off school.  I feel really safe at school and my mom does not need to worry.
Sophomore,1,"This school is GARBAGE!! DO NOT ATTEND!!!!
I spent one semester here and already transferring to another university back home. This school is the worst school in America food is terrible and the campus is trash.  Classes are super easy toooo easy. If you passed high school you can pass here only 5 good people that work on campus way to expensive if you come here your most likely just coming here to be in debt. This school is not diverse at all"
Sophomore,1,The campus sucks the food sucks everything really on here as bull. The cafe is to packet for the amount of students. The location is absolute trash. The only reason anyone should even consider coming here is for the restoration program which still need refinement. The athletics are ehhh and the teacher are good beside the most pointless grabage class they make everyone take that aren’t at normal schools.
College Junior,1,Very inconsistent with the food and food is reused way too often.
College Junior,1,Transportation options at school are very minimal usually you get around by taking a bike or walking if you do not have a car. Or you can ask someone that you know to take you somewhere. There is no public transportation like back in California.
College Junior,1,"There are not many healthy places to eat. Usually it is just chain restaurants that are available. I gurantee if you drive 15 minutes in any direction when you are in Kansas you will find an applebees, Long John Silvers, or a KFC."
College Sophomore,1,There are actually no fraternities or sororities on campus so there would be no form of a Greek social atmosphere.
College Freshman,1,There realy is no public transportation in this small town.
College Freshman,1,There is hardly any clubs. Nothing really going on in the small town.
College Freshman,1,If you want money from McPherson College you better hope you have a long line of relatives that went to school here. Otherwise you aren't going to get very much money at all!
College Junior,1,This is one think I would like to see at McPherson College.  I wish I had the opportunity to rush a sorority.  Most of my famiy were in sororities and I wanted to do that as well.

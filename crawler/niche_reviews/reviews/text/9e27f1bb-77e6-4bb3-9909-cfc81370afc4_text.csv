Niche User,5,They have alot of online classes and its easy to navigate them. You could almost finish your entire AA from your home.
Junior,5,I have been with PHSC since my junior year in High school. I could not see myself with any other college. They have really helped me pursue my career and do what they can to help me get there. The teachers and staff are very friendly and help in anyway they can.
Junior,5,My last semester was all online classes and I could not have had a better time. I loved the classes and comfort of doing them on my own pace in my own time. The classes were easy to navigate and gave a good amount of work for me to do in the time I had to complete it.
Sophomore,5,"I took online and hybrid classes at the beginning of my first year. The professors make it really easy and guides you through the online classes. During the big COVID-19 outbreak, the professors truly did everything in their power to make the online transition as smooth as possible. They put in a lot of work and effort to make sure that everybody was still learning."
Sophomore,5,"I am now a sophomore at Pasco-Hernando State College and I really enjoy my time here so far! All of the professors I have were all very caring and genuinely wanted me to learn and passed the class successfully. The staffs are also extremely helpful and nice, especially the advisors. I know I can depend on them when I am stuck or have questions. The campus is also really nicely taken care of, and that is so important. A nice clean campus allows me to fully focus on my studies."
Sophomore,5,"I really love this college! There are so many resources on campus it makes it easy to be successful in your classes, and the professors are really great and make the classes enjoyable (for the most part). I really love this specific campus, it has so much nature surrounding it and in it, and the Quista cafe is my personal favorite spot to be. I love going for breakfast and for lunch, and going there just to catch up on my studies and homework, or just to hang out with my friends. Pasco Hernando State College is a great school with a great education system and I would and have recommended it to people!"

Sophomore,5,Very easy and accessible. Professors do a great job in trying to get the information out to us in a clear and concise manner.

Alum,5,The process was simple and easy. Great for a first time college student. it might also be because I wasn't transferring at the time.
Sophomore,5,My online experience has been great. It’s not overwhelming and the professors have been great and understanding! They offer extra help!
Sophomore,5,"PHSC has several campuses, but I only have experience in the Porter Campus in Wesley Chapel.  All of the professors I’ve had were all very talented and well-rounded.  The classrooms are small enough to rival a high school vibe, but still intimidating enough to rival a college vibe- about 15-40 students each classroom. The campus itself is beautiful- surrounded by nature, lots of quiet places outdoors to sit and study.  The library is a good study spot too.  The students and staff are respectful and quiet there.  I have heard of some of my friends having trouble contacting Advising and Financial Aid, but I have not personally had any problems at all. Appointments are easy to make and they except walk-ins.  The staff at Financial Aid and Advising are really nice and helpful."
Sophomore,5,Everyone was friendly at phsc! Although it wasn’t easy it did push me to grow in my education and prepare me for my career. They did a lot of stuff for the students and did their best to transition into a social distanced learning environment.
Sophomore,5,"Although it was difficult at times, the professors were always there to help and we got the work done. Also the micro apps class prepared us for online in many ways."
Sophomore,5,"Professors strive to provide very organized online content. Their ability to use powerpoints and prerecorded lectures is one of the many resources they make available to you, for you journey."

Freshman,5,When I first decided to go back to college I had looked at Pasco-Hernando. I had many questions and concerns about my education. I do have a learning  and minor physical disability along with hearing loss. I had met with one of the Student Accessibility Services advisors. She took the time and had met with me before I was enrolled. She gave me all the information needed to get help to get into college. All the staff have been very accommodating to my needs. Well done PHSC
Freshman,5,"All throughout high school, I always thought I wanted to attend a traditional four-year college with thousands of students and class sizes of hundreds.  I thought that where my friends were going would be a good fit for me too. Now, I understand how wrong I was. Pasco-Hernando State College feels like a second home to me and even if I don't have class, I am always there studying in the many study areas available. My teachers are more than willing to help me with my work, and students are always welcome to visit teachers during their office hours. Many teachers will reply quickly to emails, so there is no lack of communication between students and teachers. Attending a community college has been the best decision I have ever made and made my transition from high school to college effortless. Pasco-Hernando State College is an excellent school with an abundance of resources to help me learn and grow."
Freshman,5,"Honestly, it's great and you feel like you're at home. The professors care and you have all the resources you need at PHSC."
Freshman,5,I give this college 5 stars because my overall experience has been great! I knew right away that PHSC was the college I wanted to attend after meeting some welcoming students and the amazing tour they provided. Professors are wonderful and very clear on what they expect from us students.
Freshman,5,"I love how there are multiple types of clubs that can teach you about your career. For example, at PHSC, there is a DATA Club for students who want to study engineering or programming. In this club, you get work with many people and cooperate together on projects that can help you understand technology as it is now. Also, If you are having trouble with any of your subjects, there are tutoring sessions that assist you and you do not have pay for the tutoring at all."
Niche User,5,"PHSC has many options for class schedules, with ones that will accommodate your bus,life and has great professors, I have loved all of mine so far. If I could change one thing, I would expand the different types of degrees you can get there."
Senior,5,"Pasco-Hernando State College is a great place to start your college journey. The teachers are great, if you ever need help they are always there to assist. Everyone from administration to the janitors want the best experience for the students. There’s so much to do on campus as well, there’s a club for everyone. Every student is able to experience the “college life”."
Freshman,5,"""Leonardo, hold mommy's hand!"" 
  I announced to my 2 yr old as I walked through the substantially alluring campus. As i proceeded my eyes laid on a middle-aged woman in her cap & gown. This encouraged me to move forward. The view was so magnificent, yet intimidating. The greenest of green trees and grass swaying to & fro with the wind, dancing in a welcoming manor. The suns gentle rays beaming down on the easy description signs of directional of the campus Of course my son instantly started to act his age. The Receptionist immediate attention went to my toddler; she was swift, delightful & was exceptionally accommodating. As I got ready to return to the Salvation Army Domestic Violence Shelter my eyes grazed over the lavish campus & motivation as well as encouragement glittered of me.
      My first experience to this college could not have been anymore brilliant!"
Freshman,5,the college is amazing! I was hesitant at first about going to a community college but this school changed my mind as soon as I stepped onto the campus! the teachers are amazing and there are always activities going on.
Sophomore,5,I have loved my last two year at PHSC. I love how the class sizes are small and how much effort professors put into their students. They truly care about us and our careers!
Freshman,5,"I love it here I attend the Porter campus and its kind of isolated but its quiet small campus and its close to many places, its beautiful and the view is amazing. The advisers are really good with helping you find the right curriculum for you. the teachers that i have taken so far have all been amazing and really good at what they teach. Overall the school is a great place I love the campus and the staff has helped me a lot with planning my future. I wish that they offered more classes at the porter campus but the other offer class."
Sophomore,5,It has been great. I have taken all of my classes with PHSC directly online. Everything is simple. I would definitely recommend them to my friends and family to also take classes with them. They have made receiving my degree simple and easy. Their classes aren't expensive either. They have several campuses for convenience.
Niche User,5,i recently had college day at my school nature coast tech in brooksville fl and the 2 ladies there were very helpful. they gave me and my mom lots of info and answered all of our concerning questions.
Niche User,5,I have met so many new people at PHSC. I have also gained so much knowledge about my interests for my future career. I believe that the classes I have taken at PHSC have prepared me to further my education at another university.
Freshman,5,The admissions office and staff are very welcoming and are sure to give you the best information possible in order to get that jumpstart on your future
Sophomore,5,"The professors I have had thus far have been very knowledgable and genuinely care about my academic success.

Graduate Student,5,"This college is amazing. There are great classes and even better professors.
The campuses are so nice and everyone is so helpful and nice. This college made such a big impact on me and gave such a wonderful school environment and experience. The tutors are also the best in the world. I hope everyone gets to experience this amazing place."
Sophomore,5,"I have been a student at PHSC for about a year. In this year, I have become more and more comfortable with the tactics of the courses provided at this college. I have transformed from an on campus student to an online student; both unforgettable experiences. Throughout the college, there is non stop help and guidance to shoot you to the right college after graduating with your degree. Unfortunately, Pasco Hernando State College is not a 4 year university; but it is suggested because of my experience here; I feel any student would be lucky to attend ."
Niche User,5,I have attended PHSC in the past when it was just a community college. I have had the pleasure of attending four of its five campus's. They have come a very long way since being a community college. The campus's are beautiful and clean. The staff are very helpful and pleasant. I have never had a bad experience at any of the campuses. I obtained an associates in paralegal assisting and am now working on my associates in Nursing. Each campus delivers a peaceful and quite atmosphere in which to study and learn. I enjoy PHSC and will continue on working toward my BSN when I graduate next year.
Freshman,5,"Anytime I've reached out to the college for anything they have been extremely quick with their response (even over breaks), they've been really clear and straightforward and have helped in anyway possible making it a simple process."
Freshman,5,This college is very friendly and organized even the students. This is the best school to start up at. The counselor and office workers are very friendly and helpful

Sophomore,5,Great option for students who cannot afford to attend a private college or university. The staff is passionate about what they do. I have taken three classes here and all of the teachers have been helpful. I wish the waiting list for nursing wasn't so long.
Freshman,5,My experience at Pasco Hernando so far has been amazing. I go to one of their smallest campuses but its really nice and they have great professors and good class times that work with my schedule. They are always doing something where you can get involved in the community.  There's really nothing that needs to change because its just been great all the way around.
Freshman,4,I'm only a freshman but it's been good so far. I hope I'm able to take some of my  classes on campus soon. It would make thing's a bit easier for me.
Niche User,4,"They have alot of online classes and the website is very easy to navigate. The dual enrollment program is great, and it’s so close to my highschool."
Sophomore,4,"I did not take any online classes, but we did use online softwares and textbooks in nursing school and they were easy to use."
Sophomore,4,The nursing program here is pretty good. The teachers really care about the students and wat to see you succeed. The campus s pretty and there are lots of events on campus.
Graduate Student,4,"Overall I very much enjoyed my time at Pasco Hernando State College (PHSC). I am so happy that PHSC was my first experience into a college lifestyle. Academically the state college focuses mainly on medical degrees while lacking in other degrees such as, biology focused programs. However, the brighter side of the college is that it is very local allowing for a diverse student body. Although PHSC doesn't offer dorms/housing for their students the campus if very welcoming with a smaller campus so you don't feel overwhelmed entering into college from a high school setting. The professors who work at PHSC are honestly my favorite part of attending the school. Not only can you tell that they really love their job, they make a real effort to ensure that you are getting the help and education that you need to succeed."
Graduate Student,4,Personally I did not take any online classes with Pasco Hernando State College. My classes consisted of on campus classes and my experience with those classes were very positive.
Sophomore,4,"I haven't taken any online classes to date, but I am enrolled in two online classes for this upcoming fall semester. I have been in multiple hybrid courses that are half online and half in person. Those classes have been great and the professors I have had in the past were very good about posting announcements and what not in canvas."
Alum,4,the teachers were very good at using the internet to enhance our learning and getting us to talk/write to our fellow classmates.
Sophomore,4,Online is simple and the teachers are willing to help you. It’s very convenient for students who are working full time or do not have child care.
Sophomore,4,The student aid and teachers have all been wonderful and they truly want to help and are understanding. I worked as a student worker there and saw first hand how wonderful they were even when I went through a tough patch. I do wish there were more opportunities to make friends however and more athletics as well.
Sophomore,4,"I took one online class in my first semester at PHSC.  Naturally, the material was harder to learn (for me at least) because I had to rely almost completely on the textbook.  However, the format of an online class is very simple- get the assignments done by the due date.  If you can set away time to commit to an online course for a couple of hours a week and take advantage of an academic planner, than online shouldn’t be a problem."
Sophomore,4,"I moved her from previous being at Valencia college I’m Orlando, and I love this school. Teachers are amazing and so helpful."
Sophomore,4,"Teacher care about students. Office staff is really nice. Nice book store and cafe, cute campus. There is always something to do on campus."
Sophomore,4,Online classes were interactive and educational. In nearly all weekly or bi-weekly discussions were completed. Most teachers graded quick.
Sophomore,4,"Teachers are understanding and eager to help. All of the professors I’ve had so far, except one, have been excellent! Tuition costs are fair. And there is a plethora of support from academic advisors, financial advisors, free tutors for students and tons of other available resources. Overall a great school!"
Sophomore,4,Online courses are great. The professors are always there to help. Plus online resources and tutors.
Sophomore,4,"I started at this school during my junior year as a dual-enrollment student. Up until now, my experience at this school has been terrific. I've been able to accomplish many things in regards to preparing myself for graduate school and my life after I am all graduated. Pasco-Hernando State College a wonderful place to start."
Freshman,4,"Pasco Hernando State College is a 2-year community college that is affordable for the locals in the area. I've heard great things in the college, being able to have a bright future that in an affordable manner. In this college I enjoy the opportunities, environment, and communication among the peers. Attending this college in the next semester will be thrilling to finally start my career."
Sophomore,4,"Pros - openness of campus, flexibility of schedule
Cons - limited coursework selection, instructors without bachelor’s degrees"
Sophomore,4,"I am currently in my second and last year at Pasco-Hernando State College. I study at the Porter Campus in Wesley Chapel. Overall, I have enjoyed my experience and there are many opportunities available at this school. I have become a member of two honors societies, and I was able to be employed as a tutor here for 3 semesters. The staff is great, and I've only had a couple of professors that did not teach effectively. I am very happy that I chose this school to start out with!"
Alum,4,I loved the quaint classes and school atmosphere here. The school is surrounded by fields and makes outdoor breaks and fresh air even better.

Junior,4,PHSC is a great campus. The environment is well put and I really enjoy my time spent here being that I am also a transfer student from a junior college.
Freshman,4,"As a whole, PHSC is a pretty nice school. For the most part, the students and faculty are pretty easy going. Since I'm only a freshman I still have a lot to learn. So far my professors are nice and already very helpful. The food is not bad the the parking area could be alot better. The classrooms are a nice size but some  of them are overcrowded. My very 1st class this semester was overcrowded and I had no where to sit. My professor was good about it and made it work. Overall, I love PHSC."
Graduate Student,4,"I went to the Porter campus and it was very nice, with plenty of parking, a safe campus, great professors and courses. The only drawback was the admissions office was always too busy and hard to get help and advisement from.  I spent over two years there as I worked many hours but I am glad to say I have transferred my credits to university. Thank you PHSC!"
Alum,4,"Going to this college was a life changing experience. I started at that school not caring or knowing what I wanted to do with my life. I would just keep my head down, go to class, and go home. One day however, I was approached by the student life coordinator to participate in events. Soon after, I get elected into the student government and become an advocate for 28 schools in the Florida College System, talking with our senators about College affordability and better options for our students. I became a liaison for the students at my campus to get strengthen the connection between administrators and students."
Freshman,4,"If you are looking for a cheap way to get through college, this is a good school to go to.  It has an inviting environment and intimate classes.  There are a lot of campus activities to get involved in the community.  The college offers several different kinds of clubs, including honors clubs.  The professors are welcoming and supportive, they want you to succeed.  Most of the teachers I've had either have practical experience in their fields or previous experience teaching at a university level."
Niche User,4,I have had a good experience with PHSC as a dual enrollment student. The teachers are helpful and kind. The campus is clean and welcoming.
Freshman,4,"The campus is very nice but it lacks the enjoyable events with student life. The professors are nice and will help you out a lot. Tuition is cheap with five classes only costing you $1,500! Which is a perfect stepping stone for students who want to work hard in college to make up for lack of care in high school."
Senior,4,PHSC is a very good school with great staff that offers a variety of courses. I've enjoyed my time here immensely and I'd honestly recommend it to anyone looking for an affordable college experience.
Freshman,4,Currently enrolled in the radiographic technology program and almost done with my first year. It is a fantastic program and the professors are amazing and full of knowledge to help me prosper in my educational career.
Freshman,4,Nice teachers and online courses I have taken are very easy to navigate. Students I have encountered are nice as well.

Sophomore,4,I enjoy my time at Pasco Hernando State College. So far I have had all pleasant experiences with my professors. The classes are challenging but not horrible. The students are friendly and it is very easy to make friends and study groups.
Freshman,4,"They are resourceful and they help their students out as much as possible. If there is one thing I could change is their starting process, they should do more in person to help instead of online"
Niche User,4,PHSC is an average community college that allows you to receive your AA efficiently and without fuss. The campus is easy to navigate and the staff is kind. I've had a good experience with PHSC.
Sophomore,4,East campus was a good school when I went there. It has grown up over the years though. A lot of commercialization though. If you are looking for specific classes to transfer to a bigger college later make sure to check what they offer and what you will need.
Freshman,4,My experience with Pasco Hernando college was been very well. The teachers I've had were all very nice and went out of their way to help their students. The campuses are always clean and look really nice. Other students are very friendly and sociable.
Senior,4,"Some professors i would not recommend, others I recommend to everyone. The campus I attended was organized and prioritized student comfort and happiness.

Sophomore,4,"I've definitely had teachers that cared about their jobs, but I've also had odd experiences with people who should not be teaching. As a whole the campus is lovely."
Junior,4,"Over all very good school. All the teachers want to see you succeed and are great about not over loading the assignment. very affordable, safe, and clean campus. I'm in the RN program and it's very rigorous but they say that everyone wants to hire a PHSC grad because we know our stuff."
Freshman,4,"I have bee going to PHSC for a year now and honetly it has been amazing. the professor are alwys there for you and know what they are talking about, you feel like everyday you learn something new. the staff is very kind, helpful, and willing to go the extra mile for you. I wound not change my experience here for anything in the world."
Niche User,4,The classes and the teachers have been great so far. It's affordable and the variety of campuses are convenient.
Niche User,4,Pasco hernando state college is a college that consists of 5 campuses which is good but if a class is not offered at one college you would have to drive about 45  minutes to get to the other campus.
Freshman,4,"The professors are very easy to understand and teach their materials in an easy to understand way. I have only had two semesters here, but I have enjoyed all of my professors. The staff is pretty great to, the help you out, when you ask for it, and help lead you to where you will best succeed."
Senior,4,My experience  has been good. They try there hardest to work with you as much as possible. And make it a little more convenient.
Sophomore,4,PHSC has good instructors for a wide variety of courses. It has many campuses which provides students with different options.
Sophomore,4,PHSC has been amazingly accommodating to my needs as a non traditional student. They are making my degree seeking become successful. The advisors are great but we need morevtime with them. The Financial Aid department seems to run like a well oiled machine . Alot of brand new teachers though. and thats rough.
Senior,4,PHSC is a fantastic state college. They offer four year degrees with the convenience of small campuses and smaller class sizes.
Alum,4,I have graduated with my nursing degree from PHSC. Now returning to get my Bachelors degree from here. It is a wonderful school. I love the close-knit environment. Teachers have all been great and have never felt not supported in my education goals at PHSC.
Alum,4,The campus is really pretty and taken care of. At Pasco-Hernando State College the professors are very helpful and respectful. This college is a very good one to start out with. I enjoyed my time there a lot.
Alum,4,This college is a great starting point for students who are nervous or cannot afford going to a University or Private college. I had a great experience the two years I attended.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the small class sizes. The campuses are all very nice. The professors are easy to get a hold of and they all want to see you succeed in college. They are willing to help as long as you are willing to do the work. Overall I have been happy with my experience at the school.
Junior,4,I love that PHSC has on campus security that patrols all hours. This makes the campus a safe environment and comforting. Something that could change would be the guidance you receive on enrollment. I prefer to enroll online for my classes due to lack of help I received in the office.
Sophomore,4,"Pasco - Hernando is a great college in it's  academics, teachers are carrying. It's in a great location and very it's very safe."
Sophomore,4,"PHSC is great for the most part, but the Spring Hill campus needs better communication between the students and faculty. They are late on relaying information, and sometimes up and provide false information. They are a clean establishment and have high expectations for students. They always have advisors ready to help when students need it. The staff are (for the most part) very nice."
Sophomore,4,It is a beautiful school with wonderful educators. Only problem is the organization of the staff in the office. I am transferred multiple times to sometimes not even find the answer to my question.
Freshman,4,"I have had a very good experience. The property is clean and well-maintained. I have enjoyed all of my classes. My professors have all enjoyed teaching. Canvas is easy to use, and it's helpful to see all of my assignments in one place. The staff is knowledgeable, and a academic adviser always answers my questions."
Sophomore,2,"The teachers do not care for their students, administration is a mess and the disabilities department made me take the same class two times because of an error they made.  I wouldn't wish anyone went through the same struggles I went through since it was really stressful.  I tried giving this college a chance but they really dropped the ball."
Sophomore,2,"I attended PHSC with the intention of attending for two years to receive my AA degree.  My course plan began complicated due to AP credits, and the advising at the school was not able offer advice or help.  Advisors may be overworked, as when I sought the help of an advisor for guidance on my situation, they were difficult to get ahold of.  They also did not give me very much information or answers to my questions, and I feel were ill-equipped in helping me transition into a university.  This school is a good option for those returning to school or do not have a desire to attend a university.  In my opinion, PHSC is more focused on that body of students versus the entire student population."
Junior,2,"This school is extremely affordable, however, this tends to show in most areas. Professors range, in the natural sense between quite terrible and absolutely wonderful. Unfortunately, the school seems to often higher the least qualified (see: cheapest) faculty they can find, and many don't seem entirely suited to the environment. Extra-curriculars, at least in the less populated campuses, are nearly non-existant, with only the most standard options being available.

The financial aid department here is... terrible. Unfortunately, there is simply no other way to describe it. I have had to go over the heads of the local administrators every single semester for a simple renewal, and I have had to start classes late on multiple occasions due to unfinished paperwork (not on my part.)

By no means is this school ""avoid at all costs,"" but it is exactly ""you get what you pay for."" With a college education, that can amount to very little for what may seem like a lot of money."
Sophomore,2,"Some very good teachers here, but also some that just didn't know what they've were doing. I Would like to see this school require the teachers to have teaching degrees."
Freshman,2,"I attend the Spring Hill campus of this school and have hated my experience there. It's a fairly cheap school, seeing as it is a community college. The campus is always clean and well kept. However, diversity is a minimum because of the community it is in and athletics are no better than the high school level. Sports are only offered at the Port Richey Campus. Also, there is only one small food truck on the Spring Hill campus, no dining options at all. There is next to no student life on campus and the professors are exactly what you pay for. My humanities professor went above and beyond but some professors fall extremely short. Many teachers make their political ideologies known, even in classes where politics are no factor in the curriculum. There are very minimal chances to meet new people and everyone there seems to already have their group. Overall, I can't wait to transfer out of this school, worst choice I ever made was to stay local."
College Student,2,My first semester was great! My second semester was good too but part of it was not. My online teacher stunk because I had a family emergency and he did not understand at all. He gave me so many problems.
College Sophomore,2,It isn't a very admired school and it doesn't have many connections. After graduating one would work at the local hospital and such.
College Sophomore,2,"I took a developmental writing course where I believed the teacher wasn't really doing her job. My professor would constantly talk about all the work she had to do, because she also taught at a high school and an online course. I felt like we would turn in our work and instead of reading it, the professor would just give us a 90% because we had five paragraphs. There weren't that many student taking the class, the professor should have had enough time to look through our papers. It really annoyed me when we would ask her questions when one of us was stuck and the teacher would claim to have taught us that already when all the professor would do is sit in front of the computer. As far as my other courses went they went pretty good."
Recent Alumnus,2,My experience with the financial aid office has not been great. I have to make multiple trips because they do not tell me everything i need to know all at once
College Junior,2,I do not like on line courses
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid hard to work with.  Pretty much on my own.  No communication, or follow up (as promised).  Just to bad so sad."
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid office is a mess. They don't give you all the paperwork you need at once and you have to keep going back and fixing things. The tuition isn't bad but the process is terrible.
College Senior,2,I did not qualify for any financial aid so I must pay everything in full.  My tips to students who want financial aid is to fill out the FASFA early and make an appointment to see an advisor. They will let you know what kind of aid you qualify for. I think I'm getting good value of what I have paid in tuition. My only complaint is the price for printing/copying in the library. It is 10 cents a page at PHSC and it can get pricy when you have a teacher that required lots of papers to be printed.
College Senior,2,"Councilors at PHSC are clueless about what comes next. I have not graduated yet, but I have asked them a few questions about transferring to a university. They almost never know the answer to anything."
College Junior,2,Its Extremely hard to receive financial aid. I live on my own and have no support from my family and Its hard enough paying bills let alone school
Recent Alumnus,2,"Professors are unwilling to allow make-up work and tests, or make-up clinical days, even for illness or emergencies!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Many professors don't like to be questioned or expound on subjects.  Curriculum needs to be totally updated and professors need to take refresher courses, immediately!  Professors need course in: ""Respect and Common Courtesy 101. ""No real study options or help offered."
Recent Alumnus,2,"This school used to be well respected for its RN Nursing program in the Tampa Bay area.  However, it has gone downhill in the past couple of years and is too busy spending all of its money on building more campuses, instead of on hiring better educators."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Until the 2014 Spring Semester, I had felt I was getting a pretty good return for my money, education wise.  However, this past semester was a fiasco and, basically, a joke. I feel this institution needs to really work a little harder at acquiring better educated and forward thinking instructors!!  I am entering my final semester of RN Nursing in the fall."
College Junior,2,There isn't much that stands out.
College Senior,2,Teacher was rather rude and insulting
College Junior,2,"At the dade city campus there is no library, no study area except for the student resource center but it consists of loud students and a lot of noise. No lunch or dining area. No place to buy food , very small and limited. Not a great study area for students. Computer labs are always locked so you csnnot use unless supervised"
College Student,2,I dont take online classes
College Junior,2,Had to rate this semi low because there is not wifi here! This is a huge let down because that is very necessary in order to do school work.  I don't want to have to go to a computer lab just for quick researches that I COULD be doing on my tablet or laptop. 
College Freshman,2,I've heard from several students that the school is not on top of their game when it comes to career services.
College Junior,2,"I have not graduated yet, but i did apply for the work study program at my school and i have not heard from them. They are not on top that kind of thing. I went several times to ask them but i get the same response or none at all. I understand they have a lot to do but if a student is coming in need of help for finding a job or entering a program that can help them with welfare services they should be more helpful."
College Sophomore,2,"I had to constantly ""ride the coat tails"" of the Financial Aid Dept. I kept getting different stories of what was needed and who actually knew what the process was that was going on. No one gave me a printed list of documents or a checklist that I had to have for everything to be turned in all at once. I had to ""fish"" for answers and nothing was given voluntarily. After deciding to take five hours out of my schedule to sit and wait for answers and clarity at the Main Campus in New Port Richey, I got the help and answers that I needed and a lot of accomplished tasks completed. I've found that if you aren't willing to go the extra mile in whatever circumstance, no one else will either."
College Junior,2,"The financial aid office is always busy. It's like pulling teeth to see someone on a ""walk in"" basis. Unfortunately, I don't get financial aid because I'm under the age of 24 and the deciding factor is based on my parents income. However, I'm completely independent and can't get any assistance. After being denied assistance, there is no other advise that the Financial Aid wants to offer. They just send out a letter through the mail without advise."
College Sophomore,2,I don't get much financial aid here. I really need more money in order to afford classes and get where I want to in life.
College Senior,2,"I believe the financial aid office could be a little more helpful. Sometimes they just talk to people at the front desk, standing, instead of really trying to get to know their problem or situation. It's hard to get information when you feel like your being rushed. Sometime they gave me the run around on certain things and I felt they didn't care if I went there or not."
College Junior,2,"The online courses and the professors for the coursers, in my opinion, need work. The professors interaction from my experience was very vague, like they didn't care. Many of the exams seemed like they were meant to trick, not test. I probably would not take another online course from this school again."
Recent Alumnus,2,"My school is a community college that through the years has stepped up its game, however, they have not stepped up their environment for the students. The new campus they had built, looks like a down grade to all the other campuses they have."
College Freshman,2,"The spring hill campus does not have a lot of resources for the students. It is a smaller, newer campus and is still small."
College Student,2,"I'm currently a resident of Florida, but have not been for long enough so for the next two semesters, I will need to pay the out of state rates. This is especially tough because I earned no financial aid. I am currently taking two classes and finished one of the courses that ends on April 29th in less than one month. I did a lot of self teaching and received a 98 on the final exam! The courses are fairly easy and quite expensive for my particular case, so that is what I gave the tuition and financial aid a C-."
College Senior,2,"I do not know that this campus is any different from any other community college. There are probably amazing activities and such that everybody gets pumped up for. My cousin also plays for the baseball team and loves it, so if you are wanting to get involved, get out there and do it!!"
College Senior,2,"I have had a mixed experience with online classes. One I just took was extremely hard causing me to have to breakdowns any time something was due. On the other hand, I have taken a couple of classes that I looked forward to the work for."
College Junior,2,I honestly do not think they help find a job. Most students transfer to a university after.
College Junior,2,"Moderately Happy With My Choice – The reason that i gave it a C is the fact that the financial aid is absolutely horrible, the organization, and knowledge of things that i need to know is not found there at all. The reason being is that they dont have enough poeple and the people that they have are brought up to how to managa a student and their time wisely. As soon as they meet with the student, they should tell what the student will need to fill out our bring and where to get the info, so that like I and including many others dont have to come to the office 7-9 times to get everything done. They only tell you a little of what you need and then next time you bring that item thinking that your are done they not only have another thing for you to bring, but they wont take what you brought that day until you bring in the paperwork that they told you that day. And believe me that cycle continues on for those 7-9 times, im not even exagerating."
College Senior,2,"Somewhat Not Helpful – I find the financial aid office not helpful. I've gotten no financial aid even though i'm in need of it, and it's been difficult to pay for my classes. I wish they would help me out a little more in regards of financial need."
College Senior,2,"It felt like a lot of people who were losers in high school, or older people going back to school. I didn't feel a lot in common."
Freshman,1,horrible there is no advising help they do not care about the students. no one answers the voice malls no matter how many times you leave a message
Freshman,1,this school is seriously horrible they do not help at all very hard to get in contact with anyone beware do not go to this school
Niche User,1,They do not care to assist in college requirements. They will block you in every way they can to destroy your success to enter college.
Sophomore,1,"The quality of instruction is a joke. This school takes advantage of the poor population in Hernando-Pasco counties by selling them the idea of a better future, but in reality only takes your money and give you a sad excuse for an education."
Alum,1,"I graduated with my Associate Degree in Nursing several years ago. When they started offering a Bachelors degree in Nursing, I was told I needed a few undergraduate classes before I could apply for the program. I have finished those classes, and now that I am ready to apply for the BSN program, I was told the program is changing to full-time only program. It will be impossible to work full-time and go to school full-time, so all my prep work in completing those classes is for nothing. I couldn't be more disappointed that this school is ignoring the needs of the community and the students by making the BSN program full-time. There is a nursing shortage and they are making it MORE DIFFUCULT to earn the BSN that employers are requiring these days. I will be completing my BSN elsewhere."
Alum,1,"Don't know who these people are who are giving this school high ratings. This place was a nightmare, and the only good thing about it is that it will motivate you to want to get out of here as fast as possible.

The biology department is decent, if you take Wiatrowski or Hannick; the Chemistry Department is a complete and total disaster, if you take it here you will regret it.

Would solely come here to finish the Gordon Rule classes, but anything serious (such as Chemistry), hell no.

Also I've met more open racists, White Supremacists, and White Nationalists then I can count here. If you're a minority - I urge you not to attend the New Port Richey and Dade City Campuses.

This place sucks."
Alum,1,"The teachers are wonderful, almost always nice and helpful. There is a scenic pond on the West Campus that houses wildlife (though no one seems to understand that the animals should NOT eat cheeze-its). Everything else is a nightmare. You'll get contradictory info from different departments and first-time sign up for anything is a multi-step process that includes redoing paperwork that could've been avoided. This semester alone I was given misleading information on PELL disbursement that suggested I'd have my money a week before classes. However, this was only available through the college store via my Student ID so now plans I made for buying (cheaper) textbooks online, etc have to be scrapped because no one thought to clarify the difference between the two disbursement dates. 

The school could definitely be worse but I've had way too many unprofessional interactions outside the classrooms to give a good review. Luz Himelhoc is a quality educator and PHSC doesn't deserve her."
College Junior,1,Personally I do not like doing online courses. I have taken one and I will never take another one. The one was difficult for me the other I couldn't ever get a hold of my teacher to get help.
College Student,1,My sister had a bad experience with multiple advisor not knowing what they were doing and messing up her degree requirements and career plan. I do not use them I feel I'm better off on my own.
College Student,1,Nursing degree is the main degree that had very good prospects and resources.
College Sophomore,1,"I don't think we have any of that, at least I haven't heard of any of it there."
College Freshman,1,they don't have any programs or internships.
College Senior,1,"Biology, the teacher will talk really quickly and to a point you couldn't understand."
College Junior,1,"The process for Dual Enrollment students is HORRIBLE. We have to get our classes approved by our guidance counselor and administrator before signing up for classes and then go to the college campus on allotted days to sign up, and if the classes we want are full, then we have to start the whole process over again.  And then we are only given the first two days of each semester to get our books at a textbook depository 45 minutes away while school is still in session."
College Junior,1,"I go to school at the local community college, the post-grad options are non-existent they offer nursing degrees and dental assistant technical degrees but nothing that will make a sustainable income."
College Junior,1,There are no resources at the dade city campus which makes it discouraging to go
Recent Alumnus,1,PHCC is a community college with very few job opportunities offered.
Recent Alumnus,1,"There's no athletic center on the campus I go to, the activities are few and far inbetween, the student center is limited to helpers and the libraries shelves are bare and next to no computers if a student needs one."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I had a teacher who was rude, did not want to help, every time I sent her a message asking her a question she got nasty and really defiant through the semester to the point I actually started failing because I didn't know what to do and when I would do assignments based off of her syllabus she would write me the day before due date telling me what I did was wrong because she decided to change it."
College Senior,1,I guess because i am more of a visual and i need human interaction the online courses for me were absolutely terrible.

Junior,5,My professors have been very open minded during these hard times. They all have given the option to be completely online or to be a hybrid class. I chose to do completely online in order to work and learn asynchronously.
Junior,5,"From the advisors, teachers, and the students, they are all great. They have all been helpful in making my life as a student easier than it really seems."
Freshman,5,"The honors program does have a few issues with professors. Some expect you to 'just know this because you are in the honors program"", which isn't how it works. They try to be understanding with online classes, but it's hard to contact them."
Freshman,5,"The campus is so beautiful in the fall and every campus staff member is so nice. I love everything about campus, and there aren't any roads throughout campus (only by housing)."
Graduate Student,5,Attending the University of Louisville has opened a lot of doors for me. I became a Cards fan immediately and I've love the experience. Everyone treat you like family and this is important. The professors and academic advisors are amazing and everyone will help support you with class all the way to your personal life. They offer great resourced to help prepare you for your career and other professional opportunities.
Junior,5,I love the University of Louisville!  It is so diverse and very easy to get involved on campus because of the wide variety of opportunities available!
Junior,5,"I am a transfer to the University of Louisville, I transferred from Stephen F. Austin State University in Texas. I am a junior in college, and I am taking all of my classes this year online. I have so much on my plate with work, and cheer practices, that normally I  have barely any time for school, but since now that I am taking all online classes starting this semester, I can manage my own schedule and do everything I need to do during the day or week as I need to and whenever I want to as well. I love taking all my classes online at the University of Louisville. All of the online professors are very informational with online courses and I feel like I am learning way more online than I would be in person classes. This is my first year to take all of my classes online, and so far I am making A's in every single class. I will defiantly be taking all online courses for the remaining of my college classes throughout the next few years. I love everything about University of Louisville!"
Junior,5,I love the University of Louisville overall. Such a big school with a lot of opportunities to succeed.
Alum,5,"Excellent instructors, fair tuition price. Great sports. Ma
ny interships available. Opportunites were given to students."
Junior,5,Blackboard based system and most of the instructors open up the entire class the first day of the semester.
Junior,5,Overall it’s been a blast! The CHED department is amazing. The profs actually give a damn which you don’t get from a lot of places.
Freshman,5,"Most of my classes are hybrid, with that, there have been challenges that test me, but I am adjusting."
Freshman,5,"My experience with UofL has been an ecstatic experience! I have been blessed by being given the opportunity to connect with my advisors, professors, and counselors and they all have been so kind, understanding, and helpful in many areas of my incoming college experience."
Senior,5,"I will always appreciate the university of louisville. It definitely has a community aspect to it. You will always feel that you a part of an organization that has a unified goal in mind. To not only make your education purposeful, but also to let you know that they are there to help. You will have professors every now and then that you may not get along with, but overwhelmingly every one of them just want you to do your best and to see that your trying your hardest."
Senior,5,"The university of louisville uses an online platform called blackboard, and every class I have taken also uses an online textbook/homework site as well. I did have a pretty serious issue with one of my professors. Throughout the entire semester, I never received a response to any emails. The only help I could get was from the TA. However, I have met others that have taken her class as well and ran into the same issues. Other than her, every online class has been great. Everything is easy to navigate. The syllabus is always spot on and very helpful. In short, if you do the work, online classes will be very beneficial and generally easier than in class."
Sophomore,5,"All of my professors are very patience and understandable. The professors want to help you, they will provide you with resources on campus to help you succeed in college and in life. Everyone at the University of Louisville are phenomenal communicators. You can expect a response within 24 hours. They are great! Go Cards!"
Junior,5,A great place to meet unique people and change your point of view. I am so thankful for attending U of L because I wouldn’t believe the things I do today if I was not going to school there.
Freshman,5,The University of Louisville is a great school that offers quality programs and includes plenty of diversity. It really feels like a community.
Freshman,5,The online learning experience so far with the University of Louisville has been more than adequate. The teachings are clear and I learn so much from them.

Senior,5,UofL offers extensive online programs with some degrees being offered completely online. I have only ever had excellent experiences with online classes and materials.
Junior,5,"Online classes are great because you get work on your own pace the only thing I would suggest is the fact that you have to make sure to check it every day, there were times where I forgot to check my online courses and have missed a few deadlines but most of the time the professors are very understanding that we have a work-life on top of being a student"
Freshman,5,Great experience so far. I love the school and the campus. They make the transition for high school to college simple.
Freshman,5,I haven’t taken any online classes yet. But I have heard that the classes are fun yet still challenging.
Sophomore,5,"I am about to be a sophomore at U of L and let me tell you, it has been an amazing experience so far! The teachers there are so dedicated to making you succeed and the students are all so nice and dedicated to their studies! Also, as a commuting student, the on campus safety police makes me feel so saved and assured that nothing bad will happen as i am walking late to the tarc. And if it was too late for the tarc to drive me to my car, the on campus police will not hesitate to drive you! Diversity is also a very big part of our student life at U of L, which is amazing since I am a hispanic student! It feels so nice being a part of a community that supports you through thick and thin while also making so many new friends there and I just can't wait for the next 3 years to follow!!!"
Sophomore,5,"During the start of the pandemic, early march, our school had to reroute its way of teaching and hostly as a first time of most of the teachers doing online teaching, it was bad. they made sure that everyone was able to reach the material and succeed in all ways possible. they even extended their office hours so students who aren't in the same time zone are able to reach them whenever. it was tricky at first but they were able to manage it with us!!"
Sophomore,5,"Experiencing The University of Louisville has been nothing less than amazing. From the Students to the Faculty, Everyone is there for a purpose and it is presented well throughout campus. Louisville as a city is one big family that rallies behind the University and Vice Versa."
Sophomore,5,The online learning experience was troubling but Professors are always willing to help and take time out of their day to teach lessons over remote communication to ensure their students have a clear understanding of the lessons.
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I have had a good experience with U of L. The campus is safe and there are well-lit paths. Once admitted to the school you are signed up for RAVE alerts which informs each student about security alerts around campus. The professors are incredibly helpful. There are plenty of clubs to join covering a wide range of interests. I'm not much of a sports person but if you are, this is a great school for it."
Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere at UofL and the diversity. The university is a great place to learn. Most professors truly care about their students.
Sophomore,5,I have taken some classes online during the pandemic. They were all helpful and beneficial to my learning.
Senior,5,I love being at this university! My professors have been great and they offer many resources to help students be sucessful!
Junior,5,I attended the University of Louisville because it was close to home and I really liked the campus. I am able to work at UPS while attending school and am currently debt free! I have really enjoyed being a student at UofL for the past 2 years.

Junior,5,"Even though the University of Louisville is a fairly large school, they keep class sizes to a minimum which allows for more individual attention. Professors are more than willing to help if you are struggling, and they will go out of their way to ensure that you complete the class with a passing grade."
Niche User,5,"It has been a few years since I last visited the the University of Louisville, and a lot of new things have been added. But the campus is very spacious and full of things to do. Aside from the size of the campus, it offers a lot of majors to choose from. For example it has a very good nursing program. The University of Louisville also has several residence halls that offer a variety of different amenities for different price ranges. In general, it is a very good school, that has something for everyone."
Freshman,5,The diversity and gracious culture of Louisville is no where close to other colleges and I always can find help from others there.
Senior,5,"I transferred here and loved the atmosphere. The professors are understanding people and always expect the best out of you but understand that life does happen. As a criminal justice major it is hard to schedule classes because a lot of electives tend to be online and you have to pay out of pocket to take online courses. That can be very expensive so financial aide is incredibly important so make sure you fill out the fafsa. Also, scholarship opportunities are limited so make you apply for outside scholarships because it is the best way to pay for your education."
Niche User,5,"I love it here, and I can’t wait to go there. The campus life is amazing here and the facilities are amazing."
Senior,5,"UofL is an accepting school, for a university in Kentucky. In addition, professors are generally understanding, and the city is really nice to be in."
Graduate Student,5,The University is a good place to make great connections in the field that you want to go into. The people here are striving to make the community a better place. they are also there to help you succeed both in the classroom and in life. They are not just going to pass you through they will make sure that you know what you are doing and how to handle problems that may occur.
Niche User,5,"I love how welcoming U of L is. They are always willing to take your questions and answer them to the best of their ability. If they don't know the answer, they will work hard to find someone who does. U of L makes you feel at home without even going to start school there."
Freshman,5,"The University of Louisville is an amazing college. The campus is very diverse and the food is great. The classes can be large, but the professors make you feel wanted and like you have a purpose in being there. I recommend anyone to attend there and will promise that you like it!"
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely LOVE UofL! Everyone, everywhere is so nice and motivating! I couldn’t have picked a better university to be apart of!"
Freshman,5,I enjoy the diversity of the university of louisville and the personable relationships the president builds.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love campus! It's beautiful and spread out; just an overall gorgeous campus. My professors are great, I've met a lot of amazing people, and I've thoroughly enjoyed my first semester at UofL!"
Niche User,5,Somewhere that truly makes you feel at home no matter where you are on campus. Nowhere in Kentucky is as bustling and diverse as UofL's campus.
Junior,5,I love UofL. It has the large community feel while still being a fairly small college. I like the opportunities I have been given just by going to UofL. It has treated me well.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Louisville has been amazing so far! The academics have been amazing and have pushed me to work hard, and I've made lots of new friends being away from home. The environment here is great."
Niche User,5,"I was accepted into the University of Louisville's School of Dentistry so I decided to tour the Belknap campus along with the School of Dentistry. I absolutely loved both campuses. The student guides were exceptionally kind and took the group around the whole campus. The School of Dentistry was absolutely captivating. It was large and inviting. The students were very kind to me and answered my questions as I toured. The academic counselor was fantastic, as well. I highly recommend all students applying for colleges to look into the University of Louisville."
Junior,5,The best part of attending the University of Louisville is the inclusion and diversity on and around campus. Campus is rich with culture and diversity is celebrated regularly!
Junior,5,Louisville has a beautiful campus. They are constantly improving the grounds and building new buildings. It's an exciting thing to be a part of!
Freshman,5,"The University of Louisville is not like other universities. At UofL, you really learn what it is like to be a proud ""Cardinal"" and what""Cardinal Pride"" really means. I had the privilege of the oppurtunity to leave home and go to an out-of-state college, but chose to attend UofL because I thought it was the right fit for me. And I was right! The university is amazing and I reccomned everyone to apply."
Sophomore,5,"I am a music student at UofL double majoring in Choral Music Education and Piano Performance. I absolutely love the campus, the people I met here, the professors I work with, the facilities, and the environment! I have so many wonderful opportunities to go to conferences, travel internationally, work with world-renowned performers and clinicians, and push myself to be the best student I possibly can. Go Cards!"
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my experience at Louisville thus far. Everyone here, including faculty and even students, want you to succeed and will help you to do so. The campus is beautiful and makes the commute to class interesting and relaxing.  While the campus housing and dining hall could use improvements, the campus, and Louisville itself, makeup where dining and housing are lacking. I love Louisville and all it has to offer. I absolutely feel as though I am investing in the right university."
Niche User,5,"This University is uniquely amazing and has such a vast range of diversity in student population, education, and even cultural avenues."
Freshman,5,The University of Louisville is a place where you can meet new people different but respect themselves and others which make the beauty of it .I was scared when I first come there but the advisor showed me the way to go so I be successful .I can say the same abut the culture .I've always seen people judging others because of their accent of skin color but I rarely here those type of comment around which bring an livable atmosphere around us .
Freshman,5,"I love the welcoming atmosphere here, the food is amazing, and the professors are really nice. Although the campus is gigantic and it’s takes almost fifteen minutes to get across campus, it’s a large campus for opportunity with joining clubs and plenty of new people to meet."
Freshman,5,"The University of Louisville is overall an amazing school. Everything about the University is great. During the summer I was taking classes and living on campus. I had an amazing time getting to meet people and mature over the time here. With the school year starting soon, I hope to continue to grow as a person and use my resources to enhance my learning experience so that I can pursue being a special education teacher. There is honestly nothing bad that I can about this campus or wish that it would improve. There are so many resources available to students to ensure their success in the classroom whether it is with tutors or even the library."
Senior,5,Louisville creates a combined sense of community education. As it is not by itself an academic institution but it is a city that has its own culture and area for personal development outside of academia. I have been pushed to the highest level of intelligence by all of my professors!
Junior,4,I have not taken classes online as I was not in school during the coronavirus. I have heard from friends it is better than other schools and teachers have remained relatively responsive.
Freshman,4,"I’m in my second month here at Louisville, and I love it. The atmosphere of the campus is amazing and safety on campus is not a huge issue. They have a great safety app called Rave that alerts you of anything happening on campus. I will say with the protests here have caused some worry, but the school has done a great job of keeping campus safe. My main issue is housing. They are AWFUL at communicating. As a school who requires freshman to live on campus, unless commuting and/or over the age of 21, they should provide etiquette housing for students, but fall short in quite a few dorms. They are building a new freshman dorm that will be nice, and tearing down those with mold and cockroaches (finally). Louisville is a great school for those who are outgoing and active. Lots of clubs and extra curricular’s to join if you want to."
Freshman,4,Online courses have been a breeze. Professors are great at communicating and keeping blackboard updated.
Graduate Student,4,My online experience at this University was very smooth. They are well organized with blackboard and I rarely had issues finding assignments or meeting the requirement. I personally felt like I had some type of control over my education with this experience.
Junior,4,"So far, my online learning experience is very good!  My professors are really working with us this semester to make sure that we have the best opportunity to succeed.  If we do not understand something in the syllabus or the content, the professors get back to us within a day at max!  It is creating a good environment to learn in not so good of times."
Senior,4,I enjoyed the campus and it’s a nice area. Lobe the professors there and students. The food can be better but overall it’s a decent place to go to school.
Senior,4,I’ve never taken an online class but I’ve heard it’s intense. It really depends on how well you study
Graduate Student,4,"I didn't intend on going to UofL, but I've very glad I ended up there. I found a wonderful community, fantastic professors, and a lively campus life."
Graduate Student,4,"I didn't take any classes that were intended to be online, but at the beginning of COVID some of my classes did end online. The professors didn't do anything particularly noteworthy, but were focused on maintaining community."
Alum,4,Did not have online opportunities when I graduated for University of Louisville. Great opportunity for student especially in the age of covid.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, most of my classes are online due to the Corona virus pandemic so not at all what I was visioning my"" college life"" to be like. I will take this time to practice social distancing and not having to wear a mask for most of my classes are online! So I can "" breathe "" easy while getting my studies on!"
Freshman,4,A college freshman starting my college experience while Covid-19 is in full force. Lots of challenging moments to endure and incorporate into my daily life as a college freshman! Should be memorable.......Go Cards!
Niche User,4,nice big campus. parking could be better. went to visit my friend on this campus and had to pay for parking
Sophomore,4,"I have been on Blackboard and ULink and these two sources are great sources for students and professors to find grades, classes, financial aid information. They are reliable sources which is a must in anything that you do. These websites are the key to succeed at the University of Louisville."
Alum,4,"While attending the University OF Louisville, I can say that I thuroughly enjoyed my time there. The faculty was nice and wonderful. They really do care about helping their students get to where they want to be. The campus was lively and robust. I got everything I was expecting to get out of the college and I haven't been disappointed since."
Junior,4,"Sometimes there was a little lack of communication, and there was an overwhelming amount of reading, but overall a pretty positive experience."
Senior,4,The university of Louisville has a dynamic campus with a diverse population. There is so many opportunities to learn and experience.
Senior,4,The transition for online learning was tough for me as I struggled to adjust and some professors did as well. Since I am a music student it made things tough to adapt but in the end we found a way to make it work.
Junior,4,"I loved UofL, it a nice big public school. If you love big classrooms with students filled in them then UofL is definitely a place to checkout. They built a whole new huge building for students' resources. The library is great and big great for reading, studying, doing homework,etc..."
Sophomore,4,"When Covid happened, Louisville adapted to the change very well and helped the students make sure they were getting the best education they could."
Sophomore,4,"I fell in love with the openness of the campus right away. I enjoyed my professors and classes too, along with the people and friends I met."
Sophomore,4,"UofL is a great school that has a lot to offer. They have  great football and basketball teams. The campus is not huge for the size of the school, but that makes it nice because classes are not more than 15 minutes away. Our president has done a good job in her first two years, and I believe that UofL will continue to get better."
Sophomore,4,"I was forced into a online environment with Covid. The teachers went out of their way to make sure that everyone was still understanding the material. Although I was not a fan of online classes, the teachers made sure to be there and were very understanding of everyone's circumstances."
Sophomore,4,"Having currently attended Uofl for a full school year, here is my synopsis of my experience so far. I feel pretty comfortable on campus as far as safety is concerned. They have a well-lit path that students can use after dark if they have late classes and those of us who commute can use the school's Tarc buses to get around campus. Although you get used to it, parking at the stadium off campus is a bit of a con. There is lots of places to eat lunch on campus. Some of the buildings could use some work, as well as the roads near the stadium, but we make do. The Professors I've had so far have been decent, no issues past communication. Homework can be a bit heavy at times, but that's just college. My worst complaint at the present is the expense and lack of communication. If you intend to apply, make sure to stay informed and ask lots of questions.  Meet with your advisor every semester, research payment and scholarship reapplications carefully, check your email, and get that degree!"
Sophomore,4,I took a majority of classes online for my first year. I enjoyed the way the classes were set up. It does require more attention than on-campus classes but it is nice to work at your own pace. I would recommend it for anyone who works unusual hours or who works a lot.
Senior,4,"The University of Louisville has a stunning campus and very helpful teachers. Also, the administration at the university is very helpful in financial aid, registration, housing, or any other questions that may arise as a student. Go Cards!"
Sophomore,4,"I love everything about this campus and the education I am receiving. The professors are amazing and genuinely care about their students, even if it’s a big lecture. They help with so many different aspects of college, including life before and after. The Counseling Center and Campus Health provide some of the best care I’ve had from clinics. The Career Center is extremely helpful when applying for internships or future jobs. The IT Center has been there for me any time I’ve had laptop/internet issues. Every resource is possible on this campus with extraordinary staff to help you along the way. My time at UofL has been nothing short of everything I hoped for when I came to college."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely love UofL and do not think any other college would be better for me! That being said, it still is not perfect and could always improve. UofL prides themself for being the most diverse school in Kentucky, yet they do little to support minorities on campus. It is the most inclusive school, but UofL could do even more for their students. Safety is another issue, as there are many crimes that happen right off campus students are unaware of. Campus is safe, but anywhere off can be a little sketchy. I have never had any safety issues but I know some people who have. Despite this, it is still an amazing school with something to offer for every student!"
Junior,4,Some areas lack safety on campus but the university is now doing its best to transition to online classes because of the coronavirus outbreak.
Sophomore,4,"It is a nice state school. The professors here are very good and let students know when they are available to help. Has an interesting major called the individualized major, which is used to study more of what you want."
Alum,4,"Decent campus-life, solid academic, great networking. The professors seemed to care about the well-being of their students and their academic success. They were great resources to me in my collegiate experience."
Junior,4,I would like to see more diversity on U of L’s campus. It is a great institution that offers many programs and majors. It is large and has many opportunities to be involved on campus.
Senior,4,University of Louisville has recently started their Social Work Bachelor and Master's program 100% online.
Senior,4,"Louisville gave me everything I didn't know I needed to succeed! I found professors to be very accessible and for the most part understanding; Campus life to be awesome, but the best part was living in such a cool city! The city of Louisville is now a place I am very happy to call home, that has amazing restaurants, bars, and a great music scene. The campus fits smugly in the middle of everything going on, and does a great job of keeping its students in the loop of city happenings. I also found student organizations and other ways to get involved on campus extremely accessible and student support resources existed and I knew where and how to get help if I needed it."
Senior,4,"Great experience. Incredible students, faculty, and staff. Easy to get involved and stay connected. Great atmosphere overall."
Freshman,4,"The University of Louisville is a good college. There could be improvement in quality of the classroom as well as quality of professors. This being the first year of college it could change, but the teachers teach dry and out of textbooks. Everything else is overall a great experience. Campus life is nice and convenient with the farthest class being a 10 minute walk. Also, the student life is beaming with diversity and fun experiences around every corner.  So far its been a decent experience and has given something to look forward to for the remaining academic years."
Senior,4,"They have a really good online program with easy to use platforms, and have been very responsive through email."
Sophomore,4,I like how small the campus is but some of the buildings need to be upgraded. The humanities teachers are very nice. I am taking Arabic and the professor is amazing. He makes sure the students understand what he is saying and wants everyone to pass. The chemistry teachers are not amazing.
Freshman,4,"Campus is great, it’s big but not too big.  It’s easy to get to class and get to wherever you’re going."
Junior,4,I like that their local university and that they off online courses. They have a great successful rate of graduate and they have a great sports background. They also have programs that assist people with disabilities and that help those that want to earn a degree get established in getting what they need to attend school.
Freshman,4,"Overall the University of Louisville is a great school and it's easy to feel welcomed here. The professors are pretty good as a whole and depending on the school you're in your professors might be better suited to teach. The dorm living is the worst part of Louisville and I highly recommend at least a suite dorm. The traditional housing units are run down, have mold problems, and a cockroach problem. Outside of that, Louisville is a great school and campus."
Niche User,4,I have been on the University of Louisville campus one time a few years ago and from what I remember the campus is fantastic. I love the scenery and the people there.
Sophomore,4,"Although the University offers many great opportunities for students, the campus safety could use much improvement. The Greek life on campus has been on of my best experiences and provided me with many other opportunities."
Junior,4,"University of Louisville is an amazing school overall. The buildings and classrooms are very nice and good learning environments. The professors are kind and care about helping you out, especially if you put the effort in. There are many places to hang out and get your work done, as well as many different dining locations and coffee shops. The one thing I would like to see change is more available parking for students."
Junior,4,"For the most part, the college of business operates smoothly. I think scantrons should be covered by tuition."
Junior,4,University of Louisville is an outstanding school. I was able to transfer my credits without any problems and everyone was very helpful with the process. It is a very active and fun school. All different kinds of programs and sporting events.
Freshman,4,"Figuring out financial aid and how it is all displayed on the student website was incredibly confusing. However, it is a beautiful campus, with dedicated professors and a lot of transportation options. Wish their was healthier food options though."
Freshman,4,The classes are interesting and diverse. A lot of the professors are very dedicated to teaching and making sure students are learning. The dorms could be better. Athletics are good.
Sophomore,4,"It's nice overall but the location is horrible. The second you step off campus, you're in a really bad area. As long as you're on campus though, you should be fine :D"
Senior,4,"The University of Louisville offers a great variety of classes. However, I feel that this school's tuition is overpriced for the education in which you receive."
Sophomore,4,Overall it’s a good school. I would just like to see more student activities on campus during down time so we can take a break from studying.
Freshman,4,I love how university of Louisville is a place where students can meet new people. Our sports teams are very talented so there are athletes coming from all over the U.S which is a big advantage. University of Louisville also accepts students from other countries so students get to experience new cultures as well.
Sophomore,4,I am a recent transfer student and the process of transferring was very easy. The only thing that I would say wasn't very good was that they lost some of my scores and said they didn't receive my FAFSA but then emailed me back a couple of hours later and said nevermind we do have it.
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at UofL. Helpful advising, good instructors, clean campus, good amount of food, good housing."
Senior,4,"I like the diverse atmosphere of Univeristy of Louisville. However, some learning equipment is outdated."
Graduate Student,4,"The faculty were all amazing and I enjoyed the campus and my time spent at the University. My only problem was the fact I had to go on medical leave for a year, and they would not remove the classes I had medically withdrawn from from my transcript."
Freshman,4,"I like how nice the teachers and the whole community is. Most of them teach detailed and not too fast paced so everyone has a fair chance to learn and succeed. However, I would like to see scheduling classes become an easier process."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Louisville is the most inclusive, friendly place in the city. There are not racial barriers, no hatred towards different beliefs, only love and kindness towards each other."
Senior,4,"Most of the professors in the engineering department are great adn I am thankful that I haven't had to take many classes throughout the arts and sciences departments. Any Social Behavioral classes besides Anthropology have a very distinct left leaning tilt, and you are likely to get a poor grade if you don't subscribe to their ideology. Stick with a STEM major and you'll be fine."
Freshman,4,"I am very pleased with my decision to complete my secondary education at the University of Louisville.  It's engineering school is second to none, U of L Speed School is well known in this part of the country for it's academic achievements,  available internships, and career placement opportunities.   The University of Louisville is situated on the Ohio River in a three state area, merging with Indiana to the Northwest, and Ohio to the Northeast, making everything you would ever want to do right at the tip of your fingertips.  Louisville is home to the Kentucky Derby, the most ""exciting 2 minutes in sports."" It is also one of the most diverse cities in the country and the academics offered at the University are beyond compare.  Among the 12 academic schools and colleges you'll find   engineering, nursing, medical school, dentistry, the Louis Brandeis school of law, just to name a few.  A++ is my grade to this university."
Junior,2,When we went online for COVID the university didn't give their professors the right tools to teach online and we all fumbled very badly when it came to figuring out how to do testing and keep up with academics despite it all.
Junior,2,"I have had problems with safety, with advisors and other things but overall, i feel like the education im recieving is good."
Freshman,2,The engineering program is ridiculously difficult and the professors keep making it harder. I wanted to do engineering but was basically forced out.
Junior,2,"I rate my overall experience at U of L low only due to the interactions I've had with other students and clubs.  I have loved and enjoyed my classes at U of L and have loved most of the teachers I have had but being on campus and trying to go about my day is hard on U of L's campus.  While I support being diverse as a University I don't agree with forcing it upon other students during their school time.  It is a public campus and everyone has the right to say and do what they want, but I wish the University would put some restrictions on what clubs can do on campus during a school week."
Junior,2,"My experience at the University has been an uphill battle,  from financial aid falling through causing me to have to get a job to the overall student population seeming like they don't welcome strangers or new people."
Alum,2,"U of L is all about the athletics. There is little emphasis on the actual educational aspect of the college. Labs lack equipment and leak water. Faculty and staff are often sub-par. Parking is a nightmare. The school is incredibly over-priced and consistently increases tuition by the max amount allowed by law, every semester! There is always to much controversy surrounding the school, that I am pretty sure my degree from there is laughable."
College Junior,2,"Our campus seems to brag about how diverse it is. But, minorities aren't treated well. Last year the president had a party with students and staff in brown face. When the Latin American Student Organization and allies tried to protest, they were patronized and the whole attempt was in vain. The fact that there is a Pan-African studies department is a miracle. The Native American Student Organization will probably disband in a year. There were racist incidents in freshman dorms last year.  Microaggressions run rampant."
College Senior,2,They could use some improvements
College Freshman,2,I lived in student housing first semester bust disliked it so much I moved home my second semester. It is okay but not worth the money.
College Freshman,2,"You've got the really crappy places that are mildly affordable like Unitas Tower, or you've got the ridiculously expensive but infinitely better places like Bettie Johnson Hall. However, even for the nice Bettie Johnson, which has private bedrooms, shared but not community bathrooms, and kitchen in unit, the place still has a lot of problems, mainly with cheap appliances and maintenance never responding to requests to fix them."
College Freshman,2,"My FAFSA keeps saying there is a problem, well the school says that, but there isn't anything wrong with it and I probably will not get money from them great!"
College Freshman,2,i'm seriously struggling to pay
College Freshman,2,they don't know what they are doing at clllllllllllll
College Freshman,2,"nothing good AT ALL

h8 parting here

legit AAWFUL"
College Sophomore,2,Way to hard on students
College Junior,2,Greeks don't really want to be friends with non greeks. To make good crowd of friends at UofL you either have to rush or be in a sport.
Recent Alumnus,2,The school does a bad job in working with students.
College Sophomore,2,"Haha value of a degree? Let's go thousands of dollars in debt because the school wants to raise tuition for new athletic facilities. Sure, you can get a job, but it's just a degree, where it comes from shouldn't matter."
College Sophomore,2,"Really? It's downtown Louisville, every day there's some sort of crime whether it be a shooting or a robbery. The university police are a joke. Always sending out alerts for crime in the area, they usually leave it up to LMPD to deal with the crimes. I think they get their officers from Rent-a-cop"
College Sophomore,2,"Not the best thing in the world, and is pretty pricy as well."
College Freshman,2,"Many of the traditional style dorms are home to mold, cockroaches, and mice. I had multiple mice in my room for my entire freshmen year, and UofL Housing failed to adequately address the problem when I brought the issue to their attention."
College Freshman,2,"While there are many conveniently placed parking lots around campus, parking is still vary frustrating. Another garage is needed to accommodate the growing student population."
College Freshman,2,"UofL employs a number of associate off-campus housing options for students. However, these associate corporations are a danger to students as they surround and choke off the campus while depriving students of other competitive off-campus options."
College Freshman,2,Louisville weather is unpredictable. This past year saw classes being cancelled multiple times due to inclement weather.
College Student,2,They are often all taken
College Senior,2,"Why is there only an option to rate the girls on campus? Excuse you, sexist survey. To answer your question in relation to boys, there are a few cute ones but they're all either A) still dating their high school girlfriend B) are married C) are gay D) are actually undateable. There's not a great way to meet people on campus, any ways."
College Senior,2,"I don't live on campus, nor do I use our health center. However, I don't notice a strong police presence, and I get a lot of emails about crime on or close to campus. When so many incidents are happening at universities across the country, I would think it would be a wake up call that there should be more security on campus. Also, I hear a lot of students say they're afraid to live in some of the off-campus options close by the university because they're not very safe (lots of break-ins and rape)."
College Senior,2,"Campus is walkable... but most students do not live on campus. The city bus is awful, and even though you can ride for free, I don't recommend it for getting around town.  Cars are a must for getting around our widely spaced out city.  We don't have a subway, and though there are bike paths around downtown, we're not what I'd call ""bike friendly"".  Campus isn't too far from the local airport, but our airport isn't as ""international"" as it claims to be. Louisville has a pretty major public transportation issue!!"
College Senior,2,"I can't help but compare UL's greek life to my previous university. I was in a sorority at my last school, and the greek life was fantastic.  Every sorority had a house or was in the process of getting one, and all of the girls wanted to live in their sorority's house.  There were so many greek organizations that most of those who wanted to get into it would be able to.  Greeks were involved on campus, did a lot for the community, and wore letters on a regular basis. That's not the case here. There is only one sorority I see wearing letters on regular basis, and I rarely hear about their events.  Only a few greeks have houses, and the rest are stuck with small space in a building that looks like an office center. There isn't a single ""big"" event that greeks and non-greeks seem to get equally excited for. The people I know that are involved in greek life at UL don't have the same relationship with their members that I saw at my last school. It's a depressing excuse for greek life."
College Senior,2,"It's a headache and a half to get financial aid. In the fall, it takes a long time for the money to come in, which makes it almost impossible to buy books and materials at the start of the term. I don't get enough to cover everything, and have had to apply for additional loans on top of what I get. However, I had more issues at my last university with financial aid, so I know it could be worse!"
College Sophomore,2,"I lived off campus for the first time this year, and absolutely hated it. The bellamy apartments constantly enforce overage fees that I can not afford. They also have cops who harass the tenants quite frequently mainly (african americans). As I have been a victim to the lack of equality."
College Sophomore,2,"Nothing but run down fast food places, no healthy alternatives."
College Junior,2,Robberies made present in my campus. Has to stop.
College Junior,2,Some parties and clubs can get out of hand.
College Sophomore,2,Parking is a problem. Not enough
College Freshman,2,"If you are of any other heritage than white, you can basically get a full ride to go here. On the other hand though, if you are white and have nothing that stands out but a grade point average you dont get any money."
College Freshman,2,There are no police patrolling around or near campus.
College Freshman,2,Greek life is pretty pointless in general on campus.
College Freshman,2,I cannot tell you how many times we have cancelled school this semester because of snow/ice.
College Freshman,2,I am only a freshmen so I haven't had a lot of experience but the teachers here know their stuff but do not really know how to teach it to us.
Recent Alumnus,2,I've never heard of anyone being sanctioned for anything.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It's either hot or cold, snowing or sunny, my allergies kill me every year."
College Freshman,2,It is sad to see how many students go out and get drunk on the weekends. There are so many.
College Freshman,2,"Most of the traditional dorm buildings are either old enough to not be suited for new generations of college students and all of our interests, or they are just completely unsanitary and unhealthy to live in in the first place. The spaciousness is nonexistent. Campuses need to move forward with the times and just make all dorms apartment-like."
College Freshman,2,People talk about smoke spots all the time and have drinks in their rooms.
College Freshman,2,Right now we are in the middle of a gosh darn winter storm! EVERYONE IS FREAKING OUT!!!
College Freshman,2,I have seen people stumbling around in the halls and with open bottles in their room in plain sight. It should be taken care of.
College Freshman,2,"I live in the oldest dorm, it's a bit ridiculous how it suffers from mold problems every year and yet it still stands."
College Junior,2,I don't use the computer much on campus because it is hard to find a free computer.
College Student,2,Computers and networking at school is rather bad. The library has very limited computers and most of them are old and outdated. Also the wireless network is total CRAP. it is always down or slow and it is NOT reliable at all.
College Student,2,All the off living housing options are for old decrepade houses and they are over prized.
College Student,2,Campus housing is rather sad. Pretty much all the buildings are old and have mold in them. The two plus sides of living on campus is the fact that you are more likely to meet new people and the fact that if you don't drive it's right on campus.
College Student,2,Here at school it is so common to overhear people talking about alcohol abuse. it's all over campus and include underage drinkers. It's hard to find someone who doesn't drink.
College Freshman,2,"Alcohol is just as prevalent here as anywhere else. Pot is prevalent, but if it's not your thing no one is gonna pressure you too much. Don't be an idiot and you won't get caught."
College Freshman,2,"The main campus is located just south of Old Louisville, one of the most beautiful (in the day) and dangerous (at night) parts of the city. Crime is a constant concern, and anything not literally locked down will be stolen (especially bikes). Non students on campus is a big concern, especially at night. Women shouldn't travel alone on or around campus at night, and men need to beware as well. "
College Freshman,2,"Very hot and humid in the summer, freezing in the winter, plenty of snow, and it changes at the blink of an eye."
College Freshman,2,"The University of Louisville is one of the best engineering schools around, but the people who built this city clearly didnt understand the concept of drainage systems. When it rains in Louisville, it floods. The drivers also dont handle the rain and snow very well "
College Freshman,2,I did not qualify for financial aid at U of L due to my families financial income 
College Junior,2,"With all the new buildings being built, it takes up spaces to park. Tickets are usually outrageous. If you are a commuter, you would park at the stadium and catch the shuttle to campus."
College Senior,2,"Finding parking is difficult even if you have a pass, and if you do find a spot, sometimes its very far away. "
Graduate Student,1,The University of Louisville offers many different programs to study. Depending on what program you are completing determines how much effort is being made by the professors. The University's number one priority is the Athletics department.
College Senior,1,"Though our facilities are nice, there is CONSTANT controversy with our athletic programs. Both the athletes and the coaches. It's a mess--they can't stay out of trouble."
College Freshman,1,"I am not a fan of UofL Greek Life. Both sororities and fraternities perpetuate rape culture, have low morals, and perform poorly academically."
College Freshman,1,Completely unreasonable pricing.  Truly takes advantage of students.
College Freshman,1,"The off- campus, campus-affiliate(Bellamy, Province, Retreat, Grove, etc) housing and apartments are really nice, but outrageously expensive. They charge around $800/mo. per person. So if 4 people live in an apartment together, it's still around $800/mo per person."
College Freshman,1,I did not receive any financial aid. I think that is stupid because my parents are not helping me with college. The amount of financial aid a college student gets should not be based off their parents' incomes.
College Freshman,1,LIKE ANYONE CAN BE IN GREEK LIFE NOT KIDDING AWFUL
College Junior,1,"I lived in an off-campus affiliated complex for exactly one month. The building had not finished construction by the time school started, rent was outrageous, the building was cheaply made, the safety was terrible, and it was a 45 minute walk to where I needed to be on campus. I ended up moving halfway through the semester because I hated it so much. Most of the off-campus complexes are the same, overpriced and unsafe."
College Sophomore,1,"Need financial aid, but has yet to receive any what so ever."
College Sophomore,1,Do not feel comfortable walking on campus at night or on the outskirts
College Sophomore,1,Campus housing is the worst. Not enough rooms for their students.
College Freshman,1,i had to summit my paper like three times which cause me to get less money.
College Sophomore,1,"I cannot register for classes until last semester is paid for. Classes start this month and I'm still dealing with the financial aid department. I've contacted them multiple times and each time a different excuse as to why they haven't gotten my package together. First it was 'I wasn't in the system', then the excuse was because it's summer break, fafsa was broke, or some other ridiculous excuse."
College Student,1,I always dread having to find a spot. It really is the worst!
College Senior,1,"I'm sure it could be worse, but I don't have a whole lot of positive things to say about our campus dining situation. First of all, meal plans are required, even if you live off-campus, and are a pain to get rid of. Secondly, the options are limited and not great quality. The McAlister's on campus is the worst I've ever eaten at but the wait is still long despite the quality! The Papa John's isn't warm by the time you get it. There's a Wendy's and a Chick-Fil-A, but I can't say much for those. We have an Einstein Bagel place in the Humanities building that I like, but is slow and always has a long line. I haven't been to the dining halls, but I haven't heard great things. At my previous university, we had a Starbucks, Panda Express, Subway (and more) in addition to decent dining halls. UL's dining options are far below my expectations."
College Sophomore,1,"Lost my scholarship due to not meeting the GPA requirements, they expect freshman to maintain a 3.0 while athletes fail classes and are rewarded for it."
College Sophomore,1,"I've been harassed over 15 times including in dorms, in my apartment complex, as well as around the campus."
College Freshman,1,Global warming causes it to literally be 70 degrees one day and snow the next. NO joke.
College Freshman,1,"OH MY GOD. Campus parking is as awful as it could be with there actually being spots on campus. Commuter parking literally requires a shuttle to get to class, and resident parking is so limited it may as well not exist. Enforcement is as strict as one could imagine. "
College Freshman,1,I get annoyed with members of Greek life. They typically think they're better than everyone else. Being a part of Greek life is just a way to buy yourself friends.
College Junior,1,There are way too few places on campus to park and the off campus parking has a 30 minute shuttle to get to class which is extremely inconvenient. The school is in dire need of another parking garage on campus.
College Senior,1,they ticket everyone with a car.
College Junior,1,"The Ohio Valley is unpredictable. You could be wearing shorts one minute then it snows that night! You never know what the weather is going to do! 
"
College Sophomore,1,"We have 2 healthy options, both of which close by 6PM. On top of that, we have about 8 restaurants in total on campus. Majority of them are closed on weekends all day. It is practically impossible to be here on weekends without spending real money on food."
College Sophomore,1,"I have yet to hear about anyone being punished for underage drinking or drugs. Yet the day I moved in (on a weekend), I didn't have a parking pass because the parking office was closed, and I got a ticket. I feel that they focus on unnecessary things rather than the actual dangers. We also have a lot of crime near the outer boundaries of campus that never seem to be taken care of completely."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is absolutely atrocious. You are required to buy a permit each year and these are given to you based on where you live. Depending on the type of permit you have, you are only allowed to park in certain lots. Off-campus residents must park at Papa John's Stadium and wait for the bus or walk to campus. On-campus residents have parking that corresponds with where they live, however, you are not told that a permit does not guarantee a spot. If you cannot find a spot, you must park your car in the Papa John's Stadium or risk being ticketed/towed."
College Junior,1,"Off campus housing is overpriced, poorly-maintained, loud, and unsafe. I have had two friends have guns held to their heads and another had her apartment broken into and robbed twice in one school year. I carry a taser and pepper spray everywhere I go."
College Senior,1,"They offer parking permits, but it is really hard to find an available space. There is paid parking, but it is expensive. There is also street parking that is free, but it is hard to find a spot there too."
College Senior,1,I have had to go to the Financial Aid office at least four times in the last couple of months because they can not seem to get their act together. I have had to resubmit the same paperwork because of their irresponsible actions.
College Sophomore,1,Not enough choices...if your an athlete and have practice late your never find anything open near campus....
College Senior,1,It's supposedly a non-smoking campus and that isn't evident anywhere.
College Sophomore,1,there isnt enough and its fast food and the hours are ridiculous alot of places are only open for 4 hours and not on weekends at all ! more options an flex if you ask me
College Junior,1,The parking pass is ridiculously expensive and you don't even park on campus you park at the stadium 2 miles down the road and have to ride a shuttle that takes 30 minutes to get any where and is usually late. Your only other option is to park in the parking garages that are usually full and charge $8 to park there all day. I HATE their parking.
College Junior,1,Louisville is a college located around a larger city it isn't a college town. That being said there are a lot of sorority and fraternity parties but until you are 21 there are no bars or clubs or any options like that. Also there are A LOT  of robberies around campus at night.
College Freshman,1,The scholarships are not accessible to every student.
College Senior,1,Smoking Ban? This campus is not strict at all. How are you going to put in a smoking ban and make the campus a non smoking campus and have no consequences for those that still smoke. our campus is very polluted and no one cares about it.
College Junior,1,"Nothing for You – I was told that there weren't any grants or scholarships available for Master's degree students.  The only financial aid available to me was loans, and if it wasn't enough I was on my own to figure out how to come up with the money."
College Senior,1,I think they are all too expensive.  And some are far from campus which could be a problem if you do not have a car.
College Junior,1,"When in College – As a student that was not really ever exposed to many different types of drugs growing up Louisville has opened my eyes, it all goes back to your social circle, manu people either have tried or regularlly use an illegal drug not including alcohol."
College Sophomore,1,"The Food Is Better Left Untouched - The food on campus is primarily fast food.  Regardless of its status of being fast food or not, the food is overpriced for the quality and the only good thing about the required meal plan is that it is tax free.  For wanting to provide their students with good food, they are going about it completely wrong.  They have also built places nearby to eat, but they don't take the meal plan(due to them being outside of Sodexo's contract) and you have to either load up the card with more of your money, or pay for it out of pocket.  There doesn't seem like there is a real desire to make getting food on campus more convenient(or healthier) for students."

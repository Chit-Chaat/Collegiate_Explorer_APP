Sophomore,5,I signed up for various online courses to maximize my availability for potential new jobs. I am thankful for ASU's icourses.
Sophomore,5,Arizona State University is a great school because it offers many opportunities to student veterans like myself.
Sophomore,5,"I have taken two semesters fully online and some professors have adapted better than others, but overall, decent experience."
Freshman,5,Really excited to start my college years at ASU located on Downtown Phoenix Campus. I got accepted just recently and I'm on the prowl to apply for many scholarships to make my success a reality.
Freshman,5,"With current situation with Covid-19, ASU has offered many opportunity to explore ASU on a virtual platform. I've learned many important details of how ASU works!"
Sophomore,5,My experience at Arizona State University has been good. Everyone on campus is very friendly. I have found great friends at the ASU Newman Center. I overall enjoy being on campus and look forward to going there every day.
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Arizona State Univerisity is the diversity among the programs and the students. I am constantly meeting new students of different backgrounds and learning of majors I did not know even existed. I am not stationed at the main campus, Tempe, but instead Downtown. When I heard I had to live where my major is, I was very upset because Tempe is where one wants to be to receive the full college experience.  However, Downtown has benefited me in ways Tempe never could have. The campus downtown is in the city and in the middle of all the action. When I walk one street over or pass the law school every day, it reminds me of the real-world and not the college-world. This motivates me to continue my academics and hopes to one day be apart of the community and influence a curious student like me, like the strangers are today."
Sophomore,5,"Taking classes online was not a hard entity for me to transition into. Before the virus impeded, I had already been taking an ICourse and planned for another one the next quarter. ICourse's are not intimidating and I highly suggest taking them for general education classes. Some of my classes, like my honors human event, was very difficult to adapt to a technology-based setting. This class is a Socratic seminar where students talk about the reading material they had to consume before class. I noticed half the students distracted, and have been on full alert.  This semester, I choose to attend the majority of my classes in-person because that is the best learning style for me. There are sometimes only three of us in class, but I want to take advantage of this space and opportunity in case it is taken away again."
Alum,5,"ASU is great I love how the tempe library operates on a 24hr schedule. I had many late night study days there, which were needed. Downtown campus does not have that i believe they close at midnight. But to have that space available is so great. The campus is great I hate how expensive parking on each campus. The culture is great overall."
Freshman,5,Having classes online is good but it is also good to know i can still go to class to get my learning in a physical manner.
Freshman,5,"As a incoming freshman, So far college life has been a new eye opener. It has been a good experience so far with all the help I need to get adjusted."
Sophomore,5,I love the Downtown Phoenix campus of ASU it is absolutely gorgeous and I love that it's smaller than Tempe and has a much tighter knit community and everyone is so kind
Graduate Student,5,"My online experience has been very minimum because I prefer in person classes. However, the classes that I have taken online were highly organized and structure. Majority of the time my online classes were a move at your own pace, so if you are a procrastinator it may be hard. Also , classes were very easy, teachers/ TA responded very quickly, and all test were online open book. 
Overall a great experience, best advice would be to communicate with your professor at all times, no questions are dumb and ALWAYS READ YOUR SYLLABUS.  Follow those simple steps , and your semester should be great!"
Senior,5,"I took some classes online, they were easy to figure out and made is a lot simpler to take a few in-person classes while also being able to get a few courses done online."
Senior,5,I love going to the Downtown Phoenix campus for school. I've never had anything dangerous happen as there is a lot of city police as well as campus police. The professors and courses are for the part excellent.
Junior,5,"Before the Coronavirus affected academics, I was taking 2 classes online and really enjoyed the classes and the professors. When my remaining 3 classes switched to online, I really liked having all of my classes online because I was able to learn from the comfort of my own home and didn't have to commute downtown."
Junior,5,"My experience so far with being at ASU has been very pleasant. I am a transfer student from Glendale Community College and pursuing nursing as my major. Majority of my professors have been very nice and helpful in helping me achieve my goals. Overall, I would highly recommend ASU as a college to anyone."
Junior,5,"I love being a student at ASU. The professors and the environment are very welcoming. Great school, I'm so glad I chose to be Sun Devil."
Sophomore,5,"I have had an overall great experience with ASU so far. All of my professors are willing to help if asked and seem very fair with their grades. With COVID-19 occurring currently, I am pleased to say my professors have been helping as much as they can to improve our online learning experience."
Sophomore,5,"Overall this school is amazing, specifically the downtown Phoenix campus. The class sizes were perfect because I got to experience smaller classes and larger lectures. The mix of these two really helped me integrate into a college lifestyle. This campus is also very small, but it something I genuinely enjoyed because I could easily navigate around and find my way to classes, restaurants and study spots. I think the best part of this campus is the professors and resources. Professors were all very willing to provide help with whatever I needed and made plenty of time to visit with students for office hours. This campus also has great tutor center that is free of charge where I attended many study sessions that tremendously helped me in many courses!"
Senior,5,I enjoyed how the campus was smaller and it did not feel over crowded. I appreciated the resources that were available to me while attending the Downton campus.
Niche User,5,"I enjoy the campus very much at ASU. It's separated into four colleges based on your major which helps you connect with other students who are going into the same field as you. The downtown campus focuses on health. I find myself interacting with students and learning about their different professions interests me. At this time, there's nothing that really bothers me at this campus!"
Sophomore,5,The Downtown Phoenix campus is a great place to go to school! It is a small campus filled with friendly faculty and students. There are many resources available here for both staff and students. College life here is amazing! There are so many events that students can attend to get involved.
Alum,5,I loved the campus for several reasons. The first reason is that we were mostly a health related major campus so it was easy to build a community with similar likes and interests. The second reason is that it is a small campus so it was easy to get around. The third and most important reason is that the professors are all incredibly smart and truly care about the quality of education you are receiving. They take their time to answer questions and meet with you about any concerns you have. This is a great campus.
Freshman,5,"I love how modernized and new this campus is. The Taylor Place dorms are very nice and well put together. I also like how classes are not that far away from each other and the safety and security on campus is excellent. Depending on classes, my professors have been very well rounded and have helped me to succeed in my classes. There are also many student interactions for everyone to get involved with student life and meet new people."
Freshman,5,"My ASU experience has been nothing but great. Great professors, many classes to choose from, in the heart of the city, and so much more!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the high-tech resources that are accessible for free to students. As a Cronkite student, I have access to printing, a state-of-the-art radio studio and recording booths, and internships that will give me the necessary experience to excel in journalism. The professors are excellent, and are experts in their field. I feel so thankful everyday that I am able to attend this school!"
Senior,5,ASU made it easy for me to get my degree and launch my professional career path. ASU has several resources for students to succeed. My professors were readily available to meet and help me outside of class if I needed help. I highly recommend this institution.
Freshman,5,"I admire the diversity around the campus and how there is always places to go and do something. The campus is home to a variety of students coming from all backgrounds of life. I also took this into account when applying to Arizona State. This campus is home to many rotc classes, including airforce and army. Additionally, having this campus downtown also means there are numerous choices for food and activites, when not in class."
Junior,5,"Arizona State University's Downtown Phoenix campus has a great vibe with plenty of people around and activities to do. Every professor that I have had on this campus has been wonderful and eager to help their students succeed. The campus does lack in on-campus housing but they are currently building more within the next year. The food options are also expanding right now. The new Sun Devil Cafe in the Cronkite building has tons of food choices for a really great price. Overall, I have really loved my experience with Arizona State University."
Freshman,5,I love Arizona State. I am a freshman right now and I am studying Sports Journalism at the Walter Cronkite School of Mass Communication and Journalism. It is the greatest school because they are able to get new freshmen started on getting the hands-on experience to start their future dream school.
Freshman,5,The campus is very organized and safe! The teachers are very helpful and help students succeed! Academically the school prepares students how to be successful in the real world. They provide research opportunities that will help students gain experience and skills for when they get out into the real world!
Freshman,5,"It's a small campus and it's easy to get where you need to be. The students are very serious and there isn't much of a party scene on this campus, but you can easily get to the Tempe campus if that appeals to you. The dorm is great and the community assistants make sure there are plenty of opportunities for everyone to get involved on campus."
Niche User,5,I attended a summer program at ASU Downtown Phoenix Campus. The staff and facilities are all excellent. The downtown environment is fun and interesting. It is a very manageable campus and offers a variety of majors.  It is also near many sports and entertainment venues. The best of both worlds. Smaller campus life with the benefits and perks of living in a city.
Junior,5,A diverse school with outstanding professors and programs. Excellent internships with many big name companies.
Senior,5,ASU - Downtown campus is an excellent campus. Everyone feels welcomed and most importantly safe! Even though the campus is in Downtown Phoenix it is safe for all students. Education is tremendously great. All the other ASU campuses are great too. Very diverse!
Freshman,5,The campus gives off great vibes. When I toured I fell in love with everything about ASU. I highly recommend touring the school. There is so much to do there. ASU also gives lots of opportunities to freshman that makes them feel like you're at home. I have heard nothing but good things about ASU and can't wait to attend there.
Niche User,5,"I'm transferring to ASU this semester, but so my experience with them has been great. They really care about you and want to work with you to help you succeed."
Niche User,5,Arizona State University is my dream school to go to as far improvements is that ASU can making dorm rooms a bit cheaper as for that i rate it as a excellent school all around from diversity all the way to the sports programs
Junior,5,"ASU has really helped me understand my career goals and have provided the right resources to help me achieve anything,"
Sophomore,5,"The Arizona State University - Downtown Phoenix Campus makes you feel like the campus is your home away from home. Being located in the heart of Phoenix, one never runs out of ways to find something to do off campus, on campus and connect with their peers attending the University. There is always something to do and always a way to keep yourself busy throughout the year. That could be from volunteering within Phoenix, to campus clubs, to rigorous couresework,  etc. The ASU Downtown Phoenix Campus always manages to exceed your expectations."
Niche User,5,"I have visited the campus many times for interviews with an Army ROTC instructor as well as to visit friends on campus. I have recently enrolled into the university to better my future. As of April 27, 2019 I have attended my orientation at the Phoenix campus. The hospitality was warm. I feel that I can have a good time their with all their programs they have to offer along with furthering my academics and creating a better life for my future."
Junior,5,"Arizona State University has been great to me! There are many opportunities offered to students. Whether it is a job opportunity, volunteer work, study abroads, and even internships. The staff at this school is really welcoming and friendly with everyone. Whenever I have a question, it only takes one call or email for me to get helped out. It is very easy to reach out to teachers, counselors, and other students. The thing I like most is that everyone seems to be enjojying their time around campus. Which makes it easier for me to enjoy my time too!"
Niche User,5,"What I liked about the downtown phoenix campus is how it was purely for social work majors and other majors related to that. So if you had any questions the campus was a big help on where to go, what classes to take, and how to get there since there was other campuses involving other majors. Overall I had a great experience and hope to commit when the time comes."
Graduate Student,5,"Great vibe and location.  Professors are caring, flexible and intelligent.  I am in a graduate program, and so far all of my professors value and appreciate cultural diversity and individuality."
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman and I'm loving the experience. I'm majoring in kinesiology and I'm loving the classes that I'm taking. It's a wonderful environment to be in because I love Phoenix more than Tempe. The environment in Phoenix is not too big, like Tempe. It's just the right size to where you can meet someone new everyday, but you're not overwhelmed with the amount of people who go here."
Freshman,5,good school g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g gg g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g gg g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g g  g  g g  g g  gg  g g  g g  gg g g  g g
Sophomore,5,"Some things I like about ASU were the tutoring services available, everyone is very helpful and nice, and I have learned a lot from the classes I've taken. Something I would love to change about ASU is the food because it's not very favorable or tasty."
Freshman,5,"Absolutely welcoming environment, orientation set you up perfectly for the first day of school not only academically but in terms of friends, campus tours and tips and tricks around complicated issues such as long wait lines for printers or bad internet connection."
Junior,5,"Loved being part of ASU!  My academic counselor is amazing, he did everything he could to make sure I had the best experience as he helped me prepare my schedule for next semester. I have made so many good friends, and unforgettable friendships that I will always take with me. My professors are always there to help me when ever I had a question. Just love everything about being part of the ASU family."
Graduate Student,5,"Worth researching for undergraduates and graduates who favor global management. The degrees offered at the graduate level are Master of Global Management, Master of Global Affairs, and Master of Applied Leadership and Management. Some of the graduate degrees schedule an international project along with other foreign countries. At the undergraduate level Bachelor of Leadership, Bachelor of Global Management, Bachelor of Global Affairs.  The education at Thunderbird, School of Management offers traditional and online campuses.
Business Weekly has rated top five schools in International Business."
Junior,5,I love it! You get a Downtown kind of vibe and school vibe. Pretty awesome. Faculty and staff are very nice and helpful.
Sophomore,5,"The Downtown Campus at Arizona State allows for students to get a small campus feel while still being apart of something bigger. The professors are all super involved and helpful because, in most major-related courses, there are only about 20/30 students in a class. The campus is located only a few blocks from Chase Field and Talking Stick Area, which is great if you love sports. It is also only a short light rail ride to Tempe!"
Graduate Student,5,"Awesome school with top-tier professors. All instructors are highly sought after for their expertise in business, management, and leadership. Great opportunity to travel abroad, fantastic alumni network."
Sophomore,5,"I love the smaller size compared to the Tempe campus, the teachers are extremely knowledgeable about their subject matter, and I've felt comfortable and at home since I enrolled at ASU."
Junior,5,"I love the ASU downtown campus. I enjoy being in downtown Phoenix, I like that the campus and classes are smaller, and it feels like a more mature, friendlier student and faculty population. It's also the most diverse ASU campus. A large percentage of the students are studying social services, as well as journalism, law, and health."
Sophomore,5,"Arizona State University has given me the opportunity to meet a lot of new people. They set up many events so students have the opportunity to engage with one another. Along with working for ASU as well, its really fun to set up for events and movie nights!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the professional environment. It seems like everyone's main focus is school and getting a degree which is nice. There is so much downtown culture to explore around campus which I absolutely love. There are not as many majors downtown as the main campus in Tempe so there is not nearly as many students which is nice for crowdedness purposes. Classes are small and professors can better cater to each and every student because of it. The student body is very diverse and you are able to meet so many different people from very different backgrounds and upbringings. Overall, it has been a great experience."
Junior,5,I love that ASU Downtown Phoenix Campus is located near Cityscape ! It gives students the opportunity to get away from academics and enjoy the Phoenix area.
Junior,5,"ASU is such a large school that uis spread out throught the beautiful state of Arizona, but the down town campus is at the center of it all. the down town campus is located in the city of phoenix, which happens to be the states capital. the down town campus only has several building so the walk isn't strenuous. upon first glance the large building may seem terrifying but one will quickly realize how proximal everything is. the down town campus provides a city view and also life. being the center of Arizona many attractions are located near it, such as the baseball stadium. Downtown is such an unbelievable setting, is a unique and thrilling."
Sophomore,4,"I love the location in the heart of Downtown Phoenix, there is always something to do. I have only enjoyed 2 of my professors, the rest have been average or poor."
Sophomore,4,"ASU online has been good throughout the pandemic. Inevitably, some courses have been more challenging than ideal."
Junior,4,"Overall, I had a very good experience at Downtown Phoenix.  I found the size of the campus a good size, as it was all within walking distance, and public transportation was always available.  It was easy to connect with professors and people within my major.  That said, as most clubs and major events at ASU happen to be in Tempe, transportation is needed to attend any college-related extracurriculars.  Due to this, the campus is usually quiet and peaceful, with a very eclectic lifestyle. 
The pandemic, however, has changed many things regarding campus life.  ASU as a whole did not handle the pandemic well, especially for us nursing majors.  A lack of things to do as well as a lack of in-person classes, and implemented social distancing on an already-small campus has led to a somewhat lonely, cramped environment for students.  This is a very new development though."
Sophomore,4,Online learning has been a difficult transition but many teachers have been understanding and willing to adapt and listen to their students concerns
Graduate Student,4,"Great campus , loved the scenery that the location had to Offer. Another bonus is that their are many eatery areas around and on campus , so its never hard finding a place to eat.  Also the teachers were great and very helpful, every class I took  through downtown campus were highly organized . I rate my overall experience four stars because, I wish my programmed required a class to help us prepare for medical school, personal statement, application etc. 
Other than that the experience was great and very pleasant."
Senior,4,I really enjoy Arizona State University Downtown Phoenix Campus. Being in the middle of the city fills me with passion and the colleges that are there suit the area perfectly. I have always felt safe here and the commute between classes is quite simple. I really appreciate the shuttle service they offer to students for us to travel between campuses. The instructors here are highly educated and push their students to have intellectual discussions.
Graduate Student,4,I really like that it was a smaller community compared to the Tempe campus. Smaller classrooms allowed me to receive more one on one time with the professors. I really enjoyed the set up here for my program.
Junior,4,"I felt very welcomed when I toured this campus last year. Since I've started school, everyone that I have met seems to be very friendly and willing to help. At the same time though, since I am a transfer student, I still feel very disconnected from a lot of my peers. I also live off campus, which contributes to the feeling that I don't get a chance to connect with people outside of class. The college does hold a lot of events to help remedy that though, so I plan on getting more involved after I've had a chance to get more used to my surroundings as well as my school and work schedules"
Freshman,4,"My experience at ASU is coming along nicely, I love the atmosphere and the people are really nice and understanding. I would only change the tuition for non-residents and the scholarships I would make them more available to everyone."
Sophomore,4,I've been going to this campus since Fall 2019 and so far I love it. The professors really care about helping you succeed!
Alum,4,"I like the overall focus of the Downtown Phoenix Campus. In particular, a lot of the professors construct courses that are designed to help you learn content material and practical research skills. ASU does a good job enabling clubs and community events. As a result, I think that students are able to find life-long friendships among peers if they seek them out through club/organization events. 

I would like ASU to curb tuition costs where possible. I remember tuition being a sore spot for me because it grew considerably during my 3 year attendance."
Niche User,4,"I love how its in the downtown area and allows students to connect with the city community. Being connected with the community allows the students to not only help, but learn what it is like to be a working citizen in Arizona."
Junior,4,"Arizona State University Downtown Phoenix Campus, I'd say is a newer campus. It has a different vibe compared to the Tempe and Polytechnic campuses. The downtown campus is by the Sandra Day O'Connor Law School, and the University of Arizona Phoenix Campus Medical School. So, aside being in the middle of the city life, I feel like the campus serves its purpose on motivating and educating students who intend to go into either the medical or law field. Most of the professors there are approachable and would coordinate with their students to help them achieve a good grade in their classes aside from learning the material required."
Freshman,4,"The Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communications is very well connected in the journalism community and it offers many different internships/professional programs in order for you to gather experience in the field. The building itself offers many free amenities, which include: printing, classroom use, computer use, and equipment that could be used for podcasts/shows. The dorms are very nice but the dining hall could use work."
Sophomore,4,"Professors at the Cronkite School are great for the most part. Campus is fairly small and quiet, and the area is very career oriented in the heart of downtown Phoenix. Shuttles to and from other campuses make transportation easy. The dorms last year were fairly nice. Each dorm had a shared private restroom and some even had private bedrooms. Only complaints is the amount of crime prominent on campus. Campus does have a large homeless population in the area, making some areas less safe than others. There are systems in place though to notify students about crime occurring on campus and even apps to alert on-campus police about possible issues."
Sophomore,4,"i love how friendly the staff are and the people there! Everyone welcomes you with a great smile and cool stories. People are there for you whether you are struggling with classes or just need someone to speak to. No one there want to see you struggle, someone always finds a way of helping you. There are success coaches there to also help and guide you in the right direction. The professors are so helpful whether it is trying to find an intern or a job or even getting a A in thier class."
Niche User,4,"I liked the campus and the environment around me. it was a very welcoming and had a lot of various people. When I went to visit the school with my class, the tour guide was very helpful and told us interesting facts on the school and what they provide. They answered all of our questions that we needed and made the experience good overall."
Sophomore,4,Downtown Campus is very easy to navigate and it is not as crowded as the Tempe location. More Parking would probably make it better.
Freshman,4,Parking would be a great needed change as it’s a hindering problem for current commuters. Academics are impacted due to difficulty parking. More spaces are needed and closer spaces are needed. Lastly pricing needs to be more reasonable.
Freshman,4,"Although I am an upcoming freshman, I know this campus is great for me. Smaller than the main Tempe campus, this school focuses on gaining professionalism. Located in the center of the fifth largest city in the United States, Downtown promotes students to take internships located near by. Furthermore, you are still part of the entire ASU system. If the West campus has a class on dinosaurs and the Downtown doesn't, you can take a free shuttle ride over to West to take it. The only downside I can see would be feeling distant from the sporting events regardless of the free shuttle rides as well as the smaller campus size."
Freshman,4,"I would say its fairly good and I enjoyed being there, I would change nothing as I have enjoyed what has been given to me."
Sophomore,4,"Downtown is perfect if you don't like the atmosphere of having a bigger campus. You still feel like a ""college student"". You have businesses around that help you be able to get new experiences and try new things, and slot of things are within walking distance so it's prefect if you don't have a car or have money to spend on ride sharing apps."
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere of this school because everyone is so friendly and the teachers want to help students succeed. I would like to see some of the technical problems like class schedules improve.
Senior,4,"Arizona State University was one of the best decisions. It is a really positive environment! So far, the professors I have had are great."
Junior,4,"I like the small campus feel in the middle of a big city. It's also really nice that this campus is right around the corner from news stations and even law offices, giving the students hands on experience."
Freshman,4,I like that the campus is smaller. It lets you become familiar with all of the buildings downtown. I also like that there are only a few majors down here and most of them happen to be medical. That means that we are all studying for similar classes.
Freshman,4,I liked the community of Arizona State University (ASU); the faculty and student staff are all very helpful. The resources available at ASU helped for a smooth transition from high school to college. I know there are people there to support me. The teachers are very helpful and knowledgeable.
Alum,4,"For those who are seeking to experience an urban setting, this is a great campus to attend. Surrounded by tall buildings and sophisticated folks it's arguably the best location to do your studies with ASU. The campus itself is filled with great instructors, faculties and students alike."
Sophomore,4,Campus is not too big so it is easy to get around the campus. Buildings are nice and have multiple study areas.
Sophomore,4,The teachers are really great.  There are a lot of great programs at this campus.  I wish some of the university's advisors were more helpful.
Sophomore,4,"At Downtown ASU, you get the opportunity to experience a fast paced, business filled world. There are various majors to accompany to thousands of different people, going anywhere from journalism to criminal justice. The hands-on practice you get there is unmatched. I am in the journalism program and they have their own news broadcast!"
Senior,4,"The professors on this campus do a really good job of getting to know their students and working with them. The area around campus is a little more on the sketchy side. Many students commute to this campus, so you find that there isn't a close knit community on the campus. The one thing lacking from this campus is the student interaction with one another, but that is difficult to create when it is known as the commuter campus. Academics and professors are exceptional compared to the Tempe campus, most likely as a result of smaller class sizes."
Sophomore,4,"For incoming freshmen, the dorms are a good size. Just big enough to offer personal space while at the same time being intimate enough to be close to your new roommate. Though one thing I will say is to be cautious of space as it is not vast. The food in the dorms is alright from my experience. If you are an incoming vegan rest assured they have good options for you, but I have heard things from my friends living there with me that the food quality wax and wanes from time to time. Another thing I will say is that we have had some problems with the surrounding homeless population lately. The campus is small enough so that you will never be too far away from anyone at any given time. But if you want to do partying the best place to do so is Tempe by far, so be prepared to drive a bit to get to the big ones. We do have one thing beat in the Tempe department and that is the surrounding area. We have both the Arizona Diamondbacks and Suns teams. So rarely are with without entertainment."
Freshman,4,They do not have very many clubs so I did not find one that I want to join. They do have good communication and orientations are very useful. The location is nice and I like how there are not a ton of students.
Freshman,4,"The downtown campus of ASU is very small. Though everyone there is very kind, it is still hard to make friends and build community. However, the education is great. You are given many resources and your advisers are ready to help you with anything. Each faculty of the Journalism school offers a unique resume and teach amazingly."
Freshman,4,"After transferring from University of Arizona to Arizona State University, I have seen such a difference in the feel and ""vibe"" of how the school interacts with their students and how their students interact with others. ASU was more open to talk and also have fun as on the other hand UA from my perspective was figure it all out on your own."
Freshman,4,"Academics are amazing, but the teachers are not always so great. Safety is top notch, but there are situations where safety is in potential danger. However, security handles it very well and quick. The people and security guards are kind. Dining hall only has good food during orientation."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I think Arizona State University is a good school, however, I have had frustrations with professors. Some of my professors are not the best at teaching and do not really listen to the students concerns. A fair amount of them only know how to teach through death by powerpoint methods. My favorite class this semester is taught by a spunky, upbeat woman who teaches differently than my other professors. She knows how to listen to us and explain the constructs in the class well. She also realizes that sometimes her test questions are not always the best. Thus she is willing to be lenient on our answers when she has written a bad test question. I have taken classes on both Tempe and Downtown Phoenix and I enjoy both campuses fairly well. Downtown Phoenix tends to have smaller classes."
Freshman,4,I like the small community you build and the professors are great! I have had an amazing time making new friends and getting help from them with my academics. I have always been able to find someone in my dorm to help me with homework through our Facebook page. My professors have all been helpful and understanding and do everything in their power to help me with concepts I don't necessarily understand.
Freshman,4,"I love the intimate experience that I've had downtown. The campus is small, meaning smaller class sizes, less students in the dorm, and easy walking distance to classes. The academics are challenging, yet rewarding. Here, professors are genuinely interested in their own field and care about making a difference in the students' learning from day to day. The relationships I have built over simply the past semester are unbreakable. I have full faith that a good portion of the people I have met here so far will be in my future for a long time. Overall, I wouldn't want to be anywhere else!"
Graduate Student,4,"I love that it is downtown and has good public transport options. The buildings are amazing and super high-tech. There is a Starbucks which is great but more food options would be nice. There are quite a few homeless people around which isn't a problem because they're homeless but there is quite a lot of mental illness issues, campus security seems to move them on. Overall I'm happy with the campus, it is not as fun as Tempe but it is a lovely place to study"
Junior,4,"The Downtown Phoenix Campus is a smaller facet of Arizona State University, offering several general ed courses as well as those concerning journalism/media/nursing/law. The courses are taught by professors who challenge students and often keep to relevant assignments and lessons. Professors serve as a good source for students in need of help and are usually available. Relevance begins to lack when it comes to materials--more often than not ""required"" materials, which tend to cost quite a bit, are used far too sparingly within the semester to merit such emphasis.

An interesting facet concerning ASU's downtown campus is certainly its location. On the surface, it is placed in the midst of Phoenix, but the locations nearby are actually quite relevant to the the majors of interest designed for the schools there (for example, ASU's Cronkite School of Journalism is nearby major metropolitan news organizations). It is a nice way to immerse students that takes them beyond the classrooms."
Junior,4,"A few things I like are the location of this campus, and for the most part the instructors make themselves available (office hours for ex) to go over any questions you have about the material. Sometimes some instructors can seem a little unorganized at times, so you kind of have to push to get what you need from those few."
Sophomore,4,"Arizona State University is an excellent school with strong academics and a warm, welcoming community. I chose to attend ASU because despite its high rankings and state-of-the-art facilities, all of its campuses are filled with cheerful, friendly, down-to-earth people who know what really matters: integrity, kindness and getting the job done. ASU offers the benefits of an excellent academic environment while sparing students from the arrogant and stuffy attitude so many Ivy League alma maters offer. 

ASU is a truly fun school to attend. Its cafeterias are fantastic, the campuses are clean, and there is always something fun going on, no matter which campus you're at. If you're an in-state student, this school offers an awesome bang for your buck."
Senior,4,"The campus is very nice and is in Downtown Phoenix, so there are many good places such as restaurants and coffee stores. All the professors are very nice and care about their student."
Senior,4,"The downtown campus does not have the college atmosphere as the Tempe campus does.  The academics is great and professors are fine, it just doesn't seem like you are in college!"
Senior,4,"ASU downtown campus has great professors that are incredibly knowledgeable in their field. The campus is in the heart of downtown where there is plenty to do before or after class, and there are countless coffee shops where you can sit and finish homework assignments. My only complaint about ASU downtown campus is the lack of parking area for students. I really wish there were more lots for students to park that are closer to campus buildings. I enjoy walking, and it is a great form of exercise, however, I do not enjoy arriving to my afternoon class dripping with sweat and stinking up the classroom. I think more students would attend if the parking situation was more bearable."
Freshman,4,"Downtown Phoenix campus is a great transition into the college life. It is a small campus with all of your classes close by. Night life and sports events are all in Tempe so you spend a lot of money on transportation either because the shuttle has stopped running or you're not comfortable taking the light rail with the people that are on it at night, so you opt for Uber or Lyft."
Freshman,4,It's a very close community at the Downtown Campus. Smaller classes allow for more personal relationships with the professors which strengthens the learning environment. Great people down here that are always looking for a friend or there to help you if you need assistance.
Senior,4,"I like the convenience of the classes. Everything is centralized and I don't have to walk too far in the heat to get to any particular building. 
What I would like to see changed is possibly less people begging from students focused on getting a degree."
Junior,4,"I am currently in the Nursing Program at the Downtown Phoenix ASU campus. I am in the year-round program in my summer semester. I would recommend to any prospective year-round nursing applicant to do plenty of homework regarding this campus and it's program. This ASU campus does not make things easy for prospective year-round nursing applicants. Summer semester classes are not made available until 3 weeks before your start date. Parking permits are not able to be purchased for the summer semester through ASU. Meal plans are required for ASU dorming students, but cannot be purchased during the summer semester even if you are a dorming student (which makes no sense). My advice for prospective students is consider monthly parking permits via nearby garages that offer them, buying M&G dollars for the summer semester for eating, and dorming at the campus in general. I'm currently living off-campus because it's cheaper, but more of a hassle for this particular program."
Freshman,4,"The Downtown campus is a good place to get adjusted to the college lifestyle, but it doesn't offer as many social opportunities as the Tempe campus.  It's inconvenient to attend club meetings and go to sporting events because everything is on the Tempe campus.  The academics are good, and the professors care about how well their students do.  Generally, the class sizes are pretty small (it depends on your major).  The dorms are fairly new and have private bathrooms for each room, but the food isn't good and the guest sign-in policy is annoying."
Graduate Student,4,I am in the DNP program and this is my second semester at the ASU Downtown Campus and am happy with the education I am receiving. My professors make themselves available over the internet as well as in person. The course work is challenging but I feel like it is preparing me well for my career after I graduate. I have and will continue to recommend this program to others.
Freshman,4,"What I really like about the ASU Downtown Phoenix campus, is that everything is so close. When I say this, I mean that everything is at walking distance and along with that the campus is small so you get to see familiar faces every once in a while. Something I'd like to see change, would be more nearby affordable nearby restaurants. Like Tempe, downtown needs more restaurants to go to and relax by with friends."
Junior,4,"Beautiful campus, but still not a fan of walking around alone at night. All of the buildings are new and state-of-the-art. The only thing is that it's not really a campus. It's all scattered around because it's just lots in Downtown Phoenix, so there's hobos, buisness people, and average Joe's walking around. A very different feel."
Freshman,4,"Downtown campus is nothing compared to Tempe campus on size. It has a smaller school feel, but it is still diverse and has a great environment. Downtown itself is part of the campus so it has a nice city feel. The Dbacks and Suns sports stadiums are near so that is always something fun to attend. Overall pretty great campus."
Freshman,4,There are so many resources and opportunities for you to chose from. Everyone one around you is cheering you on to do well. I haven't experienced anything negative here. 
Recent Alumnus,4,The security on and around the campus is amazing. They have emergency phones around the campus if you feel unsafe.
Recent Alumnus,4,It seems that ASU is always hosting career fairs. They really take pride in helping the student to find a career after graduation.
Recent Alumnus,4,The housing units around the campus seem to be very well kept. They look like they are maintained on a daily basis.
Junior,2,"I feel like the online courses were not for me. The way some professors handled the workload on top of giving lectures were not the best. It's very easy to get lost in the directions when looking at the assignment, especially when they are not properly stated. Even though asking for help may seem like the right answer, even then I was answered with a question to my question so that was very intimidation. I definitely do not recommend any online classes if you're more of a hands-on/in-person type of learner like I am."
Freshman,2,"The campus is small which is convenient because of the short distance to classes. There is only one dormitory on campus, since ASU guarantees housing for all freshmen, they have many students without dorms. There are 35 students living in a hotel instead of dorms. I wasn’t informed about living in the Hampton until three days before moved in. Living in the hotel has been very unfortunate because of the lack of exposure to other students. This living situation has made it very difficult for me and the other students in the hotel to make friends and meet new people. It is right in the middle of phoenix, there is nothing separating the campus from the city. There are homeless people walking all around campus every single day. I feel unsafe going to my classes, the dining hall, and even the gym. ASU only offer escort services on the Tempe campus. Almost every single night I receive an alert about someone on campus with a gun or a knife, which threatens the safety of all students."
Senior,2,"If you are a student at the downtown campus, do not expect anything your admission counselor promised you to be true. My entire cohort in nursing were told we'd have morning classes, but administrators overbooked all the classrooms. Despite paying $3000+ more in tuition to other majors, the nursing students had to come into a dark downtown area every Friday for classes that could have been online. Students had multiple meetings with deans/administrators/faculty and were completely shut down and dismissed despite being assured their opinions matter. Some teacher in my program are fantastic, but some are absolutely terrible. The school is aware of this through student reviews, but don't make any changes. Why offer the reviews then? Overall, this school has really poor organization for my specific major, and also charges an arm and a leg extra for not amazing teachers or facilities. 

Overall, ASU's housing is overpriced but the environment is pretty fun in dorms."
College Junior,2,It is often dark and dimly lit. Definitely lots of places for creeps to be lurking if you are walking alone.
College Sophomore,2,all they do is drink
College Sophomore,2,"Did not get anything. Apparently my parents have money? Well they would if they didn't have a house payment, car payments, and 4 children!!! No help with financial aid whatsoever, and when there was a blip in my financial aid, they were slow to help me."
College Sophomore,2,Only expensive fast food. One time I went to Bowl of Greens and paid $6 extra for shrimp in my salad and they gave me 3 shrimp!
College Freshman,2,Most scholarships offered by the university are for in state students only. Nothing really offered for out of state students
College Freshman,2,All of the off campus housing options are outrageously priced.
College Freshman,2,"Dorm life is restrictive at times for visitation and it can be a hassle, it's well maintained and very safe on the other hand but can be challenging at times."
College Senior,2,There are a of options cause on-campus living is socially acceptable only for underclassmen.
College Senior,2,Greek life can go to hell. It's a bad atmosphere because it creates exclusivity.
College Senior,2,The downtown campus is locked up tight. Card access buildings are really nice and generally prevent the riffraff from hanging out in campus buildings at night. Cronkite integrity and attendance policies are usually much harsher than in most Tempe classes.
College Senior,2,Cost of living is very high - most of my colleagues moved to apartments or rented houses in Tempe to avoid expensive downtown housing. Studios and one bedrooms in gated complexes downtown usually start upwards of $800 per month
Recent Alumnus,2,"Usually there are no spots and the parking fees are expensive. Permits are way over priced; I think the cheapest one is around $400.00. They are pretty good at keeping track of the parking spots, thus they give away a lot of tickets in a day."
College Freshman,2,I can't wait to live off-campus so I don't have to eat hamburgers and crappy pizza each meal.
College Freshman,2,"The students here a very nice and considerate. They won't steal your stuff or harm you. I am more concerned with the community outside of the campus because they walk around the campus a lot, especially homeless people."
College Freshman,2,the surrounding places are a little unsafe. There is a lot of small cute places you can go if you're interested in that. Most people around here usually commute to the Tempe campus for fun activities. If you're into sporting events like basketball and baseball we are near the stadiums. There is art and science museums.
College Freshman,2,"The night life is not necessarily safe for being in a high crime area. The best bets are kickbacks, or staying in."
Senior,1,professors arent food with helping. classes are not structured well. very boring. very hard. i just would not recommendz
College Sophomore,1,It's very hard to find help for answering questions! They will send you to five different people to get one simple answer.
College Sophomore,1,"Unhealthy and poor quality of food. They only have breakfast, lunch, and dinner specials out for like an hour."
College Sophomore,1,"Housing office refuses to help students and will charge accounts without explanation. The dorms are small and poorly built. Since the dorms are in downtown, they are very expensive."
College Freshman,1,We hardly have any off campus dining options. Its literally the worst.
College Sophomore,1,"I'm sure my experience is skewed because I lived in the room right next to the lounge, but it was an awful experience and I couldn't wait to get out. The walls are stupidly thin and I would be kept up until past midnight because of people talking and slamming doors. Quiet hours were supposed to start at 9, but they were rarely, if ever, enforced. Getting out of housing was a similarly awful experience. It took weeks to process and it seemed like none of the staff knew what was going on and wouldn't respond to emails. The social atmosphere made me extremely uncomfortable and everyone was quickly sorted into cliques."

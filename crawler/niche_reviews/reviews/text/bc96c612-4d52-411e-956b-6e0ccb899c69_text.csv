Freshman,5,"I am currently taking all courses online, and I believe that the teachers are trying the best they can with how the classes are currently set up. All my teachers have been very open and ready to discuss, which I appreciate greatly."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy how well ran Winthrop is. I find it easy to converse with staff on issues and I am glad to have so many helpful professors. I also find that the school is very inclusive in the cultural events they offer, and I am currently enjoying doing my college here. One concern I have is playing for the school, and I wish more help with scholarships was offered."
Freshman,5,"Winthrop University is a very inclusive and diverse school. There are many academic and extracurricular opportunities. The classes they offer are very diverse and taught by wonderful professors. The students and staff are also very inclusive, kind, and a nice community to be apart of."
Freshman,5,"Although online like earning is a very new and scary experience for everyone, many professors are going above and beyond to make everything a normal as possible. Along with allowing more time for assignment and going into deeper meaning because of the lack on in-person learning. They are doing very well in my opinion."
Senior,5,great faculty to student ratios in every department; valuable summer and in-semester research and career development opportunities
Sophomore,5,"Winthrop is an amazing school that I would recommend to anyone. It was ironically my last choice on my list of schools, but I am so glad I made the decision to attend. The professors overall are great and very helpful. You can tell they have a passion for what they teach. Campus life is fun and there are so many ways to get plugged in. Attending Winthrop is one of the best decisions I have made."
Senior,5,Winthrop University ensures students are challenged in all areas of study. My professors are willing to take extra time to teach information that was misunderstood or challenging for a student to grasp. I am grateful for the student-teacher relationships that are developed because they truly care about my academic success.
Junior,5,Everything from Greek Life to other involvements on campus has been an amazing experience. The atmosphere is wonderful. The professors and other peers on campus are very involved and easy to talk to. The experience away from home is a great way to feel at home at college as it should be. I feel safe and know that I can trust the campus police and my professors.
Senior,5,"I have really enjoyed my experience at Winthrop so far. I like the positive atmosphere and the strong African-American presence on campus. There are also lots of fun on-campus events to go to throughout the year. However, I wish there was more mixing of races in terms of organizations, clubs, etc. There is a lot of racial diversity present on campus, but people still tend to naturally segregate themselves  which I think can limit one's full college experience."
Freshman,5,"I have enrolled for the Fall 2020 semester, but haven't yet been there and so far I have received nothing but help and encouragement from everyone there!"
Freshman,5,"Once again I have not actually taken classes at Winthrop yet, but the webinars and online chats have went great! Even when I had technical difficulties the staff on those webinars led me in the right direction to fix the problems."
Senior,5,"I did take classes online, some were a breeze others were a bit more difficult but I do better in a face to face setting anyways."
Senior,5,"My online learning experience with Winthrop University has been pretty good. I tend to learn better in the classroom setting, but so far I have had great online professors. They were really helpful in ensuring that my classmates and I understood the content being taught."
Junior,5,"Online learning at Winthrop is really, really good. They allow you to move at your own past and they are always willing to help where it is needed."
Sophomore,5,"Winthrop is an amazing school for anyone! It’s very active and a very comforting school. If you’re looking for a college that you can interact with everyone Winthrop is the place! My experience throughout my freshmen year has been amazing, I’ve grew out of my shell and began to take advantage of every opportunity on campus! I highly recommended Winthrop!"
Sophomore,5,"As a post traditional student, I have really enjoyed my time at WU. Professors that have a clue about life, have yet to have a boring lecture, and the campus is beautiful."
Junior,5,"I have had a really good experience so far as I have been attending Winthrop University! Everyone on campus is super friendly. And all of the professors I have had the past two years, have been very helpful to my academic career and I can tell that all the want for their students is the best."
Sophomore,5,"I loved the diversity of the campus and how small the classrooms were! The school itself is beautiful, everything is walking distance with a smiling face at each building ready to help those in need’"
Junior,5,"What I like about Winthrop University is that the professors are very good, and always ready to help you."
Senior,5,"I have attended Winthrop throughout my whole college career. To put it simply, Winthrop is absolutely incredible. 

1. They cater to those with disabilities VERY well. I was beyond impressed with how they approached my learning disabilities. Beyond astounding and far better than I could have ever imagined. I do not feel ostracized, but more valued as a student. 

2. The staff and faculty are VERY caring, intelligent, upbeat, open-minded, and they often go above and beyond for their students. I love my professors at Winthrop. I have been able to form meaningful relationships with the faculty at Winthrop University, which is really incredible.

3. The campus is beautiful and unique. It is a smaller campus, but not too small. It is the perfect size, compared to the extremely large universities that force students to sprint from one class to the next.

Needless to say, I 100% recommend Winthrop University to anyone and everyone looking for a loving community and high quality education!"
Freshman,5,"Very fun, and diverse! Class sizes are small and there is help available all over campus for academic needs."
Sophomore,5,The thing that I liked the most about Winthrop is how everyone there to help you succeed. Not once have I felt like I could approach an RA or a professor about getting help to improve my academic career.
Junior,5,"So far, being a transfer student, Winthrop has topped my previous school in all aspects. Not only are they genuinely concerned with students' education, but their well-being as well. They emphasize and encourage diversity and are very adaptive to student needs. Winthrop is a breath-taking campus, and I thoroughly enjoy being a Winthrop Eagle. I would recommend this institution to just about anyone seeking to pursue higher education."
Junior,5,I love Winthrop so much! Wonderful professors that really care and a diverse and liberal community... I couldn’t have chosen a better college for my undergraduate years. ❤️
Junior,5,I love Winthrop University so much. This was actually at the top of my list for colleges. Winthrop has so many amazing opportunities to engage with your peers and to get one on ones with professors. Attending Winthrop has really helped me to grow in my college career and gain more experience with my passion.
Junior,5,"For my own experience, I liked Winthrop because I never had felt like I was alone. When entering in college it is hard to figure out what direction to go into and I had enough of support to place me in the right direction and I’m thankful for it. One thing I would say that I would change is having groups that help with certain issues for instance a group for freshman or transfer students where they show you where your classes are or even answer common questions that they might have had on their first day."
Alum,5,"When I attended Winthrop, it was a small and friendly atmospheric college whereby everyone felt safe, got to interact with many students in a positive way, and going to classes was a must and not an after thought. The campus was not as big as it is now, but so many of the landmarks of the mid to late 70's still remain. As with anything else, Winthrop has made changes to keep up with the growing needs of society. It is the major institution in the Rock Hill area;  therefore,  the community takes pride in the University's existence in their area. As a graduate of the performing Arts department at Winthrop, I am proud to say that I was always employed in my field and I am now a retired educator. A proud EAGLE from Winthrop College, now known as Winthrop University."
Sophomore,5,Winthrop is a great school that gets you ready for life outside of college. It provides many organizations and clubs to get you involved and help you connect with many different people.
Freshman,5,Winthrop is a mid-sized school that offers the benefits of a large school. The class sizes are small and create an intimate feel. Opportunities are vast in that the academics act as a large school with many internship opportunities. The teachers are well educated and informed and willing to assist students in any way that they can.
Freshman,5,"Excellent scenery on campus , great way of meetings lots of new people and to learn about life and what you can make of it."
Senior,5,"Winthrop University has provided me with a lot of lessons, heartbreak, success, failure, life long friendships, goals reached, goals failed, and much more. Winthrop provides students with a lot of opportunity to be great. I also love the diversity surrounding the campus, the alumni, and the faculty. I do believe there needs to be more equality. For the professors, female professors need to make as much as male professors. I played a female sport and there is not enough diversity there as well. SOme ports are treated with more attention than others. There is a lot of attention to one or two sports and I think they need to market all the sports equally."
Alum,5,"Winthrop changed my life. It is a beautiful, diverse, and challenging environment that can build students to many future successes. It may not be everyone's cup of tea, but take a tour and see it for yourself."
Freshman,5,"At Winthrop University, You will feel like you are home and it is a very peaceful, and calm environment. Winthrop is full of excellent staff members and wonderful new people to meet and the time you are there will make you see and experience new things. It is so easy to talk to other people and the staff is excellent."
Alum,5,"Going to Winthrop was the greatest decision I've ever made.  My program was incredibly challenging, but my professors all offered me support, and I made friends that I know I will have forever."
Freshman,5,"Although I am still a freshman, I am loving the campus so far and I can even say that it is such an amazing experience that if it didn't cost anything, I would want to stay my entire life. The campus is so beautiful with both modern and antique-ish buildings, some dating back to the late 1800s and early to mid-1900s. The professors are absolutely incredible and show true compassion for the students, showing that they really do care that you receive your degree."
Freshman,5,"So far the campus, student life and professors all do an amazing job of transitioning first-year students from high school to college life. I hope I may continue my remaining three year and complete my degree here."
Sophomore,5,"Winthrop University is truly a great place to go to school. It’s a smaller campus so students have a better connection with their professors. Winthrop would be a great place for students who are looking for a campus that is very diverse. Now as for the local area isn’t the best but, most locals are nice. The only thing I don’t like about Winthrop is the campus food and safety. When it comes to the food, the cafe isn’t the best, I feel like they could have more of a variety of different types of food. As for safety, I feel like Winthrop could do a better job policing the campus."
Freshman,5,Winthrop University feels like home. Everyone on campus is so welcoming and friendly which makes the transition a lot easier.
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and everyone makes you feel welcomed. The professors also help you if you ask for it. Most of mine give extra credit opportunities which is very helpful if you didn't do so well on a test.
Graduate Student,5,"I went back to Winthrop to get my Master's as a career change, I was extremely nervous at being older than most of the other students. However, it was great, everyone worked together, and was extremely helpful.  The professors and my mentors were fantastic. When I graduated, I was completely prepared for my new profession."
Freshman,5,"Winthrop is fun, exciting and people here are very friendly and the party’s are lit the professors are all great but some are changing but they offer tutors to help with any and all classes so overall you want be to stressful and can have fun with all the different opportunities Winthrop has to offer"
Sophomore,5,"I love how open and diverse the staff and other students of Winthrop are. The staff is also always willing to help and put students' needs above all else. The only things that I wish would change are things that cost money, so I can't really fault the school for that."
Alum,5,"Winthrop stands out with it's intimate classroom settings. I have not had any classes larger than 25 students. The campus is small, but not so small that you feel like you see the same 10 people every day."
Sophomore,5,It is more diverse than my high school! I love that so many different cultures and interests are represented
Graduate Student,5,"I loved my undergrad years at Winthrop and am currently enjoying working towards my MSW with Winthrop. Winthrop has a beautiful campus, wonderful professors, and small classes."
Freshman,5,"What really drew me to Winthrop was the campus and how much more there was to it. For a school of about 5,000-6,000 students, you would not expect it to be that little due to its beautiful, big campus. Rock Hill is on the come up and is expanding rapidly. In the next couple of years, Winthrop will undergo lots of improvements and more attraction."
Freshman,5,there’s a great atmosphere and it really feels like a tight community. It’s so easy to make friends and it really does feel like home
Junior,5,"It's a small town feel, everyone seems to care about you and your education, the only issue is the surrounding area is not the greatest, thankfully charlotte is close by, mitigating most of the issues with the area."
Sophomore,5,"One of the biggest things I liked about Winthrop University was there efforts at being an inclusive and diverse campus. There was always events being put on that students could attend and learn about the ways of people different than themselves. One thing I would like to see improved is police surveillance around the apartments that are ""technically"" off-campus, but still owned by Winthrop."
Sophomore,5,"Winthrop University is a great college! The professors are always willing to help and care about your success. During my first year at Winthrop, I made lots of new friends and expanded my cultural responsiveness."
Sophomore,5,"I love the small class sizes, the campus, and all the undergrad research opportunities that are available to every student, no matter what their major is ."
Freshman,5,"I am about to attend Winthrop University and it has a lot to offer with their big and beautiful campus, supportive environment, dedicated to help you succeed professors, and much more. This school is one worth checking out when you decide to go to college."
Niche User,5,Personally I  like the environment and how everyone is connected to everyone and how you can get that personal connection any of your professors because of the smaller number of students that attend Winthrop compared to your Duke or Clemson.
Junior,5,"The professors genuinely want their students to learn and to succeed. Winthrop has excellent student resources to encourage student success, such as the writing center and health services. The campus is small, but as a student living on campus, the small size makes getting to classes easier. Winthrop and its student organizations frequently hold different events, from educational to entertainment, for students to enjoy and better engage with student life.
My major is psychology, and I am at Winthrop specifically for their psychology program. The psychology professors are awesome, and the program provides students with plenty of opportunities to work with these professors for research. The psychology club and Psi Chi (International Honor Society for Psychology) provide majors and minors with further involvement and assistance within the psychology department."
Niche User,5,"Winthrop is beautiful and a wonderful education college. I have not yet started my Winthrop journey yet, but I will be in August. I am excited to attend this beautiful school because everyone is so nice and willing to help when you need it. It feels like home there."
Niche User,5,I love how the faculity and student are all so involved with this univeristy and they way they run things.
Sophomore,5,"My experience as a transfer sophomore has been worth while so far. I haven't been in school in about four years and their were many things i wanted and expected out of the experience. Greek life, Culture shook, self awareness and appreciation, opportunity, campus involvement and a great academic awakening among meeting some amazing people. Lots of those things are already happening and i couldn't be happier about my decision to join the Winthrop eagles."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus and the instructors who age  very helpful. I’ll be transferring here soon once I finished my two years at Midlands Tech
Sophomore,5,"Winthrop University is an amazing college. I currently attend York Technical College and I am in the bridge program through Winthrop, and because of that, I am able to be on their campus and attend numerous events, such as Basketball games and cultural events for graduation purposes. I am thrilled to be able to transfer to Winthrop in the Fall of 2019."
Freshman,5,"Winthrop University provides quality guidence.They have a great staff as well as campus space.There are many clubs and programs to attend.Also,the professors are great and you are guaranteed a great college expirience. This is all coming from a current freshman."
Alum,4,"I did not take any online courses, but from my friends that did, they found the experience to be just as worthy or effective as the in person experience."
Alum,4,The College of Education at Winthrop really prepared me to tackle the various obstacles and challenge that educators are bound to face inside of their classrooms.
Freshman,4,Online is a generally good program. Winthrop offers asynchronous and synchronous online courses. Keep good communication with your professors.
Freshman,4,There is a good culture on campus and overall good professors. They did not handle Covid-19 this semester in the best way possible.
Senior,4,I have indeed committed to multiple online courses over the past couple summers. Every online professor I've had has utilized the university-managed Blackboard learning service. Engagement with faculty and other students has personally been a huge positive.
Sophomore,4,"Overall my online learning experience was relatively smooth. There was some lack of communication from a professor, and another gave complete new, complicated material to learn online that made the experience difficult. But overall there was clear communication and expectations from my professors, and I finished in good academic standing."
Senior,4,"Online learning is difficult for those who are used to a face-to-face conversation with a professor. Compared to in-class courses, online consists of more writing assignments as a substitution for discussions made in a regular learning environment. In addition, computers are not so reliable sometimes. So if you were to have technical difficulties, it is important to communicate with your professor. Professors are usually very understanding and give you a second chance to resubmit your assignment. Online courses are more suited for people with decent time management and enjoy learning online."
Junior,4,The professors did an amazing job teaching online. They helped you learn as you would be in a classroom setting. They are very responsive to emails when needed. They really want you to grow and learn whether it be online or in the classroom.
Senior,4,"I only took courses online because of the pandemic, but overall it was pretty good. I'm not really a fan of online courses in general, but almost all if my professors made it easy to submit assignments."
Senior,4,I like that they have online & face to face options for students. I do wish there were more night classes as I work full-time 8-5
Junior,4,College is of course what you make it! Winthrop does a very good job in fostering student involvement. They care about the experience you have. I have a good two years there and I am looking forward to the third!
Junior,4,"The online courses I have taken have gone well! Very straight forward and to the point, no busy work. I definitely would recommend taking online courses at Winthrop."
Senior,4,"Overall, Winthrop University has a great campus vibe. Although it's a small campus you tend to meet and greet new students and or faculty everyday. I love how diverse it's student population is and how there are several opportunities to intermingle with each other outside of the classroom."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my online learning experience was pretty good. The set up for their online classes was easy to follow and reaching out to most professors for help was as simple as sending an email."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I had a really good first year at Winthrop. Academically, because it is such a small school, it is very easy to get to know your professors and work with them. They are willing to help you if you put in the effort and will make sure you're on track. Socially, the school does a good job at trying to make sure everyone feels welcome and has some where to go. There's over 160 clubs--if I'm not mistaken--so you're bound to find something you like. The school is also based near downtown Rock Hill, so there's things to do outside of campus, as well. As for safety, I was originally worried because there is a electric bus that goes on and off campus that can pick up and drop off anyone, so anyone can come onto campus. However, they do a good job at securing the housing buildings and other buildings, so I'm less worried."
Sophomore,4,Most of my professors were able to transition to online teaching without it hurting my education. Only one did not figure it out well.
Sophomore,4,it very welcoming. I am glad i decieded winthrop. It far from home but feels like my new home. I plan to getmy master there too.
Senior,4,I loved the connections I was able to make as well as the number of school events and cultural events held. All of classes were challenging and and really made you want to apply yourself more.
Sophomore,4,It's a small campus so it's easy to get everywhere and you get to know all of your professors and classmates. Dorms are a bit of a yikes moment but not terrible. If you were to pay full price to go here it isn't worth it but after getting some of the cost paid by scholarships it's a great school.
Sophomore,4,"Winthrop University is an overall great school when you think about the actual reason that you are there. Anyone who attends Winthrop or has attended Winthrop in the past, will be sure to let you know that as students, we absolutely worked to earn our degree. The education is not a give me at Winthrop and the professors can seem a little difficult, but it is all to get the best out of the students."
Junior,4,Over all my experience at Winthrop has been eye opening. With the courses and professors conversations and realizations are often and sincere. I have opned up and branched out because the school atmosphere is so welcoming and accepting. Plus the campus is beautiful so that's a bonus!
Freshman,4,This is a very exciting university and offers a ton of majors that can help with a successful future.
Junior,4,It is pretty average they are a academic based school which focuses on more in teaching degrees. I think anybody who goes there will love the atmosphere and the people.
Junior,4,Very friendly atmosphere with a lot of organizations and community involvement opportunities. The professors are helpful and the smaller class sizes make it easier to do well in class.
Junior,4,"Winthrop University is an extremely diverse and unified campus community. Winthrop has great teachers who are passionate about their classes and love to offer advice to students in order for their success. At Winthrop, it is very easy and encouraged to get involved because Winthrop is a leader grooming University."
Junior,4,"As an out of state student I felt very welcomed when I entered Winthrop’s campus. The people, professors, the campus has made it feel like I wouldn’t want to go anywhere else and they care! 
One thing I would say maybe to change would be to open the fact that it is a college campus and people want to be able to do more than just stay on campus!"
Freshman,4,Overall it was a good first experience of college. I’ve learned a lot of things about myself and others
Freshman,4,"Everything so far has been good, but our dining hall and some of the bathrooms are scary. All of the faculty really care about their students, and Winthrop offers so many opportunities to improve yourself as a student."
Sophomore,4,I've had a pretty good experience with Winthrop so far. The campus is nice and quiet and the university takes academic very seriously which is very good.
Alum,4,"Winthrop University is an exceptional college for peoples seeking a degree in education. The courses thoroughly prepare students, covering content such as ESOL, technology integration, arts integration, students with special needs, etc. Students are also given multiple opportunities to work in classroom before beginning an internship senior year. The campus also offers a wide range of extra curricular activities such as sports, clubs, honor societies, and cultural experiences. Students are encouraged and lead these organizations and events and are given autonomy. My only complaint is the excessive use of funds to improve aesthetics."
Junior,4,"So far I have attended 1 semester of college at Winthrop University as a transfer student. I like the fact that despite it not being a small college, there are smaller class rooms. So there is a lot of 1 on 1 time between the teacher and the student. This allows the student to feel like they are getting the maximum benefit out of every class. I do feel like the advisors can do a better job of advising the students and asking personal questions to make sure the student is choosing the right major. Often time freshmans go to college and really dont truly know what they want to do, so they just pick something. Then a few years later they end up changing their major and in some cases have to devout more time to college than they had too if they had known earlier."
Sophomore,4,"Winthrop has a lot of endearing teachers that genuinely care about their students, and a lot who don’t. However those teachers don’t detract from an overall great experience that pushes the idea of new experiences and personal growth. My only complaint towards Winthrop is the housing, it’s similar to living in a terrible apartment complex in which everyone is 19 and doesn’t understand how elevators work."
Freshman,4,"I really liked the outside environment. After one day, it felt like home.  However, the dorm I stayed in, Richardson Hall, doesn't seem to be worth what I paid."
Senior,4,"I like Winthrop University for the excellency of its instructors and pursuit of knowledge, acceptance, and extra-curricular activities. However, it could stand to reduce its cost and grant access to more struggling students."
Junior,4,"Winthrop is a great school for those that intend to pursue a degree in the College of Arts and Sciences. The professors are willing to help and do what they can to help you succeed. There are plenty of things to do on campus,It is fairly easy to make friends as there are plenty of things to do on campus and most people are friendly.  Charlotte, NC is a 30 minute drive from campus. There is Carowinds, festivals, concerts, and museums. 
However, the food on campus is not the best. We do have options though. In the dinning hall there is always a sandwich/toast section, salad bar, and pizza section that will pretty much always be open for lunch and dinner. The other sections global, pasta, home cooked, the grill. In the student center we have a Chick-fil-a, a tex-mex place, salad place, another grill place (hamburgers and hot sandwiches), and an Asian place."
Freshman,4,Winthrop is an amazing University! They have great faculty members and students. They are open to all new people and old. I would change the prices because they are so high for students that struggle
Sophomore,4,"Winthrop is a small campus which I love. Small class sizes and its easy to meet people outside of you major. The buildings generally will only have a few subjects taught in them. for example, Kinard only has psychology, sociology and languages classes taught there while most  math and English classes are taught in Bancroft. I like that the subjects are divided in that way. One thing I would like to see changed however is student parking. Student parking spaces can be hard to come by and for a college that has as many drivers as it does, both residential and commuter, I think the campus needs to invest in more parking."
Junior,4,"I like that Winthrop has a beautiful campus with amazing people. The campus is not too big, so it is quite easy to establish relationships with peers and professors. I also love that Winthrop offers a variety of scholarships to assist students in need. This school also has a great honors and disability program. Winthrop University is really good at hiring those with disabilities to work on campus and everyone here is treated equally and respectfully. However, Winthrop needs to improve on safety. There has been instances of robbery and unfortunately enough, even rape. I would also like to see there be more healthy food options. I would also like to see Winthrop develop a nursing program."
Sophomore,4,"Winthrop University is a great college and campus if you do not want to go to a big school but still want to get away from home. Located in the heart of Rock Hill, South Carolina, it has a big city feel without all the traffic that comes with living in one. Plus it is only 30 minutes away from Charlotte."
Freshman,4,"Winthrop is the perfect campus for many like me who want to experience a quiet yet engaging community. With smaller class sizes and interactive cultural events, this is a college that can easily be the perfect fit for people who want a good education without the hardships of a general public college."
Freshman,4,"Winthrop is truly an amazing school I love that the classes are not overfilled which allows my professors to have one on ones with me and my classmates and I also love how kind everyone is to one another. I have not met any rude people (yet) and I hope it stays that way. I really do love Winthrop great classes, great professors, beautiful campus, and it is VERY close to Charlotte."
Junior,4,"Winthrop University Is great! I have made many friends, taken the time to get to know the real me, enjoyed classes that are interesting and in which the professors genuinely care about me. The material covered in my classes undoubtedly pertain to what I will be doing when I graduate. Winthrop has broadened my perspectives on many things and has really helped to shape me into who I am today. The population at Winthrop is diverse, which has allowed me to move outside of my comfort zone and engage with people and in activities that I would not have previously done. The campus offers many places to fellowship as well as the areas around campus. Rock Hill is becoming more college friendly and its great! Campus police do a great job keeping the students and campus safe, and if anything happens, they are quick to respond, inform us, and address the situation in whatever ways they feel are necessary. Winthrop has given me lifelong memories and I am forever thankful!"
Freshman,4,Although there are some classes that seem useless and some neighborhood problems recently it's a pretty cool place.
Niche User,4,Winthrop is a very diverse university and there is something to do for everyone there. There are plenty of useful resources and ways to receive help with whatever you need.
Alum,4,"I had a great experience at Winthrop.  It was also my mother's alma mater and she was very proud that I followed in her footsteps.  Winthrop is in a relatively small town so it was the center of the community.  It was pretty diverse and was a great liberal arts college. The campus is beautiful, the professors are great and the opportunity to live close to the college and have an easy commute are plentiful. I would not change anything about Winthrop University!"
Freshman,4,"I love going to Winthrop University. The campus has a great feel to it. It's a perfect blend of a historical yet modern culture. It's located in Rock Hill, South Carolina so it's in a city, yet it's not a huge city. It has a small town vibe to it that I fell in love with. I feel like I am at home and that I belong there. Student life is pretty good and there are lots of activities and clubs to stay busy with. The professors seem to really care about their students and genuinely want to see each and everyone excel in their respective studies. If you want to attend a university with a small town feel, but has great academics Winthrop is definitely a place that you should check out."
Freshman,4,"The teachers genuinely care about your grades and well being. Everyone there is generally nice and accommodating. And the university has a great global and diverse mind set.(from what I've seen and experienced)
The only thing I would mention would be that while the food is too quality there isn't a lot of variety, but that is because the food companies changed and the new food company is getting settled."
Junior,4,I would not change anything about Winthrop. I love how people there to help with anything you need from directions to how to be involve on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Winthrop is a smaller campus which means there's a strong sense of community there; it's perfect for people trying to find a tight-knit community to be a part of it. However, some professors I've had aren't at a professional university standard, but there is a lot of resources available to help students succeed."
Senior,4,The professors care about how you do in classes and are willing to do whatever needed to help students excel if asked.  The campus feels like home and has great student life.
Senior,4,I love the small class sizes; I really get to know my professors and they get to know me. It makes a big difference when I need letters of recommendation.
Alum,4,I love Winthrop. Rock Hill is a great city. It's close to Charlotte without the traffic. Students are diverse. Teachers are great & accommodating to student needs. Parking is free. There are a lot of different student activities and events.
Graduate Student,4,"Very friendly staff in the social work department however, there have been some moments of small error that have cost me time and money."
Sophomore,4,Winthrop University has a beautiful campus and is very family oriented. The faculty help their students to be truly successful in the work force. Academic advisers are willing to do anything they can to help students prepare for life after college.
Graduate Student,4,I love the friendliness of everyone on campus and in rock hill! The one thing that the campus could use are some more healthy food places in the area
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Winthrop has been great. Winthrop has it all. From sports, visual arts, performing arts, science, education, criminal justice, and social work. The campus is really taken care of with a lot of area to study outdoors while overlooking the University's charm. The campus has expanded offering more eateries and housing. Winthrop has a lake and a physical fitness building offering over a dozen of physical activities to stay active and healthy. The only one thing that i could see improvement in is the cost to attend Winthrop is very expensive. With York Technical being so close and a fraction of a price Winthrop should consider to lowering tuition to make Collage affordable for all working classes."
Sophomore,4,Great school! They are very welcoming and determined to help you achieve. It is very diverse I feel that all the students are nice and a great place to learn and grow as an individual. The professors are passi9ante about their jobs and what you to receive the best education possible. As a incoming sophomore I had a great first year and can’t wait to go back.
Sophomore,4,"I’m transferring over this semester, very excited but I need scholarships. Diversity is not a problem and there is something for everyone on campus club wise. Also features a very nice gym and lounge area."
Junior,4,"I really like Winthrop. It is fairly close to home and the teachers are excellent. The main things that I think need to be worked on to improve the experience are that the older buildings on campus need updating, i.e. the outlets do not always work and the technology in general is worn out, and the other problem is a severe lack of parking. The school is located in the middle of Rock Hill so room is limited and the school has a parking lot that can only hold about 20-30% of its faculty, staff and students, much less if there is any kind of big event at the school that requires a lot visitor parking."
Junior,4,"Winthrop University is very diverse and small, which is great for social activity as well as finding connections with others. I am going into my third year there but my experience had been a bit different. I work two jobs so a social life is out of the question but, luckily, my class sizes are fairly small so I find connection within the classroom. The facilities often offer great devices but they food court could offer better guest service to the students and faculty members. Being apart of the Foods Department at Winthrop as well as at Carowinds, it is easy for me to assess the service we give our guest. Other events such as sports, rallies, cultural events and common time events are always great and really do a great job at getting students like myself out of their shells."
Freshman,2,"I was there for my freshman year and it wasn't as great as I was told... There's a huge lack of social life (believe me I tried) and EVERYONE goes home on the weekends. The police officers don't really care too much, all they do is give out tickets. There are some frat parties, but you have to be associated or be on the list in order to get in. Not many students have school spirit/care at all. Some of the prof care, but be wary of some of the online classes. The food here is wack-nothing but Starbucks and Chick-fil-a are open past 8, and the dining hall is the only consistent thing open on the weekends-but they almost never have full meals then. I was so looking forward to being here but I had to transfer because it was way worse than I thought :/"
Niche User,2,"As a parent, I am beyond disappointed in the treatment of students for a first time away-from-home experience.  Although the students and staff are friendly enough and welcoming, the school itself is disorganized and poorly managed.  I would really recommend reconsidering this as the investment of your child's educational institution of higher learning."
Freshman,2,"Winthrop is a decent school. It’s a pretty boring school, practically everyone always goes home for the weekend. it’s not a very safe campus either. Greek life isn’t very prevalent here. Winthrop’s tuition is crazy high, but unlike schools like Clemson you can’t see where the money is going. The dorm rooms are pretty run down. The elevators break down at least once a week. Upon arriving here my entire fridge was moldy and they said they couldn’t replace it and for me to just clean it out. The paint on the walls were peeling terribly, I was missing a towel rack, outlets didn’t have a cover, the blinds were growing moldy. It was pretty terrible. The diversity isn’t great, although they try to make it seem as if it is. The cafe has terrible hours. Breakfast stops at 9:30 so if you have an 8 am class you’re screwed. Lunch starts at 11:30 and stops at 2 which is when practically everyone has classes. If you want a very small and very quiet school then this is it."
Niche User,2,The campus was stunning and the perfect size. However the professors in the arts department were not so great (despite a few). Myself and other students were cussed out and publicly embarrassed in front of our peers over our projects and still have not recieved our grades a year later. It is a beautiful campus and I have not had any problems with professors outside of the arts department.
Alum,2,Winthrop is becoming more recognized now than in 2007 when I graduated. In 2007 there was no activity on campus on the weekends as everyone returned home. Some events were planned on weekends but rarely did they foster a sense of community at the school.
College Sophomore,2,Greeks can be very judgmental and harsh
College Sophomore,2,Greek Life is not really present.
College Freshman,2,Student turn out for games isn't relatively high because they aren't the most important thing on campus. The fields are also off campus which I believe causes the low turn out.
College Freshman,2,I have heard of nothing like this.
College Senior,2,"We've become a ""suitcase school"". Rarely any parties mostly because campus police is a little difficult to work with or does't want to work at all."
College Freshman,2,Thomson's hours of operation are inconvenient. Many people have late classes and miss the meal plan time while also missing the opportunity to get a meal from Digs because it closes before the class is over. Thomson should be open until 30 minutes after the last class lets out to make sure that every student eats and also has a healthy option for food unlike the food they would eat in their dorm room. If the the dining halls were open longer more people would choose a meal plan that has more meals instead of cafe cash. Also the opportunity to open different meal plans for students instead of just the gold and ultimate because students are wasting their meal swipes when they could benefit using cafe cash.
College Senior,2,"Nothing is open past 9pm on weekdays and 7pm on weekends. The food quality is awful, we get stomach aches and stuff a lot just from campus food. It is ridiculously expensive ($8.50 to eat in the cafeteria and around $7-$9 for a meal in the campus center) and not even worth the price. Don't get a meal plan if you are able to buy groceries and make your own food."
College Senior,2,"In my opinion Rock Hill is eclipsed by its proximity to Charlotte. A lot of fun club activities take place in North Carolina, like going to Whitewater Center or petting zoo. The mall in Rock Hill seemed progressively abandoned over the years and students with cars would prefer to go to shopping malls across the state. For nightlife students can go clubbing in Charlotte on a bus that runs on Thursdays. In comparison a local nightclub called Scandal closed despite its proximity to campus."
College Freshman,2,"not clean, no room, poor maintenance timing"
College Sophomore,2,I had to struggle to get the financial aid I was awarded to be used for school. The financial aid office tries to help but isn't really effective.
College Senior,2,"In regard to stuff in walking distance from the campus, there isn't much and it gets old quick."
College Sophomore,2,Living in the dorms are okay except they want you to pay an arm and leg for buildings that are not up to date.
College Senior,2,"There is not as much pride towards the athletic team as you would see at other schools. Also, it does play a part that the school does not have a football team, a sport that most of the students enjoy more so than others."
College Senior,2,There are not many places close to campus especially for a late night meal besides McDonald's. There are more options further down the street (approx. 10 minute drive away) and across town.
College Sophomore,2,The food is not all that good and gives me stomach cramps and it gets to a point where my digestive system becomes poor.
College Sophomore,2,"There is no public transportation, so you really need a car to get around."
College Freshman,2,The housing is good but they force you live on campus even if you can't afford it unless you have family near the area or are a certain age.
College Freshman,2,I'm still looking for scholarships on my own since the school isn't very helpful in helping you find some that match your area or needs.
College Freshman,2,we live close to the hood
College Freshman,2,There is really no form of transportation unless you count the bus to the athletic games or having a car on campus
College Sophomore,2,There are three within distance that you would want to walk.  Some places deliver but aren't considered to be healthy.
College Freshman,2,there is not public transportation or shuttles around campus or near by areas
College Junior,2,It is a place where you are free to express your own beliefs
College Freshman,2,"Graphic Design is the most challenging program at Winthrop. It requires all of you time and expects all projects to be absolutely perfect. There are a lot of late nights, and if you are on the fence about being a graphic designer all I have to say is it's a trap. I changed my major to Computer Science and enjoying it a lot more."
College Junior,2,We only have a bus that takes us to and from sports events. 
College Freshman,2,it's bipolar and rains when you don't have an umbrella.
College Freshman,2,"Not much to choice from, and not all are cheap."
College Freshman,2,Housing costs way too much to be living in not so good facilities.
College Freshman,2,Had to do too much just to receive the money that I needed.
College Junior,2,You have to keep nagging them about it. They're not good with notifying you about things.
College Student,2,The quality of the food is pretty bad. The dining hall is a reasonable size for the amount of students that eat in the dining hall.
Recent Alumnus,2,They run a shuttle to the arena for games. That's it.
Recent Alumnus,2,I really don't care to party.
College Freshman,2,"Not my scene. The type of people, the campus outlook. Many people do not want to go here, but it was one of their only options."
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall is only open a few select hours, otherwise you have 4 mediocre fast food type places that you have to spend cafe cash on. Once your cafe cash runs out, you starve."
College Freshman,2,"The only transportation option is campus police, and most only call them when they absolutely have to!"
College Freshman,2,"Our Wi-Fi is terrible. No matter where you stay you need a router, especially at night when everyone is on the computer."
Recent Alumnus,2,Parking on campus can be such a headache and the permit is seventy-five dollars per year. The cost of the permit and the frustration that goes along with finding parking is too high. The amount of parking on campus and the average student body does not meet the standards of finding parking easily. It seems that parking on campus benefits faculty rather than the student body! 
College Senior,2,All I receive is loans. Have not been offered anything other than that from the school. I am from a single parent home and could use the help.
College Junior,2,"Athletics are so/so.. the school is not known primarily for sports. Academics are first then sports, which is the way it should be at schools."
College Sophomore,2,The only Winthrop transportation is the Party Bus that takes students to Charlotte and back on Thursday nights. Needless to say they are really lacking on the transportation.
College Freshman,2,The Off-Campus Housing at Winthrop isn't five star quality but that is every school in the US.
College Sophomore,2,"The parking is average. For commuters to get a good parking spot on campus, they have to get to their classes early."
College Junior,2,Parking is annoying because spaces aren't convenient to come by and the police are anal about giving tickets.
College Sophomore,2,Most places are fairly close to campus. Charlotte is only 30 minutes away but there is not a public transportation system in Rock Hill. Winthrop provides transportation to home games at the coliseum and are easy to catch a ride on.
College Senior,2,"In general, most Winthrop Students end up eating at one of three places: Groucho's, Ichiro's, or McDonalds. Those that venture down Cherry Road can get Cookout, Papa John's, Del Taco, etc."
College Sophomore,2,"The food in Thomson cafeteria is edible but don't expect much more...a lot of people joke about the  ""Thomson diet"" and that isn't far from the truth. The food in Digs gets old really fast...you can only eat so much chicken and Mexican food."
College Freshman,2,When you're under 21 there is really nothing to do.
College Freshman,2,"The weather here is sooooo bipolar!! (That's what we call it) It definitely keeps things interesting though... Winthrop is BEYOND beautiful on Sunny days! And we get more sunny days than rainy days, so that's always nice."
College Junior,2,"If it is raining and windy, and you have a very small umbrella...expect it to be windtorn and broken by the end of the day, walking from one side of campus to the other. There are no easy ways to get between buildings (aside from Bancroft to Kinard) without getting soaked in the rain."
College Freshman,2,It tends to rain a good bit on campus.  Rain boots/gear is a must.
College Freshman,2,I am a Chemistry Major here at Winthrop and it is difficult but you have to stick to studying and taking notes. I'm improving my grade and I am expected to pass with at least a B+. The professors are extremely helpful.
College Freshman,2,"There are not many places within walking distance of the campus. Not all students drive so without a car you can be stuck on campus. But if you do drive, you can go to Charlotte which is only 15 - 20 minutes away."
College Junior,2,"The only sport that students care about most is basketball, and even the teams aren't that great. Overall sports aren't as big as they should be, big reason is because we do not have a football team."
College Sophomore,2,"You will get tired of the food towards the end of the first semester. The cafeteria has it's good days and when its good, its really good! I would say to make sure you have a good amount of cafe cash."
Niche User,1,"Winthrop provides a terrible environment for a basic conservative kid, their organization for meetings and festivities is put together as if by a first grader, and their campus is unsafe.  When a student withdraws they become vindictive and dealing with their butt hurt business office is worse than a day with the IRS."
Junior,1,The parking is horrible for students. The WiFi is the worst I’ve ever experienced. The education program is very extra. The dorms are way overpriced. The school doesn’t even have a football team and our tuition is competing with Clemson’s.
College Sophomore,1,The atmosphere is terrible because most students go home for the weekend which causes most of the locals to call us a 'suitcase college'.
College Sophomore,1,There is only one good party on campus. It is held at the bar across the street and is only on Halloween.
College Senior,1,You can't drink the drinks at the party so what's the point of even going if I can't have anything to drink
College Freshman,1,Barely anyone I seen does it.
College Freshman,1,No is outside after 12 it is sad.
College Freshman,1,The only transportation students really use it the shuttle to athletic events.
College Sophomore,1,"Public transportation is not existent around Winthrop University. If you do not own a car, you better find friends who do or be stuck 24/7"
College Senior,1,"Do not live on campus. The rooms are  tiny, smell weird and are typically loud. Most dorms have a black mold problem that causes students to get sick quite often. After living in the most expensive dorms on campus and experiencing this, I am quite disappointed. The residence life staff do not know how to do their job and will whine freely at you if you come to them with an issue that is taking place in your room. Residence Assistants are generally useless. Heed my advice and live off campus. Winthrop Dorms are terrible."
College Freshman,1,There is no form of transporatation available for us
College Freshman,1,"Living on campus for me really did not make any difference. I have no car, so I am stuck here all the time. Its not the best housing, and the food is not all that great. Living on campus was a disappointment for me."
College Junior,1,Parking is terrible if you are a commuter. You have to walk long distances to do so.
College Sophomore,1,"I am sure there is potential drug activity, but i have not heard anything about it so i believe it does not exist."
College Freshman,1,"i rarley hear anything about drugs or drug abuse on campus, if anthing you would hear about someone drinking before doing drugs."
College Freshman,1,The parking is really annoying. This is the biggest negative Winthrop has. It is really inconvenient considering how many students have cars here. The parking is really far from everything and the spots are always taken.
College Freshman,1,"There are two options for transportation at Winthrop: your feet or your car. There are no available shuttles , buses or cab services. The only bus that rides is the athletic bus to games and a ""party bus"" that ventures to downtown Charlotte on occasion."
College Junior,1,"Well, campus police just want to find an excuse to give you a ticket. A lot of the administration do not approve of what students do especially greeks."
College Sophomore,1,"I Hope You Have Good Luck. There are a TON of Faculty and Staff parking spaces near all the buildings yet very, very few student and visitor spots... especially near the dorms. There are two large gravel lots for students who weren't lucky enough to get a spot near their dorm. These lots are on opposite ends of campus meaning that it could be a far walk to your room or class and can be scary at night (though there are emergency call boxes, but nowhere near enough). A lot of students believe all on-campus parking spots should be for students since we live there and need to come and go often and that the faculty should park in the gravel lots since they only come to work in the morning and leave after classes (all while still daylight)."
College Sophomore,1,There Is Little Hope for a Good Spot – Trying to park close to your residency is near to impossible. The best chance to get a good park is on the weekends. If not you are parking a good 10 minute walk over in legion lot. Freshman living on campus is mad dash for a spot.

Junior,5,I love Missouri Western State University. The teachers are great and so is the campus. There are several computer room and places to eat. The tutors on campus are amazing.
Junior,5,I take all the classes I can online. The online experience is awesome. The teacher are easy to communicate with.
Sophomore,5,The classes I have taken online so far at Mo West have been amazing. Assignments are easy to access and submit and teachers are never late to respond to any questions you have.
Freshman,5,My experience at Missouri Western to start off I will like to say it’a a great campus school boards are for the students. Learn more things from other students as well.
Freshman,5,"Online classes where pretty rough at the beginning but a adjust to it and made it the best I can, Also had my teachers help every step."
Niche User,5,MO West is great place to meet new people from all walks of life while gaining an education at the same time. Campus clubs/organizations do a wonderful job including students in the excitement of events on campus. My family and friends truly enjoy visiting the campus during sporting events and other school activities. Missouri Western has become a second home and I recommend it to all I know.
Freshman,5,MWSU has given me a wonderful experience. I would recommend this college to everyone. It's small and easy to navigate. Everyone is very friendly!
Freshman,5,I love this college. I have learned a lot of knowledge that I haven't learned yet. Plus the president and the staff and students are really nice and will help with things that u might need help with
Senior,5,"I have been attending Missouri Western State University for the last two years and I absolutely love it! Compared to other colleges and universities, it isn’t that expensive, but it still provided you with a great education. All of the professors that I have had in these past few years have all been very caring about their students and our grades. Many of them would do anything to make sure we understand what the material is about and also make sure that we are able to apply it to our actual lives."
Senior,5,I love Missouri Western! The professors are highly educated and great teachers. Everyone is so welcoming as well. I have enjoyed my time so far at this university.
Freshman,5,"Everyone here is really helpful in letting me understand how all of the college experiences work, and how to navigate through classes. Before coming here I was on edge thinking I would not like it and that I would be very confused on everything going on. But I am actually understanding all of this very well. I met with my academic adviser the other day to talk to him about enrolling in classes next semester. He showed me this really helpful tool that lets you put in the classes you are wanting to take and then it will generate hundreds of schedules for you to choose from. Once you choose that schedule it will upload it to your student account and all you have to do is click submit."
Junior,5,At Missouri western they are a big help. Missouri Western Financial Aid Office is the reason I Have signed up for niche and decided to apply to scholarships.
Alum,5,"Attending Missouri Western was one of the best decisions I have ever made. The tuition is really cheap, but you still receive a quality education. I was able to make personal connections with each of my professors thanks to the small class sizes, and I still keep in touch with them to this day. They really care about helping you succeed as long as you put in the work."
Freshman,5,I absolutely loved this place!! I highly recommend going to this college. There is just so much to do and it’s a great atmosphere to be in .
Sophomore,5,I love that everybody at Missouri western is very welcoming and it’s makes you fell at home. I love the environment because it’s a safe environment and not a party place. One thing i would change is the cafe food just include more options.
Junior,5,"Missouri Western was 3rd school I toured when I was a senior searching for colleges after High School. I loved the atmosphere, affordable prices, and easy commute. I have loved every person I have come across in my major (Elementary Education). I feel I have learned very valuable skills that will carry me into my career."
Niche User,5,"I have had a wonderful time going through the application process, and have had very responsive staff members going through it."
Freshman,5,"Super good community everyone is nice, The dorms are really good for the price plus you only share a bathroom with 3 other people. The cafeteria has really good food all the time and there are several on-campus restaurants such as Starbucks, Einstein Bros Bagels, chick fil a, and a rotisserie for whatever you may be craving. The campus also has its own convenience store stocked with basic essentials such as toothpaste, toilet paper, and cleaning supplies. The college is within 15 min from best buy, rue 21, JC Pennys, Walmart, and other various shopping centers."
Niche User,5,"I am a dual credit student at MO West. I really like how the professors teach through video. They are very thorough with how they explain concepts. They are always available. If you ever need anything, you can just email them and they will reply back within 12 hours."
Freshman,5,"Missouri Western is a great school and I'm so happy I chose to attend.  The professors really care about the students, and there are so many resources for students as well.  There are always fun social events happening on and off campus, and it's really easy to get involved.  There are multiple organizations which make it easy to meet friends.  There are also several job opportunities on campus.  I really feel at home at Missouri Western."
Niche User,5,"I like how Missouri Western State is an hour away from home, not too close, but also not too far away. I love how inexpensive it is to attend."
Senior,5,"The professors are all very hands-on and willing to help students succeed! I lost my mother while in school and everyone was very supportive in helping me to reach my goals! 
The only thing I would like to see improved is more evenly distributed funding for the Fine Arts programs. Having a portion of the revenue from the new Kansas City Chiefs Training Camp is wonderful but additions to the building and more adequate space between Music and Art would be nice."
Junior,5,I love going to Missouri Western. It is a very laid back school with a lot of clubs and organizations to choose from to find out which ones are the best for you. If I could change anything I would let students be able to do laundry for free or be able to swipe their ID and add the charges to their student accounts.
Sophomore,5,I liked that the student were able to ride the bus for free and that they also provided bus maps to know where and the when the bus will be.
Freshman,5,It was easy to apply and register and get financial aid. Everyone was very helpful. I like the campus it's not too spread out and close to the stadiums also.
Junior,5,I love everything about Missouri Western State University I honestly did not think I could afford college. Missouri Western made that possible for me . I love how diverse the school is and how everyone has tons for school spirit. Missouri Western State University gave me chances I couldn't even dream about. I am the first chief justice of Student Government Association Missouri Western has ever seen and I couldn't have achieved this goal without the help and support of my fellow constituents at my school. I would love to see Missouri Western grow in enrollment that is a change I have been wanting to see. I hope I am chosen for this scholarship! Thanks for your time.
Niche User,5,Everyone I have spoken with has been very nice and friendly.  They are very helpful with my schedule.
Sophomore,5,Missouri Western is a really great college. The professors are sociable and genuinely would like to see their students succeed. There is a tutoring center that's free to students and everyone there is always helpful in whatever subject you need.
Niche User,5,"Everyone was very helpful. The campus was really clean and I really enjoyed it. The class rooms were a good size, the food was AMAZING! I really liked the dorms because they were pretty decent sized and very clean."
Sophomore,5,"Missouri Western is a fantastic, low budget school with phenomenal faculty members and a beautiful, green campus.  Not a day goes by that I'm not glad to be at this university. "
College Student,5,"Excellent professors, classes are valid to my field of study, great art program."
College Student,5,"Very diverse campus, lots of support for multicultural backgrounds, LGBT friendly, all religious groups are welcome. I have PTSD and all staff and professors have been supportive and helpful."
College Student,5,I've never seen anyone partake in illegal drugs or underage drinking.
College Student,5,"Love the campus, staff, professors and my field of study."
College Student,5,"I feel very safe, grounds are well lit."
College Student,5,"Really proud to be a griffin, the school is excellent and I could not ask for more."
College Student,5,"All staff and professors have been very helpful and encouraging, the grounds are beautiful and well maintained, the classes are fun and engaging. Overall very pleased."
College Senior,5,I feel adequately prepared for my career.
College Senior,5,School spirit & support is always present.
College Freshman,5,I love everything at my school. Proud to be a griff!
College Freshman,5,It is my sophomore year and I am already doing a summer internship.
College Freshman,5,I love living on campus and in the dorms.
College Freshman,5,Greeks are not considered any different.
College Freshman,5,Brand new football field and great intramurals.
College Freshman,5,It is a perfect size with so many opportunities!
College Student,5,"Even though it's only my second semester as a student here, I've had a very good experience with the courses I've taken and the professors I've taken them with, although I have heard complaints among the upper-level classmen. I believe that Missouri Western has an excellent and very knowledgeable assortment of Gen. Ed. professors, the quality of such which may decrease the more specialized you get with your courses and perhaps the greater the chance that they are insured with tenure is"
College Freshman,5,"At MoWest, we have students from all around the country and even all over the world. Diversity in race, sexuality, economic background, and religion is all definitely present."
College Freshman,5,"Placement rate for all of the programs are 90-100% which is excellent! Finding a job through Griffonlink can take a few tries, but it's still pretty good. The resume builder is extremely helpful. There are about 3 major fairs where employment recruitment is present and there's always a large variety of jobs."
College Freshman,5,Stands are always packed for varsity sports games. Fan support and school spirit is definitely present. Team performance is pretty decent for a DII school. Intramurals are really popular!
College Freshman,5,The campus is extremely diverse. Almost everyone on campus is accepting of other students. The campus has several international students and also has people from different backgrounds.
College Freshman,5,The teachers are really good at their jobs and also will help students when they need it. The workload isn't as bad as I was expecting and the work isn't very hard as long as you understand what the teacher is expecting.
College Freshman,5,On campus there are police boxes in several locations. These boxes have buttons that students press when they feel unsafe and the police will talk to them and even come to walk with them back to their cars if they are scared. I feel very safe on campus because I have not heard of anyone being assaulted while on campus and there are lights by most of the parking lots.
College Freshman,5,The professors are all very friendly and really know about what they are teaching. They also are very helpful when students don't understand something that they taught. The class sizes can vary but most of them are around 20-30 students per class. There are also a lot of online classes offered.
College Freshman,5,Class sizes are wonderful. Professors are very willing to help if need be. I love the courses I Have taken so far and I definitely recommend new students take griffon edge.
College Freshman,5,"School spirit is very prevalent at MWSU. Students, alumni, and faculty are always there to support our athletes."
College Freshman,5,They forces heavily on possible internships and for incoming nursing students that's amazing. They truly care about students after college and will keep in contact with them and even sometimes bring a past student in as a guest speaker for incoming freshmen.
College Freshman,5,"There are so many courses to choose from that find a major will be easy and exciting. The professors are so amazing and understand that it makes me extremely happy to have attended this school. The class sizes are pretty decent, with a 1-18 ratio so it's really easy to get a one on one with your professor when need be. As a freshman the class work ethic reminded me a lot of highschool with a real world spin. They treated us like interns to society which is something that I truly appreciate."
College Freshman,5,I loved my dorm. It was clean and provided enough room for me to havey own personal space yet interact with my roommate and suite mates. I believe that Scanlon dorms were the best.
College Freshman,5,"I loved out there. The professors where caring and understanding yet have put tough love when needed. Though many people usually speak only highly of the professors, if like to say that the office workers where by far since of the hardest working and kind people out there. Whoever was a head of hiring faculty the did a wonderful job because I can speak highly of everyone from the professors to the janitors and the lunch staff to the RA's."
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely LOVE Missouri Western! I never expected to end up here, but I'm glad I did. The school isn't too small or too big, I would say about medium sized. Students are friendly and welcoming. There are about 80 different organizations to choose from so there is pretty much something for everyone."
Sophomore,4,Online classes at Mowest are not incredibly difficult to get working. They are significantly more expensive however.
Freshman,4,"I personally am not a big fan of online learning but due to Covid 19, a lot of our classes have been moved to at least partially online. My professors, however, are all very helpful and approachable. They have office hours that students can attend to ask questions and they are all very good about responding to emails as well"
Freshman,4,I am really enjoying my first semester at Missouri Western! There are a lot of student organizations to be a part of  so you can really get involved on campus!
Freshman,4,The staff is nice. The campus isn't that big so it takes like 3 minuets to get across campus. We have a great registered student organization called christian challenge. I've learned a lot from the leader Paul about the bible.  The lunchroom is nice and we typically have good food. The staff in the lunchroom are always nice and ask how you are doing each time you go. Majority of the buildings are kept clean and I hardly ever see trash on campus. The campus police are around a lot making sure nobody is out messing around. They patrol quite often and it makes me feel safer. The classes aren't too bad since they are online. The teachers are friendly and caring.
Freshman,4,Its hard to get answers about assignments because you have to wait for the teacher to check their email other than that its just like being in class. Not as many people talk in the online class but it could be worse. My teachers have given plenty of resources if we get stuck and have opened their office hours as well to help.
Sophomore,4,"No West is certainly the place to be if you want friendly, close and personal relationships. The school isn’t too heavily populated so it’s almost as if everyone is family."
Senior,4,"I have not yet taken classes that are fully online, but many of my professor's have utilized online learning to further add to the experience of in-person classes and they have always made an improvement on my understanding and enjoyment of said classes. For instance, my art history professor supplemented us with online articles from reputable website's to give us context to the information she was going to present in class."
Senior,4,"What I love most about Missouri Western is the environment and affordability. Unlike other universities that seem larger than life with a price tag to match Missouri Western provides an affordable education in a environment that is easy-going and welcoming that helps to minimize the overwhelming feeling that comes with starting your college career or continuing it on from another institution. With that being said, I wish Missouri Western would be more conscious of the majority student body's desire's for their school and take that into account when making decisions that will affect the future's of said student's."
Sophomore,4,"When I started formally attending Missouri Western, I felt comfortable immediately. The staff and students are very open and friendly, I've never really had a problem socially. My only complaint is accessing information, it can get a bit confusing trying to find certain resources from the college both in person and online"
Niche User,4,"I live in the city that this college is located in, and I have taken two classes here as a high school senior to get some college credit before I actually go to college. Therefore, I can't review every aspect of this school. However, the experience I have had with this college has been good. The information presented in the courses is relevant and beneficial. The professors for the most part seem knowledgeable, friendly, and accessible to help students. Most other students are nice as well. The facilities may be just slightly dated, but it really doesn't affect learning. For the educational experience you get at reasonable tuition rates, this school is a great value!"
Freshman,4,My experience with MWSU so far has been fabulous. Great staff and administration who answers my questions promptly and with detail. I feel welcomed.
Alum,4,"Missouri Western is a great school for a student that is wanting to take their first step towards higher education but is unsure of where they fall. It is inexpensive, consistent, and safe. The professors are committed to student success."
Sophomore,4,Missouri Western is a great college with a fun atmosphere. The professors are helpful and the programs are diverse and work for the students.
Sophomore,4,I like how diverse and very much the student body wants people to be involved in all the events on campus.
Freshman,4,"So far, they've been a  great school and I am anticipating this upcoming fall. However, they fall short in a few areas that I think they could easily adjust to make it more convenient and affordable for their students."
Junior,4,"Tuition is rising, and open enrollment is closing. Otherwise, facilities just need some updating. The arts program is excellent in my opinion. Some professors are rude but otherwise I would recommend it. They need to get the emergency phones back up however."
Freshman,4,Missouri Western does not make you feel like just a huge open area when they try to keep what you're going for all in one building.  The athletics are huge when it comes to football and being the home of the chiefs when they come to practice. You will find something there to help keep you occupied when you're not doing your homework.
Freshman,4,The campus is very beautiful and not that hard to find classes here on campus. One thing that I would love to see is more options for food. Such as adding in more food places. Personally I would love to see a Chinese place here on campus.
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy all the experiences I have had at this school. There are many opportunities to excel in your area of interest.
Junior,4,"I love the dorm where I live, and lots of the classes are absolutely amazing. (Lol like anywhere, some are super difficult or boring, but for the most part they are great).  I have made amazing friends, and I have been involved in some awesome organizations on campus. Get involved with more than just your classes, and you will have a much better (and easier) college experience! The one thing that I loathe about the school is the meal plan. If you live on campus, you are required to have one, and it is a waste of money. Overall, I love the school.  It is what you make of it though. If you don't invest yourself into it, you won't have the amazing experience that I have had."
Freshman,4,Love how open they are for helping students. The dorms are amazing and staff is always so helpful and they have so many workstudy options.
Niche User,4,did a college tour and the campus is AWESOME. The tour leaders were great and explained everything in great detail
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful. The buildings that lectures are held in are in very clean shape with a modern look. There are always events going on, and something for everyone to enjoy."
Freshman,4,The school is a good school and I have good experience so far.  I have good time learning and do not have too much stress.
Freshman,4,"Missouri Western is honestly the biggest small college you will go to. It has vast opportunities and activities, both academic and social, while keeping class sizes small. This allows you to become closer with your professors and fellow students."
Freshman,4,I am a freshman just finishing my second semester. I declared my English major and was welcomed with gusto by the department! Teachers really care.
Niche User,4,I look forward to attending Missouri Western this coming fall. I have taken many Dual Credit courses through the college and find each course beneficial. I feel vary well prepared for college thanks to the help of my professors.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Missouri Western State University is its affordable cost, the faculty members are willing and open to listening to students, there is diversity and student can get involved on campus easily if they are willing too. What I would like to see change is more school sports."
Freshman,4,"I think that they have a n amazing campus full of great opportunities and activities. Saint Joseph is a bright town with awesome shops, restaurants and atmosphere."
Sophomore,4,"If you're looking to party or not show up to class, I wouldn't bother. If you're willing to walk a good distance to classes and are really here to get your degree, you aren't going to find anywhere cheaper really. Reslife has some issues but not for lack of trying. Most professors are very available and the school offers plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus. There are lots of opportunities for on campus jobs."
Junior,4,"Although I was skeptical at first, I thoroughly enjoy MoWo more than my last college. It's a fun and friendly little school, and all of the staff is incredibly helpful."
Niche User,4,"I attended Missouri Western State University during the fall semester of 2006.  It is one of the most beautiful, green campuses in Missouri.  Class sizes are small and the professors will gladly see students one-on-one.  St. Joseph is a wonderful city with many things to do!"
Junior,4,"The campus as a whole is very welcoming. They give you several fun and free opportunities to meet new people and make new friends. The campus is just the right size to be able to walk anywhere in 10 minutes or less. There are several fun clubs and organizations to join on campus. The tuition is reasonably priced and the classes are challenging, but still give you enough free time to have a great college experience."
Sophomore,4,I liked that the professors were helpful. When I had a question or needed help they were very kind in helping by guiding me towards the right resources.
Sophomore,4,Missouri Western is a great place to be at. Being an international student here is amazing. Everyone here is so supportive and friendly towards us!
Freshman,4,Missouri Western is a great school for nursing and engineering majors. I am currently majoring in construction engineering technology. I will state that to be successful at this school it is important to get as much on the job experience as possible. Missouri Western has plenty of opportunities for internships and does a great job handling financial aid. I do not live on campus however from visiting the dorms I know they are very well kept. My friends say they are expensive and most will be moving out into apartments. If you plan on partying every weekend I would not suggest Missouri Western. I have witnessed a ton of people leave other colleges  and come to Missouri Western because this college focuses on academics heavily. Missouri Western does  have neighboring colleges that have many parties per semester.  I met many people in my career field that are very successful and have many nurses in my family who have all went through Missouri Western.
Freshman,4,Nice class sizes allow you to know your classmates. Great teachers willing to give extra help when needed. Free tutors and gyms are very nice.
Freshman,4,"Missouri Western is a very unique place. With its 100% acceptance rate, you come across a plethora of individuals who aren't quite set on the college path, yet. I came to Missouri Western because they rewarded me decent scholarships in result of my good high school grades and ACT score, but better yet, Missouri Western's tuition is the 4th lowest in the state of Missouri (right below Northwest, Harris Stowe, and Missouri Southern). So far, all of my professors have been great at what they do. They are very informative, motivated, and supportive. Campus is small, but you can easily walk from the residence halls to the furthest building on campus in just 10 minutes. St. Joseph is a bit outdated, so I tend to stick to campus; it's not all that bad, there is always something to do on campus or in the residence halls, so just be creative. You can make the most of any college experience by putting yourself out there. Go Griffs!"
Sophomore,4,"Teachers really get to know you,  and most of them care about your success! However like most anywhere you go there are a few teachers who don't care if you fail or not. The community  is Great, you will always find a friend in class!!!"
Sophomore,4,"This is my second year at this school and so far I've had great experiences academically and socially. The classes that I have taken so far have all been challenging, interesting, and extremely helpful in preparing me for nursing school (starting in fall 2017). Other than the one and only English class I took, (I got my first ever C in this class) I have really enjoyed the teaching styles at this school.
Last year, I was on the cheer team here which provided me with a great social life and lifelong friends. I loved being involved and getting to know other athletes. This year, with my classes getting harder and harder, I decided not to cheer. I still however have the amazing friends I had made last year and still feel involved with the school."
College Sophomore,4,The demand for this field is high. I don't anticipate problems finding a job in my field.
College Sophomore,4,"I took all of my classes online, but every exchange that I had with the school was a positive one."
College Student,4,They consider a variety of students including nontraditional which is cool ( I am 30 and would be considered) the Greeks are all very friendly and do not treat non Greeks as lower students.
College Student,4,"Offer both a normal gym setup and a larger complex for racket ball, squash, basketball, swimming etc. 

School spirit is high and we support our griffons! 

Home of the Chiefs football training facilities."
College Sophomore,4,I don't know much about the alumni network but the school makes it easy to look for jobs once you talk to the employment department. All the workers seem nice. Not sure how much weight a degree from this school will have over others though.
College Sophomore,4,There is a full-fledged police department on campus (not just security guards) and the officers are pretty nice. You don't hear much about crime.
College Senior,4,I've had some bad experiences; overall it's good.
College Senior,4,Roommates were respectful & dorms were spacious.
College Senior,4,Excellent networking opportunities & very diverse.
College Freshman,4,Doesn't have the best lighting at night.
College Student,4,"As I'm currently coming up on the end of my freshman year, I probably haven't been here long enough to really say for certain how safe I feel on campus. Likewise, there are multiple personal factors that one may have to take into consideration when evaluating my response, such as a natural impetuosity that may make me shortsighted to some of the fears I would or should normally feel in a given situation (my boyfriend's always grabbing my arm to keep me from crossing the street, not because I don't see the car, but because I'm thinking, ""Meh, I can make that"" without breaking pace). 

On the other hand, I know that the police on campus are very protective of its students; you won't have a hard time finding someone who can testify to a ticket for not yielding to pedestrians at crosswalks, not keeping their average speed limit on the correct number, and not coming to complete stops at stop signs, even at 2 or 3 o'clock in the morning. And, although I've never had to use one, there are a good number of emergency call phones scattered around campus, including along the inside of campus, in the parking lots, and around the residence halls. These phones will immediately patch you to the campus police upon activation, and I've been told that you can hit up the phones even if you're scared for no apparent reason and just want someone to walk you back to your dorms."
College Student,4,"Being a largely blue-collar college, there's a wide variety of ways one can earn their keep on campus. Since I started as a student here, I've only held two jobs: Resident Hall desk assistant and classroom technician for the Instructional Media Center, both on campus jobs. I was a desk assistant only for a couple of months, but in that time I had made many lasting friendships inside my resident hall which is great, essential even, if you're a freshman just starting out. I didn't know many, if any, of my employers during this time, though - I was hired by a student assistant. I ended up quitting this job because I wasn't able to keep up with the late night hours and graveyard shifts. 

On the other hand, I have thoroughly enjoyed my position in the IMC since the beginning. There aren't as many new people going in and out who would be willing to chill with you in the office, but the friendships you do make, however many or few, will be fairly tight and always welcoming, and this is including my bosses and my colleagues from other parts of the Instructional Media Center. The hours are a lot better though. With this job, I go in for about an hour between classes if I have breaks, and then for a couple of hours at the end of each day, although I can go virtually anywhere on campus so long as I have the work phone on my person in case we get a call asking for assistance. Furthermore, if there are no orders at any time and no one needing help, we can pull out any homework or whatever to work on at our desks (which have 2-3 moniters each) until we get off.

As for the pay, the minimum wage in Missouri is $7.65, which is 40 cents higher than that in Louisiana. You're allowed to work a maximum of 20 a week during school and up to 36-37 hours a week during school breaks. Also, I haven't had any deductions from paychecks, though I'm sure that varies depending on the student."
College Student,4,"The social atmosphere is awesome in the dorm that I live in, Vaselakos. My only complaint is that the showers don't drain well at all so be prepared to shower with sandals on."
College Freshman,4,"Most of my professors have been great. Most of the classes I want to take are on campus, with the exception of higher level physics courses. Class size is fairly small so the professors can be more personal with the students."
College Freshman,4,"Dorm parties are usually hosted by athletes, including the basketball, soccer, baseball teams, and cheerleaders. There's usually a couple of parties going on every weekend. But 1 in 3 parties do get busted and get MIP's handed out."
College Freshman,4,It all depends on who you know. If you're friends with athletes you've got a higher chance of having party plans. Best parties are usually dorm parties or off campus at someone's house. The off campus ones are usually older students and they get a little wilder.
College Freshman,4,"Missouri Western is very into athletics. When there is h me games, there will be signs stuck in the ground all thro ghost campus encouraging all students and faculty to go support the Griffons. We have a pretty good football and softball team, and I'm sure the rest of the sports are good as well. There is a ton of school spirit. There isn't a day that goes by that you don't see at least a handful of the students wearing Missouri Western sports attire around campus. You can tell everyone enjoys there time here at Mo West."
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy that the freshman class are strongly encouraged to take part in what is called the 'Griffon Edge' program. All freshman, and selected upperclassmen, come to campus three days prior to actual class starts and we all make new friends, do community service together, have a variety of different themed ""parties"" every night on campus. (No alcohol was involved). And that's really gets you experienced with the campus so it's not so intimidating on your first day of class. I love that my school is very into sports and the community really comes together on homecoming week. Being a freshman at any school is almost always scary, but the Missouri Western faculty and students make everyone feel welcomed. I would 100 percent choose Missouri Western State University all over again."
College Freshman,4,"They all really care about your well-being as a student and just want you to succeed. Help is always offered. Quality and variety is great! Class sizes are small to moderate, which is good for your professors because they're able to get to know everyone individually and offer help when and where it's needed."
College Freshman,4,The Greeks do a lot for the campus community. They plan a lot of beautification days and other things that are nice to get involved in. They throw a lot of events that everyone is allowed to attend and their fundraisers are pretty cool. They all live in Juda Hall. And they also have their own intramural teams that you can play against.
Junior,2,"There are a lot of problems with the administration and academic standards. If you are someone that wants an easy degree, this is the school for you. But, if you want to learn a lot and achieve great things, look elsewhere. 

There are a lot of racists and sexist things happening on campus."
Freshman,2,"All around, I have hated my experience at MWSU. Teachers are extremely rude and scoff when you ask for help. People who work in main offices (financial aid, business office) are very mean and act like you're a hassle when you come for help. Everything they tell you when you visit campus is all a lie. NOT FUN. MISERABLE."
Senior,2,"Quiet. Party scene is mostly off campus hosted by the BSU. Dorms are crap, with Griffon and Scanlon falling apart with those being the newest dorms."
Senior,2,"Facilities are decent, campus itself is picturesque, however faculty and staff are, on the whole, snobbish, elitist, and generally seem too self-concerned to actively engage students in a productive way. If you're a fan of standard education (that is, lots of busy-work for standard degree(s) with varying job security), then you can certainly find what you're looking for here. If you think that this school, with a continually rising tuition thanks to needless (nearly forlorn) increases to funding for the football program, is a place to capture and older, truer sense of university education, however, be prepared to doggedly harass professors for any insight and generally fight an uphill battle (or simply find another school)."
College Freshman,2,"Personally, I am a non-Greek and do not plan to join Greek life anytime soon. From my experience the Greeks are arrogant athletes that care less about school and more about parties."
College Freshman,2,The athletics on campus are mediocre at best. The football team is paid little attention and never have I been asked to attend a sporting event.
College Freshman,2,Living off campus cost alot
College Freshman,2,"I personally do not go to parties, however my neighbors do party a lot. For them is makes their experience both better and worse. I know one has a bunch of friends but she was on academic probation. It is a great experience when people get together for a campus event. That will allow you to meet more people and get you more involved."
College Sophomore,2,"I went to one party, a cook-off thing, it was not fun or exciting. All the kids were just standing around or sitting. Not enjoyable and I left right after coming."
College Junior,2,I never really hear of any partying going on.
College Freshman,2,It was a long process with little aid from the school.
College Senior,2,The party scene isn't prevalent. I only hear about small house parties.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are some nice days, mostly in the spring or fall.  However, winters are miserable with extremely cold temperatures at times and summers can be brutally hot."
College Freshman,2,Midwest weather is terrible and bi-polar. No other comment necessary.
College Sophomore,2,Weather is always changing so it kinda sucks to walk on campus when you do not know what the weather is going to be like.
College Freshman,2,"Make sure you take time when you apply, do it months in advance so that you have time when the office will inevitably get screwed up and you'll have to go in a couple different times and talk to a bunch of different people just so they can tell you something they already knew and something you already knew."
College Senior,2,"I rated the weather a Cbecause you never know what to expect in the midwest. It may snow, rain, whenever."
College Freshman,2,"It's a wonderful town, for the older generations. As for college students, there could be some more attraction."
College Junior,2,I receive loans and the Pell Grant but I just found out that my LIFETIME pell is going to be over in fall 2013. I wish when I started someone would have told me about that sooner than later. I recommend that  non traditional students find out what's their options
College Freshman,2,Strictness wise they are not so strict  on some stuff for example nose but drug wise they are strict
Freshman,1,"I do not recommend anyone to go here ! Seriously take your money elsewhere. The tuition price is nice , but you really do get what you pay for here . If you just want to get your degree , then come here . But if you want a very involved college experience with top tier professors and lots of ACTIVE orgs to join  , don’t go here . And there’s nothing in St. Joseph and the campus is dead on the weekends unless there’s a party. Everyone normally goes home and there’s nothing to do. As for the students, the campus is very divided. There’s no diversity & Rarely do you see different races talking or going to the same events together. Also , don’t go here if you don’t wanna be a pothead cause mostly that’s what people do on campus ."
Freshman,1,"I didn’t learn anything for the remaining months we had online because of corona . Easy to pass , but my professors didn’t do zoom classes , which was not very helpful at all."
Freshman,1,"They ruined my entire first semester of college for something that I didn’t even start. I was defending myself, and they removed me from the campus, and didn’t even give me the option to do online classes to finish the semester. Teachers agreed to work with me online, and did no go through with it AT ALL. I failed all of my classes, and they are taking away my financial aid. I’ve been reaching out trying to get help, because I really want to stay at school, but it’s stressing me out. Another girl who also had an altercation at school was allowed 2 years to stay on campus, and then she has to move off campus. If I was given that option, I wouldn’t be having that problem. I’m not sure if I can even get into any exceptional schools."
Senior,1,"Before I rip into this CRAP college, I will say that the scholarship opportunity they gave me was too good to pass up... that being said, I wish I were in a billion dollars of debt at ANY other school rather than on a full ride academic scholarship here. The city of St Joseph is disgusting. It smells bad here and has very limited opportunities to offer anyone, let alone 18 year old kids.  
It's my second semester of my senior year and I am taking 13 credit hours, three of which are coming from a different university. I fought for three weeks w financial aid and the registrar’s office but STILL received an email alerting me that my meal card privileges and on-campus ""money"" would be suspended if I didn't respond to an email in three days. Three days! And I’m enrolled in 13 hours! 
WHY MISSOURI WESTERN YOU GARBAGE YOU
I have so many other things but I'm limiting my rant for now..."
College Student,1,The administration is nothing but glorified bureaucrats. They sit and do nothing to actually help the school. They simply build new offices for themselves or memorials to people unimportant to the college. The staff is what makes the college a good learning experience.
College Senior,1,There isn't what most would consider an active student body. Everything stays the same no matter if it isn't right or not.
College Sophomore,1,"The parking rules suck. You cannot park on a line, back into a parking spot, or park in a certain color of line. The fines are ridiculous"
College Sophomore,1,"The police force and residents halls dont take drinking in the dorms. you get punished right away, they dont have a three strike policy. I have seen them kick several kids out of there dorm for drug use. having a party in your room is not a good idea but maybe having some buddies over to drink is ok. Any sort of noise complaint late at night gets checked out even if you are with your girlfriend."
College Sophomore,1,greeks are a complete joke on campus; no houses; lame parties; douchebags.
College Senior,1,The white greeks do NOT include black greeks in anything
College Junior,1,"Somewhat Divided – There are typically 2 types of students who go to MWSU: local kids from St. Joseph, and African Americans from KC and STL. St. Joseph isn't known as the most accepting of diversity, and that's for a good reason. There does seem to be a little racism."
College Sophomore,1,"The security guards are lazy and really don't do anything unless it benefits them, the drive around all day writing tickets when they should be doing things about drugs and alcohol in the dorm rooms."
College Sophomore,1,The drug scenen had progress while I was there my first semester.
College Sophomore,1,There really isn't a nightlife at Missouri Western on campus it's silence and nothing to do and the city is just as boring as the school.
College Junior,1,Parking is awful and you have to come early to get a decent spot.
College Freshman,1,I Don't Care About the Sports – I really don't go to college for the sports. Just for academics.
College Sophomore,1,"Sororities Get Away With Anything – Girls from Sigma Sigma Sigma cheat off of eachother, teachers make exceptions for them, and they are rude."

Freshman,5,"My online experience with Fontbonne University was great! I was attending school on campus until the corona pandemic, but once our school was forced to go online they continued to do great work. All of my teachers were very understanding, accessible, and caring. I loved that my teachers were accessible because that transition was very difficult for me."
Junior,5,I love Fontbonne and the small class sizes they offer. You really get to know your instructor and your classmates.
Senior,5,Fontbonne University has such a community feel! The faculty and staff really care about their students! During your time there you are bound to meet people who will bring new opportunities to your attention and will challenge you to better yourself!
Alum,5,Excellent program in Deaf education. One of the very few to focus on Listening and Spoken Language. Well worth it.
Alum,5,Great school with small classroom size right in the middle of St. Louis. Professors are always happy to help.
Junior,5,Fontbonne University is a great school. I transferred here from Kansas city mo and it was a great choice. The classes are small enough that you really do get that one on one attention with the professors. Everyone knows everyone and the professors really do want you succeed.
Niche User,5,when visiting with the upward bound program last summer my experience here at Fontbonne was overall amazing. exploring the campus and meeting with students and some of the administration was a great experience
Freshman,5,Love the hometown feel this campus has.  The teachers have the opportunity to get to know and understand you as an individual due to the moderate class sizes.
Senior,5,"Although the cost is very expensive each and every year. The staff at Fontbonne University are very accessible from the instructors to the cafeteria workers are helpful and will put you in the right direction. When I first started at the university, I choose it for the hours and how well they were willing to work around my work schedule. So many of the changes have come with a price, not only the tuition but also the changing of the hours for the evening students. The evening class were from 6pm to 9pm and now they are from 5pm to 9pm or 5:30pm to 10:00pm. This time change has hurt a lot of evening students because most have jobs that are 9am to 5pm and getting through traffic is very stressful. The learning environment and the staff are the main reasons I choose to start and finish my degree at Fontbonne University."
Niche User,5,I am going to transfer to Fontbonne University in the spring semester. Whenever I visited the campus everyone was very nice and helped me in every way possible.
Senior,5,My experience with my teachers and the staff have been excellent. They made sure my goals were reached and gave me the tools to do it.
Sophomore,5,Fontbonne university is a great school! For many students including me it feels like home and I couldn't imagine myself at any other college!

College Senior,5,"I've loved attending Fontbonne for my graduate degree. It's affordable and because it's a smaller school, I feel that professors and staff are really focused on the students."
College Freshman,5,Fontbonne University is so small that it is possible to know almost everyone that goes to the school. Everyone feels like family here. Because the overall school population is so small. classroom sizes are also small. As a freshman I usually have about 25-30 students in my class. Learning in a smaller class allows the students to connect with the professors better.
Recent Alumnus,5,"My overall experience was great. More than anything it made me become more in touch with my faith, made me a man and I felt prepared for not only college but life. Our school is unique in the countless service opportunities we have here as well as the amount of alumni we have still involved. We currently have 19 full-time alumni in the building and when including part-time coaches we have over 40. Our students go to some of the best schools all across the country. I feel more than anything our school has a great balance as far as academic, athletics, clubs and activities and service opportunities. We truly are strong across the board. Our slogan is ""come for 4 years and stay a lifetime."" That best describes St. Rita High School."
College Sophomore,5,"I immediately felt comfortable and welcomed when I first started at Fontbonne. The small size not only made it easy to get to my classes, but it gave me the opportunity to really develop a relationship with my professors. They genuinely care about their students. I also like the multicultural atmosphere."
College Junior,5,"Fontbonne is very small and I am still trying to get used to it, but it is great.  It is nice when they know your name and care."

College Junior,5,Lots of things to see and do in St Louis
College Sophomore,5,"I've enjoyed every minute I've been enrolled.  The staff and teachers really want you to succeed, they take great pride in what they are doing. I'm not a great test taker, but I participate in class and I do the work that's given to me. I express my concerns about my grades and what I've learned in class. They know that I'm serious about what I'm doing, and they know I put my heart and soul into it. As long as you put in the effort, they have your back."
College Sophomore,5,Probably the safest campus I've been on. Everyone looks out for each other.
College Sophomore,5,Everything you need or want to do is only 10-20 minutes from the school.  There is never a dull moment in the STL!
College Junior,5,I love everyone there and the willingness the teachers and staff have to help.
College Junior,5,It's very easy to use and it is nice that it saves everything from the year before.
College Sophomore,5,Wonderful teachers that work with every student. Sometimes can be difficult but time management plays a large role in everything!
College Sophomore,5,Fontbonne does prepare you for life and all the skills I have learned in my classes for the most part have been applied to the job I am at!
College Senior,5,Everything goes smoothly with getting in the program.  It's a small school so advisors aren't extremely over-worked.
College Junior,5,Career market supposed to be good.
College Junior,5,I'm enjoying....excellent professors and staff is student-oriented and accommodating.
College Sophomore,5,GREAT ARRAY OF DIFFERENT ETHNIC FOODS ESPECIALLY SOUTH CITY 
College Sophomore,5,I have lived on and off campus and off campus is cheaper and more freedom. I have lived in two places within walking distance and the rent was $500 a month and some houses are a little higher than that for students to live with roomates and split the rent
College Sophomore,5,of course there has been good and bad but overall I love this school and even recruited people to go after failed attempts at college out of state. The only thing is that this school is more family oriented and there is not as much comradely as to be expected in a school and very over priced!
College Sophomore,5,lowest price ever at 125 for a whole year but its better to know someone's schedule as parking is limited
Freshman,4,"My freshman year at Fontbonne University was amazing. I met great friends, genuine teachers, and I learned a lot of interesting things. I was also very appreciative to how small the school was. I was able to get one on one time with my teachers during class and that was something I felt extremely helpful. Overall my experience with Fontbonne University was great!"
Junior,4,Online learning was not the easiest.  Many instructors were flexible which was great. It really depended on the courses you took and the instructor you had because some knew how t navigate online learning while other instructors had a harder time.
Alum,4,"Everyone was very friendly and I loved most of my professors. I felt like I learned a lot in my time there. It was a small campus and most people knew each other so there were a lot of tight friendships. The dorms left a lot to be desired, however. There were talks to knocking down the oldest dorms but they never came to fruition. Overall, I cared most about my education while I was there and had a positive experience while there."
Freshman,4,"Everyone who goes here is so friendly and engaging, it’s the complete opposite from my high school experience. The classes are interesting, the clubs are fun, and the professors really care about you. Dorm life is another matter entirely. It’s loud all the time, especially at night, and everyone acts like they still live with their parents and make messes and don’t clean up after themselves. That’s freshman for you, I guess, but it’s inconsiderate and rude to the others living in the building who actually know how to operate like responsible people."
Niche User,4,"Fontebonne is filled with very helpful and kind professors and employees. However, it is quite expensive for the level of of education offered in my opinion. The food and dorms could use an upgrade as well!"
Freshman,4,"Fontbonne is a great school with wonderful and devoted teachers who really strive to see their students succeed. The small campus allows for students to make fast friends and really get to know their peers. It would be nice if there were more living and dining options, and it would be great to see more students involved on campus."
Junior,4,I just enrolled this past semester as a transfer student! Fontbonne has a great online program for my studies so I am able to work full time and also attend school. The staff has been very helpful for  everything . The only issue is that it is very expensive for me and I have loads of student loans from only one semester.
Junior,4,"What I like about Fontbonne is the small community. The class sizes are smaller. So, it is easier for professors to help each individual person."
Junior,4,I love the size.  It is a small school with small class sizes.  Professors really get to know you and you get to know the people in your program as well.
Freshman,4,"I love waking up in the morning 15 minutes before class and still making it to my class on time. Even if my class is all the way across campus it takes 5 minutes at most to get anywhere. I wish to see that Fontbonne will get more degree options in the future. The degrees they have here are good but many are aimed towards more stereotypical ""women"" professions."
Junior,4,"I love Fontbonne University! It's a small campus which makes getting around to classes super easy. It also means that everyone knows everyone else, and everyone on campus, staff, faculty, and students are friendly! The buildings are nice and classrooms are comfortable. Fontbonne recently added a new parking lot which helped a lot. Fontbonne also offers a lot of activities and fun events. The only thing I would change is the cost of parking passes. FBU is a private University so tuition is crazy expensive and so are parking passes. I feel like since we already pay a ton in tuition, parking passes should be cheaper, if not free! But overall I'm proud to be a Griffin!"
College Freshman,4,I'm not sure at the moment because this is an open campus.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy our sports teams
College Freshman,4,I love it so far. The teachers are great
College Senior,4,I was previously enrolled in a different university for several years. Fontbonne staff is very personable and they help you every step of the way through your academic career.
College Junior,4,I would definitely choose my school again because toy not just a number tittle an individual with a voice. And is so family oriented so you don't feel home sick.
College Sophomore,4,There is a certain respect to every individual.
College Sophomore,4,I have always had professors that were knowledgeable and passionate about the subject they were teaching
College Sophomore,4,Choosing to go back to school and get my degree at Fontbonne turned into the best one I ever made and wish I could have done it sooner. The staff itself to me make the school.
College Sophomore,4,"This was the first time back in school after being out for thirty years. The whole staff a Fontbonne are professional, friendly and willing to help. I can pick up the phone or walk into the wrong office and I am greeted and directed to the correct place or they will make a call and get the information that I need."
College Student,4,I live off campus and its about a 15-20 min commute so it works out well for me.
College Student,4,"Fontbonne is very good about helping their students needs, and of course- drinking, drugs are NOT allowed- but that's also a no brainer. Common sense- who would do drugs to begin with though."
Recent Alumnus,4,No problems with financial Aid.
College Junior,4,I could see the interest in living on campus.
College Junior,4,St Louis has an endless variety of dining options
College Sophomore,4,Everyone acknowledges you when in passing. Friendly atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,There is so much space. You can lounge anywhere and be comfortable. There are hammocks in the court yard. Chairs and tables in the student facility.  Couches and tables in the library. A very relaxing atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm pursuing my B.A. in Fine Arts. The Educators work in the field, and are knowledgeable on all aspects of the industry.  A lot of the instructors pack on a lot of homework. So be prepared."
College Sophomore,4,"The school isn't harsh on minor issues. It's common sense,  don't break the law."
College Sophomore,4,They care about your success. Small classes to meet each students individual needs.
College Sophomore,4,I own my own home. I have no comment for this section.
Recent Alumnus,4,Fontbonne is in the heart of the city of St.Louis
Recent Alumnus,4,I always feel that I am in a very safe environment when I am at school.
College Sophomore,4,"walking, link cars and busses will all get you there in a timely manner with student discount cards as well"
College Sophomore,4,My advisor was not the best and I think that is because me and her do not favor each other but the other staff have been awesome in assisting me with any questions that I need
College Senior,4,I don't go out much.
College Senior,4,I love the psychology program there.  The professors are wonderfully nice and understanding! They make things straightforward and it's just a great major.
College Freshman,4,I got a good amount of financial aid which is why I decided to attend.
College Freshman,4,I have not yet had an internship.  The workload can be quite a lot.  I really like the faculty in my program and I have a great adviser.  A unique thing about the SLP program is that clinicals can be started while still in undergrad.
College Freshman,4,I like the program that I'm in quite a lot but the other aspects of the school are what make me wish I had gone somewhere else.
College Freshman,4,The program at my school is good.
College Freshman,4,There are tons of really fun things to do around the area if you can get there
College Freshman,4,The housing itself is great but very very expensive.  Most people who commute just live with their parents.
College Junior,4,"Compared to other colleges, the price of parking is minimal. However, the spaces fill up fast and it is hard to find a space at certain hours of the day. They have a joint agreement with a nearby university that students can use their lot. They have shuttles from this parking lot to the college. "
College Junior,4,I feel I have so far gained a very strong background in my field and will have professors and professionals to turn to even after I finish my schooling.
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe walking on campus, even after dark. The campus police are always available; there is a security guard constantly watching the parking lot."
College Sophomore,4,There is a couple of teams that are wonderful in supporting students and getting students to come together but overall it feels as though once you reach a certain level you are only there for school and nothing else.
College Sophomore,4,Lots of different people who are open to talking just have to make the moves to start the conversation
College Sophomore,4,There are tons of computers at Fontbonne.  Pretty much everywhere you go you will find computers.  They are all equipped with Microsoft Office programs and all printing is FREE.
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms at Fontbonne are nice. As it's a small campus, they are obviously very close to the academic buildings.  Free Laundry for residents, cable provided, and overall nicely-sized rooms."
College Sophomore,4,"We have a very strong athletic base at Fontbonne. We are a small school to begin with; so a lot of the people that go to the school play a sport. Even just being a DIII school in athletics, we have strong pride in our athletics."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy living on campus at Fontbonne. The freshman dorms were a little old, yes. But they are soon renovating it. The other housing on campus has been renovated and allows a great place to live on campus."
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of amazing dining options off campus!
College Freshman,4,It's a very diverse school. Which makes going there unique. I like a variety and openness
College Freshman,4,"Everyone has a click, but they are still friendly. Everyone has been very helpful."
College Freshman,4,"There are many types of students at Fontbonne.  I  have always felt accepted and felt that the professors are accepting of everyone, regardless of their life situation."
College Sophomore,4,We have security on campus day and night. We also have Clayton police officers that patrol the campus.
College Sophomore,4,Public transportion is very good around Fontbonne. It is right in the middle of a big city so there are always buses running and also taxis. The cost for these are affordable and it is very convenient.
College Freshman,4,I am very happy with Fontbonne and Fontbonne's History and Education departments. I wouldn't think twice to do it all over again. I learn more and more every single day. My goal is become an AP American History Teacher in high school and help coach of be the head coach of the school's baseball team.
College Freshman,4,"Getting into Fontbonne was pretty easy, at least on my end. I graduated high school with a very high GPA, which helped me out a lot. Fontbonne expects a lot out of their students. So, preparation of the workload is very, very important."
College Senior,2,I would not live in the housing there.  It's too old.
College Freshman,2,"Our dorm usually smells, I've seen cockroaches in the bathrooms, and we don't get public transportation perks.  The social aspect of living in the dorms is very good however, most people are very close friends here."
College Freshman,2,"Most campus residents don't even feel worried about getting caught drinking or doing drugs, I see people do these things all the time but I've yet to see someone get in trouble"
College Senior,2,"I don't go out to bars or clubs, so I really don't know. My friends go, and there doesn't seem to be much variety in options of places to go. They always have to use a DD for transportation."
College Junior,2,I hardly know what scholarships are available for me.
College Freshman,2,Breakfast Is Better – I would recommend breakfast in Ryan it is really the best option you have so far. I think the problem comes into play when the other ONLY eating place is DSAC hall. The food is really bland and sometimes the people working behind the counter can be rude. Its decently priced for what type of food you get. Also Ryan serves dinner and lunch. Lunch is usually okay but by dinner all bets are off.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,no drugs ever! very dry campus and not that type of atmosphere to have that kind of thing going on 
College Freshman,1,We don't have a greek life here at fontbonne not that I know of.
College Sophomore,1,"Don't Leave Durring Classs Hours – Parking at Fontbonne is horrible. We have two small parking lots, and if you don't get there before 9 o'clock am you will have to park elsewhere and take a bus back to campus. Public safety is pretty uptight about people parking with crooked tags or tags not being displayed the right way. They will boot your car no questions asked. It gets very frustrating, but there is not much you can do."

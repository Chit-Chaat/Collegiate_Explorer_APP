Sophomore,5,"I love the most that it is by the beach, I feel like this is the next best thing to living at the beach. Not only that, but the campus is beautiful and the professors are the nicest!"
Junior,5,"Transfer student here, so far everyone is nice and the experience is interesting. I feel that my school is doing a great job handling the covid-19 situation and classes for students."
Junior,5,So far the Wi-Fi has not given up on me during my online classes. My professors know how to work the school site well and assignments are easy to find. I also like how my professors are always available and respond in a timely manner to their emails.
Sophomore,5,"One thing I appreciate about Coastal Caroline is how the staff cares about its students. Each of my professors tries to make a personal connection with each student. Making a connection makes me feel more comfortable to ask for help. Also, the shuttle system here is very convenient. If you do not have a car the shuttle can take you around the entire campus, and to the local Walmart."
Sophomore,5,"Half of my classes are online, while the other half is in person. Even though some of my classes are online, it is not very different than learning in the classroom. Being able to be on a zoom call helps a lot to keep me focused."
Sophomore,5,I have had no problems with learning online. The professors have been good at keeping a schedule and telling our due dates for certain assignments.
Sophomore,5,The professors at Coastal are understanding and willing to help you with all your inquiries.  The campus is a beautiful place and provides us students with large opportunities for activity.
Junior,5,"I was nervous about online classes in the beginning, but the professors are super understanding and so willing to work with students!"
Junior,5,"The university is honestly an amazing place and if you get the chance to go, take it! The campus is the safest I have ever been on (and I have been on Cornell University's campus (which is not safe WHATSOEVER)) and the people there are so nice.
The cost is fairly low for in-state students, especially with all of the discounts they offer based on grades. You can go to this university for as cheap as $200 if you play your cards right with grades and scholarships!"
Junior,5,This is a great opportunity to receive education in a way that fits better with your schedule. I enjoyed using Coastal's online classes.
Sophomore,5,Coastal Carolina is a good university where everyone is friendly and willing to help you out if you need it and ask for it. I don't think there is anything I would want to change about this university aside from some of the food that is in the dining hall.
Graduate Student,5,"I spent probably the best years of my life at Coastal. I've always had a hard time with school -- as a kid, my family and I moved around quite a bit. As such, I never had many friends. Coastal was the first place I felt like I really belonged. I'd encourage everyone to befriend their peers and classmates; it'll result in lifelong friendships that'll benefit your personal and professional life, and enhance your academic experience. Let's face it, college isn't always easy!"
Graduate Student,5,"Learning online is always tricky -- luckily, my professors handled it with ease. I honestly really missed being on campus with my friends, though."
Sophomore,5,"As a member of Coastal Carolina University's community, I am proud to represent my school. CCU is a diverse, involved, and friendly community. The faculty and staff constantly and consistently offers new opportunities fit for any student. CCU's goal is to see every Teal student succeed. This shines through in the voice CCU encourages its' students to have and in the help the school gives us students. This school provides internship connections, job opportunities, over one hundred clubs to join, and an open and creative platform/outlet where young adults can get acquainted with their futures. Coastal Carolina celebrates team spirit in many ways, as well. CCU shows an exceptional appreciation for both their athletic department and their liberal arts department."
Sophomore,5,"During Covid-19, I took my classes online. Coastal Carolina did an exceptional job organizing their campus and moving everything online. Professors, especially, managed to keep their classes up and running smoothly."
Sophomore,5,Coastal Carolina University is an all-around great school. Everyone is so nice and the campus is absolutely beautiful. CCU students form a welcoming community and you will make new friends everywhere you go.
Sophomore,5,"I have taken multiple online classes for the 2019/2020 year. At first, adapting to an online class is a little challenging but I soon got the hang of it. The professors are very helpful and patient with the new students who have never taken an online class before."
Sophomore,5,I really love going to Coastal. It's in a great area and the campus is beautiful. Every professor I've had so far has been amazing and really helpful. I haven't had a bad experience so far with the school.
Sophomore,5,"Since COVID-19 I had to finish this semester of classes online, and I felt like Coastal's online classes are very easy going and not as stressful as it seems at first. I passed all my online classes with A's and had a ton of help from my professors which included online tutoring sessions."
Freshman,5,I am an freshman going into Coastal Carolina University. I have not attended any classes yet but I have had an in person tour. The school as well as the environment on campus seems great and completely same. Everyone welcomes you with open arms.

Junior,5,"I'm a transfer student coming in this fall. From the start of my application and enrollment process, it has been so wonderful."
Junior,5,okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay okay oaky
Junior,5,I like Coastal because it has allowed me to pursue an education online while still working full time. My professors have always been helpful and flexible with me which I appreciate so much.
Sophomore,5,So far my time here at coastal has been nothing but amazing. The staff here is all so nice and the campus itself is perfect. Not too big yet not too small. Very clean and safe campus. I have lived on campus for the last two years and it was very nice for a college dorm. professors really care about the students and classes are perfect sizes 20 to 30 students max to ensure the quality of each class!
Freshman,5,"the campus is wonderful it is only 15 minutes from the beach, it gives the students a life they always wished for."
Junior,5,What i like about coastal Carolina is the environment and how helpful they are as a institution. Whatever you need assistance with or help on they would make it there priority and duty to help you the best that they can.
Sophomore,5,"Love coastal! I just transferred here and I recommend it to anyone who is looking into it! The reputation of being a ""drug and party school"" is not true it is just like any other university with its social life! only difference I would wish for is a bigger greek life with greek houses."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the campus environment, the people, and what the University stands for. I currently represent the campus as a Senator in the student government and it is such a blessing to represent a great and inclusive community."
Sophomore,5,The things I like about Coastal the most is the campus and the foods of choice! I would highly recommend to my friends and younger family members to attend Coastal Carolina University.
Alum,5,I loved the small classes and how helpful the staff was. The professors were always very professional and very knowledgeable in their subject content. I enjoyed the atmosphere on campus and I always felt very safe. The food was awesome and there was a lot of different choices that I liked. The students were all really nice and everyone seemed very professional.
Freshman,5,"Coastal Carolina is an awesome University to attend. The professors are not only qualified and helpful, but they also clearly care about the success of their students. furthermore, the Coastal Carolina community is amazing and full of wonderful youths who are passionate about their futures. There are tons of resources offers for every class and they offer everything you need to succeed after graduation."
Alum,5,"Felt like home as soon as I walked on campus. Beautiful and resident life was enjoyable. It's come a long way since it's start. Still friends with many professors and staff since I graduated. My education was top notch. As with most things, you get what you put in. I was involved with many student activities and spent a lot of time on campus."
Sophomore,5,"Coastal Carolina University is very beautiful. I love the overall architecture of the school. Also, the dining halls are pretty good. Their Cino Grille offers Chick Fil A which is one of my favorite restaurants. The people around campus are open arms and enjoy seeing new faces. Most of the students seem like they are in good spirits and are focused on achieving success."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about Coastal. The professors, the food, the diversity, the students. The professors make classes seem so much easier than you thought they’d be."
Freshman,5,Coastal Carolina University is one of the greatest schools I have ever visited. The community cares a lot about each and every student and does everything they can to make the students succeed. I had the pleasure of visiting the campus multiple times and each time I was greeted with joy and kindness. I cannot wait to attend this university in the fall!
Freshman,5,"What I enjoy most about Coastal Carolina is the extreme amount of safety on campus. With emergency poles at every corner, easy numbers to call and campus police driving around at night it ensures students that campus is a safe place. I also enjoy the school spirit. Teal Tuesday is one of my favorite days of the week, where teachers and students dress in Teal to show school spirit and also, give away free t-shirts. Coastal Carolina was a great way for me to get away from home and experience an ever changing experience."
Alum,5,Outstanding campus. Professors are great and just an overall positive atmosphere. I attended for a 4 year Bachelor's and time just flew by. I couldn't believe how fast year in college would last. Make it count!
Senior,5,"I love it here and it is a close knit campus and I know a lot of people walking around even though it is around 10,000 people. I do wish sporting events were a bigger deal around campus for students. Professors for the most part are super nice and want you to do well."
Freshman,5,"One of the things I like about Coastal are the different food choices they have around the campus.  One thing I would change are the sports , they're not got at all."
Freshman,5,"So far i have experienced one semester at CCU. I LOVE my college. The friendships i have made already is unreal. The friends i have made are forever friends. The professors i have had are amazing and deserve every penny they get! Plus, the food isn’t bad either!"
Niche User,5,Their tour shows the different learning buildings the students will be at and you can room in dorms with people of your same major.
Senior,5,I love Coastal Carolina! The campus is beautiful and it feels like a family when you're here! There are so many resources available to you and the staff if amazing. I have been in greek life on campus for four years and it was the best thing I ever did to be a part of the Panhellenic and IFC experience here on campus.
Alum,5,"How do you highlight 4 years in a short blurb? Simply put, if you take advantage of all the opportunities, you'll have an amazing experience at Coastal. Outside the classroom, I loved living on campus and being a part of the campus life. Inside the classroom, the faculty were always approachable, knowledgeable in their field, and presented opportunities to connect with them. The highlight of my time at Coastal was my summer study abroad where I was able to take Spanish courses with Coastal faculty and students in Costa Rica for a month. The icing on the cake was finding my dream job before I even graduated. Highly recommend!"
Freshman,5,Coastal Carolina is a great school. I have just begun my educational journey here as a freshman and I could not have asked for a better school. The school does all it can to make sure there is never a dull moment and the chances for student involvement are basically unlimited. The one thing that needs changed about this school is the fact that there is no parking and its kind of inconvenient and there is always some small details about every university has but overall its a great university.
Freshman,5,The experience is amazing here. I would recommend coastal to anyone who likes to be near the beach and likes to be in warm weather. The teachers are amazing too.
Freshman,5,It is a beautiful school with so many activities and events. The academics here are phenomenal and the people are wonderful. 10/10 recommend.
Niche User,5,I liked the small personal atmosphere of the campus and the classes.  I feel like that experience will help me with my studies and make the college experience more meaningful.
Junior,5,The professors are very nice and outgoing. They are all willing to help each student do their best and gradute. The clubs and organizations are a very fun and easy way to get involved on campus.
Freshman,5,I love Coastal Carolina University. I have always wanted to attend here since I was a kid. I love the student involvement and just how beautiful campus in general. These are the reasons why CCU is my college. I would love to have more washers and dryers on campus. Other than that I wouldn't change a thing.
Alum,5,I loved being a college student at Coastal Carolina University. I received a quality education and am still involved with them as a mentor for students completing their internships in Physical Education.
Niche User,5,I loved Coastal Carolina University. I was pleasantly surprised with everything about the school. They have a perfect 5-year program for me and the campus is beautiful.
Niche User,5,I liked the campus and all of the workers and the students around me. The areas are very safe and the dorms and housing are very nice and pretty.
Freshman,5,From the people to the food there is no place like Coastal. The food here is amazing and is rotated frequently. The people here are nice and willing to help you with whatever you need.  Although one of the best things about Coastal would be the campus. It is beautiful and well taken care of. One thing that I would like to see changed would be how things are advertised. An example of this would be theater productions. I always hear about how good the show was but I never hear when it is scheduled.
Freshman,5,This is my first year a CCU and the campus is amazing. All if my professors are great and so are the dorms. There is alot to do on and off campus since it is located near a vacation destination.
Junior,5,I love the school size and how each student is treated. The maximum amount of students I have had in a class is around 30. They make it so every instructor knows each students name. What is most important to me is that coming into a school where you live all on your own and in my case I was far from home I had the most amazing advisor. I only saw her a few times just getting my schedule all set up but even when I would show up unannounced she would call me by my first name and make me feel so welcomed like she had known me forever.
Junior,5,"Coastal has a great sense of community, the food is great, and there is so much help available to students."
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere here! Everyone is so nice and helpful! Also, the campus is very beautiful and clean."
Junior,5,This school is willing to help students who want it. Every professor I have had so far like feedback so that they can always grow and improve. This is important to me because it shows that they care about their students.
Freshman,5,What I love about Coastal is that they have a wide variety of opportunities. No one should ever feel left out or anyone because everyone there is super supportive.
Freshman,4,"I HAVENT STARTED COLLEGE YET.I WILL BE A FRESHAMN IN FALL 2021. FROM MY RESEARCH, I BELIEVE THIS WILL BE A GREAT SCHOOL FOR MY NEEDS . I KNOW MY FUTURE WILL BE BRIGHT AND FURTHER MY EDUCATION HERE."
Senior,4,"Coastal was a great college experience. I was able to quickly and easily make life long friends. They college was roughly 11,000 students while I was attending.  This allowed the school to feel big enough that I was getting a big school college experience. But I was also able to get to know my professors and they knew me."
Junior,4,Overall this school is excellent! It is full of teachers who want to see you succeed. The campus is not very far from the beach. I am giving a 5 star because of attendance and finical issues that I personally had.
Sophomore,4,Most of the teachers did an excellent job in communication and providing all resources for their students.
Junior,4,"I am a new transfer student, so I haven't taken any classes. But I hope to take some this fall and I am excited."
Freshman,4,"Overall, it's a good school. Everyone is friendly, but there are a few that can ruin the experience."
Sophomore,4,I like the location and what's it surrounded by. The beach is lovely and its a hour away from my home. The campus is no too big where you can get lost. The professors really care about you. The events we have on campus are fun to be apart of and most times the students run the events. The school allow us to add on spice to have fun. The support everyone who goes to Coastal Carolina.
Sophomore,4,Its a good university but you have to  know exactly what you are in for. Its a good school with good athletics and great weekend activities. The schooling is easy and the dorms are decent. Good place to make new friends from around the US and even the world.
Freshman,4,"Overall, I love going to school at CCU. Everyone is super warm and welcoming there! If you have a question about something there is always multiple people you could go to and get a solid answer."
Freshman,4,Everyone at Coastal was very nice and cared about you and your education. You feel very at home when you are there. The campus is very beautiful. There are always things going on and you can find something that you can be a part of and enjoy. The campus bus will take you any and everywhere you could need to go.
Sophomore,4,I love this campus and school it feels like home. The professors are excellent and willing to help you always. The student to professor ratio is excellent. Class sizes are small and your professors know you by face.
Freshman,4,"In general I love the experience at Coastal. Drugs and partying are a big part of the culture at Coastal, which I am not a huge fan of. I like everything on campus being close together."
Sophomore,4,So far everything is going pretty well! The arts and the support for them are really amazing! The campus is beautiful and they make sure to focus on food allergens or preferences for their students! Everyone’s experience is individualized.
Sophomore,4,"I like how Coastal seeks to round out their students through a liberal arts education. In terms of my degree program, Coastal has a lot to offer in terms of a theatrical education, whether you're interested in performance or design and technology. The location is also very ideal, with Myrtle Beach only being a 15 minute drive away."
Junior,4,"The Admission Office, VA Services, Financial Aid Office, and any other behind the since faculty, are absolutely amazing. The teachers are a bit younger and more inexperience; however, they make up for that in their enthusiasm and willingness to work with students. Coastal would also do better with a more set transportation system, as currently their app for shuttles can prove faulty and unreliable. Overall, an amazing college and campus all around."
Freshman,4,"My experience at CCU so far has been pleasant. My parents and I have had some difficulties with the  Financial  Aid and Residency office but those were the only troubles. Orientation was very  thorough  and gave plenty of information about student life, clubs, Greek life, safety and building your academic schedule. All of the people who worked during orientation were very friendly and it was obvious that we’re happy to be there."
Senior,4,"Coastal is a wonderful school once you find your niche. As an artist, their theatre program really pushed me into my own."
Freshman,4,It is a great school with an awesome business program! The campus is beautiful and there are always so many school sponsored activities on campus. One thing I would change is the price! The tuition increased by 2.8% this year.
Senior,4,It is still overally expensive for an out of state student to go there. I wish they had some other clubs like book clubs or cooking club.
Sophomore,4,"I love Coastal Carolina University. They have a beautiful campus and offer amazing opportunities for students in the career I chose. I was able to student teach my first semester as a college freshman and see how it will be when I graduate. The school has great meal options, housing, and location. The dining halls are very good and the housing is very clean and newly built. Also, this college is in a great location near the beach. I think one thing that could be changed is the tuition cost. The out of state tuition is extremely high and is very difficult for myself and others to pay for."
Sophomore,4,"So far it has been a very exciting and fun first year at Coastal Carolina University. The teachers are great and I am really enjoying the academic programs. There is always something to do on campus, movie night, bbq, volleyball, attending a sports game, and many other activities. The on-campus living is handled well and there are many food services provided at a reasonable cost. All in all, I have enjoyed my first semester at Coastal and will be attending again."
Junior,4,"I have had an overall good experience attending Coastal Carolina University.  The campus is neither to big, nor to small.  The professors, as well as the staff in general, are nice and helpful. Something else that I like about  Coastal Carolina is the diversity of the students. There are so many students at Coastal Carolina of different races, which I find to be beautiful, and about half of the Coastal Carolina student population are out of state students. 
 I have met a lot of people from various other states, which I like because I love meeting new people that are from different places. Something about coastal that I would like to see change is  how strict the campus police are about parties, even if they are off campus.  I also think that some of the freshman dorms need to be renovated, however, the upperclassmen dorms are pretty decent."
Sophomore,4,"I love coastal, its a gorgeous campus and I feel like im getting my money's worth! its a great time and I have made amazing friends"
Senior,4,Coastal Carolina gave me the opportunity to follow my dreams and pursue a degree in business by allowing me to play division 1 soccer.
Freshman,4,"Professors were all very intelligent yet also easy to comprehend in class. Diversity was very prevalent which makes for a healthy student body. Also, the location was great, being next to Myrtle Beach."
Senior,4,"great campus, student body has no school spirit, everyone is from the NY/PA/NJ or New England area,  great marine science program"
Sophomore,4,Coastal is very pretty and the atmosphere is nice if you are into parties. There is very much only two types of people in Coastal so there is not much diversity and that is the problem i have with it
Freshman,4,"My experience at Coastal Carolina was very good on my behalf. I went there for a basketball camp twice. I had so much fun each time I went there. The rooms were clean, the food was good, and the court was big."
Junior,4,It has been an amazing experience! I’m a junior in the marine science program which is very challenging but rewarding! The school owns their own island so you start doing field work and hands on experiences your freshman year. The clubs offer a way to meet new friends and they offer a huge variety of interests! I’m the President of the Sea Turtle Club this fall and a member of the fishing club.  One recommendation that I think they can improve on is offering more hours and more tutors for chemistry and physics.
Freshman,4,Coastal Carolina is a great school with a very friendly atmosphere. The professors and students alike are helpful and cordial to all. The beautiful scenery around campus is just a plus.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Coastal Carolina has honestly been great. I think a key to having a great experience in college is branching out and meeting people. Thankfully for me making friends was simple because of my participation on the school women's soccer team. I can honestly say that my experience at college as been so fun and I can thank my friends/team for that. The education part of Coastal is challenging but I enjoy that because it helps me prove to myself what I can accomplish at high education level. The school campus is also really pretty. Although this detail is a minor detail of the school, something I would change would be the parking situation on campus. Coastal allows for freshmen to bring cars to school and there's not enough parking on campus for people who live off campus. Overall, the parking situation can be really stressful when trying to get to class on time so that's something I would change about the university."
Freshman,4,Overall great experience. Academically a bit challenging but the smaller class sizes help with a more personal experience. Lots of clubs and opportunities to meet new people and a short drive from the beach.
Sophomore,4,"I really like the academics and professors. It is a really beautiful campus and I like that it is a walking campus. I don't like how we get fees added on to our bill like transportation fee because half the students do not use the shuttle. The lab fee should not be there if the class is a requirement. The way the school handles certain situations could be better but besides that I love this school, campus and the people I met there."
Sophomore,4,"I love how open and welcoming everyone seems to be on and around campus! The professors are helping when they are asked, but you have to start by building that connection with them right off the bat otherwise you might have a hard time to make that connection. It is important to get involved and a majority of the campus is into serving/giving back to the community."
Junior,4,The environment is the perfect breeding grounds for success. My school presents every single person with opportunity to mold themselves. The only thing that could be negatively said is their lack of communication throughout departments. By this I mean when one group of authority says one thing and another group says something else.
Sophomore,4,"Coastal Carolina is a really good school to study at. If you are only coming to party, you might have to rethink going to college. Majoring in science seems like a big thing for Coastal students. There are many majors but the top two people go to Coastal for is Marine and Exercise science. The food is great, just depends on what your taste buds like."
Senior,4,Coastal Carolina University is a great institution if the particular student is looking for a cross between a huge university and a smaller college. The student involvement is amazing but it is hard to to keep up with changes. Its a great place to meet new people and get good advice. It is a smaller campus and easy to figure out.
Junior,4,"It is an excellent environment. Some things could be improved department wise. Professors are very hands on, and many are willing to help you succeed however they can."
Sophomore,4,I am a transferring student to Coastal Carolina. Overall on my visit the school campus looks very nice and the professors are nice. The sports fields look very interesting. Im ready to see what this year has to offer.
Sophomore,4,CCU has been an amazing learning experience to date. Getting ready to start my second year and I can't wait to get back to Conway!! GO Chants!!!!!
Sophomore,4,"Absolutely beautiful campus and great efforts in making students transitions into college as smooth as possible. I do not for a minute regret deciding to come to Coastal, however, I do wish they would do a better job at selecting professors for subjects that are usually more difficult than others (i.e. math and/or science courses)."
Sophomore,4,I loved Coastal's campus and student life. I would like to see their offers and scholarships for out of state students change.
Junior,4,"Here at Coastal, there are so many opportunities for you to become a leader and find something to do. Everything one is so welcoming and very nice."
Junior,4,"Coastal Carolina is a beautiful school with a lot of diversity. The only thing I would fix, but have seen getting better, is organization. Sometimes they send you all over the place with a question you need answered, only to leave more confused than ever. It is getting better, but I do believe it is something they should continue to work at"
Senior,4,"I would like to see an improvement in the campus food. It has gotten better over the years, but they could do a lot better in regards to number of choices and overall quality."
Sophomore,4,"I love Coastal Carolina University! The location, my dorm last year, my friends, professors, all of it! I am a Physical Education major, and the Education program at CCU is ridiculously acceptable. As a freshman this past year, I had already gotten experience within an actual classroom, and from here on out, I only have more coming for me."
Sophomore,4,"CCU is a great school. The work can be a bit much at times, but thankfully we have professors that don't mind helping you. I haven't met a professor who didn't care or could care less whether you fail or not. Outside of the classroom and homework, there's always something to do or some kind of event going on like Steak & Shrimp Night @ Hick's or the Farmer's Market on Prince's Lawn."
Niche User,4,"During my tour, I became very interested in this college. They are known to have  one of the best business departments in the states! It is  a bit pricey, but nothing scholarships can't handle. The atmosphere is tense (of course) but they have events and places you can go to unwind a bit. The staff are understanding and patient as well."
Junior,4,"I love how accepting the faculty and peers are. There's always something to do on or around campus! Not to mention, it's a 20 minute drive from the beach."
Sophomore,4,I thoroughly enjoyed my freshman year here. The only thing that I did not like was that some professors did not post their grades.
Senior,4,"I couldn't imagine myself attending any other college. The professors, faculty and staff really care for students, offer many events on campus, employers work well with your schedule, and the family atmosphere of this school just amazes me every day."
Junior,4,"I love Coastal Carolina University! Classes are small and teachers are very easy to talk too! Teachers are very prompt and classes are very informative and you feel like you are actually learning and not doing busy work. The campus is beautiful and close to the beach, in case you need to get away for a little while to clear your head! Tuition isn't bad, southerners are very friendly, and living conditions are ideal!"
Freshman,4,"Coastal Carolina is a very beautiful school. Even though its location is not in the middle of much, it is 9 miles away from Myrtle Beach. The school has great academics and teachers know you by name. The food is not the best but no college has very good food. Overall Coastal Carolina is a great school."
Freshman,4,I like the landscaping and the environment as well as the smaller class rooms so you are more involved.
Niche User,4,"The campus is beautiful and covered in school colors. Teal. Chauncey, our mascot, is always walking around surprising the students. The athletics here are awesome as we have a great baseball team and other sports such as basketball, softball and soccer exceed as well!"
Sophomore,4,"Things I enjoy about Coastal Carolina University is the environment, meaning the humid warm weather, mixed with warm loving student population, and the overall size of the campus (Not too big Not too small)"
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Coastal Carolina university is the ability to implement diversity throughout, even when the students don't realize their need for it."
Freshman,4,this college I enjoy greatly. It's only two hours away from my house so its far enough to be myself but close enough if i get homesick. The campus is a good size not big enough where i need a car to get around but its not to small where i feel cramped. The sports are good and thecampus is excited for every game there is. It feel like a little slice of home here. I've made some good friends in my short time here.
Freshman,4,"Coastal Carolina is a great school in a great location. The professors are awesome, campus is clean (and right by the beach!), and everyone is friendly."
Niche User,4,"Coastal Carolina University is a really amazing college. Their campus is really beautiful and clean, everyone is really friendly, and the atmosphere around the school is unlike any other. Coastal's size is not too big or not too small, it's just perfect for any new incoming college student. I would recommend anyone to attend Coastal Carolina University."
Sophomore,2,I originally was taking face to face class but everything was transferred online. I didn't like taking online classes and some teachers didn't communicate with students after the transition to online classes and had problems setting up moodle so we could turn in our work
Sophomore,2,Classes are easy and campus is nice. Party scene is overhyped. Life around campus is dull. Nothing much to do besides study.
College Freshman,2,This school is still coming up so not all sports events are attended. Some of the sports coaches aren't very good.
College Sophomore,2,"Most people smoke weed or drink. The policy enforcement is good, if the students are caught. However, most students get away with it."
College Sophomore,2,I am not part of Greek life because I cannot afford it. It is expensive to join which upsets me because they are there for causes and not everyone can join to help a cause just because they cannot afford it. Greek housing from the campus is not available but most of the Greek students live together as friends.
College Freshman,2,"Coastal Carolina university has a reputation for partying. The academics aren't good because honestly none of the students care. Also the acceptance rate might not seem very high, but many student come from high school with a 2.4 GPA & low test scores and get in easy."
College Freshman,2,"I am from a big college town where Greek life is huge (Greek row etc.) so I can knowledgeably say that the Greek life at Coastal Carolina is very limited. There are four sororities are that considered ""good"" and only two fraternities. The Greeks all tend to only party together, which in turn leads to them all sleeping together because the Greek life is so small. Really, it's like a mini high school."
College Junior,2,It's college! A lot of students like to party and the university doesn't want to accept that.
College Junior,2,I feel extremely safe on campus and would think twice before walking around or to my car at night.  It's still a college campus tho so just use your head.  Public safety is over bearing to when it comes to parties in off campus apartments and housing.  I'm not sure how  statistics are reported but a large number of students seem to get in trouble with Horry county police over petty alcohol related things.  With that being said students need to be a lot more careful at CCU then on majority of other universities across the country.
College Junior,2,Housing options on campus are great and offer you a wide variety of options most campuses don't have.  They are clean and offer decent space and privacy for college.  All the RA's I've been in contact with are really nice and helpful.  The higher authority figures such as the resident directors have zero respect for the students and have little to no respect for the RA's that work with them.  With that said if you have the option to live off campus or or are coming in as a transfer student I would recommend living some where such as coastal club or monarch.
College Sophomore,2,"Coastal keeps you safe but also gets you in more trouble than anything. They need to remember it's a College still, were 20-21 years old a controlled get together shouldn't end in 15 MIP's and 500$ tickets for being in the presence of alcohol. Little over bearing if you ask me. Coastal cops abuse their authority."
College Freshman,2,Let's be real; Greek life is terrible.
College Freshman,2,"The sororities are all rude, especially top tear ones."
College Sophomore,2,"Coastal is not the worst, but damn sure aint close to being a top school. The food is okay I guess. The academics is pretty bad. Some teachers stand out more than others. Greek life isn't all that unless you're white and from the north. Cops and security give it tickets left and right. I wouldn't recommend parking on campus anywhere after 8:50am classes bc everything is taken and you WILL get ticked for trying to park in areas that have AMPLE parking spaces for faculty, by wall, by ingle...even if there are parking spaces. Might as well not go to class bc the trolley is also unreliable at times. The school was just cheap and near the beach. 2 main points that brought me here."
College Freshman,2,"I am doing a lot better here than in high school grade wise but I am miserable.  No parties are fun ever.  The only way you can kind of have fun is going to broadway or tongys which is mad expensive and I am personally not a huge bar fan especially when that's all there is to do here.  The cops are outrageous and will give parking tickets, drinking tickets, and dui's excessively and sometimes unfairly.  The campus is nice but everyone is unfriendly and as someone who likes to have fun I hate it here.  Everyone in my dorm is transferring and I don't blame them, I am too.  Monarch the apartment people live in cancelled the crazy pool parties on I'm Shmacked and basically this school being a fun party school was a lie.  It also gets pretty cold here and rains almost everyday so if you came here for the weather probably think again or make sure you invest in rainboots."
College Freshman,2,"My experience was bad, it took a lot out of may family to try to keep me in school, but we made it through"
College Sophomore,2,The places that are near campus and convenient for students are priced incredibly high. All shopping and things are a good distances from campus and those apartments. Safety is horrible. There are a ton of armed robberies and just recently there were two murder suspects hiding out in one of the complexes.
College Sophomore,2,They are very strict on everything when it comes to on campus living. Quiet hours start at 10 and you get written up right away. You aren't allowed to even have a decorative wine glass or margarita glass in your room. I understand not having alcohol and drugs on campus but if you get caught you immediately have to pay $100 for a alcohol class.
College Freshman,2,It would be the best if the Subway and Chic-fil-a could take meal swipes! Hicks is usually okay if you go to the deli or go to the salad bar. Sometimes though the food is gross. I personally don't like CINO's burgers but that's just me. I just wish there were more options in the dining hall.
College Sophomore,2,I didn't receive as much as i did at my previous college(Lander) and they tried to charge me out-of-state at first
College Freshman,2,The party scene is slowly going down at Coastal. Due to campus strictness any and all parties WILL be busted by 12pm if not earlier. There used to be house parties at Quail and Goodyear but it seems as if those are no more. So for now the only options for students are small apartment parties at Monarch or spending a lot of money at Broadway at clubs.
College Freshman,2,"Overall the quality of on-campus meal-plan food is terrible. Hicks Dining Hall has very few options, and is only open until 8 on weekdays and 7 on the weekends. UP cafe is open later but there have been many cases of students receiving food poisoning. Cino Grille is by far the best on-campus meal-plan option. They have a variety of sandwiches, burgers, and many other things. Dining dollars are best used at Starbucks and Subway, but make sure you use them wisely as they run out quick!"
College Freshman,2,"I am not saying the classes are terrible it is just fact of how hard it is to make friends on this campus, because most of the students are weird and rude."
College Freshman,2,"I feel its very fattening, and I know some its frozen at UP Café and Hicks, and the quality matters to me. Also I feel I can cook better and healthier at home."
College Freshman,2,"Greasy disgusting and repetitive (Hicks & UP Cafe)

Most people goes to CINO Grille to eat or cook their in own food it they live in UP.

All my dining dollars went to Chick-fil-a and Starbucks"
College Freshman,2,"Did not feel i received as much as i should, stuck struggling with payments."
College Freshman,2,"the food is very unhealthy, and there's not a great variety out here in UP"
College Freshman,2,"I was offered a merit scholarship to attend, but because I received in-state tuition, they took away any and every scholarship I was given. it is not too too expensive here, but the fact that they revoked my financial aid was a struggle that I did not expect."
College Freshman,2,Our Student Health Services is awful. You wait forever and they have well educated physicians.
College Junior,2,"Two policies I believe should be less strict are parking on campus because public safety is out everyday to provide tickets for those without a parking pass. Attendance in class should not play a role in a final grade in a course. I find it important to attend class regularly, but a student's grade should not drop a letter grade because of three unexcused absences."
College Freshman,2,You are living outside the largest tourist area in the United States. Just imagine during vacation season.. The traffic is horrendous.
Recent Alumnus,2,I dont have any tips for financial aid.  I'm still doing things with it and I need money real quick.  I really need financial aid but everything is becoming a mess.  Do it in advance so you have time to make changes and fix problems before any deadlines.
College Junior,2,It is the same things over and over .
College Junior,2,The parking is a bit far from campus if you have mid-day classes.
College Sophomore,2,It is the social norm to which most adhere.
College Sophomore,2,"I do not drink or party or do drugs, but i have to live around people that do, and it is really obnoxious. There is an ABC store down the street that doesn't card if you're a girl with cash, and people are getting drugs and alcohol on campus all the time, despite a zero tolerance policy."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not share the same background as most of my fellow students and I feel slightly out of place because of that. I am from a relatively northern city, not from a rich family, am not of traditional religious views or sexual orientation. My friends are supportive of me, but I do not feel entirely comfortable in the environment that I live in."
College Sophomore,2,"Since there is only housing for two years, we all have to find off campus housing for the last year or two we are there. But all the prices are so high because they know we have to find housing. On top of that, not having a car means we can't travel that far from the campus, but those housing complexes are even more expensive and hard to get into."
College Sophomore,2,"There are very few spots available around the dorm. On top of that, commuters and students that live in the other dorms park in our parking lot, which should get them a ticket, but it never does. The parking lots for commuters fill very quickly. There are not enough spots for the professors to park, either. And the over flow lots are way on the other side of campus from the dorms and classrooms."
College Junior,2,"I have found that non greeks don't like greeks and the greeks stick together. Most sorority girls won't even look at guy who's not in a frat. It's not like that completely, there are a few chill frats and sororities, but in general there's a pretty bad divide between greeks and non greeks."
College Junior,2,"Honestly, taking the shuttle is easier. Unless it's after five, you generally have to park way far away anyway and if you park where you're not supposed to, it's a guaranteed ticket."
College Junior,2,Cops are only there to hand out parking tickets and enforce the hypocritical rules.
College Freshman,2,"Most of the people I know with cars complain about the parking on campus. The lots near buildings fill with people who work in the buildings, so there's never enough spots for students."
College Freshman,2,I do not drink or smoke and a lot of times you just hear it in normal conversation. People talk about it daily which I do not like.
College Sophomore,2,I do not know anything about campus housing. I do not want to bash this school about campus housing because i have been downgrading (telling the full truth) about this school for more than appropriate reasons. All i know is that campus housing is very strict.
College Sophomore,2,I live off campus but i have a friend or two that live on campus. They say it is extremely strict.
College Freshman,2,The food is gross. Its the same stuff every single day.
College Freshman,2,Every fast food place you can possibly think of is around this school.
College Freshman,2,"The school finally had a good wifi system, and then the decided to change it and it is nearly impossible to get good connection."
College Freshman,2,"It basically feels like I'm attending a Community College on a daily basis because of how simple the classes are, and how unintelligent most of the professors are."
College Junior,2,"Always building new buildings over parking lots, not enough spaces"
College Freshman,2,"They are okay with housing, and it the community."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking on-campus at Coastal always seems to be a problem, especially if you're driving to campus in the morning or early afternoon when most students have their classes.  Campus security are constantly patrolling the parking lots and giving out parking tickets left and right.  You have been warned!"
College Student,2,Eaglin and Ingle suck. The woods are alright and UP is the nicest but farthest from campus.
College Junior,2,The woods are cramped and full of mold.
Recent Alumnus,2,"You definitely need a car on campus! There is a shuttle that goes to university housing, but to get anywhere else in the area, you need a car. The parking and traffic situation on campus are horrible, as the school undergoes construction constantly so they often close off parking lots. The parking permit is rather expensive - 75$ and so are fines - from $35."
College Junior,2,"It's nothing special. The food isn't great, but we're in college so we have to eat. The cooks are a bit obnoxious, but we have to go along with it if we want our food to be ""safe"""
Recent Alumnus,2,Parking was a struggle. Knowing how to parallel park is a must.
College Sophomore,2,"It rains frequently but I like the wind, it turns a hot day into a cooler one but the fall and winters are very cold because of this. A lot of the weather conditions are the way they are because the school is about 10 miles away from Myrtle Beach, SC."
College Freshman,2,"My major is Finance and I haven't really started any classes on my major, but I will next semester."
Junior,1,"My experience here was horrible, worst mistake of my life, they never accepted my Fafsa for the semester I attended but accepted my Fafsa for the following semester, and sent my $5,000+ debt to collections. My ""adviser"" didn't even seem to realize I was an Art Major before attending this school. They didn't care that I already had a Probability and Stat college credit from High School. NO PARKING AVAILABLE for students, and they'll tow your car if you decide to park in one of their biggest lots before a baseball game, regardless if you had to go to class? School is a Joke. Now I want to go to a different college to get a professional career, but, because they just didn't want to accept my Fafsa, for false reasoning, I can't get a transcript from this school until I pay up the waste of $5,000+. Plus, they give out car Tickets like presents on Christmas. Don't plan on using more than one car unless you plan to pay for a parking pass for all of them."
Senior,1,"they really dont care and all they want is money, learned nothing here, no one likes it other than its location. place is a trap"
Freshman,1,"Coastal Carolina is the worst University I have ever seen. They treat students as a payday. All they care about is getting your money!   Read every document that they send very closely. I would recommend securing a lawyer before you sign anything.

The whole experience was a scam from the onset. 

Do not send your child to this money hungry University."
Junior,1,"Truly a poorly designed college. Campus is structured to intentionally drive out commuter students even though only about 43% of students live on campus and benefit stidents paying more to live in campus housing. If you do not live in a dorm and are local for example (mind you this is Conway, SC not at all a big city), you will have to budget between 8-10 hrs per wk for shuttling. There is almost 0 parking for students and the shuttles are on 30 minutes loops (unheard of). If shuttle is full which often happns, add 10-15 min. This is really amazing because this college takes in a ton of gov funding, yet operates in sole purpose to increase money and drive out students who either can't afford or choose to live off campus. Universities shouldn't have agendas outside of education. It is like a warzone in their campus parking lots and why they have so many buildings without parking I could never tell you."
Freshman,1,I can’t wait to transfer. Most people hate it here. Morale is so low. Half of my dorm was scammed somehow and couldn’t come back 2nd semester because they were in a Bridge program that changed its grading policy with no warning. Lame.
Alum,1,"I would think twice before attending this school. There is a reason their retention rate is so far below the national average. The Bridge Program is an utter scam. Hurricanes are a serious concern. If you aren’t from the South, it can be another HUGE expense to get out of SC. Airfare goes way up and flights are cancelled constantly. They claim they provide housing during hurricanes but they really don’t. Last year students missed three weeks of classes. No reimbursement. Many students struggled to make up work. Professors do not care. Had an awful experience here, start to finish."
Freshman,1,"Beware of the RIP off HGTC/CCU Bridge program. This program was put in place to help struggling students gain some footing in college life. This program is possibly the worst run program I have ever seen. READ THE FINE PRINT No one on one meetings, and the school should exercise  some emotional intelligence when they a sending do not return form letters that arrived at my house Chrismas EVE"
Niche User,1,"Warning to other parents. CCU runs a scam called the CEaL program where they recruit students with less than stellar academic performance who they have no intention of admitting to the school. They give these kids false hope about being able to attend (stating that 93% of kids are successful when in actuality it is about 10%), bilk their parents out of $5K or more for a 4-week session and then fail them out. After being asked to leave due to low GPA they refuse to return the housing deposit, will charge you a $400 fee for leaving and will keep any money you put on the student's commissary fund. If you don't pay they threaten to ruin your credit. Under NO circumstances should you send your child here."
Niche User,1,"This place has been a scam from the moment I walked in. The people are incredibly unhelpful in every department and the academics are awful. Their graduation rate is so low, and it clear why. I transferred out my first semester, this is just an awful place to go and if you're looking to get away from your parents, look at schools with a better reputation."
Freshman,1,"The only way you really stay after freshman year is greek life or athletics. The party side of the school was very talked up before coming, and after experiencing it I was very let down. All the house parties get shut down, and no boys that are not apart of fraternities can get into the house parties. All bars are 21+. The campus is so secluded, and you see the same people constantly. The food options are very limited and repetitive. Parking is awful. The list goes on... I will be transferring after next semester to a larger more open campus."
Freshman,1,Do not come to this school if you want to party. If your high school was fun and you are looking for an even better party expierience do NOT come here. Greek life is the only source of parties and they are extremely terribele. My high school threw parties twice as good. Trust this advice and go to big schools like Arizona or West Virginia if you want to turn up.
Niche User,1,"I started at Coastal and was very excited to go, but once I got there I quickly learned it was very inclusive and no one wanted to do anything with people outside of their social circle."
Senior,1,"This school is sub-par in regards to its atmosphere and in regards to the way it's run. The public safety is actually insane and very very rude, the school hires staff that have poor attitudes towards the student and never adresss any issues, the school blocks websites such as Netflix due to unknown reasons, there are little to no healthy good choices on campus unless you're into eating a salad every day you're here or eating off campus, some professors are spectacular but then others are atrocious, every aspect of this school is a money trap. There is also minimal parking no matter if you live on campus or if you're a commuter as they spend money on pointless renovations and annoying speed bumps instead of spending their money on a parking garage for their ""expanding campus"". All in all this school, the food and primarily the staff are mere jokes. Go elsewhere."
College Freshman,1,"They are very weird and secluded. they probably do good things for the community but nothing that shows, or that anyone cares about."
College Senior,1,Not a fan of greek life so I am not the person to ask
College Sophomore,1,"I'm a second year student at coastal so im currently still in my 2 year life on requirement and it sucks. The mold problem in UP is disgusting, cockroaches are always lurking. My personal RA wrote us up for an extra table in our living room which is so dumb and a power hunger issue. Also don't even think about it if u wanna even ask to live off campus ur second year cause it won't happen, Coastals living requirements are ridiculous."
College Freshman,1,"If CCU does anything, they definitely insure the safety and well-being of the students."
College Freshman,1,Greek life is a literal joke.
College Freshman,1,"Coastal us very uptight on many issues. Drinking and having people in your dorm is always a worry, because the RA's always like to break up the fun. Coastal police seem to always be lurking for their next arrest."
College Freshman,1,I really wish I chose to go somewhere else.
College Freshman,1,"It has been really bad in one year, its been so dangerous with armed robberies."
College Junior,1,Needs a lot of work.
College Junior,1,There really aren't any so there isn't much to do.
College Senior,1,We dont have a variety of Greek life for the minority students.
College Junior,1,"I HATE the policies here! The cops LOVE to break up the fun and they are everywhere. If you're smart you can still have a good time though. The first time I ever smoked weed here, I got caught. It was my first time and I had less than a gram on me and they kicked me out of campus housing forever. I'm not even allowed to visit any of my friends who live in campus housing. It is absolutely ridiculous it's not like I was dealing or anything, I was just smoking a bowl! They have zero tolerance for drugs yet they give you three strikes for underaged drinking which is also illegal, it's not fair!"
College Sophomore,1,"I am spending my second semester here now, and am transferring out after this semester. I am a person that can meet people everywhere i go so it is not me. Unfortunately this school is extremely niche based. If you are a golfer or frat child you may have fun for the first month, after that month it will get very boring going to the same pub ""Tongys'."" The campus is always under construction so it does not look all that great. There newest building in which i have class in is falling apart due to water damage and still is not fixed. My overall experience here at Coastal Carolina University was so boringly pitiful i would talk anyone out from attending if i could. Out of all the professors i had for my CORE CLASSES were great, non core classes....horrible. Save money, college experience, and state of mind, and choose USC if you are destine to come down south. If you have other universities in mind, choose your secondary school please."
College Sophomore,1,"It is LITERALLY horrible! After a full week of classes one would not mind to kick back and meet people at parties. Sorry but parties do not happen here at Coastal Carolina University. Nightlife is so very disappointing. To spend roughly 30,000 a year to attend this school, not only would one like amazing professors and academic help, but also some form of great fun on the weekends. There is one bar every angry college punk goes to and it is not worth the guaranteed trouble."
College Sophomore,1,Beware which off campus housing complex you decide. Many people do no have fun on living on off campus housing.
College Sophomore,1,The local atmosphere at CCU and of Conway SC is horrible. I will not be staying here next semester for this reason and a few other reasons.
College Sophomore,1,Extremely snobby rich children at play. Greek life is the absolute worst at Coastal.
College Freshman,1,There are so many attractive girls everywhere you look.
College Freshman,1,I hate the greek life because all of the people are very rude to everyone not involved in greek life.
College Freshman,1,"I hate this place.  It is a waste of money, time, and energy.  The classes are horrible.  The housing is horrible.  The students, teachers, and staff are horrible.  If you are thinking of going to Coastal, please do not.  They make it out to be the best school in the nation, but its all a show.  If you come here, you will most likely transfer just like everybody else."
College Freshman,1,"Unless you are in a fraternity or sorority, the parties suck.  Even if you are part of greek life, most of those parties get busted too."
College Freshman,1,"It is absolutely miserable.  Every cop treats you like a criminal even if you aren't doing anything wrong.  If a party is busted, the designated drivers get in the same amount of trouble as the people who drank because they were in the ""presence of alcohol."""
College Freshman,1,"Some people are placed in horrible dorms while others get brand new apartments with full kitchens.  It is not a fair system, and all the RA's are very strict."
College Student,1,I graduated from a school in state but due to my mother's illness she did  not change her DR lis and I was considered a out of state student which put a bigger hardship on my mother she do not work.  She has a spine dis.
College Junior,1,"I have made Dean's List for three years straight and I cannot get any scholarships. It is an on going struggle to find a loan that will approve me with having little or no credit , and I do not have a credit worthy cosigner. Year to year I do not know if I can attend Coastal due to fiances. "
College Freshman,1,Not very the center of restaurants. 
College Senior,1,Permit cost are too high and they will ticket you for not having an permit. Very hard to find a parking space.
College Junior,1,"The school is growing. Parking lots get closed off and everyone tries to drive to class, even the freshmen who could walk the two minutes to class! If you live on-campus take a shuttle but get to the stop early so your not late. If you have to drive make sure you have your decal and park in the correct designated areas."
College Junior,1,"They are constantly getting rid of student parking, yet they allow the freshmen to have cars. Parking is ridiculous and students get petty parking tickets all the time."
College Student,1,"Greek life is totally lame. Parties are low-key and nothing special and there is no greek housing which makes it seem as if greek life doesn't even exist. The only benefit to greek life is that most of the babes join the sororities, so if you struggle with picking up chicks a frat is your best bet."
College Sophomore,1,"The cops at Coastal are not only assholes, but they're everywhere. They are always on the prowl, and will catch you if you start to post things about parties on social networks. We have @CoastalCopWatch and even they can't keep up with them sometimes. It's annoying, and also a lot of the time they go undercover and will have undetectable cars- which seems a bit extreme because how can you not tell its a cop car, but trust when I say you can't even tell. Most of the time they're just regular white chevy Malibu's. Most parties get busted, and even if you get arrested off campus, the school still intervenes and you are punished not only with actual law enforcement, but with the school. It's stupid"
College Sophomore,1,"There's nothing to really ever do besides party with the frats who happen to be mostly douche bags (just being honest)... Coastal is all about greek life, which means if you aren't in it or apart of it, then you're nothing."
College Freshman,1,Where I live the living conditions are terrible. The dorms are filled with black mold that creates the individuals living in them to become sick often.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is terrible and it is just getting worse. I would have to get to campus almost an hour before my class would start just to get a decent spot. They are turning the majority of the parking lots into new spots for buildings as well, so it is just going to get worse."
College Sophomore,1,"The effort is appreciated, but it's not where one would want to eat at everyday. One place may cause health issues and the others will leave you going to bed hungry. "
College Junior,1,"I thought in college you find the person you will marry, have kids and so forth. At CCU boys are not here for relationships but only for relations."
College Junior,1,There are far too many alcohol and drug abusers here
College Freshman,1,"Just about everyone i have come in contact with so far is doing some type of drug. I can walk down my dorm hall and pick 5 rooms that i know do drugs. ive herd people asking for club drugs, seen deals go down and run into people blazed out of their minds all the time. while all this is always going on, it seems no one is getting caught and no concequences are being faced. Its sad."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is not the best part of this college, freshman are allowed cars and have parking lots next to the dorms, but there are places certain people can and cannot park. if you park in the wrong place you are almost guaranteed a parking ticket, and finding a parking spot is extremely difficult on weekdays"
College Sophomore,1,night mare from 10 to around 3 and plus the contructions all around does not help with teh parking issues leave 30 min early in order to find a good spot your going to park in the over flow parking at the edge of campus
College Freshman,1,This school is terrible. The state cops set up DUI checkpoints wherever the students are partying or hanging out. They even had a checkpoint set up on the main road of the campus. In university place the cops constantly are pulling people over for bull****. And all the parties are constantly getting busted. The shuttle services suck as well. Half of the time you can't get on because the bus if filled. Schools terrible can't wait until i transfer out.
College Sophomore,1,Wireless Not the Best – The computer labs are reliable and do not get crowded unless it's finals or midterms. Wireless areas are scarce. The dorms do not have wireless internet and only a few buildings have a good wireless singal.
College Sophomore,1,Campus is filled with construction and no parking.
College Freshman,1,not enough spaces for students. to many for professors. Needs to have makers of where the parking lots are divided for students so there arent any parking tickets for students.
College Junior,1,Parking is horrible. They take away parking lots but do not provide other place to park temporarily.
College Freshman,1,"Scary Shuttle Bus – I would avoid the shuttle if at all possible, its nearly always late."
College Freshman,1,"It is impossible to find parking on campus, and if you do find a parking spot it is not close at all! all the close spots are for the commuting students. Its so annoying i dont understand it at all!"

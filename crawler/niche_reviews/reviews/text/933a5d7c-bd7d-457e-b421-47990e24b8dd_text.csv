Freshman,5,"I love it, its been able to help to to expand my skills and chase after the field I want to pursue now that i am out of the military."
Freshman,5,"its fantastic the teachers and staff are friendly and helpful, I would highly recommend it, it was my tp choice after getting out of the navy."
Sophomore,5,"I love DU and overall, I'm extremely happy with my college experience so far. The campus is beautiful. I love the proximity to both downtown Denver and the mountains. Many students are very involved on-campus in sports and various clubs. In terms of academics, classes are challenging and the quarter system is fast-paced. I have found students at Korbel to be more competitive, for better or worse. In general, my professors have been fantastic! They're extremely dedicated and most have been easy to connect with. Small class size helps with making connections. For cons, I wish the student body was more diverse and dining hall food could be much better."
Junior,5,"Spring quarter was moved to online and all of my professors were very accommodating. I'm in the business school, so the transition could have been different for students in other areas, but the professors I had were great. DU has worked hard during the pandemic to give students refunds where they deserve and to work with students to keep us and our families informed. You have to hound administration to work with you if you have issues that are unique to your situation, though. This school is overpriced tbh, but all colleges seem to be that way these days."
Freshman,5,It’s an amazing school that offers many programs and many classes. They help you out so much and the classes are fun!
Alum,5,I only had one quarter but it went well.  Some classes were better then others and it was mostly left to the professors.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed the classes and class sizes. I loved my dorm and the student life. They did sort of push diversity which I understand why that is important, being a biracial, queer, female student. However I don’t think forcing diversity is the way to make a school more open and accepting. I appreciated the alcohol and gun violence safety training courses at the beginning and how they taught us about consent as well. I think more schools should do something similar."
Junior,5,The University of Denver is truly a special school. Its beautiful campus makes me feel welcomed. The staff and the teachers make it a point to really get to know their students. Denver is an amazing city and the perfect place to spend college.
Niche User,5,"As a parent of a current freshman from California, DU was an excellent choice (academics, campus life, supportive administration & faculity, culture, surrounding city, etc) for my child.  After visiting numerous campuses throughout northern and southern California, I'm so glad DU was on the out of state list. After the initial visit and tour, my child knew DU was ""IT"" based on all of factors noted above. Still very happy with DU 1 year later!"
Freshman,5,DU is a tight knit community with excellent academics.  It is a beautiful campus with easy access to public transportation to get around Denver.
Freshman,5,Very comfortable environment. People are positive and help one another. Teachers genuinely care about students. They are nearly as helpful as high school teachers will be. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate. The dorms are clean and comfortable. There are lots of things to do near campus.
Niche User,5,"I haven't visited this college yet, but i have applied and been admitted. As of right now, DU is my top choice for a school; they have been very helpful and informative with different oppurtuinites and deadlines. Despite being a signific antly small part of the college, they make the individual feel important to the whole big picture."
Niche User,5,"What I loved about DU was the campus, the first time that I went there I knew that the campus was a great fit for me. It also has great staff who are there to answer all the questions that you might have."
Niche User,5,"The diversity at DU is little to none, however there are so many amazing people you will meet, and it just feels like home."
Graduate Student,5,"The University of Denver provides a seamless transition into graduate life. The advisors are genuine, caring, and informative. They will be as involved as the learner would like. The educators really have a passion for the curriculum and care about the experience of the student!  I would recommend this institution to absolutely anyone!"
Freshman,5,"I love being a student at DU. The campus is gorgeous, the people are so kind, and the variety of classes offered is incredible. I've always been really involved in extracurricular activities, and DU encourages students to get involved on campus. It's common for someone to be taking 12-16 credit hours of classes and be involved in more than one campus activity or have a job! I fell in love with DU in about the first minute I was on campus for a tour. There truly is something for everyone on DU's campus. You like sports? Students get free tickets to all sporting events (except hockey) and $5 tickets to hockey. Greek life? Join it, it's awesome. Student government? Run for election in the Senate. Dungeons and Dragons? Yep, DU has that too. Like to sing? Join an acapella group. If you like it, chances are DU's got it. Overall, DU's an amazing school."
Graduate Student,5,"The GSSW focus on trauma awareness, privilege, and inclusiveness is what makes them a top-rated Social Work graduate program!"
Sophomore,5,"This University is great for those invested in their educations and who want a more traditional smaller class as opposed to large lectures. Teachers do their best to get to know you and the University really focuses on maintaining small class sizes to encourage stronger relationships between students and teachers. The quarter system this university uses also gives a month off in December which gives students time to take advantage of the winter mountains or to head home for the holidays with their families. The quarters only last 10 weeks so classes go by fast and you have to learn a lot quickly, but the pace really helps keep you on task and invested in class as well."
Senior,5,"Nice place to study. Great programs, great professors. Student life isn't too complicated.  And I love the local area"
Graduate Student,5,"I had an extremely pleasant experience with the admission counselors as I was deciding whether or not to apply. They answered all of my questions with genuine care, advice, and direction. Once I applied and was accepted, I was pleased with the level of communication - getting me in touch with my program advisors and professors. I am super excited to begin my PhD program this fall (2019)!"
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the University of Denver. Aside from it being a STUNNING campus, they are very focused on inclusivity and diversity. They have an amazing business program, and a hospitality school that is in the top 10 in the world. The business professors are outstanding, and have so many connections to help their students with their careers. However, the university is extremely expensive."
Graduate Student,5,"The faculty are excellent, the campus is beautiful, and student life is very pleasant. The location of the university is a huge bonus as well."
Freshman,5,I will be an incoming freshman but it seems like a great campus and super excited to attend in the fall.
Graduate Student,5,"I love the online Masters of Social Work Program! It is very inclusive and comprehensive. The fact that you get to be in an internship almost right away is also really awesome! Hands on experience in social work is a must. It works well with my schedule, and even though it is a ton of work, it's totally worth it."
Niche User,5,I had the opportunity to stay at the University of Denver for a week during a high school summer program. The program was amazing and I truly felt like I belonged there. The professors and the students involved in the program truly made this experience unforgettable.
Graduate Student,5,"My experience as a DU student has been fantastic. The campus community is welcoming and the education is amazing, especially at such a great deal compared to other programs I'd researched."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus. It is a good-sized school for me and I felt that my education would be enhanced greatly if I were to attend. I love the atmosphere of the location and the student body seemed great. All the staff I interacted with were extremely nice and professional. I also loved watching one of their hockey games. Go Pioneers!
Senior,5,"I have absolutely loved my experience. The people are down to earth and look like they enjoy being at school. The best part has been partaking in the Pioneer Leadership Program. I have made life long friends, as well as effective and important leadership skills."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy going to the University of Denver. It is challenging but the small classes are great for teachers really making a point to know you and help you. The campus is good sized, but small enough that it is easy to walk everywhere. The kids are nice for the most part however some may come off as a little snobby. The school is very diverse with a lot of international students and opportunities to study abroad. Overall, the classes a perfectly sized for the most part, the professors are great, and campus life is fun."
Senior,5,"I loved going to the University of Denver from Freshman year up until my Senior year. Although I found my way to the major I truly wanted in life, the hardest part of this school was the disconnection between students and advising. It was hard for me to find the right advisor that knew enough for me to get a proper internship. The career fairs were also biased in my opinion. They were either for computer science majors or people in the business or international studies schools."
Graduate Student,5,"My overall experience with the University of Denver has been nothing but excellence and positivity. I knew DU was the university for me once I decided to go to graduate school and couldn’t be more happy that I chose DU. Everyone has been so helpful and accommodating to help me towards my goal of becoming one of their students and now that I am a graduate student, I am ecstatic to pursue my masters degree here."
Alum,5,I loved every minute of attending DU. The campus has amazing faculty and students. I would recommend everyone to attend DU.
Freshman,5,My admissions advisor was great! He helped me get through a lot of sat and financial aid issues and was very supportive! Additionally the school offers amazing advisors and has a studious but still friendly and fun environment!
Niche User,5,They were very kind sending me information about the college and what they stand for. I enjoyed how fast they are with replying and how energetic and excited they were while touring the campus.
Sophomore,5,"Very good school. The STEM majors need more support and funding but most of the professors are wonderful. There are lots of places for undergrad research and many professors work hands on with you.
The dinning halls are pretty awful but many dorms have kitchens which is nice."
Alum,5,"Campus is beautiful, the people are great, night life was pretty nuts - overall great college experience. Obviously small things that could use improvement such as campus food (though there are 30+ restaurants within a 5 block radius) and the whole detox scare but overall it was fantastic."
Senior,5,"It was amazing! I loved seeing the campus thrive, and exploring such a vibrant city. The academics are very good, and it is just a great place to be!"
Niche User,5,"The size of University of Denver is so convenient especially for first year students. The campus is so pretty and easy to navigate, while still being a decent size! Everyone in admissions is so easy to communicate with and really good at getting back to students quickly."
Freshman,5,"The university of Denver could not have been a better choice for me. This school is the perfect size and has so many opportunities to offer undergraduate and graduate students. The classes they offer are incredible and with the average class size being around 20, that makes it just that much easier to get such a pristine education."
Freshman,5,I LOVE THE FRIENDS I HAVE FOUND HERE.  I FOUND PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND HOW I THINK.  THERE ARE STUDENTS HERE FROM 48 DIFFERENT STATES AND 13 DIFFERENT COUNTRIES JUST THIS YEAR.  MOST PLACES ARE VERY EASY TO FIND ON CAMPUS.  IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A CLOSER GROCERY STORE FOR THE PEOPLE THAT DO NOT HAVE CARS.  IT ISN'T EASY RIDING PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION TO STORES AFTER YOUR PURCHASES.  THE CLASSES AND STAFF ARE AMAZING.  THEY SPEND TIME WITH THE STUDENTS AND REALLY CARE ABOUT EACH ONE OF US.
Graduate Student,5,Very responsive to questions asked and feedback from students. The professors are knowledgable and provide an learning environment for students to grow and explore their academic potential.
Freshman,5,"Perfect for me!  Great profs, always available.  Awesome campus.  Very active outdoor life.  Good variety in clubs, activities and sports.  Short ride on light rail into Denver."
Freshman,5,"I love the size and the overall feeling of the campus. It is easy to meet and get to know new people as well as excel in the classroom. I love the easy access to the city and surrounding area so you can experience off-campus life as well. DU pushes its students to work hard while also giving them a community to feel safe and comfortable in. I also love how much they encourage studying abroad and how popular of a thing it is here, because that just shows that they are interested in immersing their students in the real world and what it has to offer."
Niche User,5,the people are very friendly and i love the location of the college as well and the mens soccer team is very good as well.
Freshman,5,"I was pretty skeptical going in, but even just a quarter in and I'm convinced DU has it all - the frat ragers, the athletic wins, the tough academics, the sports team parties, lit bars, clubs, and the mountains. We have a massive metropolitan area and free public transportation. There's something for everyone here."
Freshman,5,"The extra opportunities at DU are fantastic! Not to mention the personable size, phenomenally balanced and experienced professors, and stellar location, the Honors Program and Pioneer Leadership Program add extra communities and ""niches,"" if you will, in the school. I'm a freshman this year, and my expectations were exceeded because of these great programs! I'm so excited for what's to come in these next four years. DU has something for everyone, and responds SO well to self activism."
Senior,5,"University of Denver is an amazing school that provides students with a myriad of opportunities, academically, socially, and professionally. Staff and faculty are passionate, supportive, organized and encouraging."
Freshman,5,"It's a great school that makes you feel like home. The campus is spread out and it can be a long walk to get to classes from the freshman dorms, but the classes are worth it."
Junior,5,Great university with a beautiful campus. Class sizes are smaller and more personal. All of the professors and staff want to see the students succeed.
Sophomore,5,I had such an incredible experience during my first year. The professors want to see you succeed and support you if you need help. Living in the dorms helped me meet amazing people and I found it easy to make friends when I put in the effort.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Denver is a dyamic campus that caters to all types of students. From traditional to the retired, DU has education opportunities  to engage and interest everyone in the community."
Sophomore,5,"When I was touring the school, the tour/ Student Life Staff were very informative and helpful. They were please to guide the potential students and pleasantly answer all of the questions that students and the parents had. Programs that are offered at the University of Denver is suitable for students interested in various fields. From its exceptional Daniels College of Business program to its science and engineering programs, students will find their place at the University with no problem. Additionally, the active student life such as sororities, fraternities, and various clubs and club sports, students will always stay active at the University of Denver."
Freshman,5,"So far DU has been amazing. I would not want to go anywhere else. it is a great balance of what you are looking for in college. There are lots of smart students here but also a lot of people who party hard. The location is fantastic with having a city and the mountains. DU is small but not too small, so I am continually meeting new people but also recognize a few people every time when I walk across campus. The student body has a lot of athletes for its size, but not much diversity."
College Junior,5,"I can only go by what I see.  As an adult learner, College Sports are not my biggest interest."
College Junior,5,"I would choose this school again, because I enjoy the atmosphere of learning and the commitment the Professors having in educating all students in the program.  Everyone has a voice and all opinions are welcomed."
College Freshman,5,I'm so happy I chose DU. Great school in a great location with a lot to do.
College Freshman,5,I've never felt in danger.
College Freshman,5,I love DU's location and size. You get all the perks of a wonderful city but are also close to the mountains.
College Freshman,5,always DIAL 911 just in case of emergency
College Senior,5,i loved my dorm! Campus safety is pretty strict though so you have to be careful
Alum,4,"Great school in an amazing city. International studies program was fantastic. Not sure the result was worth the high price tag, though."
Freshman,4,"Everyone here is friendly and very helpful. I appreciate all the students as they have all come from all over the globe and share some valuable insight into the different places they're from. The professors can go too fast so classes are a little hard but they do respond to all questions so it's easier to get help. Due to COVID, there are no parties at the moment, but there are plenty of clubs and sports available to join. Additionally, students can be quiet and reserved sometimes but there are also plenty of times when students aren't studying that they are ready to have some fun and explore the campus. The campus itself is beautiful, almost reminding me of a castle, and is easy to navigate, especially with all the helpful staff ready to point you in the right direction. All in all, the University of Denver is a academically rigorous school, but still beautiful and a great place to be attending."
Sophomore,4,"Although not ideal, my experience with online learning at DU has been good. Most of my professors are very aware of the challenges students are facing and have been lenient during this time. Many professors have stressed that they are available to talk and give support. Online learning is definitely more self-motivated, however I feel that I was still able to learn and grow."
Alum,4,"I got a lot of value out of DU.  Great friendly ambitious people, classes where I learned a ton, an incredible location.  I am so glad I choose to go to DU.  It does have its substantial issues that unfortunately hold it back from being all it could be.  Lack of school spirt, an incompatent administration, drug issues.  DU is a good school that is so close to being a great school but can’t seem to actually make progress on what it struggles with."
Alum,4,"I only had to complete 2 classes online, one including a lab, but I feel that the professors really did the best they could with what they were given especially on such short notice."
Senior,4,"I took several classes online. Overall, they went well. Professsors were understanding of challenges that students are facing right now, like not having a quiet place to study."
Senior,4,Professors are outstanding - they really connect with students on a personal level. It is easy to find ways to engage in the community and become inspired by the university's desire to be a private university dedicated to the public good.
Junior,4,The teachers are dedicated to their students and the small class sizes allow for more involvement. There are also a wide variety classes available.
Junior,4,I love the professors and the dedication to education. There is also great student life including sports (especially hockey) and clubs.
Sophomore,4,"I've only completed one year so far but I already really enjoy the school! Professors are super helpful and the small class sizes are great. I always feel like I can ask questions or get further help with an assignment. Other students are pretty friendly too. There are always fun events going on campus whether it be for greek life, sports, or other clubs/organizations."
Sophomore,4,My professors were really accommodating and I still learned a lot despite the difficult circumstances that come with online learning.
Senior,4,The Daniels College of Business is a world renowned business school with some of the brightest minds and inspirational faculty members. The University as a whole provides a safe and comforting environment for all.
Senior,4,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, DU turned to online classes and has been extremely supportive of each and every student's needs. Online classes in general provide students with more flexibility and are a great help especially to athletes!"
Sophomore,4,"The University of Denver is a great size campus, having smaller classes you have the ability to build relationships with your professor. The University has great school spirit, where students, families and faculty attend the lacrosse, soccer, tennis, hockey, gymnastics and all other sports events. Being ten minutes from downtown Denver, the school sits in a great location just off the highway and near many local spots. The school offers ""flex"" accounts for the students to get discounts on food and restaurants nearby. The University has great dorms for freshman and sophomores on campus and the layout of the school is really nice, taking only twenty minutes to get from one side of campus to the other. The school has a beautiful view of the mountains which are also only an hour or two away. The University of Denver is really dedicated to clubs, and all students are made aware of all club opportunities. The University is very dedicated to making campus as diverse as possible."
Freshman,4,"Overall DU is a decent university. It has some pretty serious problems when it comes to campus safety. However, there are plenty of student organizations to get involved in, and the campus housing/food is pretty good."
Sophomore,4,"I've had a good experience at DU. Class sizes are super small, so it's easy to interface with your professors. There are also endless opportunities to get involved on campus via student organizations and club sports."
Sophomore,4,"I like going to school at DU for the most part.. There are great, knowledgable professors here and interesting, insightful classes! The academics are amazing. However it is challenging to be social unless you are involved in greek life, sports, or a club. There are not many club options either. It is a small campus and you tend to see a lot of familiar faces most days. The party scene is very poor. It is nice that we are kind of close to the mountains so there are lots of options for getting outside and being active in that sense (hiking, camping, traveling.) The change i'd like to see at DU would be to have better meal options! Also there is a lot of construction going on right now as the 2025 Plan is being built up (a new dormitory and new buildings). The campus should be in great shape in the next few years and I am very excited to see what will come!"
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere of the school and the professors. There are so many opportunities to grow outside of class that is much different than other universities. I wish that the cost of attendance would go down and that the food was better.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, I joined the ZBT fraternity. SO far it has been an amazing experience. The academics are challenging but since there are not many students the professor to student ratio is very good."
Freshman,4,"The University of Denver has amazing academic programs and staff that really care about their students. The community in the JMAC building for freshman is great. The food is good but can get a little generic and repetitive. However, the accommodations and the location of the school is great."
Sophomore,4,The University of Denver is currently opening up so many opportunities  throughout my college career as well as helping me build a foundation to last me through whatever career path I choose.
Graduate Student,4,Very reputable school. Loved the professors! They were passionate and cared about your success. Beautiful campus/workout center/library. Campus is close to good restaurants/breweries/grocery stores/parks etc. Fifteen minutes away from downtown. My only complaint is that the school is so expensive. Wouldn’t recommend going there unless you have scholarships/grants/money.
Niche User,4,"Nice small campus, easy to enter into a community, Denver is about 30 mins away. Offers a great Computer Science program and Business program."
Junior,4,"I have had nothing but excellent professors at DU. I am currently in the International Studies program, and the professors at higher level classes are all passionate about what they do and are excellent educators. The Dorms are OK, the food is not good, and so far I have not seen a lot of the return on my investment."
Niche User,4,"I am not a college student yet, but I did take a tour of the college and know many people that go there. I also used to swim for their team, and I am overall very impressed with the school. The campus is beautiful, with lots of pretty buildings as well as lots of nice green space. It is also in the city so there is lots of places nearby. I also enjoyed how you were able to walk everywhere. I spent most of my time in the sports area with the pool and ice rink, and it is overall a very nice facility. From what I have heard from students that go there, they enjoy there classes a lot and find the academics very good."
Graduate Student,4,"DU has been a fantastic experience, really emphasizing work-life balance. It is, however, quite expensive and you end up paying a lot due to the quarter system."
Graduate Student,4,"So far I enjoy the school. I work full time and have not had anytime to actually sit with an adviser but everyone is available by phone and email. I barely feel like I am missing out on anything with my tight schedule. The only thing is I also want to enter their law program but they have no evening classes, and that bothers me. Dont really want to spend all my weekends in class after the long week. I'd rather just have class on the weekdays after work and get it Over with. Plus I don't know how comfortable I am with law school online."
Niche User,4,"I have not attended the school yet, but the campus is beautiful, the students are welcoming, and it will provide an amazing college experience for me."
Sophomore,4,"DU has so many opportunities to get involved on campus, in social groups, and in academic settings. The size and location made this the perfect ""goldilocks"" school for me, because it was perfect in so many ways. The only down side for me is the price tag on tuition and living in Denver!"
Alum,4,Great school. Sad that they killed greek life. My affiliation with greek life made me more invested in the school.
Sophomore,4,"I love the small class sizes. Professors will help students as long as the student communicates with the professor, and not the day before, the night of, or the morning of an assignment's due date. The campus is beautiful and well maintained. The dorm rooms and bathrooms could look much better, seeing as how they're not the prettiest."
Sophomore,4,"As a first generation student, the University of Denver has really allowed me to connect with other first gens in a way where navigating college was easier when you have all these similar people on your side. On top of that, the university offers LLC programs; these living and learning communities group together freshman of similar interests and allows for communities to grow together and meld into the larger community that is DU. Being apart of the international LLC, I’ve never been so thankful for a community. Overall, DU has welcomed all of its students with open arms and has enforced the idea of inclusive excellence, truly making its campus a force to be reckoned with."
Junior,4,"I've enjoyed my time at DU so far, there have been a lot of neat classes and I've made tons of good friends.
I have an issue with DU's advertising of being diverse and striving for Inclusive Excellence. I think they need to focus on being less white and changing the mascot to something more Inclusive, because at the moment ""Pioneers"" has a connotation of being linked to Native American slaughter, which is not good."
Junior,4,"University of Denver is an amazing university to attend. The campus has breathe taking landscape along with beautiful buildings. When i first came here for a visit i felt right at home in that everyone was nice, the school isn't that big, and all the professor's want to help you. I think some of the schools should expand a little more into different fields to create a well rounded program along with more classes students can take."
Sophomore,4,"DU is a school for those who enjoy small classes and a social environment. It offers many strong programs for majors, and has resources readily available for anyone who needs them. There are always events put on by clubs and fraternities that engage the entire student population, and the sport events are always fun to attend."
Sophomore,4,"University of Denver has a wonderful campus and academic scene.  The variety of food is awesome and the meals plans are reasonable.  Unfortunately, some of the housing does not have air conditioning which becomes very evident during the summer months.  It is a majority Caucasian school, which can be easily seen with just a simple walk around campus.  There are some diversity groups, but there is not much coverage on them."
Alum,4,My experience was through the Graduate School of Education.  The professors were all wonderful and the classes were engaging.  The ability to finish the licensure in nine months was a definite plus.
Sophomore,4,"Very nice campus, friendly students and professors. Most professors are readily available to offer help, class size is small. The campus is a great size, it is very close to the light rail and you have access to many restaurants and activities outside of campus."
Senior,4,"DU has a great business program and an excellent study abroad program. The one downside is that the tuition is very high, even with scholarships."
Graduate Student,4,"The University of Denver is located in an ideal location here in Denver, Colorado. Surrounded by delicious restaurants, you will never go hungry. People generally are very nice and happy to help if you need it. The professors put a lot into their classes and it pays off. Overall academics are challlenging but not impossible."
Freshman,4,University of Denver is probably the most prestigious school in Denver. I like the small class sizes which not only allowed for peer learning but ensured that the professor got the chance to get to know all of us. What liked most about DU is that I get to explore different academic interests.
Junior,4,"The University of Denver has its ups and downs. While the education is challenging and accelerated in a very promising way, the quality of life is not as glamorous as it seems. People are not very tolerant, and they can be quite ignorant and aggressive towards unfamiliar things, rather than open-minded. Some professors are phenomenal, others are awful, but the small-class format that dominates most of DU's pedagogical system guarantees a close relationship with professors and an in-depth approach on the subject matter. The food is awful, but improving, the internet is great, there's plenty of hidden resources to tap into, and the views are gorgeous."
Senior,4,"A great liberal arts education. I’ve learned a ton of useful and applicable stuff from passionate professors in academic classes. The piano department at Lamont School of Music is reprehensibly dysfunctional, a real joke. I do see music majors in other departments improving and getting studio lessons and opportunities to perform."
Sophomore,4,I love the campus and student life. The programs are great and I finally found the challenge I have always neen looking for in a school.
Niche User,4,It was a very nice campus on my visit and had wonderful admissions and did a good job of welcoming incoming students.
Freshman,4,Denver offers a way to explore your interests while still maintaining high academic courses and has been really helpful and supportive throughout the entire time.
Sophomore,4,Very expensive school with posh kids. Academics are great but besides the tuition there are traditions that are costly.
Freshman,4,"It is a beautiful campus, that is by a light rail stop that takes you all over Denver. The professors are all very fun and professionals in their field.  DU has a wide range of activities and clubs to get involved in."
Freshman,4,"So far, I love the University of Denver. It has a beautiful campus and all the professors I have had so far seem to really enjoy what they teach, as well as teaching. The only thing that would make DU better is seeing more students of color represented throughout the school."
Junior,4,"Everything about the school is amazing except for the on-campus food.  Dorms, classes, and the surrounding area is great especially for people that like to get outdoors."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Denver is a great campus situated just minutes from downtown Denver. The school is great for those pursuing careers and degrees in: International studies, engineering, and music. It is a smaller school, which makes professors more accessible for personal help and guidance."
Freshman,4,"Although at first I didn't think I had liked my first year that much, summer vacation has opened my eyes to my appreciation for the institution. I honestly feel homesick for school. The quarter system has proven to be fantastic. If there is a class or professor you don't like you only have to be there for 10 weeks. It feels nice to be busy, but there is certainly time for a social life too. There are great clubs on campus, run by students and professors alike. The professors are amazing, and have proven to me that a professor can make or break a subject. Although the food and housing could be better, I have fallen in love with campus and the school itself."
Sophomore,4,The campus and surrounding area are gorgeous and the University has many opportunities for students to take advantage of the nearby Rocky Mountains. The small size means that professors know and care about their students but also does slightly limit the availability of many classes.
Graduate Student,4,"The University of Denver is full of diverse people that I would never have met in any other way.  I feel as though the experiences that I gathered here, whether that was through studying abroad in Italy, the various clubs I was active in, or just the work study positions that I held over the years, all contributed to my steady development of professional skills."
Sophomore,4,"I've only been going here for one year now, but in my time here I've been shown incredible support from teachers, counselors, and various other sources to get me through. While there are some aspects listed here that I can't say much on... athletics being a big one,  I would wholeheartedly recommend this school to anyone interested."
Niche User,4,The whole atmosphere is so positive and the athletics program is really competitive and really good.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Denver has an amazing faculty and staff, specifically the Sociology and Criminology professors! They are all very willing to help you should you need it. I do wish this campus was more diverse than what is ""advertised"""
Freshman,4,"The University of Denver has exceeded my expectations. Though I'm only in my first year, I have had amazing teachers and classes that have inspired me to continue my education. Though expensive, I believe University of Denver really tries to make things accessible for  their students. I am a huge fan of their motto Inclusive Excellence and I think they really are trying to make strides to better the students lives in class and on campus."
Freshman,4,"The University of Denver offers many more opportunities because it is a small private institution. The Daniels College of Business especially sets students up for success. The small size doesn't effect the school spirt, and one of my favorite aspects of the school is the high energy the students have towards the sports. Attending hockey games is what I look forward to most on Friday nights. My professors have all been very understanding and available for office hours where they are very helpful and seem to really want me to be successful in their classes. Overall I have had a great experience so far at DU."
Freshman,4,"Denver is a great school in a beautiful setting. I've met people from all over the world with a vast variety of majors and career goals. Although it's known to barely have any diversity, the administration is working on it and there are a lot of cool clubs that represent students of different backgrounds. DU is expensive, but being a private school they give out large scholarships."
Junior,2,"Nice campus, nice teachers (ECS), nice students.
ZERO tuition price drop during COVID. Online learning is a mess. Departments don't know how to coordinate with one another. Especially if you take engineering or computer science, be prepared to take 4 or 5 classes that all spend weeks on one subject: number systems.
Some of the worst administration I've ever had to deal with. Campo loves to pin students against walls in their own room."
Freshman,2,With the pandemic all classes got moved to an online platform in a hurry. I was able to adjust relatively quickly but it seems like a few of my professors have not which isn’t their fault if they have never taught online. I definitely think going forward there should be better online teachers training just in general.
Freshman,2,"There is a general feeling on campus that everyone is really nice/ friendly and this is genuinely true- especially for the professors who are very helpful and accommodating and have your best interests at heart. However, I found it very difficult to enjoy my time at the University of Denver.  There is a lack of creativity on campus that is not made up for by intellectual prowess. Students lack political awareness (of any disposition) or empowerment to impact the world in any significant way. Most challenging for me was the overbearing presence of gender violence on campus. After meeting so many women with personal experience so quickly, it made the already poor party scene completely unattractive. The administration is taking no action, campus safety harasses students, and many of the blue light emergency phones around campus do not even work. Unless the location is extremely attractive to you (which it wasn't to me), there is nothing special about this school that makes it redeemable"
Freshman,2,"If you are looking for the ""college experience,"" you probably won't find it here. Greek life is very small, not much interaction between sororities and frats, and no one goes to philanthropy events. Frat parties are a hit or miss, and the two bars get old very quickly. The school feels VERY small and my class sizes ranged from 12-80 people. The students here (no everyone, but most) are very privileged, which I didn't think would bother me, but it did. There didn't seem like there was much school spirit either. While this wasn't a fit for me, I know many people who love the school; great location, awesome teachers, easy access to resources, with a relatively relaxed atmosphere. I encourage students to join club sports and activities; I loved alpine club, great people in that group and there is always someone to hike or ski with!"
Freshman,2,"If you are a minority in any way, do not expect to feel a sense of community here. The university is chock full of pretentious white bros and it's almost as if everyone has little to no social awareness. Also, please be WELL aware of the recent scandal involving over 150 mishandled sexual assault cases in which leadership didn't respond until the situation made local news as the university cares only about their rep, not students. Do not expect to feel safe here, the parties are trash, and you will get bored of the bar after 3 months, I promise. The only redeeming quality is the study abroad program, and if they catch you drinking a quarter before your junior year, do not expect to be allowed to go anywhere. The university is a cash grab and doesn't give a darn about the student, the student body is comically white, and LLC's foster toxic environments that will make you feel like you are attending high school. If you're looking for a worthwhile experience, go somewhere else."
Junior,2,"I've tried very hard to get active on this campus.  I left a college hometown, where 95% of kids never leave, to try and branch out and really get the most out of the college experience.  Student to teacher ration is great here.  There isn't much else that I would really say.  No one seems to be proud of our school and there doesn't seem to be anything glueing the students together.  I participate in Greek Life, the school paper, a club sports team, and more.  Still, I haven't felt like there is much of a connection here.  If you're looking for more than just a school, something like a friendly community where you feel at home, I'd look somewhere else.  "
College Freshman,2,"Almost all white straight kids, but people don't care if you're different."
College Freshman,2,My G.P.A. needs to be above or greater
College Senior,2,DU is in trouble with Title 9 and trying to cover it up by blaming students and changing class schedules
College Junior,2,I don't know enough regarding the greek life at DU to give an accurate review.
College Junior,2,There has been a lot of crime on campus lately including sexual assault
College Freshman,2,"It's college, a significant portion of students are here to party and waste time. I doubt it differs much from other schools, though."
College Freshman,2,"DU is not by any means a safe campus. Although the location is not necessarily dangerous during one-quarter we had 5 sexual assault cases at night on campus which the school deemed ""forcible fondling"", as well as armed robbers driving around with guns."
College Freshman,2,"Housing is not good for freshmen. Do you like being woken up at 4 in the morning on a Wednesday by drunk floormates? Do you like hearing ""floor sports"" when trying to study? Do you like a tiny cramped room?"
College Junior,2,"Variety of graduate level courses in computer sciences is great, but the quality of the courses have been 50% successful at best. Out of 7 graduate level online courses, I've had three professors who were responsive, knowledgable, friendly, communicative, and passionate. Every other course has been regurgitation, at best. No critical thinking, no in-depth learning. It's a miserable failure and I""m constantly frustrated by this program. I'm only continuing because I gambled on the first few courses: I had one great course, then one terrible course, then a decent one, then a good one, then a terrible course, then a good course, and, most recently, another terrible course. I spoke to the dean of University College to try and get my money back, but I can't so I'm staying int he program to get my 20K receipt in the form of a master's degree that will leave me woefully underprepared for the software development job I was hoping to get. 

Basically, each course is a total crapshoot. I'm usually one to say that attitude is everyting and that you get out of a course what you put into it, but the truth is that I've been taking $100 Udemy courses online to supplement my DU courses and get a better education through that portal than I stand to get at DU."
College Junior,2,"With all of my classes online, DU currently has a 50% success rate. If I had a 50% success rate I would be failing miserably. I've spoken with the dean of University College and expressed my issues, but to little avail. As an educational institution I cannot get a refund and there's no such thing as educational malpractice, so I'm out $20K and I have to finish my degree so I at least have a piece of paper that might get me a better job. The reviews were great when I first looked into the school and it took me three years to finally decide to pull the trigger on this master's program and it's one of my deepest regrets. I should have paid half the money and gone to a 'code college' because the first year was all business theory that was irrelevant to my career path in web development, the second year has been just as frustrating. 

In the first year, the canvas course shell that hosts all the online learning materials wasn't updated and by week 6 we had no more media or instructions. After repeatedly emailing the instructor, we finally heard back from him 10 days later and we all finished up the course without the proper materials or any guidance or instruction. 

All coding courses have been complete regurgitation: ""type this in your editor and run the code."" Any attempt to get further instruction has led to the instructor saying ""just keep doing it and it will click."" It hasn't clicked and I'm furious with the pedagogy and lackluster response. I have a sneaking suspicion that the code teachers don't very much understand the code they're writing either. So, having completed database and javascript courses with flying colors, I have no idea how either actually works. 

This is one of the worst educational experiences I've ever had and I would give my big toe to get my money back."
College Freshman,2,Drug use is decently prevalent on this campus. A lot of coke and Adderall. Almost everyone drinks and smokes. You shouldn't be to worried about the drug situation. It is just as easy to find people who are in the drug community as those who are not.
College Junior,2,There isn't much in the way of helping students find internships/job after school.
College Junior,2,"I only lived on campus for one year, but the dorm options are sub-par in my opinion."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am a non-greek, and the way some of the frats act is really annoying. They are absolutely viewed as very cliquey."
College Freshman,2,"Academics are laughable. Only a party school and I hesitate to even use the word ""school"" to describe it. Total rip off."
College Freshman,2,"It's not very thorough, it goes by what a family's income is rather what a family can afford to pay."
College Sophomore,2,Dining halls have the same old food daily.
College Sophomore,2,They are very strock about stuff like parking sn noise but not drug or alcohol use.
College Junior,2,"Personally, for the cost I could have lived off campus in a more spacious comfortable house."
College Junior,2,DU has deep pockets and it makes sure it knows exactly how much money you come from. The school does not give students large financial aid awards.
College Freshman,2,"This year there were three armed robberies on campus in one night all by different individuals and zero arrests made.  Armed robbery is a huge problem, this is a rich kid school and the surrounding poorer neighborhoods know that they can get a new Mac, phone, and cash if they hold a gun to any kid with a DU shirt on."
College Freshman,2,"It depends on which dorm you live in for some of this. If you live in J-Mac the location of the building is pretty good, but Halls and Towers are both ridiculously out of the way. J-Mac and Towers don't have dining halls, so you need to go elsewhere to eat (or make it yourself if you're in Towers.) I live in Halls, so I know most about that one. The state of the building is pretty awful; as of November we have had two pipes burst, one of which caused damage to rooms and the other of which triggered the fire alarm at 1 AM on finals weekend. The heating systems in the rooms don't work great, either, and the laundry room typically only has half of the machines working. Furthermore, housing shows very little care for who they pair with who. They have you fill out a six question form and assume they know all they need to. I'm an insomniac and they paired me with someone who comes back from parties at all hours of the night and watches hours of Netflix in the middle of the night, and we're still trying to get that sorted.

A couple of good points is that the lounges are nice, though not every floor has one. J-Mac has air conditioned hallways, so that's nice when it is warm, but if you're on a higher floor of Towers or Halls it's pretty unbearable. Halls and Towers are both close to the public transport stops as well."
College Junior,2,No variety ever. Everything ends up tasting the same. Worst is that the chefs absolutely cross contaminate meat products in vegetarian dishes.
Recent Alumnus,2,The University of Denver is a very expensive private school and I received little to no financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,Everybody here is pretty white and rich.
College Sophomore,2,DU tries to get all of their students in trouble. It would be amazing if you got out of the dorms with at least one write up for alcohol or weed. Also they are looking to give you parking tickets. They are the worst about parking tickets
College Junior,2,You are forced to pay an unreasonable amount to have a spot in the garages or you are left to find street parking which is absolutely ridiculous because the entire neighborhood has 1 hour parking signs. Majority of classes are two hours and they are relentless about giving parking tickets that are priced very high. You either have to risk it and get a parking ticket or you have to pay the fee to park in the garage. I believe it's just another way DU is trying to get students to pay them money and I find that annoying and very wrong.
College Sophomore,2,"Pioneer net has problems, but works most of the time."
College Sophomore,2,I honestly have no idea. Seems like there is some options though.
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life has far too much influence on this campus.  If you're not in Greek life, expect to not be able to attend any parties, especially if you're a dude."
College Sophomore,2,It's stressful and the award package can drastically change from year to year.
College Sophomore,2,There is no diversity at this school.  It is a rich white kid school.  It is a good example of the social economic disparity in our country.
College Sophomore,2,There is no real campus transportation. It was advertised but is a lie.
College Freshman,2,"I do not like that there are not many african american students on campus, I feel that the ones who are there are treated differently than other groups of people."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is the worst.
College Freshman,2,I wish there were more options in terms of healthier food. 
College Senior,2,"Dark and Dreary for almost 75% of the year. Campus rarely shuts down for poor weather conditions. The school has the budget to plow and salt, but all of the streets coming into the school did not have the luxurious budget. Commuter students and Faculty regularly had issues getting to classes because the university would not appropriately monitor safe weather conditions. "
College Sophomore,2,"Few computer labs, printing is very expensive"
College Sophomore,2,Similar and loo quality everyday
College Sophomore,2,"Very expensive, and limited spots (even though you have to pay for the permit to even be allowed to park there)."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is pretty prominent on campus. As a non-greek you definitely feel that it rules the school. Greeks try to convey an image that they are accepting but this is not the case. All of the student organizations are run by greeks and non-greeks feel excluded.
College Freshman,2,Centeniall Halls is not the best place to live; small dorms far away
College Student,2,not the best food. however there is something for everyone usually. wishes there was more late night options.
College Freshman,2,Campo goes utterly crazy with underage drinking. Beware.
College Freshman,2,"Drink if you drink. If you dont, stay at your dorm and chill. "
College Freshman,2,"Sports are not inclusive here. Its either you play intramural, which is a pain because you have to make your own team but people here are too stupid, you can do club- but these people here make you look like you just started dribbling a ball."
College Freshman,2,Student life is minimal to non-existent. It's only noticeable during hockey season.
College Freshman,2,"There is a variety of food, but nothing special..."
College Sophomore,2,There are several apartment living options around campus as well as plenty of houses for rent available for you and your friends
College Sophomore,2,"DU prides itself on inclusive excellence, a program that celebrates diversity on campus. While visibly you will probably see a lot of white students walking around campus and too much ethnic diversity, students are varied in interests, affiliations and beliefs"
College Sophomore,2,"On campus parking requires a permit or per hour cost, depending on the location. Off campus hourly parking is street parking that is monitored by Denver Parking. Spots are generally easy to find, but you cannot stay there for too long most times"
College Senior,2,"You get what you pay for here too. There are a variety of different parking options, some are super expensive, others not so much. It's really hard to find off campus parking, mainly because the city of Denver enforces once you get off campus. "
College Senior,2,"It's fine, there are some really good options if you know how to work the system. Take advantage of Nagel! They have a lot of stuff there and it's the best food on campus. The food is definitely getting better, and they are really willing to work with you if you have restrictions. "
College Senior,2,"To a certain extent you get what you pay for. There are many different options, furnished apartments, not furnished apartments, cheap housing, expensive housing. I've done both cheap housing and average housing. You do get what you pay for, but the biggest challenge is just in furnishing. "
Graduate Student,1,Where profits come first and students come last. Especially during a pandemic. They have not lowered their tuition prices at all despite not having any on campus services. Their professors are lazy and do not contribute to their own classes. The administration will not care about any of your problems
Graduate Student,1,Where profits come first and students come last. Especially during a pandemic. They have not lowered their tuition prices at all despite not having any on campus services. Their professors are lazy and do not contribute to their own classes. The administration will not care about any of your problems
Junior,1,"I am months away from transferring out of this school, and I can't wait! This school is  just awful; how they justify the ludicrous tuition price with their shoddy academics and crime-ridden campus is beyond me. Other schools in Denver and Colorado have far superior academics and security for a 1/10th of the cost! Look into them instead of this garbage school!"
Graduate Student,1,"For Denver, DU has a pretty campus. And DU’s business and law are well regarded. However... after trying out three graduate level IT courses, I realized that DU is not the right option for me. The instruction (instructors) are absolutely terrible. For IT, do yourself a favor and use Udacity for online learning in IT. My review/rating is only based on their IT department."
Sophomore,1,"I'm very disappointed with the time I've spent here. The University of Denver is nothing more than a very expensive extension of high school. Substance abuse, cliques, and bullying are prevalent."
Sophomore,1,"I am an extrovert. Well, was. This school has turned me into a sad and lonely introvert due due to the exclusive nature, nasty student body, and lack of care by the university. I transferred, and the school pretty much throws you to the wind. Even kids who started in the fall of freshman year hate it. In class, you always see kids checking in on college transfer applications, cause they aren't planning on staying. I don't blame them. Try Boulder if you want a good college experience in colorado. I have nothing but nasty things to say about this garbage school. Retention rates and happiness are super low here. Greek life is a joke. Run and hide from DU."
College Freshman,1,I will ever live on Campus
College Freshman,1,I don't get involved non-activities
College Freshman,1,"DU is not a diverse college. White, white, white. Rich, rich, rich."
College Freshman,1,"No football team, and the sports that we do have get very little support"
College Freshman,1,"It's a rich kid school, so it's very homogeneous"
College Freshman,1,"DU is now known nationally for the sexual assault issues on campus. Administration describes it as ""forcible fondling"" which only makes light of the topic and is very inappropriate. They tell everyone to go everywhere in groups and to call campus security if you need a ride, but the second you call them, they threaten to breathalyze you and it just doesn't seem like a good option to most students. This is a serious issue on campus. There have also been many armed robberies on campus and other violence. I do not feel safe at all."
College Sophomore,1,"The faculty here are very much theory based and the experience they do have is very outdated, especially in Information Security."
College Junior,1,Lots of people get food poisoning from Sodexo.  My roommate was very ill from raw chicken.  Food options do not change and quality is poor.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Trying to receive aid is a pain - the financial aid office knows me, because I had to go fight with them so often."
College Sophomore,1,Three words: rich white kids. The international students are mainly from China and stick together. The campus does not feel diverse at all. I appreciate my classes at Iliff School of Theology much more because the diversity there is awesome.
College Freshman,1,"The campus housing here is awful as a freshman, the showers are cold, and the RA's are unreasonably strict, especially with quiet hours. They encourage communities and floor members to talk to one another but punish them for having extra curricular activities (took away a lounge TV, didn't let us put up pictures in the halls)"
College Sophomore,1,"As a GDI, Greek life at this school is overbearing.  It's more important to the students than their education.  Greek life at DU reinforces exclusivity and rivalries among students.  Also it costs a lot of money in addition to an already ridiculously expensive tuition.  Basically you pay to make friends."
College Freshman,1,"People drink and do drugs daily on campus, so much that the Chancellor had to have a talk with our freshman class because it was so obvious"
College Sophomore,1,Lots of violence on campus this year.
College Sophomore,1,Traffic with very little alternate options than cars. No campus safety rides
College Freshman,1,I hate the food and many others do as well. Might as well get the 50 meal plan and eat in your room
College Freshman,1,I really don't like DU. The quarter system is not that great and it's not the right place for me. Many people love it but just not me
College Freshman,1,They use detox as a scare tactic. Send people who are slightly inebriated to the prison's drunk tank.
College Freshman,1,"The overall planning of this university is quite lame. Because the structure is linear, people from point A will highly unlikely talk to people at point B. Communciation is faullty. Limited organizations. Transportation is minimal. "
College Senior,1,"We're in the middle of Colorado, so I think that the diversity probably fits with the state that we're in, but it's not huge in the long run. Diversity seems to be more focused on ethnicity rather than socioeconomic though. I would say that we have a lot of socioeconomic diversity, but not much racial/ ethnic diversity."
College Junior,1,"University College at University of Denver does not have any scholarships available to students.  The only option is to apply and be approved for FAFSA.  If you have utilized and exhausted all student loan options, there is no help at the University."
College Sophomore,1,"In some ways there's diversity in terms of international students. But there is little to no ethnic diversity, and people can tend to be pretty racist because of it. There's religious diversity but people are not very accepting or collaborative between religious groups, although some are more open than others"
College Sophomore,1,It is so hard to get financial aid here. And when you do it is not very much. The process is a hassel and not very clear. They do not help very much at all.
College Sophomore,1,not very good.  have to pay otherwise you can park on the street but you will most likely get a ticket
College Sophomore,1,"There are plenty of places to park at DU, but there are always two snags. 1) You can park next to almost any sidewalk, but it's only for an hour. Most students have one hour and fifty minute classes, so it's rare to ever use one of those spots. If you go over the hour, campus safety is incredibly punctual and tickets are in the area of $30-$50 for parking. 2) The parking garage/ paid parking lots are abundant, yes, but the cost is outrageous. A parking pass is upwards of $150. To me, that's a lot to just leave your car somewhere for the day, but I could very well just be naive. If you want to park in the lot and don't have a pass, then it costs 1.50 per hour and much like the hour parking on the sidewalks, campus safety is more than punctual in giving out parking tickets. Most days I have to plan to walk a ways after parking (if I find a spot that is) and it is an inconvenience being musician: I can't ride my bike in this cold with my instruments so I must drive and then either walk another distance or pay too much for a few hours of parking. I apologize for the rant like response, but parking has been a hassle lately."
College Freshman,1,"For me, DU is not the right school at all, so please don't let my review totally turn you off of it.  I am miserable at school and whenever I'm there I just want to leave.  I went to DU because it's the highest regarded college academically in the state, but it sure doesn't seem like that here.  Sure there are tons of good classes and the professors are all really great and passionate, but the students don't seem to care about academics one bit.  I know there are parties and stuff like that at any college, but at DU it seems if you aren't a partier, you're left out.  It doesn't seem like there's many types of people.  Almost everybody I know has a fake and goes out to the bars most nights to get completely trashed.  I know there are people who aren't like this, but it's sure hard to find them (although I do hear we have substance-free floors).  I mentioned the bars, and that's another thing I don't like about DU.  DU is a bar school, and if you don't have a fake, you're kind of screwed.  I wish it had more house parties.  Anyway, it seems like everybody here is rich and snobby, and it's difficult to find people who aren't.  The one thing I do like is class, because the professors are for the most part really awesome and passionate about their subject.  DU is the wrong school for me, but more because of the social stuff.  Maybe I just need to find the right people.  Colorado is beautiful and there is tons to do in Denver and up into the mountains.        "
College Freshman,1,"I lost 15 pounds my first month at DU.  Probably because the food is so gross I wouldn't eat it.  And since I don't have a kitchen, I can't make much that isn't as gross as the school food.  The only reason I didn't give it an F is because I like Jazzman's and Nagel.  And the drink selections are pretty good at the cafeterias."
College Freshman,1,"DU will try to say it's diverse, but it's hardly true.  You've got rich, snobby people who just want to spend all their time partying and getting really drunk and then you've got Asians.  Not much else.  There aren't many different 'groups' of people.  I am not a crazy partier and I struggle to find others that aren't.          As for like diverse in ethnicity, well as I said, there are a ton of white people and a bunch of Asians, not much else. "
College Freshman,1,"GROSS. My dorm had so many maintenance issues that I moved out. Towers is notably the worst dorm on campus, and the upperclassman dorms are better. Freshmen: go Johnson-MacFarlane. Upperclassmen: live off campus or in greek housing."
College Sophomore,1,Parking around campus is almost impossible. There are barely any spots and too many signs restricting parking. You have to be there extremely early to get a decent spot. Walking is almost preferable.
College Sophomore,1,University of Denver hates Greek Life. They kicked Beta to the curb and they plan on doing that to other houses as well. Not ethical about their dealings either
College Student,1,Not so great food – the food at denver it pretty terrible and it gets old after about the first month. they make you pay an absurd about for food that you often try and avoid eating 
College Freshman,1,Something needS to be done about the parking.  If you have a car on campus the parking permits are only for one year and one lot per charge.  The costs are hefty.  If you have a visitor or a car every so often street parking is available but only in one hour increments.  The ticket police are strict.  If you have class for two hours you HAVE to leave CLASS to move your car or you WILL GET A TICKET.
College Freshman,1,"In regards to involvement and participation, Greek life is fairly strong (B+). However, the University officials hate Greek Life and want them to be completely off campus. Recently, they kicked Beta out of their house (some say illegally), are trying to kick SAE out of their house, and have given the Sigma Chi chapter little options in their housing situation. The university does not care about its students, especially those in Greek Life. The university is a business and all it cares about is how to make the top dollar. It completely disregards ethics and tradition and uses its power to have its way. I have realized this and heard from several fraternities that this is the case and that is the whole reason why I am transferring. "

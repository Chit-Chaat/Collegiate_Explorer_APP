It was some of the hardest schooling I have ever done but my teachers were willing to work with me and help me succeed. That is what makes the difference. For the professors at Snow, teaching isn't just a job its a passion in their lives and they seek to help others every day. I gained a new gratitude for the work that they put in for me."
Sophomore,5,I love the student to staff ratio! I love being able to have a personal relationship with each of my professors at school.

Alum,5,"Fantastic 2-year college. Was able to get my general education classes taken care of, graduated with an AS, and really enjoyed the atmosphere of both the college and the town its in (Ephraim, UT). I really do wish that I could've graduated with my Bachelor's there as well, but they have no 4-year programs (as far as I know)."

Sophomore,5,"The environment, and overall feeling of Snow is something I will always cherish. Snow College has a very loving, tight knit, accepting community.

I like being able to get to know my professors and being able to talk to them on a one on one basis. All of the professors I’ve had in the past have been extremely friendly and understanding. There are quite a few different housing options on/near campus and they all seem to be very nice! The campus is very easy to navigate and classrooms are easy to find within facilities. The student center is extremely nice and helpful. I’ve went to them numerous times for help and they’ve always provided an answer for whatever I needed. Overall, this is an amazing college (for an amazing price, if I might add) and I would gladly recommend others to attend!"

Freshman,5,So far I have had a really positive experience here a Snow College. I've had lots of help from the Academic Advisors to help me with school schedules. I have also had lots of positive results from professors and are willing to take their time to help us with our struggles. One professor I talked with helped me know what classes to take next semester and what he would recommend.
Freshman,5,"Snow College is an amazing college filled with about six hundred students which makes all the classes exceptionally small for a college and classes more one on one.  My first day here I was trying to find what buildings my classes would be in and I could find them fairly easily and got help from anyone that was walking by (or even driving by) which was extremely helpful.  I had one car stop in the middle of the road and help me with directions just because I looked lost. 
Since Snow College is such a small campus, it is really nice because I can have a one on one relationship with my professors.  I mean, my English class that is required for the general education has only 22 people in it counting me. 
I have had quite the experience here at snow and have only been here for about a month.  I am so glad I found this school and would recommend it to anyone trying to get a start on a higher education."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy snow college because it's small and the music program is amazing. They really do focus on making us better musicians and I like that I can get personal help from them.

In fact snow college is the best school for every student looking for a better life regardless of your background."

It's not that expensive and you still get all the first year learning from a four year college. I really enjoy the small class room sizes. If I ever needed to reach out to my professor after class hours, they were always available. Snow college even had good prices on campus lunches, which was always the best. Snow college has been the best first year college for me."
Alum,5,"Snow College is in a quaint little town. Because of this, everything is close and the campus atmosphere is tight and fun. I loved my time here."
Sophomore,5,I have attended one year at Snow College and have loved my experience. My classes are small and my professors know me by name. They were challenging and are helping me obtained my degree to work in radiology.
Alum,5,"I graduated from Snow College in May of 2019. Going to Snow was honestly one of the best choices I have ever made. The class sizes are generally pretty small. So, you are able to have a relationship with your professors. Professors get to know your name. Most professors are genuinely concerned about your experience at Snow and want to see you succeed and will help you to do so. If you are looking for a party school, in my experience Snow isn't the best school for you. However, the school has many activities on campus for students to get involved in. The area around Snow doesn't have much to do, you kind of have to make your own fun. However you are close to the mountains and are able to do outdoor activities."
Freshman,5,Snow college is an excellent school. The campus is really nice and they have an awesome student life. They are a really welcoming school and offer many different classes.
Niche User,5,It was amazing hospitality when I went there with a youth group. I would totally go again if I were younger.
Junior,5,Snow College is a great place for first-time college students and everything is close together so no car is really needed. The hardest part is getting groceries from Walmart which is a ways down the road and if you don't have a car the walk to and from with groceries can be a bit strenuous. All the professors I had were chill and super kind. The class sizes are also small and allow for friends to be made as well as a deeper discussion and better learning environment.
Sophomore,5,"Small-town atmosphere, small-class size is what you will get if attending Snow College.  My first-year experience was amazing!  I was An ambassador and was able to meet some incredible people and get involved in a lot of activities!  Being away from home for the first time is very scary, at Snow the town is very small so it makes you feel at ease and safe.   They offer affordable tuition, housing and great opportunities for transfer scholarships!  Come join in on the fun at Snow College!"
Alum,5,"I loved how the classes are smaller so you really get to know the professors and get their help. They are always willing to help you and have office hours you can go in for. Some professors even give out their personal number, so if you are stuck or sick you can talk to them or text. It is such a fun atmosphere and you get to know a lot of people. Everyone knows everyone. Everything is within 15 minute walking distance, even the farthest apartments and you'll still make it on time."

Niche User,5,Small town and super friendly! Love the area.... Lots of programs and facilities and small class sizes.
Freshman,5,I really liked how fast and easy school was here. It is really small campus and is very easy to make friends here.
Junior,4,"Professors are here really good at online teaching. When schools got shut down due to coronavirus, they did a good job. I was able to connect them through Webex whenever questions popped up in my had and I got the best explanation from the professors."
Sophomore,4,"It was a first for me. The sudden change of classroom work took some transitions the Professors had to get use to, but managed well enough for our classes to effectively continue an do work."
Sophomore,4,Teachers did really well at not overloading us with homework once we had to strictly go online with the corona virus. I just don't enjoy doing school online. I love the in person face-to-face learning at Snow College.
Sophomore,4,"Even though the quarantine made it very confusing for a while, Snow College transitioned me smoothly from an in-person classroom to an online class. I think it helped the most that counselors checked in on us periodically."
Sophomore,4,"During the COVID-19 experience, I had the unique opportunity to experience online schooling. I found that it was a little difficult at first but my professors were very kind and understandable so they adjusted their criteria to help us all be able to succeed in their course."
Niche User,4,"I am a very shy and anxious type of student and I've never been great at making friends. However, when I attended classes for even just a few days, I found it very easy to get along with the other students. The professors there are fantastic as well. And since I wasn't great at making friends, I was always able to bond and connect with the professors I had. The small class sizes made it very easy to be more one on one with them and get the help I needed with subjects I struggled with. I also became very close with my counselors. They were great and were always so willing to listen and help with anything I needed."
Niche User,4,I have had a very good experience with snow college. I love that the classes are small so you are able to build a relationship with your professors. The campus is nice and clean. Fun activities are provided to help you meet new people and get involved. it is overall a great school.
Freshman,4,It’s a good college in a VERY very small town. Academics are good. Many events are organized during the semester. But don’t expect to have parties every weekend.
Freshman,4,I love the class size here! The proffessors that I have had take the time to get to know you and care about your success.
Niche User,4,I am still a high school student but have been taking college courses and receiving credits. It has been so nice to be able to get a head start before I actually leave for college. The way that its programs are set up are made for students to be able to succeed and progress. I absolutely love Snow and I can't wait to start there next fall!
Sophomore,4,"Snow College is a really great place to get started. Its located in a small town so nothing is very busy and for those who are uncomfortable with a lot all at once, its nice to start somewhere small to get into the flow of things. Snow college is very diverse in its categories and can get anyone started in almost any degree. I had tried out for the art program, which I believe needs a little work. I was lead to believe the art taught there would help me get into working with Dream Works but it wasn't what I was looking for. I think communication with the professors is very important and it is very important in finding the right counselor to talk to. Snow does not have have specific counselors for some of their specific degrees, therefore it is better to contact the professors who are part of the program, because they know more about it. Overall my experience was good, the professors were easy to work with and very kind."
Alum,4,My experience was great I had a lot of fun and the teachers we very helpful. Also it’s a small campus so it is to get around. It also has small class sizes which allows for more one on. On time with the teachers. Also the price is awesome.
Senior,4,The Art faculty is great however the school is bad a communication with the students. one on one relationships with teachers is great though
Niche User,4,I am taking many classes from the Snow Campus while I am still a senior in high school. I am so glad that they offer this program because it gives me a head start on my education. These classes will put me ahead when I go to the actual campus after I graduate! The staff is always super helpful and the teachers have helped me so much. Highly recommend for a 2 year school.
Niche User,4,I love how nice everyone is. Every time I've gone on Campus or talked to an Ambassador they are always super nice and helpful.
Freshman,4,I liked the small class sizes. My teachers were all really nice and I liked the town. Snow College was amazing. My teachers were all really understanding when I got sick or had a migraine.
Sophomore,4,"I really love the class sizes and the teachers were all super great. The only reason I wouldn't give it a five is because Ephraim, Utah is not the most exciting location, and I was often bored on the weekends. However, the student council did a great job of always having fun activities."
Freshman,4,"Snow College is a community friendly college that is geared towards student success. The professors are amazing educators, and the fees are significantly less than other schools. Overall it has been a personal, affordable and exciting opportunity to further my education."
Junior,4,"The program I'm in is really fantastic (music). The faculty and professors are all super great and helpful, even though there are always the few annoying or boring ones. One downside is the fact that the on campus housing isn't great. All but 2 of the housing buildings are not disability/wheelchair accessible, and one is reserved for fine arts students and the other will not allow pets or animals of any kind due to the way the air vents are or something? So if someone who needs the disability access ramps also needs a service animal for any reason, it's an issue. Plus also the housing just isn't really great in general, ADA stuff aside."
Alum,4,"Snow college is an affordable college! The class sizes are small and the professors know you by name! It is a very great college to adjust to being out of the house, and figuring out what you want to do!"
Sophomore,4,"I love that the class sizes are small. The campus is great and it is right by some gorgeous mountains with some awesome trails and campgrounds. It is hard to find a job, unless you want to work at McDonald's, and the on-campus housing is a little too expensive for what you get. But other than that, it is awesome"
Freshman,4,"The professors were very nice and helpful. However, I did find that Some classes were boring with tedious work."
Alum,4,"Great college! Teachers are very understanding, tuition is low, and if you've never been to a small town, now's your chance! Of course, I can't give a full five stars because of a crazy roommate incident & the college's response (still don't know why restraining orders and criminal convictions don't get you kicked out of at least on-campus housing). Still, pretty great school!"
Niche User,4,"I'm currently enrolled as a concurrent enrollment student, so I take classes at my high school. It is very flexible and the teachers are easy to reach!"
Sophomore,4,"I have absolutely loved my experience here. The small classes are my favorite along with how caring and personal the teachers are. This school has lots of school spirit, and has amazing sportsmanship. There is a pretty good amount of diversity. They have good class choices and great staff. There is also amazing sources and people to go to for support."
Freshman,4,I love how small it is.  It makes it a lot more personal and easier to get help from my professors.  It also makes it easier to make friends and have kids to study with and recognize familiar faces everywhere I go.
Freshman,4,My first semester was really good. I had no idea what I was getting into and what to do. But everyone was so nice and helped me out.
Freshman,4,I am at the Richfield Campus and my experience there is great! Although I do wish they offered more courses of different types.
Alum,4,"Overall, Snow College is a great two-year school. The majority of the professors are good, a good portion of them are great, and only a few of them are duds. The campus is safe and friendly; its small size allows a lot of familiarity with peers and professors alike. Professors are usually able and happy to give students one-on-one attention. In terms of music, art, and clubs, Snow provides plenty of engaging student life. A great school for anyone looking to make the transition from high school to college a smooth one."
Sophomore,4,"Snow College is very personal. The professors are extremely awesome and work very well with the students to help them get the experience and grade that they want. Because of the small town, you get to know lots of people and can recognize people all across campus. I absolutely love Snow College and would tell anyone to go here! (Plus it's affordable!)"
Junior,4,"I've enjoyed my 2 semesters at Snow College. I enjoy the small town feel, the small class sizes and personalized instruction. The environment is great for young, single students looking for an affordable way to complete their generals."
Freshman,4,"Snow College itself is a great school, they strive to keep students involved and provide many resources for students to receive help in classes. All of the professors that I have had have been very understanding a know your names, which is very nice and makes everyone feel included. There's never been a professor I felt I couldn't talk to because they are all very friendly and just hope for you to succeed. There are some things that are make living here not as great, in my 2 semesters here I've found that I really enjoy the school and all my classes, but a social life doesn't really exist. Ephraim is a small town and there aren't a lot of things to do around the town, it's a lot of game and movie nights, which get boring pretty quick. Overall, the college institution itself here is very well run with lots of student input, I have thoroughly enjoyed my classes here. Professors and staff are very focused on success for students and it makes all the difference."
Sophomore,4,"Snow College is a great place to start if you aren't really sure what you want to do. It's affordable, friendly, and very student-oriented. It's in a small town which can be a drag sometimes, but is a close to many camping, shotgun shooting, and hiking trails."
Sophomore,4,Snow College is a great first step into moving forward in life even when you are not sure what you want to do. Class sizes are small which allowes you to learn more by exploring and having access to your professors.
Sophomore,4,Love the small class sizes! The student body advocates are always making plans and try to have free food for students as much as possible. It seems like there is always some activity to go to.
Freshman,4,"From my experience, Snow College is a good school, they have good professors that genuinely care about the students. In addition, they have good programs and provide opportunities for the students to talk to 4 year universities."
Freshman,4,while attending snow college i had a good time. coming from a small town this jr college was perfect for my first year of college. i didnt likd the campus too much and would like to see it become a little more nice
Sophomore,4,I feel like my department truly cared about me. I am a theatre major and all my professors know me by name and everything I can and can't do and how to push me. My only complaint about the school is that the don't treat theatre as well as they do the other department. But I love it here and all the friends I have made. I have learned so much. Because this is a smaller school there are so many more opportunities especially for the majors. You can walk everywhere and save a lot of money on gas which is amazing because of how freaking expensive gas is. If anyone is looking into colleges I implore you to check out snow.
Freshman,4,"I love the experience here at Snow College. It is a smaller campus which makes the classes easier to get to. The people are very friendly, the view of the mountains is amazing, and the classes are challenging at yet easy at the same time. Since the professors here have less students, they care more about the students, and you get a much more personalized touch when it comes to your education."
Freshman,4,I really like how small the classes are and how easy it is to communicate with my professors. What would help Snow be better is for more job opportunities.
Freshman,4,"Snow College is in a small town in Ephraim, Utah, where it has only one traffic light. My first week of school, a herd of sheep walked down the street past campus-it was hilarious. I spoke to and met with the president of Snow College, and asked him why students from Snow College after graduating went into BYU and other prestigious universities, to become very successful people in their careers. He said it was because of the teachers. ""We have an amazing faculty and fantastic professors."" He also said the small class sizes(ranging from 20-36 students) also allowed students to get one-on-one help from the professor, which is rare in any other college. Students and teachers at Snow College work hard, learn well, and go on into their dream careers 70% of the time."
Sophomore,4,"Snow College is a great way to start off your college career as it is a smaller, two year college. The class sizes are just like in high school, about 20 to 30 students per class. This school has amazing faculty who are willing to help you work towards your goal. From professors who make themselves readily available to the recourse centers across campus, getting the grades you want is achievable! The clubs are super diverse, and there is plenty to do on campus!"
Freshman,4,"I have had a great experience here at Snow, the community is friendly and small. The Campus itself is compact enough that I don’t need a car, which I really like. Each of my professors know me by name and are willing to take time to help me outside of class to help me. There are lots of clubs and events offered here so that helps me stay busy."
Niche User,4,"I really had a fantastic time! Small class sizes, you really get to know your professors IF you want to, its easy to make friends in classes and therefore have study buddies, and GREAT advisement staff! Snow College was far better than I anticipated and would recommend it to anyone!"
Graduate Student,4,"Snow college is a great school. The professors are very knowledgable and come from diverse backgrounds. The small class sizes promote more one on one learning. I always felt comfortable talking to my teachers and didnt feel like just a number. You really get the sense that educational success is valued and encouraged here. It is a small, mormon town so not much nightlife but great if you want to focus on study."
Sophomore,4,"Snow college is a growing school. It may not be the most diverse, but it's a great school that helps you transition from high school. The professors and the staff are amazing."
Sophomore,4,"Snow College is a top rate institution with amazing teachers who are passionate about their subjects. The campus is beautiful, and kept well maintained. The only thing that that prevents me from giving it the full 5 stars, is that Ephraim is a very small town and there isn't always a ton to do on the weekends. However if you're willing to be a bit creative it's still a fun place to live and get a quality education for a really nice price."
Sophomore,4,"Small campus feel, small class size, caring teachers, one-on-one help, free essay help services, great activities, tons of hikes."
Sophomore,4,"I liked the small class environment, it helped me get the attention and help I need from my. professors.
I also really appreciate how easily credits transfer from Snow College"
Freshman,4,"As a freshman coming into snow college I did not know what this experience would be like. As I have attended this school I can say it has exceeded my expectations. Here at Snow College you can find a friend anywhere you go! I have learned many valuable things since attending here, most which will help me in the future. I have learned how to be an effective student, a friends to anyone, and I've learned how to solve problems effectively. Snow College is the place to be!"
Freshman,4,"Snow College has a great campus, classes, and proffessors. The campus is small and easily laid out. Most on and off housing is within five minutes of walking. The classes have many opportunities into protential career choices. Whether your looking for fun classes or classes for your major Snow College has it all. The class sizes are small, which gives a better one on one with the proffessors. Snow College has so far been amazing."
Alum,4,Great College whiling to work with you and the class sizes are small! Teachers are very helpful and know the names of their students.
Niche User,4,"I recently went up to Snow College for one of their popular Snow Blasts and i must say that i loved it their. I have never met a group of ambassadors who were honest, and didn't try to recruit me for their benefit. All of my questions were answered. I would definitely come here."
Freshman,4,"Many extended members of my family have attended this small, unique school known as Snow College. I decided that I would take a few classes from this school as well, since I had heard so much about it! Applying to this college is blissfully simple! The ladies working in the school offices are very friendly and ready to help you whenever you need it. After I signed up, I took a few generals courses this past fall semester, and seemed to do well. The teachers were involved with caring to their many students needs! What a great school, I highly recommend attending Snow College. "
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed the actual school, Snow college is great! The teacher are all very personable and willing to help, the campus is easy to find your way around. Snow is small, which is a very good way to excel in classes because the teaches actually have time to talk and help you out. The only part that I really disliked is the actual town of Ephraim. It is small, very small. There is nothing to do and there is nowhere to work. Living here is quite hard especially if you need a job in college or like to go out and do things. But, overall I would recommend Snow College to anyone who is looking to have a great college experience without the ginormous college campus. "
Freshman,4,"I love the small town feel of the area. Campus is two city blocks that are connected. The teachers are kind, helpful and don't mind staying after to help you out. There are plenty of club that cover everything from Pokemon Go to a gardening  club. If I could change something, I would add more things to do in the town."
College Junior,4,"The career center at my school is basically just a physical extension to what the workers have put online. The employees do, in fact, do extra things there, like help revising and advise students. There are many jobs for students that are easy to find, and even more on the career center website. They really make it quite easy."
College Junior,4,"There are resources in place such that, for some of the students can have an internship before they graduate with their associate's degree and have a career at that workplace immediately after. Students are informed of the school's employment services and searching, and the people of the career center are quite nice and willing to help with revising resumes, cover letters, etc."
College Junior,4,"The only thing I've found somewhat lacking is entertainment and places to go when homework is done and the week is slow. We do, however, have a school library with many books, CDs, and movies, as well as a gym/pool/sports building.

The people here are friendly, students and professors alike. The classes are small, perhaps averaging thirty or forty students."
College Sophomore,4,The small class size makes getting help easy!
Sophomore,2,"I feel like the student life and the campus involvement was great. Academically I found the math department to be heavily lacking, in the professors I had and the math lab and tutors. But I also had some fantastic professors, especially Jeff Wallace! I took as many classes from him as possible because not only was he an excellent teacher, he as taught the course material as well as a whole lot of good stuff for life and personal success."
Recent Alumnus,2,Snow College is great for helping you to prepare to get into another school that offers your program. There are now many opportunities to get a degree at snow college. The most common degrees there are associate degrees. After receiving your Associates degree you are able to to transfer to receive higher education.
College Senior,2,The english department at Snow College could be better. I am just working on my generals right now and it wasn't until recently I wanted to go into English but it was not because of my professors. The English department is very lacking at Snow.
College Freshman,2,The online courses are pretty brutal. The workload can be horrible if you have to redo lessons constantly for lack of understanding. The professor acts more as a tutor during class walking around.
College Senior,2,"I don't know anything about the alumni network, and there aren't a lot of jobs around Ephraim."
College Senior,2,I don't have any job or internship opportunities because Ephraim is a small town and there aren't a lot of places for me to get involved with nutrition and dietetics.
College Freshman,2,"I came here for the orchestra program expecting a Juilliard partnership- which was lost the summer before I came- many musical opportunities to perform/gain musical experience, and a higher level of expectation of the students participating in the program. I was highly disappointed when none of these expectations were met. My high school's entire music program was held to a higher standard than Snow's orchestra program, and I received numerous more performance and other musical opportunities there than I do here. The program is okay. But, it's not at all what I was told it would be."
College Freshman,2,It's just such a small school that there isn't a lot of variety
College Freshman,2,I just hate online classes because they are hard to keep track of
College Junior,2,It's a tiny campus so there isn't a lot to do with internship and alumni things.
College Freshman,2,There aren't many opportunities with the school being as small as it is.
College Freshman,2,It has some classes that correspond to my major but don't actually offer my major.
College Freshman,2,"They dont really care, they are just there to be friendly."
College Junior,2,I have not chosen a major yet. 
College Sophomore,2,"I'm going to be very honest. The student body at Snow really isn't diverse at all, nor do I find the majority of them to be very culturally aware. The majority of the students come from very conservative, very LDS, very homogeneously white culture. Which, let's face it, it the majority of Utah. While this is all fine, I feel like the lack of diversity has caused lot's of problems with ethnocentrism, gender rolls, and heteronormitivity.  There needs to be a balance. This is to no fault of the schools, but rather just the way things happen.  I, myself, have felt uncomfortable in many situations at Snow because of the mentality of the students I find here.  And while there are a good amount of students of different creeds, races, religion, and sexuality, I feel as though there is a disconnect with these students and the rest of the student body. Many of the students of color, for example, are either from out-of-state, or exchange students. Every so-often I will see students stepping out of these boundaries, which is fantastic. Luckily, the school itself is very supportive of it's minority students. There are many programs and resources available to them. For example, I was glad to find that so many of the faculty at Snow were queer allies. That meant a lot to me, and made me feel safer as a student."
College Senior,2,"What Career Center? As Snow College is only a 2-year college, it focuses on helping students prepare to transfer to a 4-year college after earning an Associate's Degree. That, combined with the rural setting, means that their focus is on preparing students for further education rather than establishing a career."
College Sophomore,2,"Foreign Language Failure!! I attend a branch off of Snow College in Richfield a nearby town. And to receive my Associates of Arts I am supposed to take a foreign language, but I can't do that with out traveling an extra hour a day to get to the main campus because they don't offer it at Snow in Richfield. Whenever I ask someone about it they say that not enough students need it. If they're going to require something they need to provide an opportunity to get the credit! It has made life frusterating because I won't be able to complete my degree at Snow before transferring."
Recent Alumnus,2,No Idea – I haven't heard anything from the school about after graduation.  No career center or job help.
College Junior,2,"Teacher MIA – I have enjoyed class but only when the teacher was there, about 45% of the time in a full spring semester schedule."
College Sophomore,2,"Im Lost – I want to major in special education, I have never really got a direct anwser if I can graduate with that. They have an education program but every time I ask I do not really understand what they are trying to tell me so I am hesitant to tell people what I am majoring in because I have no idea if I can major in special education at snow."
Freshman,1,"Snow college has a very cold and bitter environment. People are closed off and not friendly. The teachers and other faculty are terrible to work with. Plus, there is nothing to do down there in ephraim. Do yourself a favor and don’t waste your money or time here..."
Junior,1,"If you want to spend thousands of dollars getting a college education from teachers who couldn't care less about students, experience a social scene that is completely void of meaningful relationships, and deal with a staff that doesn't take the cares and concerns of students seriously this might be the college for you. I'm currently set to graduate in fall of 18, however, based on the experience I've had thus far I would seriously discourage students from starting their college experience at Snow."
College Freshman,1,There is only one geology professor. She is great but there aren't many geology classes available as a result. I am one of three geology majors right now and I just wish there was more diversity.
College Sophomore,1,"This is my first semester at Snow College and I have really enjoyed it so far.  The classes I have and the times I have them are perfect and everything I need.  I live on campus and it takes less then 5 minutes to get to each of my classes.   The only thing I have had a frustration with is that it took quite a bit of times for them to receive my grant money, so I had to pay a fee because my tuition was late."
College Junior,1,I have been trying to work with the financial aid office to get financial aid but every time I go in they give me more paperwork or things I have to do first and I never actually got finished in the process. Now i'm halfway through the semester trying to figure out how to pay for school because I never heard back about getting financial aid. It's frustrating. 
College Freshman,1,"It Is a Very Small Town – Due to the fact that Ephraim is a college town, jobs are very limited."
College Junior,1,Teacher/Student Communication – No communication from reader to student after student emails teacher about assignments or tests or even class schedule.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Horrible Services Provided – Its really hard to get any real help there. The only people that can really help to any sort of advantage is the Student Support Services, but you have to be either one of three things to apply into their program. So its mostly up to you to figure out your future. But there are classes you can take that focus on those things, so I guess its okay."
College Sophomore,1,"I registered for online classes in the summer of 2010. Doing this was not the best decisions I have ever made. It is extremely hard to complete the work required for online classes when you do not have a set time that you have to go to class. Also, it is harder to communicate with the professors because everything has to be done online (which always causes a delay in response time); it is much easier to resolve problems and questions when you are able to talk to a professor face to face. I highly recommend using caution when considering registering for online classes. Online classes are hard to find the motivation to do (and this comes from someone who absolutely loves learning and receives great grades)."

Niche User,5,"Very nice, small school from what I've seen so far. Has exactly what I wanted for a major and also has great staff and clubs"
Junior,5,"I love this college. The classes are small and there are more professors than students. There are a bunch of activities, events and clubs to get involved in on campus. The students here get along with each other and are from different schools and states. When I first came to Villa Maria College, I made friends very quickly. I feel right at home when I come here. I also feel that I am part of a family at this college."
Freshman,5,The relationships between students and or the staff has been the most rewarding part of my college experience thus far.
Junior,5,"A lot of people will tell you their experience with Villa Maria college wasnâ€™t all that great. I can tell you Villa is where I met the most wonderful friends I know I will have forever. Between going down to the cafeteria during campus hour when no one has a class and the students gather in the cafeteria for Kareoke, free coffee,  free pastries and cookies. My whole group of friends and I would sit at a table which always had an overflow of mutual friends so we would sit at two or three separate tables. But we would all still talk to each other and talk about the funniest stuff and we would talk about all hanging out and plan game nights where the whole friend group was invited to have a bon fire and play games, no drinking or doing drugs. Just simple innocent friendship I had always yearned for."
Junior,5,A really great small college. The professors and staff are very nice and help you get connections. They also offer work study and the student success center~ free tutoring.
Sophomore,5,"All of my professor's are so sweet and very helpful. They are also very easy to approach with certain concerns or questions I may have had. I would recommend Villa Maria College to any of my friends looking to go into the art field. I have learned so much in just one year of attending Villa. I am using what I have learned so far, in my everyday life now!"
Junior,5,this is a comfortable and great environment. the staff and teachers and advisors are great people that will keep you confident and focused. i honestly wish they had master degree programs because this is a school that i will forever miss once i get my bachelor degree in psychology.
Freshman,5,"It's a nice, small school where the teachers are always available to help if you need it. There are a lot of opportunities and clubs, my only real complaint is no on campus housing. They have a lot of deals with Collegiate Village (a local dorm community) and I was able to get a $1,500 scholarship just for dorming at CV (and the facilities are excellent! Internet, cable, heat, everything but electric is included in the rent, as well as a gym, pool, ganeroom, and Cafe are there). I love the teachers, I love the small school feel, my only real complaint is that some students don't realize what kind of opportunity they have starting college at 18, but that's not in the school. Overall, would recommend to art students especially! I'm going for psych with the goal of being an art therapist."
Junior,5,"Villa offers a very nice student to teacher ratio with it being such a small school, this allows teachers to give students that one on one they need to better their education."
College Sophomore,5,The class sizes are very small so professors can give you their undivided attention. The professors are very passionate about their work and are always willing to help. The students are also very friendly and we all get along great.
College Sophomore,5,It's a very small school so the faculty can give you their undivided attention. They're very passionate about seeing their students succeed and there's plenty of resources available right here on campus. There's no other place like it!
College Freshman,5,I have a part time job in addition to going to school full time. I didn't want to have to change my availability to much at work because I knew my boss wouldn't be very happy so when I sat down with my advisor to register for classes we took some time to ensure that my school schedule would work with my work schedule and everything worked out!
Recent Alumnus,5,"I love small class sizes and I was given that. Even in the classes that were bigger than about 12 students, I was still comfortable. I love knowing that I can graduate with my Bachelors in Graphic Design and a Fine Arts Concentration with the classes I need being offered often."
College Freshman,5,"Transferring credits was super easy. The school took care of that for me, all I had to do is sign off on them."
College Sophomore,5,"I love how small the school is, from the campus to the class sizes.  The school is really focused on each of us as individuals.  Everyone is extremely friendly and we are all treated with respect.  All the students know how to have a good time and have fun especially during campus hour.  I don't think I would have had this experience at any other college and I am so grateful I picked Villa."
College Sophomore,5,Very affordable. The amount of experience and quality found here is so amazing. The FA faculty are very kind and super helpful.
College Sophomore,5,Professors are awesome. Class registration is super easy and smooth.
College Sophomore,5,"The Animation department at Villa Maria is a total blast. Amazing teachers with great work ethics and passion for their subjects, great facilities to work in, challenging and inspiring class assignments."
College Sophomore,5,"The best student body I have ever had the pleasure of being a member in. I love all my classmates. We study hard and play hard. We encourage each other and challenge one another to do our very best. When one of us has a down day, the rest of us are ready to rally together and help each other through it."
College Sophomore,5,The student body at Villa Maria is amazing. We are not caught up in silly segregations based on popularity or hobbies. Everyone gets along for the most part and we are like a giant family. The atmosphere is very welcoming and warm.
Junior,4,Small classroom size.  Wonderful staff .  Very understanding.   Love the bookstore.  Tuition about average.
Junior,4,"I like Villa Maria College for the most part. The graphic design program that I am in is the best in the area, if not Western New York. I am very lucky to be a part of the graphic design community and know that my professors want me to succeed and are very helpful when it comes to critiques and projects. Downsides to my college, there are no dorms or housing so if you do not live in the area, you are forced to pay an outrageous amount of money to live off campus. There is a limited supply of food for our dining hall and it closes at I believe 2 which is not very helpful if you have night classes. I want to see the college expand more, ESPECIALLY in the dining hall area, athletics, and student life as I feel like we are not involved with the community unlike other schools in the area."
Sophomore,4,"Rated four out of five for friendliness of the staff and their willingness to help students in need. However, the area itself the college is located is a bit rough."
Freshman,4,"Villa is a very small school with a lot to offer. It's very community-oriented, and the staff is very helpful to new students."
Junior,4,"I am still at villa maria college and experiencing many things that i will remeber for a long time. I feel that the things ive experienced at villa have made me a better person. I have learned so much about myself and what my weaknesses are, my strengths ,my likes ,dislikes , wants and needs while im attending school. The knowledge i have learned so far amazes me because of all the help and technology that is provided for me to succeed my career. The professors are great and are always willing to help with anything im having trouble with. I highly recomend this school ,the technology,staff and resources they have are great and reliable."
Freshman,4,"It's great! A great look, happy people! A very clean environment. Easy to get around, very self explanatory."
Sophomore,4,Villa is a great place that offers an awesome learning experience. Villa allows you to be yourself in its diverse environment.
Senior,4,"Attending Villa Maria College has been such an incredible experience.  Classes are incredibly hands-on, and the professors provide us with stories of their real-world experiences in the field to give us just another taste of what we will be expecting once we graduate. 
The faculty and staff go above and beyond to help students with anything and everything needed, whether it's clarification on assignments, tutoring, working with personal issues, etc.  If there is something you need, there is someone around that can help. 
Another amazing quality of the school are the small class sizes. Students aren't just a number in a classroom, and there are plenty of opportunities for one-on-one interaction with the professor. 
We're all a family at the college.  Throughout my years here I have made a large yet very close-knit group of amazing friends, and it just keeps growing!"
Freshman,4,"My experience at Villa Maria college is going great so far. I am able to maintain good grades and gained good relationships with my professors. I would recommend that high school graduates attend Villa Maria College because this college pushes students to do and be better. My first semester ,which was fall 2016 my professors helped me and guide me to success. I ended my fall semester with a 3.6 GPA. When I started college I thought it was gone be difficult but Villa Maria made it easier for me. Now I'm in my second semester spring 2017 and I'm am hoping to gain scholarships because this could help me with the financial struggles I have in college."
College Sophomore,4,I'm not actually sure about the post-grad services because I'm only a freshman but the career center is very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,The career services center is always looking out for out for new job and internship opportunities. They are always keeping students up to date on them.
College Sophomore,4,"The animation faculty actually have real world experience in the industry and they teach you those skills. The work load can be a bit much at times, especially during finals week, but it's worth it in the end."
College Sophomore,4,We actually have a lot of connections and opportunities at this school.
College Sophomore,4,I love the people here.
College Freshman,4,"Since the class size are smaller than other Universities, Professors get to know you more on a personal level which I think is great. They are very friendly and will definitely help with any problem you have even if it isn't related to that course."
College Freshman,4,This school is very into Internships and Service Learning. It is required that by the time you graduate you have completed two internship opportunities and there are numerous sites to choose from and the advisors to help with the process are great.
College Freshman,4,So far I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Villa Maria College. The Small classes allows the professors to get to know you as a person and not as a number. The entire faculty and staff are very caring and friendly. The environment itself is overall warm and welcoming. Also the foundation and history that the college is based on is taught and I believe that is very important.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I've heard some really great things about the internship program. I think a degree from Villa means a great deal if you know the President of the College and the countless sisters that put so much work not only into making sure we get a great education, but find ways to support the community around them."
Recent Alumnus,4,I have already been through countless art classes as a middle school and high school student and then graphic classes during my two years at a community college so there hasn't been too much new for me till this current semester but the elective classes I have taken have really given me a lot of new knowledge that will be applicable to my world experiences as an adult.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I really feel that Villa fits my needs as a student. I have had teachers that really know what they're talking about and positive classroom experiences. The staff are super helpful and I've had the best experiences with them, especially my transfer counselor. He put me on the right path from the very beginning. I think the school really gives you a chance to become an adult because they won't hold your hand through anything. They tell you what you need to do, and then expect you to go do it. Like any other college, if you do your work and do the best you can, you will succeed."
College Sophomore,4,The staff really care about what you do and try to help you with anything you need help with- you just have to seek out the help.
College Freshman,4,I've learned stuff I already know for my major. It was only the introduction class though so hopefully it will pick up with future classes. I'm a Graphic Design student.
College Freshman,4,"The staff cares about you, you're not just a number. They come to you and offer help when you don't always want to ask. The class sizes are small and easy to get on contact with the professor. They give personal phone numbers and emails if there are any questions on the homework."
College Sophomore,4,"I believe my school is pretty good because the classes are decently small which is great for concentrating. The school also has plenty of activities to do for example the honor students come up with little parties for everyone to come and enjoy, plus free food. The teachers even take the time to come along and help you with whatever you need and they are always available. The students are also very helpful they are very open to show you new things and that is some way to make new friends."
College Sophomore,4,The resources on campus are great. Everyone works together to keep the college neat and tidy. We have recycling bins scattered throughout the campus to help reduce our waste output and encourage green lifestyles.
College Sophomore,4,"If ever the computers don't work, Tech services are almost instantly on the job to fix it."
College Freshman,4,Thus far I am very happy with this school.
College Freshman,4,"The equipment they supply for graphics majors is excellent, and I feel like I am receiving valuable skills from people who know the profession very well. Workload is fair considering projects and such."
College Freshman,4,"For a private college, $16,000 yearly tuition isn't too bad. Overall after fees and such, my yearly cost was closer to $22k, but I didn't have to pay for anything but some supplies out of pocket thanks to scholarships and aid. When I was struggling with making ends meet, the Financial Aid office here gave me a $4,000 bump for academic excellence to help me cover my entire cost and still have money left over for books & supplies."
College Freshman,4,The bookstore workers are extremely helpful from the beginning of the semester straight thru the end. You also can call any department personnel you may need assistance with and they are always very helpful.
College Freshman,4,The flexibilty and convenience is very appropiate. My scheduling is done to fit my lifestyle and personality.
College Freshman,4,The students are their for each other and the atmosphere is not stressful.
College Freshman,4,The financial aid department and personnel are very helpful. The tuition is high but it is a smaller college with more one on one which is to my liking.
College Freshman,4,I believe the college assists in finding employment in your field of study
College Freshman,4,"My school resources are very beneficial, cafeteria, restrooms, gym, "
College Freshman,4,My experience at  my school has been outstanding.
College Freshman,4,My specific major is awesome and its great to be in that major learning.
College Freshman,4,"My school offers great majors, and most students are very satisfied, and pleased at the process to get accepted into my school."
College Freshman,4,"Going to my school gives me hope, it keeps me sain. I love my school I like learning there I like the food, lounging areas, the activites, and the openess of the people there."
College Sophomore,4,"Computer labs are good, wireless access very good, library is good"
College Sophomore,2,"No flexibility, courses only have two time options such as Monday/Wednesday or Tuesday/Thursday or only one time option such as Tuesday/Thursday"
College Sophomore,2,"The aspects of the classes are fine, it's that some of the teachers don't provide any helpful critic/knowledge to help further a student's skill level, or they're just plain rude, obnoxious, and act like every student has a million dollars to spend on supplies when the course fees barely cover anything..."
College Senior,2,"There isn't much offered at the school.  Most of the students spend their free time in the cafeteria because it's the only place where you don't disrupt other classes and a large amount of people can fit in there.  We have a gym, I don't think there's a weight room, there's a pool that's never open.  All of the athletic rooms listed above close sometime between 4:00 and 6:00.  Our college doesn't have the funding to do many campus activities."
College Senior,2,"It costs a lot to attend Villa Maria College.  With all of the money spent on tuition a lot of the students wonder where all that money goes.  There are parts of the building where the roof is leaking and buckets are left to catch the dripping water, it's been like this for over 4 years now.  I think with the amount of money that students spend to go to the college, we should have much better facilities. "
College Junior,2,"The campus isn't really that big, it is a small private school. The library is decent and there are some activities going on throughout the campus every now and then. There are some sports but none that really interest me."
College Junior,2,This will be my firsts semester as a business major. Previously I was in the fashion design and merchandising program. The program was not diverse encough and was only headed by one teacher whose strengths laid in design despite the facebook that most students were merchandising majors. I changed my major because of how unhappy I was with the program.
Alum,1,"I went to the interior design program at villa for one year. It was as an absolutely horrible experience. The instructions were unprofessional and unqualified. 
The woman who attended the school were catty. It was like being in a bad high school experience. 
I have attended UB and Pratt institute which were worlds apart from this joke of a program. 
I wouldnâ€™t recommend it to anyone."
College Junior,1,Somehow this year every single student at the school wound up having to pay $4000 out of pocket or get a parent plus loan. The school is expensive but much smaller than other area campuses and close to my home and work which is why I choose to stay
College Junior,1,"It costs $.50 to print a page in color, if you run out of money to print you must go from through lab to the business office and then to computer services to add money to your account. Computers constantly tell you that there are no log on servers available anoint takes multiple attempts to access your account"
College Junior,1,The indoor pool is very nice but we can only use it from 11:30 to 12:30 on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The weight room is out of date and we don't have any sports teams.

Junior,5,Online was very thorough and easy to navigate for online assignments. Professors are always helpful and great at teaching!
Junior,5,Roosevelt has been an awesome experience! I am excited to finish out my 4 years with the professors and my peers! Such a diverse campus and such great professors!
Graduate Student,5,Roosevelt University college of pharmacy where I am currently enrolled is located in a quiet student friendly area. The professors really care about the success of the students. The only thing I will like to be changed is reduce the tuition a little.
Graduate Student,5,"With covid, the summer term has been online and so far, the enthusiasm of the professors is same as when we were in school. It has been an awesome experience. They make enough time for office hours to enable that all students complains are resolved in good time."
Senior,5,"Zoom classes are great but face to face would be much more engaging since you are physically there. But since the covid-19 is still out here, online classes still have that face to face factor within the learning sessions."
Senior,5,The environment is big but has many resources for the students needs and plenty of classes for people that want to try out anything of interest. I hope to see more classes with other majors and languages.
Junior,5,"Due to Covid-19 turning every class to an online setting, I was scared I would not do well. I was never keen on online learning and there was also concern for lack of resources and tutoring. However, I was pleasantly surprised on how well the curriculum transitioned to an online format. The teachers were very understanding and lenient with assignments. They also offered extra help through zoom. I passed the semester with better grades than I anticipated!"
Junior,5,"I am currently attending the Schaumburg campus! Roosevelt is a very nice school with excellent safety measures, resources, and teachers! This off campus is also very nice as I don't have to drive all the way to the city. My sibling also graduated from this college a few years ago! Highly recommend this college!"
Alum,5,Great experience with online learning.  Completed my Bachelors of Arts here using the accelerated program with some transfer credits.  I went Online to complete my program and didn’t ever visit the campus

Senior,5,"Overall, I have met the most inspiring and helpful professors throughout my college experience. I am beyond happy with my choice to attend Roosevelt for my undergrad education. Roosevelt has provided me with guileful resources throughout my entire career."
Sophomore,5,"Roosevelt is a very diverse school and its an easy place to make some lifetime friends. The staff is very friendly and caring. Some professors are very likable, although some not so much"
Junior,5,"In the heart of Chicago downtown, Roosevelt University is situated in a perfect location that one can dream of. With the dedicated professors and faculties, the process of learning only gets easier and simpler."
Junior,5,Going to school in downtown Chicago provides endless opportunities.  Professors are accommodating to students and their needs.  Admin and staff are  easy to reach out to.
Sophomore,5,"The school is very diverse. You see many students of not only different backgrounds but you have students of different religions, cultures, states, countries, languages, and experiences. There are many opportunities to find teachers to connect with you if you wished to have that connection. The environment that Roosevelt gives off allows students to thrive and succeed towards their goals through their efforts."
Freshman,5,"As the first one going to college, they made me feel so welcomed. It was a great experience for me as well as my family. The students were also so motivated ot get to know you."
Niche User,5,I have yet to experience Roosevelt but what I've seen so far and heard I'm very excited to intend college there in the fall.
Graduate Student,5,"Roosevelt is a great example of 'you get out of it what you put into it.' The opportunities are there, and it's up to the student to take advantage of them. Personally, RU has offered me the flexibility to study Community Development, and specialize throughout the course in my niche of communities who've experienced trauma."
Alum,5,Roosevelt offers their students the luxury of going from class to class in the pajamas because everything is inside and connected. The security is second to none and I never once felt like I was in any type of danger.
Freshman,5,"Well, I'm a Senior in high school so I haven't enrolled yet, but I've toured there, and it seems really nice!"
Senior,5,Roosevelt University is very open to people of all cultures and backgrounds and provides students with a lot of opportunities for their future.
Senior,5,Roosevelt University is full of determined individuals that are driven towards success. There is always positive energy in the air that makes people motivated to learn!
Junior,5,Outgoing students and staff who are always looking for experiences to learn from. Everyone is engaged with their school work and clubs and activities. You will always feel connected and at home not only with your friends/teachers but with the school itself.
Freshman,5,"The entire atmosphere is so welcoming. I felt very at home when I stepped on campus for the first time, yet I felt that it was still so full of opportunity. Very comfortable living spaces, wonderful faculty, and excellent facilities."
Junior,5,It's an amazing university. Every class room has a great view and there are tons of food options around the campus. Inside the campus its there are many quit spots to be able to study.
Niche User,5,I had visited Roosevelt University (Downtown Chicago) for only a short time and I gotta say I loved it ! The campus is super clean and the dorms are beautiful they ensure you to feel comfortable. The classroom size are small so you won’t feel like you’re in a class with 1000 students. There so many benefits when you attend Roosevelt University.
Freshman,5,"I believe that CCPA serves as a perfect environment to model standards of excellence in ensemble performance. The Chicago Symphony Orchestra, specifically, is a great role model. The opportunity to attend concerts will serve as beau idéal for me in my vision for the Caribbean and enhance my appreciation and knowledge of the art form. The availability of guest artists, the opportunity to study with the faculty at CCPA and gain their insight in the area of performance and education serves as a powerful incentive in my choice of study."
Senior,5,I love Roosevelt university. I am enrolled in the Sustainability program and the Professor's are engaged in the community and encourage student involvement.
Senior,5,I had left my education progress a few year ago due to family obligations. Know returing they are very friendly and I feel as I had never left/
Freshman,5,"Great Atmosphere, Very clean school. Everyone was super nice and had no problem finding where to go. They answered every question clearly very well organized."
Senior,5,"I love this school, the small classroom sizes are really helpful to students and can really help them get the full education. The professors really care about their students and want them to achieve."
Graduate Student,5,I am currently a graduate student in an online program in the college of education. The professors have been great and easy to communicate with. The requirements are available from day one so there's no guess work involved and you can see if the program will put you in the path you want to go. My advisor has been very helpful as well and is very knowledgeable on what coursework will help me reach my goals. I would definitely recommend Roosevelt University to other practicing teachers looking for a graduate program.
Graduate Student,5,Roosevelt's commitment to Social Justice is an extraordinary testimony to the legacy of President Roosevelt.
Freshman,5,I love how the school foundation focuses upon social justice and how it affects our community. I also admire Chicago College of Performing Arts program that I am enrolled in.
Freshman,5,I love everything about this school. It is one of the mos top diverse school and I think that is so amazing. The food is also great and the enviroment as well. Every time I walk through the halls I see smiles and warmth and that is what make Roosevelt so awesome.  
College Freshman,5,My experience so far has been great. This school has such beautiful structure and architecture in such a metropolitan city. Its wonderful to see the diversity in the school.
Recent Alumnus,5,I love being a student at Roosevelt University.  The teachers and staff there are invested in making sure every students have all the tools they need to succeed in life. The staff when registering makes everyone feel comfortable and formative of the next steps to take to get into classes. When I'm there it actually feels like I have a big family. Everyone speaks to evwryone even if you dont have a class with that person. I'm happy I chose to attend Roosevelt. I wouldnt have it any other way.
College Freshman,5,"There are internships to choose from, on campus jobs, and the degree you earn here will most likely help you to earn a job."
College Freshman,5,"I love living on campus, it is right downtown. Nice area, not sketchy at all. It's beautiful and wonderful and the area and everything is just great."
College Sophomore,5,It's wonderful and full of options and opportunities if you work hard for them.
College Sophomore,5,Always feel safe and that's something that's very important to me considering the school being in downtown Chicago.
College Sophomore,5,I've met amazing people ever since joining Greek life and I recommend to everyone.
College Freshman,5,"Excluding the difficulties of paying for tuition and other expenses, this school is the greatest thing to happen to me. I am constantly surrounded by loving peers, supportive and intelligent faculty, and a theatre program that is going above and beyond to prepare me for my future."
College Freshman,5,"The Theatre school I am in is the most loving, familial community I have ever experienced. As well, the program itself is incredibly intense, in a way that motivates the students to work as hard as possible, and learn as much as possible. I have met people, friends and professors, that I know will be both integral parts of my future career, and loving individuals in my life forever."
College Freshman,5,My school has more students employed in theatre than any other program in the Chicago area.
College Freshman,5,"The professors are all professionals in their fields, and all adhere perfectly to the messages that the school abides by."
College Freshman,5,"There are security checkpoints all over campus, and all of the security officers are easy to approach."
College Freshman,5,"So far, this has been my best education experience. I am confident that with the connections I am making here, I will be able to successfully navigate my chosen field."
College Senior,5,"My experience with my courses and professors has been great every since I started my first semester there. The quality of courses is good the school offers a variety of different courses for different majors and concentrations. The Biology and chemistry classes are the only classes that are the largest in size. Other than those classes, the class sizes are fairly small which is great because you feel like you are just not a number but an actual student. The professors do a great job in teaching the material of the subject and are always willing to answer any questions students have. The big classes for biology and chemistry have well set up auditorium classroom seating for the students which I like because everyone can see the professor. Also the screens are large enough for everyone to see the slides and material that is being taught."
College Senior,5,The safety of every student is very important to the staff in our school. They always want you to feel safe and if something or someone is bothering you they take that very serious and do what ever they can to make it stop. I know that if there ever was a campus crime the staff would do anything in their power to stop it or try to prevent things getting worse. We have security all over the school and police and safety services are available if something bad were to happen. A personal incident that happened to me in school was when a guy was bothering me and I didn't feel comfortable talking to him so I let the teacher know and she let the Title IX staff people know and they made sure that if I didn't feel safe in school to let them know so they can get security on my case. Thankfully this didn't not get worse and the guy stopped bothering me. The fact that the staff really cared about my well-being and my safeness was what I really liked.
College Senior,5,I honestly believe our school is the best because the teachers are great and the staff as well. I love that it a diverse type of school and that they are really strong on social justice which I believe makes our school very unique. They care about justice and want all of our students to be involved and make a difference. I would totally choice this school all over again if I had the chance because the classes are small so we get more one on one help from the teachers. I also like that for an A to be considered an A you must have a 94% or higher which makes you strive even harder. All the advisers are very helpful and caring and that is why I love my school.
Recent Alumnus,5,I never felt anything but completely and totally safe while at Roosevelt.
Recent Alumnus,5,My time at Roosevelt was well spent. I was able to learn so much and grow as a person in an amazing city.
Recent Alumnus,5,The Wabash building is only a few years old and it's beautifully designed plus environmentally friendly!
Recent Alumnus,5,"If you're looking for a school were you can not only grow and learn academically, but be in a positive, supportive, social justice oriented environment, then Roosevelt University is probably the place for you. All of the professors not only care about helping you grow as a student and a learner, but as a person and a member of society as well."
College Freshman,5,I feel safe. There are machines that scan ids at all entrances aof the building. Suspicious people are pulled aside and cleared by security.
College Freshman,5,The quality of courses and professors for my major make this a perfect place to foster my love for acting and desire to perform. They treat me like an equal and give me individual attention. They have no issues with answering any question you might have. They want students to succeed.
College Freshman,5,The housing process was simple and easy to follow. No stress or nerves when moving in because there are plenty of people to answer any questions that arise and help you any way that they can.
College Freshman,5,"Roosevelt University is unique because each course offers so much to its student. As a student in CCPA, I am constantly growing and learning more about my craft in a positive and encouraging learning environment."
College Freshman,5,"The rooms are nice and very modern. You have a great view of the city and are able to travel anywhere downtown since its located on Michigan ave. and Wabash. The cost is pricey because it is a new building, but the rooms come w/ air conditioning and heat, so it makes up for it somewhat."
Alum,4,I only took a one or two summer classes online. It was a fine experience but I cannot speak to a fully online curriculum.
Graduate Student,4,"I attended Roosevelt University for my masters degree. I enjoyed the experience so much that I have made the decision attend again for a second bachelors in nursing. Their vision (social justice), location, student resources, professors and program reputation provide me with the confidence to know that I'm making the right decision to trust them with my future."
Graduate Student,4,"I have not yet taken any online courses with Roosevelt, but due to the current climate/pandemic, I will have the opportunity to do so this fall. I'd imagine the experience to be very engaging and positive -- just as face-to-face classes are."
Junior,4,Roosevelt as great programs and opportunities for its students. There is always new event and activities around the school. I wish Roosevelt had more options for times of classes.
Junior,4,I like to staff and teachers they are really nice. I hope to do well at this school. There is a piano there that I love to play when I can.
Sophomore,4,"Roosevelt University is in the center of the city of Chicago. You have a beautiful view no matter where you go and you don't have to leave the building for anything. Security is everywhere and it's extremely diverse. Since it's in the city, there are lots of opportunities, fun events and celebrity guest that come right in the front door of Roosevelt! It can be expensive but I believe it's worth the safety and the experience. It's definitely unique!"
Senior,4,The school is very clean. The food is good but expensive. Most of the teachers try their best to help their students. I would like for them to give out or help people get scholarships that are already a student.
Junior,4,Roosevelt University is so diverse and the environment is always positive. It goes by a mission of social justice and the school is really active with their events about social justice. There are not a lot of activities or events for students who live off campus and Roosevelt staff have been trying to incorporate schedule changes so all students either off campus or on campus are willing to participate.
Freshman,4,I am in the vocal program which I find is excellent. The whole music program is great though I will say that the music theory courses aren't given a sufficient amount of time to be explored in the depth that they are currently. The tuition is also ridiculously high even for a top-notch program.
Junior,4,"Very good staff in just about every area and facet you can imagine. Friendly financial aid, academic advisors, and professors, all working hard to make sure you learn and achieve your goals."
Graduate Student,4,"My experience at Roosevelt University has been overwhelmingly positive for my purpose of going there, getting my master's degree and furthering my education to enter the profession I want, being a high school teacher. I have a busy life, and Roosevelt is understanding of that. They've designed their curriculum and offer classes based on people who don't have the ability to go to school full time. However, I don't know if I would enjoy life as an undergraduate student there. The campus is rather small, and there doesn't seem to be much incentive for leaving the dorms."
Sophomore,4,"School has a great social justice goal that is embodied in your education. It is in the loop of Chicago, so you are surrounded by culture, activities, and endless food options. It is a small school, so you will see the same faces from day to day."
Graduate Student,4,Roosevelt is an excellent University located in the heart of the Chicago Loop making it a great location for various activities.
Junior,4,Roosevelt has been pretty great thus far. The campus is breathtaking and the dorms are similar to pent houses on the 31st floor! A beautiful building with great amenities makes for a great Residence Hall. The classes are small (30-40 students max) which I really enjoy because you can get to know your professors better and have an overall better learning environment in my opinion.
Junior,4,I love Roosevelt University. Although I love it there are things that I would like to see changed. Like the way that they work with new students as far as financial aid and helping them to make sure that all paperwork and other required documents are handled correctly instead of waiting until it's to late and not reaching out to the students.
Junior,4,"I wish the environment were more academically competitive. Many students in my science classes don't put in enough effort and it slows down the class for everyone. 

I do appreciate that Roosevelt accepted most of my transfer classes - I also looked at transferring to UIC but they wouldn't have accepted most of the work I had done elsewhere and would have added at least a year onto my degree. Roosevelt is a much quicker degree."
Junior,4,"I like that they have two campuses, I attend both and it's a comfortable place to come to and study."
Freshman,4,"Overall a good college for what I want to go into, the only thing is, a lot of music students come here so it may feel a little bit overwhelming at times because there is so many of them present in one clique. Academics are pretty good, love the professors here and love the different opportunities to get involved on campus, not know for its party life though."
Sophomore,4,"The school its pretty good and as student Ive had all opportunities to have good grades. The campus doesn't have the best buildings, I think we could have more space for the amount of students. However, the environment its pretty good"
Sophomore,4,"Roosevelt University provides a person with the best courses required for them to succeed with your major. There is multiple resources to communicate with professors, or if you need a helping hand, you can get it from the resource provided."
Alum,4,"I was in the musical theatre program.  My schedule was very busy, but filled with learning opportunities.  Classes are five days a week, typically from 9:30-5:00 with rehearsals from 6:00-10:00.  As an acting major, you are guaranteed to be in one show every semester and you truly learn how to work as an ensemble with your peers."
Freshman,4,Roosevelt university has the best campus views  where u can eat at the best spots and the best dorms that has the great views and I feel like the only thing I would change is the cost of some classes. It’s because it’s already hard to be at the university why make the classes cost more.
Freshman,4,What I liked about Roosevelt University is that the professors are really helpful and are willing to help with students' questions about the work.
Graduate Student,4,"Roosevelt seems to be a very good school with an intelligent teaching staff. I have not spent much time on campus besides when I am in class since I have to travel into the city for graduate class. Overall, I have enjoyed my time at Roosevelt."
Freshman,4,The faculty and staff are helpful with my personal needs and problems. I didn't find it hard to fit in because it felt like home.
Junior,4,It's a great university with quality professors. There's a lot of diversity in amongst the teachers and students. Professors are very passionate in their subjects.
Sophomore,4,"I have completed my first year as an undergraduate at RU and I have to say it was quite an experience. I enjoyed living on campus, I felt safe and had much fun. I was successful in my academics even if there was much to be distracted by  living in the city of Chicago."
Senior,4,"They have two campuses, one in Schaumburg, IL and the other downtown Chicago, IL. The staff is friendly and willing to help you with any questions or concerns and they want to see you do well."
Sophomore,4,"While most of the staff cares deeply about the students & offer opportunities for assistance, extracurricular engagement, and community involvement, it is clear that the higher ups do not care about the wellbeing of students or members of staff. They have made poor financial choices in  the past and it can at times feel as though you are only seen as a monetary value by those in charge."
Alum,4,I really enjoyed attending Roosevelt University. The counselors are a great help and guided me all the way through graduation. I highly recommend going here!
Sophomore,4,"I like the people here. The overall environment is very welcoming. You feel like you are going to get through school, but unless you are popular or an athletes you do not get the typical college experience."
Junior,4,i like the friendly atmosphere at Roosevelt. It is not crowded and you get a lot of personal interaction with others.
Freshman,4,"What I like about Roosevelt University is the fact that they work with me through everything I need help with- classes, tuition etc- with upmost patience."
Senior,4,"To be brief, Roosevelt is a safe urban school that is diverse with very good academics. It has a positive environment of student cooperation, and that has had a great influence upon my academics and attitudes. I would strongly suggest this college."
Sophomore,4,"This was / wasn't my top choice.
I feel like I settled here but considering room and board at other colleges, commuting would be way easier and cost effective.

Pros:
- Near mass transit
- Diversity
- engaging professor 
- many recourses for free ( tutoring )
- security 
- New beautiful form building 


Cons:
- gotta register early if you want the good classes at the earlier times
- some professors seem to focus more on content versus engaging and that makes some classes harder then they really are 
- tuition just went up
- dorm prices are ridiculous 
- pockets of talkative /  disrespectful students who make a classroom a hard place to focus
- crime crime crime crime. 
- homelessness outside can be scary
- did I mention tuition ?"
Junior,4,"Roosevelt University is a great school in the city. It stresses the concept of social justice, which makes everyone feel welcome. The professors are generally willing to help their students succeed and there are plenty of clubs for students to get involved in. I am a transfer student and I found it overall relatively easy adjust to the atmosphere of Roosevelt. Roosevelt University is rather costly though. "
College Freshman,4,"Many students join athletics on campus. They have a wide range of activities and sports to choose from. One thing I wish they had was a swimming pool, and a swim team."
College Sophomore,4,Our admins make sure we are educated about this subject
College Sophomore,4,Campus housing is clean and very new.
College Senior,4,Attending Roosevelt University is challenging and rewarding.
College Sophomore,4,"Departments are constantly forwarding internship opportunities to students, and the career services are extremely helpful. There are also job opportunities on campus that connect students with Roosevelt Alumni in the effort to strengthen alumni relations. I have not experienced much of the job hunting aspect as I am only an incoming sophomore, but I have seen that there are many avenues for job opportunities after graduation."
College Sophomore,4,"(This review is for the Wabash Building dormitory and does not apply to Roosevelt University's other residence option, the University Center.) Living in the Wabash Building is beautiful. The view from the floor to ceiling windows in every room was beautiful, from every side of the building. The halls were kept clean and rules were enforced in a way that didn't feel overbearing by the residence advisors. However, the dorm food was nothing to write home about, which was disappointing. While there were four stations to choose from, only one regularly offered new options. Oftentimes, it was a struggle to eat healthy without eating the exact same salad or wrap every day. The junk food options were endless, but students who hope to eat healthy have much less options. Also, the weekend hours were less than favorable for students staying up late or who held jobs off campus, as the cafeteria closed at 7 pm."
College Freshman,4,The classes that are offered are very diverse. There are many to choose from and the classes and labs and professors are just awesome.
College Freshman,4,I feel the safety on campus is very good and managed. It's in a nice place and you don't see TOO many sketchy people and I just feel very safe.
College Freshman,4,"Roosevelt is very diverse in not only their student life, but the professors as well. The professors really do seem to care and are helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"Many professors I had were great especially the ones in my program. Although, most required courses in the school are extremely unnecessary."
College Sophomore,4,Small campus housing but good space and nice little community.
College Sophomore,4,"Luckily, I feel that I fit in wonderfully at my school and the people I have met are so unique and diverse. Also, the opportunities I've gotten from by school have been incredible so far."
College Junior,4,I don't know where to look or go in search of a work-study job.
College Junior,4,Just need to add more courses offered and make the courses that are offered more accessible like there was only 1 MWF session of a science class. What if that does not accommodate students who require the class?
College Junior,4,"Registration process is great and easy! I wish there were more class availability. Also, more classes that students would be interested in outside of their field and gen eds."
College Junior,4,"I have not attended yet. This is my intended transfer school. The staff has made transferring easy, efficient, and less stressful!"
College Freshman,4,"The theatre program I am in is strenuous and intense, but in a way that creates a drive in its students to push for excellence. It is one of the best programs in the country, and we see unique individuals with their own crafted talents and energies graduate every year, and go into the world of theatre fully prepared to work."
College Freshman,4,"Expensive, but incredibly high quality. Unfortunate that it's required, for payment purposes, and a too-large-to-be-worth-it investment on the part of the school, for the sake of how few people live there."
College Senior,4,The career prospects and value of a degree in this school is great. The school does offer job/internships and work study positions. The career development center is also very helpful. They help you plan out what you can do after graduation and also help you with getting internships. The school sometimes has career job fairs that take place in the school which is great because that gives you an opportunity to gather your resume and try to apply for a job without having to go far distance. At the end of the day is how much as a student you put your degree to use and what resources you take advantage of to help you do something with your degree.
College Senior,4,Student involvement is very important in our school when it comes to supporting the athletic team performance. The school show's its spirit by wearing the school color green to every game when supporting our school teams. The students usually pass flyer's around when there is a game that will be taking place in the school so we can attend and show our support. The school althletic facilities are up to date and are very useful for the students. As a school I believe they do a great job to encourage our althletes and the students in general.
College Junior,4,The school has helped me reach my career goals and I am happy (so far) with the outcomes.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I got a job a month after graduating, and never had any problem landing internships while in school."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Athletics are still a relatively new part of Roosevelt, but they are there - and the facilities are incredible!"
College Freshman,4,"The professors here are very diverse. You have a handful of very well educated professors from all over the globe, maybe from space? Very diverse as is the student body, so it is nice to see teachers of my skin color and connect to them on a closer level. They are very approachable, certain teachers seem very laid back and friendly so their classes seem more interactive and a better environment to learn. Class sizes can be a bit tricky, I have one where it seems like there is about 13 of us, and another where we are at capacity with 45 students and a small class room. There is a solid variety of courses to take, however, you have to get passed the general stuff first. Overall a great experience, and it is one that is well to learn in."
Junior,2,"only bullies i met were teachers,  they sent back $50+ worth of MY mail that i never got back even though my full name and two other addresses were present. and y'all really need to higher someone to rework how your elevators work there will be 3 elevators waiting on 31 or 14  and you'll just have to watch and wait for the one to stop and pick up someone on every floor before it gets to your floor, only for you to have to wait for the next one because that ones full.(i would have to leave 25min before class starts to go 100 feet below me. )(please let us use the stairs)"
Alum,2,Underwhelming. High school was harder and prepared me more. Diversity was great. Programs across the board underestimated student intelligence and willingness to work hard. They tore down the terrible dorm with prison bars over the windows which is good. I have not been inside the new building but it looks fancy.
Niche User,2,"A handful of years ago I was seriously considering going to Roosevelt. I did my best and talk to everybody that I could to let them know how serious of a candidate that I was. I was going for a master's to become a teacher in humanity. I had a psychology Bachelorette. Somebody in the admissions office told me that that's a usual. Do you want to become a teacher after getting a psychology ba was an unusual path. I was so offended and I asked to speak to his boss. So the director comes on and I told him the story and he also told me he thought that was an unusual path. Frankly, both were rude about it. It was if I was wasting their time.  Needless to say I did not get accepted into the university. I'm finished with my Master's now and obviously went to a different school, it was much better for me. They believed in me. Can you believe that this school is stopping people from becoming teachers? Nobody has the right to tell you that you can't become one"
Freshman,2,"If you're going for performing arts, go! I loved the music school but be prepared for music majors and MT's that you'll be in class for too long (8AM-6PM some days). Any other major I heard is trash from non music students. A lot of people transfer. Living in the city is dope but its cold, so be ok with that and people are crazy and homeless everywhere. ALSO- they want your money. Be careful, the advisors do NOT know what they're talking about. I transferred."
Junior,2,"A major thing that needs to be changed is what they put online when it comes to dorming/housing. There is an application you fill out that helps resident assistants figure out who to room you with. I have nothing in common with my roommates, which is upsetting because why else did i fill out the application. They also need to do  a better job at picking out who should be resident assistants. My RA(resident assistant) has done nothing to solve the issues I am having with the living conditions or my roommates. The residence assistants need to be more accurate with what they post on their website because a majority of what they post about dorming/housing is not true."
College Sophomore,2,Small school with little sports teams.
College Junior,2,I don't know about this.
College Junior,2,It is disorganzed. I don't even know about it.
College Junior,2,I don't like it. Exams are hard. Professors don't go easy on us.
College Junior,2,They have some but nobody cares
College Sophomore,2,Loose your id? They'll give you a problem. They'll ban people for the simplest reasons.
College Sophomore,2,financial aid here isn't the best.
College Sophomore,2,"As a private student, you would think that they would give more aid to their students but NO. Most of my aid comes from the government as loan and not the school."
College Freshman,2,"The communication in all departments of my school is poor and needs adjustment. Despite my obvious need and the huge amount of tuition I pay, I do not receive adequate financial need. And I am not the only one, several student have had to drop out of school due to their financial needs not being met."
College Senior,2,"I work full time during and go to school part time. I take any class that is offered at night and online classes. Receiving help for school is hard, which is why it is taking me a while to obtain my bachelor degree."
College Freshman,2,"I don't really care for my professors, they are very strict and uptight."
College Freshman,2,"If you want to party, this isn't the school. The amount you pay to go here is not worth the experience. You go to this school to learn, that's it. There is no social/party scene here unless you are in the theater program."
College Freshman,2,There are probably three Greek life options and they are not very cool.
College Senior,2,No one talks about it.
College Senior,2,"The staff are so rude and not very helpful. They are not so much looking out for you as they are looking for ways to screw you over. Please keep a close eye on your scholarships, they seem to disappear mid-year!"
College Senior,2,"Only parties you hear of are from CCPA (who wont invite you if you aren't in CCPA) and JAMS parties but they get pretty raunchy. Live off campus if you are trying to party and be nice to Columbia, Loyola and other college kids, they have more parties than Roosevelt."
College Freshman,2,they are literally only there to keep people from sneaking in. they're bitchy and do nothing to help you out.
College Freshman,2,"if you go greek, it looks like you're trying too hard. this is not a conventional school so trying to be normal is being a sell out. yay social justice"
College Freshman,2,"It's not that hard to get drugs or alcohol from people. They say ""no drugs or underage drinking"", but considering a campus security member tried to sexually assault a sophomore who stumbled in drunk, they kind of ignore it. Most people drink and a good portion smoke."
College Freshman,2,"They don't give out anything compared to how much they make you pay. If you want more money, you have to know someone on the inside who could make that happen."
College Freshman,2,"It's really expensive to park, and no one has a car because you're in the middle of the city. Plus as part of your bill, the school gives you a pass that enables you to ride CTA public transportation free for the year."
College Sophomore,2,"For me, I'm always being picked for verification. ... it's a hassle."
College Sophomore,2,"Chicago, ""The Windy City"", it can be challenging commuting to school with the adverse Chicago weather "
College Junior,2,"Start ASAP. They keep on changing the amount of aid I'm supposed to receive and finals are in two weeks. Major pain in the behind. Before i applied i spoke to the FAO to make sure I would be classified as independent, BEFORE i applied. They said yes. After i accepted admissions, finished all the paperwork needed they said that I was not classified independent, not I have a huge financial burden. To be frank I probably wouldn't of gone here if I had know that would of happened. "
College Junior,2,"We have to park either at the pay stations on the street, or in the private parking at either the hotel across the street or further away for cheaper prices. RU does validate parking though."
College Sophomore,2,"Student involvement for athletics is medium to low, personally, I never went to a game. School spirit is not really high either. No football team so not a big thing as far as Homecoming goes."
College Sophomore,2,There are plenty of chain-fast-food-joints and fine dining restaurants. But there are not many healthy or vegetarian options.
College Senior,2,"Roosevelt is located directly in the center of the city of Chicago. Its not called the ""Windy City"" for no reason. Each campus is relatively close to each other in Chicago, so when it snows or rains, you can catch a cab or train to your next class or even walk!"
College Junior,2,"They give you some financial aid, but its still very expensive especially if you don't have a co-signer for student loans"
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of people who sell drugs, mostly marijuana. It is easy to come by and notice who's dealing and picking up. There really isn't a lot being done about it."
College Freshman,2,"The RAs on campus take thier job pretty seriously, some more than others.  Socializing events in the dorm can not start until after rounds have been completed otherwise for any sort of noise they will make you open the door and you will get written up"
College Senior,2,"Although available, never got to really enjoy this experience because of stress of finances due to the expensive cost of this school."
College Freshman,2,They seem like they try to recruit but I'm just not interested I the greek life on this campus. I want more of a variety.
College Freshman,2,"The school values that everyone has a different educational background, but at the same time they lower their standards to accommodate, sometimes it just isn't challenging"
College Freshman,2,"I have a lot of great friends, but they are mostly athletes. It seems like athletes are put down in our school because sports ""aren't"" about social justice. I find this offensive sometimes. I also wish they would keep expanding for more students to live on campus."
College Freshman,2,"Most students, including me, are unsatisfied with the dining hall and what it has to offer. The service is not great neither is the food."
College Junior,2,"They are very strict when it comes to paying your debt! They are not very helpful as far as working with you to seek out options other than taking out additional loans. Financial Aid is sometimes very slow in processing documents and they do not thoroughly explain to you your options as far as payment, scholarships, loans and payment plans. I beleive that their lack of assistance hinders manystudents on their academic journey."
College Freshman,2,I have never felt like I was ever in danger but almost every week there are notices of incidents.
College Junior,2,The drug scene at Roosevelt University such as smoking is big but it depends on who you surround yourself with.
College Freshman,2,"It's difficult to say that any scholarship is ""easy"" to get, so it's not like I expected to be handed a ton of money for no reason. It's just annoying that because it's a private school, scholarships are slightly harder to come by when most often, Roosevelt isn't even listed as an option. The financial aid office is a mess. Students who actively involve themselves in sitting in offices, waiting rooms, talking to multiple guidance counselors and people of that sort can even find trouble getting the help they need."
College Freshman,2,"Granted, it's a city school, not a state school. Student involvement is lacking, team performance isn't all that great, school spirit is non-existent."
College Junior,2,We recieve the lake effect from Lake Michigan so it can be extremely cold.  During the summer time it is extremely hot and humid.  Be aware Chicago has extreme weather.
College Freshman,2,"It took forever to get my financial aid figured out. My parents and I had to call and come in many times because there was money that was not being accounted for, and the people in the office were very rude to us, but I did end up receiving a good amount of money."
College Junior,2,Newly Embedded Sport Program – Roosevelt University's sports program isn't all that rate since they just started it back up in the fall of 2010. As of right now it nothing to be over excited about but I've as the years pass its gathering more and more attention around campus.
College Sophomore,2,Just Not the School for Me – I feel roosevelt moves at a pace that some peopl cannot keep up with. I understand it's college but roosevelt has a high standards for passing all you classes not saying that's how it should be but before the past weeks it was just hard trying to get through to some of them it's a good school out you are ready to be complete on your own
College Sophomore,2,Could Be Better – Its good. But sometimes they don't email you quick enough and don't do things right away
College Sophomore,2,Its a Work in Progress – Roosevelt has just gotten reinstated their athletics program with plans to enter the lower division of the NCAA.  The only thing I'm not pumped about.  But as the programs are given time they'll find their groove and I'm sure they'll be top notch.
College Freshman,2,"Chicago is known for is overpriced, ridiculous parking. Roosevelt is located in the heart of downtown Chicago which means limited, overpriced parking. Most students and faculty travel via public transportation because of the poor parking system built in Chicago. There are very few parking spaces outside of the school. There are parking garages near the school, but they are also over priced. Faculty members are given parking vouchers for parking ... availiable three blocks from the school."
College Student,2,Sports Are Definatly NOT the Main Focus. The sports teams are not the main focus at my school
College Sophomore,2,At least it's in the city and there is a lot of food choices off campus.
College Sophomore,2,Roosevelt is just now revamping its athletic department. There is a new building to support it w/ state of the art equipment. Too new to evaluate.
College Junior,2,Stay on Top of It – If you don't stay on top of things they get lost between the cracks.
College Junior,2,High Cost in Downtown Area – Too costly to live off campus unless you are living with family
College Sophomore,2,People at school can be really laid back. Of course every once in awhile u run into the freak over achiever but that cannot be helped.
College Sophomore,2,"Not the Best – RU is a private school and tuition has been increasing with each year, especially with the construction of the new building. Most of my financial aid is through loans, so I suggest to apply for as many scholarships as possible!
The financial aid representatives do there best to process your information and stay in contact with you. But it makes it a lot easier if you do your FAFSA as soon as possible to have it processed faster."
Niche User,1,"I came from Robert Morris University which merged with Roosevelt.

They raised my tuition after lying they would keep it the same.
They got rid of the accelerated degree program after lying they would keep it.
No one had answers to anything and was extremely unhelpful the 15+ times I called and no one answers emails.

I would recommend staying away from this school. My advisor also constantly tried to enroll me in classes I already had credit for from high school and community college which was very frustrating.

I will not be returning to this school!"
Niche User,1,Online was a joke. I had a class I was enrolled in late and the professor would not let me make up the work. I got 100% on everything once I was in the class and couldn't get anything higher than a B. Also no one answers their emails.
Alum,1,it’s a joke. period. you won’t learn anything. it’s all passive learning. they just want you to graduate.
Alum,1,They shit on your dreams. Staffs are a joke. They’re hypocrites and crooks. I don’t recommend this college because you’ll end up hating yourself and the people around you. They have the WORST kind of advisors. Go somewhere else that is worthy. They’ll waste your time and money. Trust me. Save yourselves. This college is not worth it
College Sophomore,1,"Very small school so a ""party"" is with your small group of friends or roommates."
College Senior,1,I don't believe we have greek life.
College Senior,1,I do not have a meal plan.
College Freshman,1,we dont have greek life
College Freshman,1,"The campus food is terrible. There is barely anything healthy to eat. The hours of the 1 dining hall we have suck. One Friday and Saturday the dining hall closes at 7:30pm.. who eats before that time in college? Also, everything there is extremely overpriced."
College Freshman,1,"The gym isn't anything special, there's like one student hangout area on the 14th floor with a ping pong table. There is some campus events but you have to pay for everything. There isn't much tradition."
College Freshman,1,There is a baseball team.. that's about it! No one cares about it though
College Freshman,1,I'm pretty positive there is no Greek Life here.
College Freshman,1,"There is NOTHING to do here if you don't have a fake ID. Drinking in your rooms isn't even worth it due to the strict consequences. The RA's are ridiculous. The only place to party is off-campus, and at that point it is pretty dangerous to be out late and use the subway, it gets real sketchy once it gets dark outside."
Recent Alumnus,1,My financial aid experience was the worst. I called them several times this summer to see if I qualified for financial aid for the fall and that went no where. It was only after I called again three weeks before class started that they told me I did not qualify for aid at all.
College Freshman,1,We have to go to a Chicago clinic for health care.
College Senior,1,I don't really go out. If I do I don't stay on campus so the distance is pretty far.
College Senior,1,We don't have parking. We have to pay for the expensive parking downtown.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking was horrible, because the school is located in the inner city and parking is street parking only. Street parking in Chicago is charged by the hour and has a maximum of four hour at a time. Therefore, if your classes are longer you will have to leave class to feed the meter. The second option is to pay monthly parking at a garage which prices range from $250-$300 or daily parking of $15 dollars. Students have to be careful because getting tickets are expensive and can cost about $50-$100. As  a student, spending this kind of money on parking can take away from important things such as books."
College Freshman,1,"In the summer, it's usually pretty nice, which makes for awesome times at all the outdoor cultural events and street fairs. The winter is absolutely rotten though, so invest in snow boots and a very warm coat. And everything else an Inuit might need. Believe me, that long puffer coat won't look so ridiculous when the wind chill is 20 below 0."
College Freshman,1,"Some people attend games, but not many. In general, sports at Roosevelt are one of the biggest jokes on campus. Even so, they did just build the new athletic center across the street from campus, and I've heard it was pretty nice."

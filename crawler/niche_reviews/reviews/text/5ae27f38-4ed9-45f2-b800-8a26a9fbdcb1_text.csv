Freshman,5,"While I'm disappointed that I'm not going to be living on campus this quarter, the online experience is still excellent."
Freshman,5,"Even though I have to take classes online because of COVID-19, I'm still loving doing so! Every class I'm taking is thought-provoking in different ways. I'm realizing my passion for both linguistics and the Russian language. A great experience!"
Senior,5,"Accessible instructors and small class sizes. As a returning student, the business program at Portland State University is a good choice due to the smaller classes. The classes are taught by people who have worked in various positions, are very knowledgable, and have contacts within the field to help guide students toward good jobs."
Senior,5,"Since attending Portland State University, I have taken at least one class every term online. Within the business school, this also meant that there were a lot of group projects for individuals across the US. To complete the business capstone, we used D2L, Zoom meetings, and our group became very conversant in the online library resources. Because of COVID, the more traditional options. were completely off-limits, but I think that helped, because we had to rely on each other, and we each did more research, and met more often over Zoom than we would have in person. This class required more work, and it was easier for our group of 5 to meet online, than it would have been in person."
Senior,5,I have taken many classes through D2L and I find that the professors weekly modules are well designed and prepared. Syllabi is easy to follow as well.
Junior,5,I am excited to be a part of this community of diverse students. Staff are very smart and love to help students excel.
Junior,5,I have learned a lot with my time at PSU. I cant wait to continue my education here because the staff are very helpful.
Junior,5,"I think that they did a very good job with the switch to online when COVID-19 forced that move. Of course there were learning curves with it for all of us, but I have been very happy with the way my classes online have been going. The online classes I had taken in the school previous to that were well set up and managed."
Freshman,5,Great university! Love all of the guidance I’ve been given. Also a plus is the amenities to attending this school.
Sophomore,5,"Online classes to me were a breeze. I only had to turn in one assignment a week and the quizzes were short and easy. The professors were easy to reach through email and responded within one day. Additionally, many professors allow late submissions with no penalties. Portland State uses D2L which I find is very easy to use."
Senior,5,The online experience for the most part at Portland State was good for me. I had one time where the teacher was not good with the online and it ended up screwing me over even though I was doing the work in the class and also had other classmates that could vouch for me.
Sophomore,5,I am currently towards the end of my sophomore year and I've enjoyed my experience at Portland State University. The classes are focused on ensuring you retain the knowledge being taught with the Professors constantly reaching out. Living on campus is great because your right in downtown Portland meaning after classes your free to check out the water front or numerous food trucks. The on-campus food isn't the best  however PSU's Dining Dollars are great if your just looking to pick up some snacks on your way back from classes.
Senior,5,If I wasn't able to take online classes I wouldn't be able to go back to school but I also didn't want to go to a school that was strictly online. I wanted to have a student life balance along with my course load. I wanted to be able to speak to some of the adjunct faculty that are the Business Leaders in our community. Portland State is the best of all of the Oregon schools in terms of integration with the business Community.   I can take as many online classes as I want and sometimes I only take online classes. it's what works perfectly for me and the teachers that teach online are amazing.  The live classes that we had to do with the coronavirus were something I have never experienced before. They put a lot of hard work into making sure the online classes are the best.
Freshman,5,"Portland State University is the diversity of students , fantastic. I also love that there is the most absolute respect for one person to another regardless of sexual orientation, race, and disability. Need to see more online classes offered."
Freshman,5,I recently went to a tour of Portland State and when I did it was one of those moments where you are able to cross of all the other colleges you had in mind in your head because you know that it’s the right one for you ! Now I will be attending PSU in the fall and not only that I will also be staying in the dorms and which is super exciting ! I just loved their campus !
Junior,5,This college has very nice and supportive teachers and staff. The atmosphere at the college is very welcoming and you feel like you can accomplish anything!
Alum,5,"Portland State University is a diversity campus. Further, it provides resources for people of color and student with disabilities."
Senior,5,Portland State is such a positive and forward thinking community! The campus is beautiful and everyone is very welcoming of people from all shapes and backgrounds.
Senior,5,"I love how progressive Portland State University is whether it's the teachers, students, or location in the heart of Portland. It is a very unique school with tons of opportunities inside and outside of the city for students to expand upon their core education through internships or volunteer opportunities. It's close relationship with OHSU is especially great for all of the pre-health professionals that attend the school."
Senior,5,Novel university with access to so many resources to graduate. I wish I could have attended as a full-time student to finish my degree faster and to be on campus more often.
Graduate Student,5,"The computer science program prepared me extremely well for industry, and as a trans woman I felt completely accepted in a way that I hadn't at other institutions."
Freshman,5,"I really appreciate the opportunities that Portland State offers its students. There is something for everyone here, as this school is very accepting of people from all backgrounds, and is willing to help those who need accommodations."
Junior,5,"What I love about Portland State University is the diversity of students that attend. I also love that there is the most absolute respect for one person to another regardless of sexual orientation, race, and disability. The classes are fun and intriguing but I would like to see more online classes offered."
Alum,5,Portland State University was an amazing experience! I lived on campus and it was really cool I had a cool apartment style dorm. It is in the heart of downtown so there is so much to do and eat!
Freshman,5,PSU is very quick on responding to questions and it is very easy to find help. The part of PSU that i enjoyed the most is the diversity it has. It shows that it cares about the community and its motivation to help. I also enjoyed how PSU counselors came to the school and gave a preview of what they can provide students and how they can help out financially.
Freshman,5,"I am originally from the coast, and I rarely ever had the chance to be in a big city like Portland. When the opportunity arose for me to attend PSU, I took it. I love that although I am at school, I am also at the heart of Portland. It is a beautiful campus that also provides countless resources to help students with their education."
Junior,5,I enjoy that Portland State University is a diverse school and has so many outreaches and programs to assist struggling students in getting back on track and on top of their studies!
Freshman,5,I have been obsessed with going to Portland State University for a little over two years! They provide support and they are culturally diverse and a social school. it’s honestly an amazing school
Graduate Student,5,"Portland State University provides an environment that is happy, healthy, supportive, and innovative. There is a diverse student body that educates and practices a sustainable way of living and learning."
Freshman,5,I love this entire environment and the vibe that living in the middle of Downtown Portland brings to the table. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and would recommend it to any one who wants to have the best 4 years.
Sophomore,5,Portland State is a very welcoming school and I love that the campus is integrated with the city so there's always something to do and places to go.
Freshman,5,I am going to be a new undergrad student in 2020 and I am very excited. I have family members that went there and were extremely glad they did. Their online application and scholarships are super easy to find and navigating their websites is super easy to follow
Junior,5,"Portland State School of Business is amazing in that there is so many different majors offered and the scheduling is superb. Opportunities for careers, internships and other learning experiences are just a few of the things that the university offers to its students. They've partnered with transportation services to make transportation easy and affordable for students. The rec center is slightly small but has a little of everything to allow for students to workout what they want to. Overall, my experience so far has been amazing and I would recommend this university to all."
Senior,5,Portland university is a very innovative college. They give you the opportunity to pick from a wide range of different majors — as well as certificates you are able to obtain. The campus has an overall great feel and very welcoming and everyone is nice. The professors are amazing and understanding especially when you have to balance your school life with your work life.
Sophomore,5,"Only being at this school for a year, I can already tell how diverse Portland State Unversity is. With students from all over the globe, to clubs varying in different fields, there are tons of ways for someone to have tons of experiences."
Junior,5,"What I love about Portland State University is how friendly and informative the professors there are. They really care about helping me develop the skills and knowledge to pursue the career I'm working towards, and they try to get to know each student personally, depending on the class size. The university as a whole is also very welcoming and supportive of everyone of all backgrounds. What I hope to see PSU improve on is the campus itself, as it will be undergoing renovations in the next coming years, and it's also renovating one of the campus buildings to be even better."
Sophomore,5,"It is a really great school, teacher are willing to reach out and extend a helping hand and really show their support."
Sophomore,5,"This school is full of students who want to be there to learn, and professors who want to teach them. Always trying to stay on the cutting edge of education and ideas. As well as supporting students through financial services, sponsored events and ect.
There is however, at the moment, a lot of student disapproval of where their tuition dollars are going."
Junior,5,"I love PSU!  It was hard for me to move away from my family, but the teachers and counselors have helped me adapt and get done what needs to be done.  I’m excited about what I’m learning and feel I will be able to get a good job with my environmental science degrees when I’m through."
Junior,5,I loved everything about PSU! It is such an amazing diverse university. All kinds of things are in here. Its amazing how people just wish to live on campus because it is such an amazing campus!
Senior,5,"Great school in downtown Portland, Oregon. Walkable and public transit readily available for reduced fares for students. Classes are available day and evening and tuition is much lower than other Oregon schools. Very ideal for transfer students and non-traditional students."
Alum,5,"I was in the biology department for undergrad. My advisor really worked with me over my last couple of terms to make sure I could take the classes I wanted while also graduating on time. There were research seminars hosted every week by the college that were free to attend, and were good areas to talk about research opportunities with other scientists. Labs were at brand new building by the waterfront and were excellent. As an off campus student, it was a little hard getting involved in social activities. Professors were generally accommodating and willing to help students. The campus is really beautiful, and also pretty close to a lot of bars, food, and recreational activities. I also really appreciated the aspect of community service involved in the capstone project."
Niche User,5,I love the community. Portland is so beautiful. The trees all over campus are pretty and the food carts aren't too far from campus. There is diverse foods to pick from.
Freshman,5,"I currently love the diverse, welcoming environment at Portland State University! I would change the amount of classes offered in specific departments, because I feel more courses could be available in specific areas."
Senior,5,"Portland State offers a huge variety of courses and majors and within majors you have a great amount of freedom to study the specification of your choice. There are clubs for every interest you could possibly have and resource centers for any needs. There are a lot of job opportunities for student both within the school itself and in the city, and you can easily make connections in your field."
Freshman,5,"There is a very diverse student base, and a lot of professors whose main goal is to help students succeed."
Junior,5,"I like Portland State University because it is located in downtown Portland, Oregon. It is surrounded by beautiful parks and offers the major that I'm interested in."
Junior,5,What I appreciate most about Portland State University is that it's local and accessible for anyone from the community.
Junior,5,Professors care about their students. There always someone willing to help. The offer great courses.
Senior,5,I like that this college has a wide range of classes. There are multiple student centers. They have a health center for students who cannot afford to go to the hospital. But the main thing I would change is the out of state tuition to be decreased.
Sophomore,5,I have not yet started at Portland State but am excited to join this school in the Fall. The transfer staff was extremely helpful in answering questions.
Senior,5,"I transferred to PSU because they offer many options for online study. After transferring, I was pleased to discover that not only do they have many classes to choose from, but the quality of the online classes is also high. I have been enjoying my classes and I appreciate all the instructors who take the time to teach online as well as in the classroom."
Freshman,5,"There are lots of opportunities available in any field of study in this university.  Mainly because of the location and it connected to so many important organizations that you could find jobs, internships."
Junior,5,Portland State University makes you feel like home. It is diverse and friendly; you would meet people from all sort of cultures similar to you and different.
Sophomore,5,The overall feel of the community is very comfortable and accepting. I enjoyed the teaching styles of each professor I've had so far. They really try to help each student to succeed.
Senior,5,Portland State University is college in the middle of a small city. The population at PSU is diverse and open minded community. With many different majors to choose from. I even want to come back for Grad School here!
Graduate Student,5,"Portland State University provides several online graduate programs of which social work is one. I have very pleased with the courses I have taken. The professors have been accessible and knowledgeable. It is hard to imagine being in class doing group projects with someone from Rhode Island, California, Washington and Oregon at the same time. The classes have been very relevant to my current work. The school's assistance with my internships has been greatly appreciated."
Freshman,5,excellent teaching staff and classes are small enough for great in depth discussions. I'm in the music program and it is totally worth your time and energy
Sophomore,5,I love the diversity Portland State has to offer. Located in downtown Portland you get a city vibe that other campuses don't have. There are many activities to do during the day as well as night time.
Junior,5,"I have had an amazing experience so far at PSU. I transferred from my community college earlier this year, and while the classes are definitely higher level, it is not something that cannot be done."
Senior,4,"Good school, not many complaints. Some professors are invested in their students, while you can tell others are not. I wish there would be more regulations regarding the homeless people on campus."
Niche User,4,"Not ideal, but it worked out. Do NOT be afraid to ask questions because chances are someone else in your zoom class is struggling too."
Niche User,4,"Very diverse school and learning environment making it so you learn much more about people, experiences, and things you never thought about without even being in the classroom. Amazing people, food, and endless places to visit nearby. Classes are big though with less personal connection with professors if you do not stand out or ask questions."
Senior,4,I feel the classes are very limited to liberal arts degrees - not many options for hard biology and health studies.
Junior,4,"I have been mostly very happy with my time at PSU. The classes I've taken so far have all been interesting and I've been lucky enough to get good teachers. I would say my biggest complaint is the amount of teachers with terrible reviews (which I have discovered are important to look at when considering which classes to pick!) makes it slightly difficult to take the classes that I want when I want to. I think this is something that many schools probably struggle with. I've felt welcome in the community though, and I think the new president of the school is taking the right steps to keep PSU progressing to be a better school."
Junior,4,"During my first year in Portland State University, I did not really know what I was doing. I was not the best person I could be, and unfortunately, the things that got me sidetracked affected my grades and ability to learn. That being said, they have a great community and resources that have brought me back up, and now I am better than my first year, consistently trying to improve each time. As a biology major, their department is very useful, the professors may be strict, but are understanding, knowing that the material that we possess is really difficult to grasp in the beginning. They have many cultural associations as well, which brings out the best in diversity, making a welcoming environment for different cultures. It isn't too boring around campus either, there are a lot of places around where people can grab a bite and hang out. However, I do wish that a lot of the campus buildings were cleaner and had more strict security regarding outsiders, but campus has been enjoyable."
Junior,4,"When everything became online, it was a quick shift from physical classes, but given the short notice, Portland State University reacted and responded the best way they can (at least for my classes). Many classes decided to utilize Zoom meetings instead, and for the classes that didn't, they created video recordings for the students to go on whenever they can. Obviously, as it was a sudden shift, students were not too motivated to learn the same way as in class lectures, but I still give props to the effort that the University put in so we could still continue our Spring term. It was hard to stay motivated while staying at home the whole time, but it was easier when the professors were there with office hours to help us learn, and in some cases even help us with how to keep being driven. It is not fun to have online classes in my opinion, but Portland State made online experience better to handle."
Freshman,4,"I don’t do well with online in general. In the past I have taken my laptop somewhere public where there aren’t any distractions. It’s a little difficult to do that with COVID. However this is more of a reflection on myself. So if you aren’t easily distracted or if you are highly motivated and don’t procrastinate then you’ll be fine. Otherwise, you’ll have to work a little harder like me."
Sophomore,4,"Coming in as a freshman, there were many clubs and people one could talk to to get help. Everyone Including teachers were welcoming to not just me but the whole freshman class."
Sophomore,4,"I'm on my third degree from PSU, and overall I've had a great experience through three separate departments! The University Studies program also offers a unique way to get your general education requirements, and still focus towards a minor or at least an interest of yours."
Sophomore,4,"Like most schools, we did Spring term completely remote, and all my professors were very good at adjusting to the new format. We had live weekly check-ins, and one class even had live lectures with individual chatrooms for doing worksheets together."
Sophomore,4,Portland State is a diverse college that is in downtown Portland. It is a very liberal college focused on many different areas of study with very supportive professors.
Sophomore,4,"Online learning has had a huge impact in every Portland State University these past months. My overall experience has been great, however one piece of advice I give is to stay on top of your homework and papers. Some teachers don't host Zoom meetings, only assignments and readings. With no exact time frame for the class it can lead some students fall behind or forget about assignments."
Sophomore,4,"The Professors made learning online easy and acceptable. Although it was a difficult start to learning and teaching online, there were a lot of great resources available if you needed help with any academics or having any trouble with anything."
Sophomore,4,"Portland State University is the most diverse college in the state of Oregon. With that it makes it a top choice for many minorities, PSU has a lot of great programs available to help with the inclusion and diversity and they have a really amazing campus."
Senior,4,"The school's response to the coronavirus was great! They made the students feel like our wellbeing came before anything else.  Resources that were offered to each one of us depending on what we needed.  I was given in the mental health and transportation resources whereas some of my friends that live on campus really needed health care when they were all quarantine.  the school refuses to send everybody back just for the sake of not losing money and they're putting their students wellbeing first, whatever that looks like. I also attended the School of Business which has had a lot of online presence in terms of taking classes through that D2L and also our instructors are very well versed in the technologies used for us to be able to be successful online. At the other  colleges within the university I hear they  really struggled.  I have my point of view from a very well-oiled machine that is the School of Business."
Sophomore,4,PSU offers a variety of programs and resources that were helpful to me as a student. The professors that I had were passionate about the course and easily accessible.
Sophomore,4,"Although there were a few technical difficulties, most of my online courses provided quality content and numerous outside resources to help me succeed academically."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy the urban environment at Portland State. The campus is in the heart of downtown Portland, extremely pedestrian and biker friendly, and at the center of a highly efficient public transportation system to get you anywhere in Portland. The professors in my program have all been very engaged and clearly love what they teach. It definitely not for those looking for a ""typical"" college experience. There are many adult and returning students, and most of the students commute. It is a very specific vibe, but I enjoy that about it as I was not looking for a typical college experience."
Junior,4,"I took a couple online courses before COVID-19 and the subsequent shutdown of the campus, which were okay. It really depended on the professor. However, all of my classes are online at least for now, and the professors have adapted the best they can and are truly making the best out of a very unexpected situation."
Sophomore,4,"Great school if you are looking to major in Psychology, as there are a broad number of classes and passionate professors. this is a ""commuter"" school so don't expect a college experience, but your chances of this would be higher if you plan to live on campus. Everyone is very independent and it has a vibe of community college."
Alum,4,"PSU is not the traditional college experience. However, you get a good value and it is a college education. Being a commuter school there is a lack of school spirit, everybody is in and out. Which might not be ideal for some, however, there's people who enjoy the fast paced life style."
Junior,4,I love going to Portland state I wish it was not as far to drive to as it is for me. I love the feel of the campus everyone is very welcoming and excepting of everyone else.
Sophomore,4,"I thoroughly enjoy my time at Portland State University. I find it to be an extremely vibrant campus due to it's prime location and there is no shortage of activities, classes, and a diverse student body."
Niche User,4,You'll very much get out of PSU whatever you put into it. The school's goal seems to be to make sure students have exactly what they need to get into grad school or to start their careers - without any unnecessary fluff.
Alum,4,"Instructors were very helpful. Would like to see more tutoring available and more evening and weekend class options. Online classes should be less expensive than in person classes, not the other way around. Parking options need improvement as not everyone lives in Portland (on street parking recently decreased in time). Overall a really positive experience with helpful and caring instructors."
Alum,4,"Portland State was a great University. The staff and students were pretty welcoming, and the tuition was for in-state students.  They had a lot of great programs and diverse class options. I got to express a lot of creativity and make new friends as well.  I also studied abroad! There were definitely lots of opportunities here. The location was also nice because it was right in the middle of Downtown Portland so there was always something to do  before, after, and between classes."
Sophomore,4,"Everything about the campus is great and there are so many food options. What makes it better is how open minded all staff and students are. It creates a very welcoming environment, especially for myself."
Niche User,4,"I'm a post-bacc, pre-grad school student at PSU doing hard science pre-requisites I need for a health professions program. 

I've had no problem getting into the classes I need at PSU so far. The quality of instruction for Anatomy & Physiology has been really satisfying-- my PSU professor has taught at medical schools, dental schools, and physician assistant programs in the past. I feel that his instruction will help me be very prepared down the road. I am satisfied with the level of resources available as well (tutoring, whole-body donor labs, etc)."
Sophomore,4,"It's very affordable, though I wish they had more majors in the art department. The community is okay, but the campus safety is very good."
Niche User,4,I think the campus is very big and is bizzare but I think thats actually really cool and interesting that the campus is in the middle of the city rather than a small college town.
Freshman,4,Portland State University prides itself on its diversity. My experience on campus was so welcoming and friendly. They show so much support and adoration for their wide range of students. My only issue that I have encountered so far is the advisors. It took me a couple meetings and advisors to really find the best fit for me.
Freshman,4,The teachers care about their students and want to see them succeed. I also like that the campus is intertwined within the city. One thing I would like to change is the general studies requirements. I would like to take more classes related to my major earlier than wait till Junior or Senior year to start focusing on my major.
Sophomore,4,"I love Portland State University. I love campus and I love the facilities. Being on the cross country and track team at PSU is one of the best things I’ve ever done. If I could change one thing about PSU it would be just getting the community to support the athletic programs more as well as the school in general. It’d be great the see the Stott Center packed with people from the community, alumni and every day fans alike."
Junior,4,"Portland State University has provided me with a unique college experience, with a campus all throughout the city, local resources are readily available. The school has several resources that I haven’t had at other colleges I went to before transferring to Portland State University such as the Women’s Resource, Queer Resource Center, and overall groups created by students that pique my interests. The instructors are very supportive and push you without excessive stress or fear of failure. The only thing that I would want to change about Portland State is aspects of the student body there is a negative air that some students hold and a general lack of diversity, which sadly reflects the demographics of the city."
Freshman,4,"There are so many resources at Portland state. It is also in downtown so there are many sight seeing. The professors and colleagues are amazing and friendly. However, they do advertise a lot on being diverse, I don't feel like that is an appropriate advertisement (because it is not at all that diverse). Other than that it is an amazing place to go to school at, especially with so many majors and classes that is offered."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, PSU is a good school. So far, the professors have been nice and always make time for students. When it comes to school diversity, PSU prides itself on being diverse, yet in the classroom, I have personally seen little to no diversity. The same can be said about the staff, but we must also take into consideration the diverity of the state, which is nonexistent. The biggest issue for day-to-day students (in my opinion) would be campus safety. There are only a few classroom buildings that are secured with ID entry, which makes it really easy for anyone to come in and out of the buildings, even if they're not students. Last year during the spring term, there were several cases of girls being recorded in the bathroom. PSU should definitely try and do something about campus safety in those aspects. When it comes to campus life and the campus itself, I can say that it is definitely nice, especially the newer buildings."
Senior,4,"Portland State University has a diverse, welcoming student base. Teachers are consistently helpful, though hybrid and online classes often suffer from PSU's established systems. Unfortunately, inflexible leases and consistently raising tuition prices has the tendency of pushing middle-class students away. The financial situation at PSU is probably the biggest issue, with frequent corruption and greed exhibited by the higher-ups. Certainly not a party school, PSU is much more home to commuters and transfer students, rather than local frats."
Junior,4,I like the amount of programs there are. If you look there are programs that pair you up with a mentor and they help you throughout your college experience.
Senior,4,"Portland State is a beautiful campus, that offers an array of degrees and programs that may meet your educational needs."
Junior,4,"The dorms are not up to par with how much you have to pay for them. There's little room for financial flexibility for someone to get set up in one. 
The professors are nice, only there's no ethnic or racial difference between them. Maybe the least diverse cohort on the campus."
Alum,4,"Overall, I was blessed to find myself surrounded by brilliant minds and excellent professors. Though, it took me some time to get to that point. Guidance was given by students rather than department advisers which caused contradiction in terms of requirements."
Freshman,4,"Portland State is located right downtown. The urban campus is home to many delicious food carts an a beautiful library. Despite being in a city, Portland has many trees and nature in and around the city. The campus is diverse with many different programs and degree options."
Junior,4,"Well known for it's excellent education! Very, very good business school! I attend the School of Business and I am in my Junior Year here. Excellent athletic center for all to use, many student functions and free food offerings. Beautiful dorms!"
Senior,4,"Portland State University is placed within a continuously changing city, with diversity growth occurring exponentially. This university is unique not only in its location, but the way students are encouraged to explore and obtain a different perspective of the world around them. Often times this school encourages students to take classes which are not related to only their major, thus allowing the student to feel as though they have truly chosen the correct major/career for themselves. Groups, activities, and programs provided are utilized by the majority of the student body in order to feel a sense of security and belonging , and the school encourages students to be involved within these programs to obtain the best possible experience from their school."
Freshman,4,"I love the community. When I am at PSU, I feel like I am at home. Also, the academics are challenging in a good way."
Sophomore,4,"Portland State is very welcoming to incoming students, and engaging professors and courses allows students to settle in right away. Freshman events around move in days, like tours, lip syncs, and drag shows give a good opportunity for freshmen to make new friends in a safe place.

While the Dining Hall food isn't always the best, there's not much else to complain about.

The campus is great, with a free street car for students needing to get to classes that would otherwise take awhile to walk to, and street car transportation is reliable. Despite Portland being known as a crazy over the top city, there actually isn't much night life (at least around campus) so it has always felt and been safe for me to go out at night on walks, and feeling safe at night is a big deal for a teenage girl. All in all, it's a good campus with good people, and professors who want to challenge and help you succeed."
Junior,4,The teachers are pretty nice and helpful alothou some can be rude and not willing to help you. The campus is really nice but there are a lot of homeless people so be safe and aware. There are a lot of activities going on on campus which is a great place to relax and socialize! The library is amazing!!! Perfect place to study! Also if your ever hungry there is food all around the campus!! The food carts are my favorite.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the area and the campus as a whole. The professors are good at getting back to you and I get the sense they really want to help. The gymnasium has a lot of options like rock climbing, a lap pool, and weights."
Graduate Student,4,The campus is very diverse. I felt welcome in all of my classes and always felt like I could voice my opinion.
Alum,4,"It's a very large campus spread out throughout the city of Portland.  I liked that the commute to and from my house was fairly short.  The teachers were very knowledgable, helpful, and wanted the students to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"PSU is a good university for possible students. It is in the heart of downtown Portland so there are many things to do around the school. The school also works with OHSU, which is great for students wanting to go into anything in the medical field. I have had great professors, who not only lecture well, but have tried their best to ensure their students are not only successful in their classes, but also with their future career goals. I would highly recommend this university to others."
Sophomore,4,"Wish the dining hall food was better, wish they had better and MORE vegan options. Keep in mind that food cross contamination for vegans is there , saw them cook a vegan patty in the same area as the real meat patties."
Junior,4,"I love how there are so many clubs and organizations to be a part of, there's never a dull moment on campus! Anyone will feel welcome to campus right away and will feel belonging, especially if anyone is from out-of-state. The only thing I would like for PSU to change is to have a smaller amount of students in a class since Portland State is a very big University, having a professor to teach a smaller classroom is a lot more beneficial to the teacher themselves to keep track of and students getting enough attention in class."
Senior,4,I liked the diversity of classes as well as students. The urban campus feels very unique and makes a good education environment. I would like to see more flexibility in classes with schedules.
Junior,4,"Portland State Universty is very serine and green campus. From my experience, all my professors have been great and increditibily passionate about their subject of teaching. One thing that I do not like is the SINQ and Cluster themes which forces us to take classes outside of our major... what is this high school? Tutiton is expressive to be taking classes that will not benefit me in my career."
Senior,4,"Portland State is a great school. The students are very friendly and encouraging. Since it's located in the heart of the city you get to experience all the energy of the city. The professors are excellent but some can be a little quirky. If you want a progressive, fun, and engaging school, PSU is for you."
Senior,4,"I had many issues with figuring out my financial aid when I first started at PSU a few terms ago. It eventually got figured out but was pretty stressful at the time. I felt like my financial aid adviser was not actually interested in helping me reduce my tuition. Big surprise. It was a student working in the Financial Aid office that ended up saving me.  Other than that, the campus and transportation to and from it is excellent. I have had wonderful professors and I think I will be out of here quick thanks to efficient advisers."
Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my time here and the professors. If you are not liberal then you may seem better to go somewhere else. But if you love the environment then this is a great school! All the professors I have met are super understanding and work with anyone. Also, class sizes are awesome!"
Sophomore,4,"The professors really care about your education and are there to prepare you for the real world. I love being in the city, and the atmosphere is like no where else. Not to mention, the street of food carts is a plus!!!"
Senior,2,"The only online class I've done have been during COVID-19, and they were a little messy. However, this was an emergency situation, so I understand. However, some professors try to port their in person class to online without thinking much about the format, so be careful! We have a lot of old-fashooned professors here who aren't great with technology, but they get by."
Sophomore,2,"Really cool location and cool looking campus. Way to expensive for what you get. Professors were often distracted and uninterested in the students and their curriculums. I hated it here and would suggest any other public university in Oregon or Washington. Left after getting an Associates Equivalent and left for another University with much better professors and Student life, and finished my Sociology degree somewhere else. There were a few professors that had an impact on me but about 75% of them made me question why I chose to shell out so much money for such a mid tier school. Overall I do not recommend at all. Also, while I was there I would get a notification at least weekly about campus lockdown because of someone on campus carrying a weapon/threatening assault."
Junior,2,"This campus does not have a very welcoming vibe. All the resource centers in Smith including student government are on floors above the 1st and don't bother to interact much with students via campus events. Also, campus public safety is armed which should never happen. Go elsewhere."
Sophomore,2,Feels like a community college with 20000 students. Often times felt like professors would put in minimal effort. I also felt as if I had questions or was struggling it could be hard to meet face to face with professors because of extremely limited office hours.
Senior,2,"The campus is very pretty and I love that it is in downtown. The faculty I've had are stellar people but the academics are not rigorous and for what we have to pay for college now a non-rigorous academic experience feels lazy and not worth my money. The facilities offered to students I find lackluster at best. The services offered to students are truly awful, mostly because they don't do what they say or the staff is terrible, sometimes outwardly mean, one department of note is financial aid. There is no traditional community feel for this college, it is difficult to make friends and there is very little support for students who need community. The administration is out of touch with the student body and refuses to be accountable. 
 This is an average university at best unless you're in a select few programs. Mostly, you have to work independently if you want anything substantial out of this education."
Senior,2,Portland State is a great school for business and health sciences but that's it. Every other major is irrelevant. There is not a strong campus environment because it is a commuter school. If you attend this school you are only doing so for school; nothing else.
Senior,2,All of the schools within the college are uncoordinated. The financial aid department is not accurate and argues with students
Freshman,2,"Portland State University is a school made up of  largely commuter and older students. This leaves the students that live on campus with little community to connect with. There is hardly any school spirit as most all of the sporting events have low attendance. Unless you are an athlete, it is very difficult to find and make friends due to the urban campus and the large commuter population. We are located in downtown Portland which is the best thing about the school. Since there is usually nothing happening on the weekends it is convienent to take the public transportation downtown and hang out. There is a large homeless population in Portland which makes the area feel unsafe to walk around at night."
Junior,2,"The campus is in a really annoying location, being downtown isn't a good thing. It feels unsafe most of the time and it's too expensive to live anywhere nearby so the commute is guaranteed to be ages. Once some guy drove by and brandished a gun and the most they did was send a text alert. The campus is spread out over several blocks, some of which are in buildings that are clearly not meant to house classrooms, like a Chase bank. A lot of classrooms have no windows and terrible acoustics and class sizes are always huge. For what you pay to attend it feels like going to public school all over again. This campus is just such a pain to get around and have classes in that it's hard to motivate myself to go."
Junior,2,"I like the school and campus, but I don't like the fact that they make up their own General Ed because a lot of my credit from community college didn't transfer. They also are not very organized at all in admissions, financial aid, or residency. I had to bug them about my admission before fall term. They did not let me know that they were waiting on documents from me, I had to ask them several times. They also cancelled my application for no reason and I finally got it approved before the very last orientation for the term. It's December and I still haven't got my financial aid or loan because they failed to tell me that I need my high school transcripts when they sent me notice that they need my high school diploma. I just barely got my residency status changed after waiting almost two months. They only changed it because I kept emailing them."
College Sophomore,2,Pretty old buildings with expensive room & board to go along with it.
College Freshman,2,It's hard to get a job on campus because it's really compitive with peers.
College Freshman,2,"I had been attending Liberty High School for 2 years now and in general terms, it wasn't how I expected it would be. I had trouble fitting in, or in other words, adjust, socially speaking, with the crowd. It wasn't unlike my other school that I had been previously attended while I was in San Diego, and fit in with a wide array of people. But on the other hand, I did manage to make a handful of great friends that I am proud to still have and teachers that I can still connect to this day and rely on them for support, they had been like a family to me and that matters a lot. In this environment to which we get use to, I believe that so much support, whether it's from your parents, peers or teachers in the community, it's their commitment and courtesy of making a sacrifice for you to reach your goal. That is what matters. In another aspect, I do believe what make my school unique is how impressive the sports and the staff are, and the fact how many students reach out into joining sports and finding something that can show or find their inner identity, or be something that they can do whether it's for a college scholarship or simply doing for fun. For me, personally, I did manage to did 2 sports while at Liberty, track and tennis from my Junior and Senior year, respectively. This is one aspect that I know for certain that makes my school unique."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life at Portland State is very small. For women, there is only one sorority and they are nearly unheard of and don't have a house. Only one fraternity is popular and well-known at Portland State."
College Freshman,2,Most of the students don't care about varsity sports.
College Freshman,2,"I am not a supporter of Greek life, and therefor I do not see it as a positive aspect to any school other than helping people make friends."
College Junior,2,We have one fraternity and one sorority. And the sorority doesn't even have a house so i'm not sure if they even count.
College Freshman,2,I've never been caught even though I'm constantly using drugs and alcohol.
College Sophomore,2,There's always sketchy people around campus begging for money. If you don't give them money they will do things like threatening to rape or kill you.
College Sophomore,2,PSU cares more about making money then students.
College Junior,2,"The only reasons why I currently attend Portland State are because it's close to my parents' and RELATIVELY affordable , and because it's located in Oregon's biggest city, which is important for my music degree. Almost everything else about the school is not so good, but some of my complaints may have to do with my choice of an arts major instead of a more businesslike major, like business itself or engineering. I've heard the business program is great.

There are countless fees for the dumb-est things that a student doesn't even use, parking is AWFUL, no one who works at the school (professors, advisers, and admins alike) knows anything about what is going on and what a student needs to do for his or her degree, administration is bloated and professors are rewarded for passing students who don't deserve it (my classes at community college were more difficult than those at Portland State!), the campus is urban but has next-to-no community feeling to it, the football team is a joke, Lincoln Hall always smells like ammonia and sewage, the professors hate their jobs, the school has next to no visual appeal apart from the Park Blocks, and so on. I have no idea what my thousands of tuition dollars are going towards, but it sure isn't anything that has to do with the student experience. Ok, rant over."
College Freshman,2,Most off-campus housing is over priced and not worth it unless you are living with your parents.
College Freshman,2,"I chose this school because it was marketed as affordable and that seems to be the exact opposite. I have gotten little to no scholarship through the school. Anytime I try and have a one on one meeting with financial aid it feels like they are rushing to get to the next person. I have had no guidance or help with applying for scholarships, or looking for them even when I have reached out."
College Freshman,2,Let's just say that I'm excited to not have a meal plan next year.
College Junior,2,There are no parties and the party scene is unlikely to affect your experience
College Freshman,2,"The food at our dining hall (Victors) is pretty terrible and often really limited. As someone who works, I barely can even get one meal in a day which is really disappointing considering I'm forced to pay for it as a freshman student."
College Student,2,"Not much of a party scene, there are no houses near campus."
College Freshman,2,"PSU Administration operates the school more as a business than an academic institution. They do not care so much about implementing the rules for the sake of the students, but for their own reputation."
College Freshman,2,"Don't call the financial aid office, they'll talk in circles. Just wait in lines and consult in person."
College Freshman,2,What is greek life at PSU?
College Freshman,2,Best bet - get something close to max line
Recent Alumnus,2,"PSU housing is very expensive.  I lived on the single sleeper unit with community bathrooms and kitchen.  I chose the single sleeper because it was least affordable.  However, the community bathroom can be very messy because some students would not just care about cleaning up after themselves as to make the bathroom clean for the next student.  The bathroom cleaners comes ones a week or ones in two weeks.  The school housing should know that not because they have a single sleeper unit made available to students who can't afford private bathrooms should not mean that community bathrooms be left in a bad order.  What I mean is this- there are various student personal hygiene habits that can be very irritating when it comes to the sharing bathrooms with 15 or more other students.  They should make amends in having the community bathrooms cleaned at least ones a day with out increasing the cost of the unit.  Some students also violates the drug free environment on the school dorm.  The hall way I resided always had bad odor.  During winter, it's warm in the sleeper unit; however, it is controlled by the school.  However, during summer, you will literally boil in your room because of heat.  If you live on the basement, you would feel more cold in winter and in summer it would just be cool.  The campus housing covers internet, trash, water, and lights."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I used to live in the school dorms.  The shared community bathrooms were often in a bad situation.  Bathrooms were cleaned ones per week, instead of on a daily basis.  This is a true experience that I had while I was still on the campus dorm.  If it was a private bathroom, cleaned ones per week or ones per month, that will be understandable.  But this a community bathroom- meaning shared by other students  (male and female) you are not even sure if they have some communicable disease.  I believe that public health should be promoted on the campus community dorms.  Sometimes, some student leaves a mess (hairs, etc) on the bathroom sink or the bathroom tub.  I remember one of my next door neighbor in the dorm, had a skunk odor coming out of his room; I had no doubt if someone told me that he had a Skunk as a pet in his room.  Whenever he opens his room door, this skunk odor explodes the entire hall way for hours.  It was horrible.  I would NOT recommend single sleeper room/ community bathroom in Portland State University.  The private room and bathroom are way much better but more expensive.   That is the truth I can share about the single sleeper room with community bathroom."
College Freshman,2,"Little to no parties here, the most I have heard of have be about 20 people in a dorm room. But after some sporting events I have heard that there are some parties. But here people usually just have kickback styled parties with a few people."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is pretty non-existent here at PSU. There are a couple frats but only one has a house and there is only one sorority and they don't have a house either. It was pretty competitive to get into the sorority this year because they had over 60 applicants but the frats were fine. You don't come to PSU for the greek life, it is pretty much non-existent."
College Freshman,2,"Athletics aren't big on campus, but the athletes are super cool."
College Freshman,2,Not the worst but not the best either. We are not well-known for our sports because they are not doing too well. Students still have school spirit though!
College Student,2,I got a loan removed without a notice because of a scholarship I had recieved
College Sophomore,2,I haven't been to a college party yet because I haven't heard of any going on!
College Junior,2,They don't really like to work with you and they take forever to review your forms. You have to bug them a lot to get them to do it.
College Freshman,2,Who cares about the sports teams?
College Junior,2,"There are not a lot of involvement between student athletes and non student athletes. I am an athlete myself and no one even knows that my team exists, only other student athletes. Even if we are a winning team.... I think that if the football team won a little more, the student body would be more involved in sports."
College Junior,2,"I honestly think they could be better, but then again, we are adults and we pay to have the full college experience."
College Freshman,2,"There is only one sorority and fraternity at PSU, and the desire to join both is pretty low among the student body. Their presence on campus is practically nonexistent and there is no Greek life housing."
College Freshman,2,"You have to be 21 to be involved in most of the nightlife here because the on-campus college bars are the most lively places during the weekend. There are some get togethers you can find if you're not 21, but it is difficult and they are not very big."
College Sophomore,2,Way too expensive since theyre close to a big college
College Senior,2,"It's completely unfair that when you are still dependent on your parents because your own salary is tedious then you are not eligible for financial aid, when there are plenty of pot-smoking students who drain all of the money they earn from financial aid on everything other than education. 

It's completely unfair that the only option I have to pay for college is by using federal student loans or paying out of pocket."
College Junior,2,Most students at this school are more focused in the arts. The athletic teams are not the best and no one seems to care to watch.
College Senior,2,"I hated it just because I was in an older dorm and the room was always cold! Windows were old and always let in cold air, also the people there were just so clique-y it just was a pretty lonely place."
College Junior,2,It is very limited and expensive. There is usually no parking or you pay extra for parking.
College Junior,2,"I have never qualified for financial aid even though I am financially independent because I am under 24 so they consider my parent's income, which is too much to get any aid but not enough to be able to afford a college education. It is incredibly frustrating."
College Senior,2,"century old buildings that would be condemned if not owned by the university, or, private for-profit corporations that regularly violate laws regarding living areas."
College Senior,2,"The people make this worth while, but the school is just a meat grinder of administrative costs lining their pockets by forcing students into classes they don't need and wont use."
College Senior,2,"It's a monopoly of ""education"" which serves only to employ sub-rate professors and has no intention of actually offering an education of any kind. Prerequisite courses and administrative garbage prevent actual attainment. Offensive professors degrade students at every opportunity."
College Sophomore,2,Overpriced housing and parking is absolute hell. Just live outside of town and take public transportation in. It's easier and cheaper.
College Junior,2,More guidance and problem solving with the students would be nice
College Sophomore,2,"Although there isn't an abundance of usage on campus, drugs are pretty accessible and there hasn't been too much of a public effort to stop usage."
College Junior,2,i would love one not to many out there i am scared don't think there will be work for me
College Freshman,2,really unless you have a masters resume and many many letters of recommendation you have no chance of scholarship. Also its mostly for people with a high GPA not financial aid need.
College Freshman,2,"really never heard of any parties that really look nice, barely any at all."
Alum,1,Throughout my four years I had many discussion groups and many of times the students were not mature enough to have a real discussion or talk about differences of opinions without immediately labeling each other and claiming very serious titles.  I met few students who took their education seriously and a lot of students casually glided through each class without real direction.  I would recommend another state school if you have the opportunity.
Graduate Student,1,"Advising is a complete joke. I was in the business program for accounting and I was told by two different advisors that I would be CPA eligible by the time I graduated (225 total credits & bachelor's degree). When I applied to take the exam, the BOA said I was short by 5 credits - which cost me $150 (non-refundable). They completely miscounted my credits which I thought was the entire point of advising. Plus, their response was pretty much telling me it was my fault. Make sure you manually count your own credits because apparently the advisors can't do basic math. I'm escalating this to the Dean and probably the Better Business Bureau because this isn't okay, plus it effects my job."
Freshman,1,"I chose to go to Portland State over University of Oregon, and looking back on my year, I do not know why. First off, in my experience and multiple others experiences, this school has been stealing money from students and will suck every penny out of you.The academics are a joke, and I am in the honors college, which I feel is even worse than the regular college itself. If you are not a ""hipster""you will probably not going to want to stay at this school for longer than a year. There is absolutely no party scene so do not come here if you are looking for that.  The athletics are also terrible here, especially the football team.The dorms I live in are nice, but that is only because I am in the honors college.The dining hall here is absolutely disgusting, and probably about 99% of students here would agree with me. Overall, this school is not very good at all, and I am transferring to U of O next year. TAKE YOUR MONEY ELSEWHERE."
Freshman,1,"Usually, I would give this school at least three stars. Good classes, good professors, etc. However, the housing and staff associated with housing is absolutely TERRIBLE. It's extremely expensive for what it is, and almost every staff member I have met is very rude and wants nothing but your money. There is a minimum $100 fine for any violation. Quiet hours are 10:00 every day of the week, and the RA's  do ""rounds"" from 10-10:30 and 12-12:30 every night. If anything can be heard from outside your door, the RA's come in, search your room (with our without permission), and write up everybody in the room. And if you're written up for noise more than 2 times, you will be kicked out of your room with only two days to find a place to go, and you are never allowed back in the building. Half of my floor alone is one write up away from being kicked out, and none of us have been written up for anything but noise! If you do come to PSU, STAY AWAY FROM STUDENT HOUSING!!"
College Freshman,1,"There is only one frat and one sorority, so greek life hardly exists."
College Junior,1,Not my cup of tea.
College Junior,1,"Wholly unnecessary. PSU will never be OSU or U of O, and should stop wasting money on gratituous athletics. Instead, the money should be moved into science, research, foreign opportunities, and overall affordability for the student population."
College Sophomore,1,For me on campus career help is inadequate. They barely do anything.
College Sophomore,1,Greek life here is virtually nonexistent.
College Sophomore,1,You can't even find a locker to store stuff.
College Freshman,1,"The party scene at this school is ridiculously dull. The idea of a good time is either drinking and hanging out in the dorms, or getting high and hanging out in the dorms. It is so incredibly pathetic that it got me to quit drinking."
College Freshman,1,"THERE ARE NO PARTIES! None, anywhere on campus. DO NOT GO HERE"
College Freshman,1,Don't go here and waste your money. Go traditional
College Junior,1,"I never get financial aid because my parents ""make too much money"". but that is not true and i need help paying for college but i never get any financial aid."
College Junior,1,"the campus housing at PSU sucks!!!! Those so called RA's dont care about you 9not that they should) but they dont address the issue when you call them. For instance, you are trying to study but your next door neighbor is having a party. You try to call the R.A but he/she doesn't even answer!!!"
College Junior,1,I only ever hear about the older students going to bars. I never hear about parties in the dorms.
College Junior,1,"By the time I got signed up for classes and got in touch with financial aid, I missed the FAFSA deadline by one day for the summer classes.  I thought 2014-15 worked for summer, but it didn't.  So now I have NO aid for summer.  Not sure what I'm going to do.  Financial Aid Office told me to contact tuition dept and ask to make payments.  When I did that, they told me no such thing."
College Senior,1,"There is no campus life. It's an urban campus in a city that pulses with activities. There is no need for a campus life, there is too much to do anyway."
College Senior,1,"The programs are designed specifically for the young, inexperienced, never been in the field, traditional student. These programs are meaningless to someone who actually has work experiences, and forces students outside their major to make them ""well rounded"" students, regardless of usefulness."
College Senior,1,"WHAT FINANCIAL AID? Scholarships are for the distinct few, loans are for the desperate, and grants are for those who aren't busting their ass working full time while trying to make self improvement by going to school."
College Senior,1,"The school removes personal rights for self protection from students and puts them at risk of injury and death. The school relies heavily on public transit, which ha no security service at all and most of the crime that occurs to students happens here, but students aren't allowed to carry defensive weaponry as a school policy, which directly conflicts with state laws."
College Sophomore,1,"Okay, so I'm an education major and basically I would have to do four years at the normal psu to get my degree THEN I would have to go to their graduate school of education to get my teaching degree. I think that's so stupid cause that's 4 years plus extra. Whereas, if I was at any other university I could become a teacher in 4 years."
College Junior,1,When it's cold and rainy it's terrible! You have to walk outside to get to the building the classroom is in and a lot of the campus is outside
College Junior,1,"This is not a party school. Nobody cares about Greek life. Half the school doesn't even know that we have it. Few parties. Don't really add anything to the school community. Seems like many Greeks are in it for the label. But again, this school has an older average age. Many people here are married with children, some came back because their careers didn't work out, it just isn't a young school. This is not a party school, (unfortunately)."
College Senior,1,"Because of it's location downtown, it is very costly."
College Freshman,1,There's no greek system here practically! They never throw parties or do anything cool. Some of them don't even have houses on campus or anything. The greek system is basically non-existent.
College Senior,1,"i know like one person who is part of a frat, and probably three girls in a sorority. "
College Junior,1,They need to back off a lot and let students fail on their own. Stop pampering them and then punish them harshly
College Junior,1,Sports are dumb here. No one really likes them its borring
College Junior,1,The campus housing director is a judgmental biggot
College Junior,1,Its not a big deal and anyway its the students choice
College Junior,1,It's easy. Everything is easy except trying to get proper financial aid
College Junior,1,there is no greek life or anything cool about frats
College Freshman,1,"It is very difficult to find a scholarship for my needs, considering I am the most basic American college student you can find."
College Freshman,1,"The Greek life is very slow here, with high prices and little value."
College Freshman,1,No one in the regular student body pays attention to the varsity sports.
College Freshman,1,"Portland State says hey are strict about alcohol and drug use, yet they never seem to really crack down on the drug and alcohol use."
College Freshman,1,"I have been berated for standing next to a girl in the elevator and making her feel ""uncomfortable"" because of my presence, but a buddy of mine got let off with a slap on the wrist because he was smoking and drinking in the dorm lobby."
College Freshman,1,The only reason I decided to live on campus is because the bus system in the city is too wacky with lazy drivers.
College Junior,1,"Because PSU is in an urban setting, parking is at a premium.  There are lots available, but depending on the time of day, spots may be all filled"
College Junior,1,I have not received any scholarships or financial aid.  The FAFSA has determined that my parents make too much money to qualify.  But I think their system is faulty.  My parents don't have tons of money to pay my tuition.
College Junior,1,"PSU is mostly a commuter campus and the Greek system is not much of a presence.  There are many other campus clubs, based on activities and interests."
College Senior,1,Public transportation sucks at Portland State.

*This last link provided for those unaware of the gentrification that is occuring in Portland as a result of the ""Education URA"" endorsed by PSU's President Wim Wiewel."
College Senior,1,"Because this school is downtown, there is limited parking and what is available is outrageously priced.  Also make sure to arrive with plenty of time, I have circled around campus for 30-40 minutes trying to find a place to park."
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is rarely heard about and there are extremely limited options.
College Sophomore,1,"Well, its Oregon. Many many people smoke pot and drink. Not very many people will do it on campus, unless you live in the dorms. In the dorms pretty much all of my neighbors smoke."
College Senior,1,"PSU is in the Big Sky conference.  Despite being the largest university in Oregon, athletics and school spirit are nearly invisible, mostly due to the ""commuter"" basis of the student body."
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't enough parking there, and the prices are absolutely ridiculous.  The people you buy your permit from are not very knowledgeable about the rules either."
College Junior,1,"I don't think that PSU is very strict when it comes to school policies.  Since the campus is in the middle of the city, it doesn't have the traditional feel that other campus' have, so that may be a factor in their lax policies."
College Senior,1,"No one lives on campus, so you do whatever you want in your own apartment :)"
College Senior,1,"Parking is expensive, people always get stuff stolen from their cars, There are not enough room for people, and they are really strict on patrolling for parking permits and tickets. But it is necessary to park at school if you drive, and they also get full by 9 or 10, and empty when you don't need them."
College Senior,1,"I personally do not like the North West weather at all, it rains a lot here. Only in the summer is there nice warm/hot weather. It does snow in the winter!"
College Junior,1,"The parking at this campus is way too expensive. I know they are trying to discourage people from driving and to ride their bikes. That's great, but i moved from out of state and i had no other choice but to bring my car."
College Junior,1,"I have always felt uneasy around Portland State's Campus. It is a very unwelcoming atmosphere that tries to promote diversity, however in promoting diversity they fail to deal with the subtlety of the students that attend the college. Many people stare at other people solemnly and there is constant gossip which tends to lead to physical altercations."
College Senior,1,"Rain, Rain, Rain – The weather here is mostly raining, cloudy and depressing at least if you are a person who likes the sun. Here you learn how to appreciate the sun. The good thing of portland State is that its buildings are mostly connected, so we do not get wet going from one class to another. If you like rain this is your place! If not come in summer. It is beautiful!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"Bad for Conservatives – PSU prides itself for diversity, but the truth is that it is only ""diverse"" under a liberal umbrella.  If you have conservative viewpoints, you will probably feel very uncomfortable.  It's a ""you're okay as long as you agree with us"" sort of environment, with not much true dialogue (or civility) between drastically different perspectives."
College Freshman,1,"Rain, Rain, Rain.... Did I Mention Rain? Honestly, most people hate the rain here, but i like it. Only reason I didn't fail this one. Otherwise, landscape is beautiful, natural, and quite serene."
College Junior,1,"Rains All the Time. About the only time when campus is tolerable is during the summer months, when nobody goes to school anyways.  Although most do not, I do, and it is my most enjoyable part of the school year.  Otherwise, you spend so much time walking between classes and being soaked by the time you get there."
College Senior,1,"Parking at Portland State is very expensive and necessary for much of the commuting population. It typically costs between $400-$500 per term to park in the campus lots and street parking is no better. Many students commute via bike, bus, or train to avoid high parking costs. If you get a ticket, the fines are very expensive($43). However, the availability of lots and parking garages is very good."

Freshman,5,"The environment of Cal State LA is very calming, and everyone is welcoming. I have a great experience so far into the year. There are many great resources and opportunities that CSULA provides for their students."
Freshman,5,I have only taken courses online since I am currently a freshman. All my professors have been very understanding of the circumstances.
Alum,5,"I never took any classes online at California State University, Los Angeles. However, friends of mine did take some and they said it was easy to navigate."
Alum,5,I had a great experience at Cal State LA. The advisors were amazing in helping me choose the right path for me.
Senior,5,"During Covid-19, all instructors that i had during the spring 2020 semester and currently in fall 2020 are doing everything in their power to help students out and be there for whatever they need to move forward with their academic goals. Flexibility is of their priority when it comes to the professors at CSULA. Reach out and the professors will be inclined to help, trust me."
Senior,5,"Overall, it’s a great school! Near the San Gabriel Valley, it’s perfect for people residing in LA or in cities of the San Gabriel Valley. The professors are extraordinary and the environment is lively i fell."
Freshman,5,"CSU- Los Angeles is great. Although we are online learning the teachers are understanding about it. They ask us about our mental health and what resources they provide in campus. Also, they offer tutoring if you don't understand the subject."
Senior,5,Faculty and administration and CSULA work hard to help you do your best in college. They provide help with tons of resources and are always super quick to respond. The campus and student life is intimate.
Senior,5,"Online classes were straight forward, teachers were well versed with Canvas so nothing too confusing. Professors were also flexible in case of technological difficulties."
Junior,5,Being enrolled was an accomplishment knowing that a great program came with attending Cal State LA. It was amazing professors and Counselors were always amazing. When you ask for help it was there. Im glad im attending it and id advise anyone to apply because we all deserve to be attending a great school like Cal State LA
Junior,5,We all love to be on our phones and to have an educational response to give back to our parents is amazing plus time flies by because our professors are great. They try engaging you in anything possible and I stay entertained.
Alum,5,My overall experience was excellent. I made plenty of friends and still maintain contact with many of them.  CSULA alums are excelling in my field.
Alum,5,The school is excellent.  You will be challenged but guided in your academic process.  The learning opportunities at CSULA are endless. I highly recommend this school.  I am an alum and making 6 figures.
Junior,5,The overall experience in the school is great everyone is welcoming from the professors to the staff there. Great school
Junior,5,it was a little bit difficult but the professors made it  work. I wish I was at the campus but I do understand the circumstances.
Freshman,5,"California State University, Los Angeles is  very diverse and open-minded and has many resources for their students"
Freshman,5,"My online experience at California State University, Los Angeles has been excellent. California State University, Los Angeles uses canvas, which is a great tool to submit and remind you about your classes' zoom meeting with their canvas calendar. You can still engage and feel like you're apart of the cal state la community by joining the school's clubs online and attending their online events."
Alum,5,"Overall an awesome school. There were some classes that were hybrid which means that utilizing the internet was a necessity. Online learning experience was exceptional. Faculties and professors made sure that we turn in things on time and in most cases, online learning experience or hybrid enhanced the learning experience because some students are busy or work full-time."
Alum,5,"Overall, an excellent school. Staff, faculties, and everything else in between are very good. The school is very supportive and want you to succeed. You must put in the work just like everything else. It is an affordable school."
Freshman,5,For now my classes are online. My professors know how teach well and they make sure we understand the material.
Freshman,5,I haven't been inside campus yet because of COVID 19 but I like the way how professors are organized with their learning material.
Freshman,5,The professors are very understanding and they try as much as possible to not put too much stress on anyone at the beginning of the school and they seem really great about getting to know everyone.
Freshman,5,My professors and many faculty members are very helpful with straightforward advice and information. It is a great school especially for latino/hispanic students because of the culture.
Freshman,5,Assignments were carefully planned on a calendar and clearly labeled. My professors responded to every email and question I had. Faculty members were respectful of my confusions and questions on the college experience.
Junior,5,"My overall experience at California State University - Los Angeles is exciting, enriching, and insightful because I am able to learn, study, and engage with others and to enhance or broaden my horizon to a better life/career."
Freshman,5,I haven't had that much experience because I am currently an incoming freshmen this fall 2020. But one thing I can say that they provide a lot of resources to incoming freshemen students. And they make sure that each and every student will be ready and prepared for the fall semester. They are really great and I am beyond grateful
Sophomore,5,"All of my professors  were really understanding and went out of their way to make sure all of their students understood the topics and provided us students with what we needed. I thought online classes were going to be a headache, especially since I am a visual learner, but there was some leverage."
Sophomore,5,"I had to use public transportation to commute to campus. All of the public transportation was so accessible and definitely something that was nice to have. Another thing was that the campus is very diverse and the clubs welcome anyone. Another thing, Downtown LA is only a few exits away."
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student who is also a junior in college. My semester didn't start yet, however I heard  really good things about this school. The teachers really care about there students and really want them to be on track for graduating. I met my counselor for orientation online and she really helped me pick all my classes for the fall and also telling me the classes I need to graduate. I cant physically be on campus because of covid 19, however I am sure to have the best fall semester online. Hopefully when covid is over I can physically go for spring semester and start my journey in college. Also meet new people and have a really good experience."
Junior,5,"Yes all my classes for the fall are going to be online. There going to connect with us through canvas, zoom and email. I have not met my teachers yet however the teachers I got have really good teaching ratings. I'm really looking forward with meeting my teachers for the first time and also learning many new things."
Junior,5,I did take courses online last semester. My instructors were fairly effective at utilizing the internet to create a solid learning environment. I have no complaints with my professors.
Junior,5,It's impossible for me to truly know how good this school is as I have not attended a class yet. But I am sure that's okay.
Junior,5,It's impossible for me to truly know how good this school is as I have not attended a class yet. But I am sure that's okay.
Junior,5,"The professors that I have had so far were excellent, funny, and understanding. A lot of them were understanding if we had additional stress outside of education. Many of the students that I have met were kind and easy to talk to. There is also great resources around campus that can help a lot; whether it’s library, help on assignments/essay writing, computer rooms, etc."
Freshman,5,"I have not taking any courses yet but with fall semester 2020 online, I can tell that they have been working hard to make sure this semester runs smoothly even though no classes with be held physically."
Freshman,5,"As an upcoming college freshman, I have been surprised at how well organized California State University - Los Angeles (CSULA) has been even through a pandemic.  While college orientation and this upcoming fall semester are virtual, they do seem to be here for students 24/7, trying to make the high-school/college transition just as smooth as if it were in person.  One thing I would like to see change however is for this college to make it more clear who are the director advisors for students when it comes to overall academic planning.  Other than this, CSULA has a very organized system that is both welcoming and understandable."
Senior,5,"I really love that California State University of Los Angeles has so much diversity, I really like that everyone sees everyone for who they are and that everyone is accepting no matter your race, ethnicity, or gender. I can walk around the campus with out feeling afraid of being judged because I am a Latina women getting her education. I feel very welcomed and at home when I am on campus."
Senior,5,"I honestly was very scared for our university to transfer to online classes because I am a visual learner and I need to see what I am learning, I need to ask questions about what is going on, and now that my classes were online it was very difficult for me to get in contact with my professors or to reach out to other students to ask for their advice about certain assignments. Most students did not get back to me on time and my professors tried to get back to me on time but I knew they had a lot going on as well so I didn’t want to add more to their plate with a student that’s bugging them about an assignment. Towards the end of the semester I found that I kind of got the hang of it and ended my semester with 2 A’s and 3 B’s."
Junior,5,I am fortunate to only live a few minutes from the campus and have a short commute. Listening to fellow classmates complain about their lengthy commutes always makes me feel grateful to be this fortunate. The classes also are relatively small in the Business department and I feel much more involved and willing to have meaningful dialogue in class.

Freshman,5,"Having Calstate LA in middle of rough neighborhoods like mine, helps bring a sense of prosperity. We need that, we are a strong community, with rough patches, but a will to survive and succeed."
Freshman,5,No I didn’t take any online courses This semester. But I will in the future of the semester. In fall 2020
Freshman,5,Always refer to rate my professor when registering for classes. Always try and never give up or be discouraged. Keep pushing no matter how hard it may be. There is help at school and professors as well.
Freshman,5,"Tough to adjust to because of the virus, but made it work. There are professors that want the best for you and it is those that will give you help."
Freshman,5,"I liked the food , the people and the atmosphere. The overall experience is there for a college and i am growing as a person."
Sophomore,5,"Very good. The professor cared they understood the changes we were going through and they land online learning amazing. They helped a lot, every time something new was tough they asked every time if we had any question and if we understood the content of the day."
Sophomore,5,"Cal State La is an amazing campus, everything is straight forward. If we need assistance we can press a button that are located on pathways, if we needed to talk to an advisor options were given such as walk in or appointments. Although they should focus more on student safety, they should be on top of they’re game with safety measurements after all the recent threats."
Freshman,5,"What I have enjoyed about Cal State LA is that there are many people to guide or answer any questions that you have. If you are a first year and apart of Alliance, you can be apart of the Alliance Mentorship Program. The program is first year students being assigned a mentor to help you throughout the year, answering questions and reminding you of  important dates. If you are not a first year or apart of the AMP program there are still plenty of people to contact about any questions. You can contact your academic counselor, or if you are a specific question perhaps for financial aid you are able to call or go to the financial aid office. Cal State LA has much to offer, sleeping pods, game room, gym, career center, student health center and a music hall. The professors are wonderful, respectful and professional yet communicative and easy to get along with. Also there is a transit center on campus so no need to walk a long distance. One thing I would change would be more seating areas."
Graduate Student,5,I have had a great experience at Calstate LA MSW program. The professors are amazing and the small classes make it very conducive to learning and connecting with peers.
Senior,5,"California State University Los Angeles has a great program if you are interested in Accounting. The professors have hands-on experience since they worked with the big 4 firms, and they bring that knowledge to their courses. This makes the courses so exciting. You will not regret choosing Cal State LA to complete your degree."""
Sophomore,5,I love the diverse population at Cal State LA and all the on campus resources. All the professors are always to help you out and they really prepare you for life after college.
Niche User,5,I liked how the School has a gym. The reason why I liked this is because I Love to workout out every day.
Niche User,5,I always have a good time when visiting i seem to always love coming here its just so welcoming and i just always have a good time. i have gone to clubs and checked out their work and they re friendly. they are all hard working and open to help out.
Alum,5,"I love how convenient this school is to everything whether they are libraries, food courts, or going downtown. There is a wide range of diversity and so being here makes you feel very comfortable! Great school and great professors!"
Freshman,5,"Cal State Los Angeles is dedicated to engagement, service, and the public good, offering nationally recognized programs in science, the arts, business, criminal justice, engineering, nursing, education, and the humanities for the students."
Senior,5,"I enjoy their small classes, doesn't feel intimidating. The teachers are really helpful and are passionate about teaching making sure their students learn. The campus is a good size not too big not too small. It's in Alhambra so the neighborhood is decent and they have good public safety that patrols the campus."
Niche User,5,I like the fact that they are very welcoming as a university which makes me feel good and comfortable.  I am looking towards joining this university and achieve my goal.
Freshman,5,"I like the fact that Cal State La is a place filled with lots of opportunities and resources. Some resources I have come across where the health center, writing center, career development center and more. Not only do they provide multiple resources but it’s a diverse school. We can interact with people from different backgrounds beyond the classroom."
Niche User,5,The thing that I liked about the college is their was a diverse culture and I like to see that with schools
Freshman,4,The thing I like about California State University Los Angeles is that they help you when you don't understand something.
Senior,4,"Before attending Cal State LA I was attending a private college up in Napa. Although this is my first semester, Cal state LA has provided me with many opportunities despite the current pandemic. The professors are welcoming and understanding. Even though I wish campus was open in order to be involved more with on campus activities. I am grateful for the helping hand professors have lent throughout times like this. The community atmosphere is highly supportive and it is one of the most diverse campuses I've been to."
Freshman,4,They have zoom calls and record them if you weren't able to go to class. They offer tutoring and have office hours if you have any questions. Professors are very understanding and nice.
Freshman,4,The online learning experience is harder because it is online and we don't have all the resources but the professors have made it easier for us to work online and have made adjustments based on what we have and don't have.
Freshman,4,"Getting ready for the upcoming year the staff and and advisors really were understanding and kind and really help me prepare for the academic year. Once started the professors were the same way and gave us lots of advice for my and my peers as incoming freshman, they even offered resources if we need help with anything."
Freshman,4,"I really love Cal State LA so far as a freshman! They really care about the incoming students and they make a real effort to connect and make things real easy and understandable but hopefully, one thing they can work on is probably giving more details about specific classes that you have to take, but other than that its pretty awesome."
Junior,4,"My online experience at California State University - Los Angeles was very awkward and strange at first, but as time went by is really enjoyed the online experience because it prepared me for the whole Covid-19 situation."
Alum,4,The online courses are well taught. The overall online learning experiences are quite good. Students are able to access a lot of free recourses.
Alum,4,I had my undergraduate degree there. People there are nice and friendly. A lot of resources. It will be better if they can have more healthy food choices at school cafe.
Freshman,4,CSULA has many resources for every type of student and their educational needs. There are support groups and study halls that can help with any  school subject or personal need.
Freshman,4,"Due to the pandemic CSULA transitioned to online instruction. To ensure their students were able to get access to their classes and assignments they distributed laptops and hot spots to those who needed them. Instructions were very clear and there was constant support from professors, counselors and classmates. With all the resources provided to me I was able to feel secure in my education and take the initiative to make better educational goals."
Junior,4,"I like that the university is affordable, and close-by. They have everything I need for my education. I wish the classrooms were more up to date though."
Junior,4,"The online experience is a bit stressful to me as I have to make sure I do not miss any assignments or online class meetings. The professors do a great job providing a similar environment as in person when using online. Not only that, but many of my professors record the lectures and put slides for us to see if we ever miss anything."
Senior,4,"I came from a community college and the transition between my cc and Cal State was so seamless. There’s a lot of transfer students, great university for California transfers."
Senior,4,"The online platform is strong, the teachers are adept at giving lectures virtually as well as providing necessary resources to complete assignments."
Junior,4,"The campus is quite and everyone is kind. However, theres not much school spirit or school events. There is a lot of clubs you can join."
Freshman,4,im taking classes online this fall and summer at cal state la. It has been very informal and an interesting learning experience.
Freshman,4,CSULA is a really good college. The professors are nice and understanding. The campus is not to big so you are able to go from one class to the other.
Freshman,4,"I like how the professors are real with you, as to say that they speak on the truth of how the world is but the way you view the world is based on you, their teaching is only for you to hear and take in if you want to or not. They are very open to any idea you have on researching for a project or essay, they get you thinking outside the box not just typical ideas. Something I would like to see a change in however is more access for people with disabilities in order for them to get around campus a bit more easier."
Sophomore,4,I was only there for a semester and a half because of COVID-19 but during my time there I had a lot of fun and felt very welcomed. the majority of people on campus were very nice and helpful. There were a lot of resources that we could use and the staff and professors are very helpful.
Freshman,4,If you’re located in the Los Angeles area it is is fairly easy to get there using public transportation. The people there have all been really nice so far and the ambience is very welcoming.
Senior,4,"I love CSULA! Over the years it’s become my home! The only thing keeping me from rating it 5 stars is that it is more of a commuter campus, so that makes it hard to make close friendships initially."
Freshman,4,"What I like about my school is that there are a lot of available resources that students can use. CSULA is a good school if you want to meet new people. The shared spaces are so welcoming, you might feel out of place at first but trust me once you know your way you will feel as if that is your new home. But I would love for it to make the clubs more noticeable, like sending videos, they have had many mishaps with miscommunication and I wish they kept the students informed on what is going on in the campus. But overall it is a good school to go to. Professors, your first semester make it an easy transition from high school to college."
Graduate Student,4,"Cal State LA is a great campus, and it is pretty diverse in terms of student population. I received both my BA and MA (2010-2018) from CSLA and had a great experience with my department. All of the professors were knowledgeable and approachable. However, I believe a few things that could have improved my experience are having a more diverse faculty (no latino professors), and a more inclusive, student-centered experience. Since there is no ""party scene,"" student life felt a bit isolated. Overall, great learning experience."
Niche User,4,I haven't gone there yet but I am definitely planning on going there for my 2020-2021 year and I am super excited about it.
Freshman,4,I visited cal state la and it was pretty. Everyone was focused and nice. I cant wait to go back and explore and get my degree. I think I will make many friends and ask the professors for help with no hesitation.
Senior,4,"I like the campus diversity. I wish they would have more student internship resources to prepare us for our career field. The professors are all very friendly and very helpful. The campus itself can be remodeled and kept cleaner. Not many healthy food options available. Parking is now better than it used to be. I came here because it is more affordable than other CSU campuses. I would come back to further my education because of the caring professors, diversity, and the cost. Most of the students here keep to themselves unless they are dorming, there are clubs you can join, as well as fraternities and sororities. As long as you try hard in your studies and are passionate about your major there is nothing stopping you from succeeding at CSULA. If you need assistance counselors are always there to support just make sure to book an appointment early on in the semester. Also, make sure to take advantage of the workshops they hold on-campus sometimes they give out free snacks and resources"
Senior,4,I am a senior in high school I'm not sure how CSULA is but from what I have seen & heard it seems like an overall great school academic wise.
Sophomore,4,"CSULA has proven itself to be great academically. In my community, it is often talked down on probably because it is a fever school. Well after just three semesters at CSULA, I am proud to be a student here. There are very hardworking students here and I have met some inspiring classmates."
Niche User,4,"I came here for an experience like no other, and I am enjoying it.  I think that this school has a little bit of something for everyone. Defiantly a great reach school for scholars in Southern California."
Senior,4,Lots of climbing as the school sits on a mountain. Parking is difficult to find and food options are limited.
Sophomore,4,I love that CSULA is so diverse. There are so many different people to meet and become friends with. It's also known for helping students of low income achieve their dreams. We are number one university in the United States in upward mobility. That means we are the most successful university to help a student who started off in low income/poverty become successful once they graduate.
Junior,4,"love Cal State La and it diversity,I really like the resource they offer on campus including the health center, the only thing I would change is better Wifi access."
Sophomore,4,People have their own friends. They’re not really looking out for new friends. It’s hard to hear about parties and the school spirit is not high
Alum,4,"Loved the campus although it could use some renovations within the classrooms. The classrooms tend to give a high school vibe because of old chairs and desks, as if the campus was run off of a high school budget. They have a lot of events on campus and encourage students to use their resources."
Freshman,4,"CSU-LA is a school that is very inclusive of all of their students and offers a variety of resources for their students. They also care very much about the mental health and well being of their students, on top of their academic excellence and offer help on campus for those who need it."
Sophomore,4,The overall experience in this university is great but the parking permit is too expensive and there isn’t much food variety on campus. The campus life is great because of the students.
Freshman,4,"I like the smaller class sizes and liveliness of the campus. The housing area is nicely separated from the campus but close enough to stay involved with on-campus events.
One thing that I would like to change is the number of campaigning groups and people asking students to sign petitions; it can be annoying and sometimes feels like I am forced to sign things that I don't want to."
Alum,4,"Specific programs/ majors in Cal State LA are very well taught with knowledgeable and helpful professors. Academically I have learned and retained a good amount of material that is now helping me greatly in graduate school. On the other hand, some parts of Cal State LA is outdated (especially the library) and could use some renovations."
Alum,4,Very diverse and quick paced school. They need to work on their school spirit and socialization but because it's a commuter school it's understandable that there is often low turnout for events and mingling opportunities. Has a fantastic Nursing program. I went before it turned into a semester school and the fast pace gets you out the door quicker but that did mean more tests and stuff. A good choice for those on a budget!
Graduate Student,4,I really love the fact that Cal State Los Angeles registration process is so self explanatory and well written. Anyone can apply without having questions. I would like to see improvement with parking for students and the amount of guidance/counseling for graduate MBA students. There are only two people in the admission department who can advise and help students which I think could be overwhelming for one person and difficult for the students to get the help they need.
Freshman,4,"The campus here at Cal State La is very beautiful and small. Personally, I prefer small campuses beceause it allows you to get to interact with one another every so often. It allows not only your graduating class to inyteract, but also other grades to socialize along with us. However, I do wish that the  advisors and counselors meeet up with the freshmen or check up on them instad of throwing us out there into the college world. Besides that, this university is the best."
Senior,4,"What I like about this university is the department of Theatre and the professors they have. My stage craft teacher has enlightened me and brought me into a world of craft that I didn’t know I belonged to. For my general education, some professors are more dedicated than others, but besides that it wasn’t terrible. So far my education has been great and the campus is diverse, clean and very green."
Junior,4,I really like the diversity of people on the campus and the easily accessible resources that are available to all different types of students. The Veterans Resource Center is great and they have tons of different programs to help with your future. The size of the campus is small but overall it has been a great experience.
Sophomore,4,It’s a very nice and clean campus. You can go and get the work done. Professors are great and understanding. The school spirt is down but that can improve.
Junior,4,"The campus overall is nice. However, the enrollment tends to be a problem as there are more students being enrolled than there are seats for classes so many get waitlisted."
Freshman,4,"So far, it has felt like home and I've been very happy here. There is a lot of things on campus to stay busy and there are many resources to get things (assignments and such) done in a timely manner"
Senior,4,"Campus has good diversity, a few things I would like to see changed is better professors for Computer Science courses"
Sophomore,4,"I love Cal State LA! Cal State La gives many opportunities for low income students. Their tuition is more affordable than most California universities. It is a commuter school, so you do get to meet many people from all over the greater Los Angeles area. It is also a very diverse community."
Junior,4,Cal State is a great school to attend. There are various activities students can engage in to help make their time at school more enjoyable. The school is great at offering students support both academically and mentally. Students are able to take a break from all the stress and go to the free gym or also take a nap in the pods. Professors strive to make students understand the fundamentals of the course.
Graduate Student,4,I like that CSULA is a very diverse campus with a wide range of students in all different types of backgrounds and experiences that makes the college experience more unique by giving each student a different perspective of how we see the world. The feel of the campus allows you to be the change you want to see in the world.
Junior,4,Great amount of resources to help students succeed. Would like to have more food options across campus.
Freshman,4,"The campus is very considerate of people with disabilities. They have programs for them, DREAMERS, and first-generation college students. A very inclusive college and you always feel belonged to."
Sophomore,4,"I've been at CSULA for 2 years. All of the professors I've had have been extremely kind and willing to put in extra time and effort to learn how they can teach the subject better. Depending on your major, the school will also email you about events hosted by organizations or companies that are looking to hire people for internships or part-time jobs."
Freshman,4,So far as a freshman there is a lot of help and communication. The professors here are very good and try to connect with the class.
Freshman,4,Staff and students are very friendly and the campus holds a safe environment. Very welcoming to new students and over all an amazing campus that is pretty diverse. There are plenty of staff and advisers on campus that help students succeed in passing the course and answer any other questions that students have.
Senior,4,I came in as a transfer student in Fall 2017 and my experience was okay. I really love the Sociology and the Pan African Studies department. They have always been there for me and I could not ask for anything more from an excellent support system on this campus.
Junior,4,"The professors are random and it depends on who you get, the experience can be very different. The campus food court contains Chinese, Mexican, American, and Japanese and other kinds of food which are decent in general but pricey. There are many clubs we can attend but the classes are very conflicted with the club meetings so its been very hard for some people to join clubs."
Freshman,4,"Based on what I've seen at Orientation, CSULA seems like a fun and friendly school to attend. Being an incoming Freshman, I was pleasantly surprised at the amount of diversity and the small size of the campus. I have made phone calls and emails to some departments and offices, all of which helped me with the problems I faced."
Junior,4,What I enjoyed about CSULA is the people and professors you get to meet . There are a lot of good people that help you whenever you need help. There are many resources that can help you through out college and outside of college too.
Freshman,2,I am taking online classes and it's hard to understand some assignments. I am a freshman and I am struggling with all my classes because they give too much homework and quizzes. Some professors don't understand that we have other assignments to do and it's stressful to do it all on time. I am doing my best even though it's hard. I don't have a private space where I could study and pay attention to what they are saying. I get really stressed when I have five writing assignments due in one week.
Junior,2,"This school is a fraud. No school spirit. No fun activities. Poor diversity. I mean this school is literally a joke. The experience can only be okay depending on the person experiencing it. You would really have to go out of your way to find some joy in the college experience. If not, you'll hate it."
Senior,2,"California State University, Los Angeles is very much so a commuter school. I definitely did not get the whole college experience by attending this school. However, more than half of my professors were very helpful and knowledgeable and overall were great teachers. There is not a very big student life on campus therefore I did not make many social connections."
Niche User,2,I used to attend this school until I transferred to an art school that really cares about it's students. I personally didn't have the best experience attending this school. I'm happy that i decided to transfer to a school that I love in every single way.
College Student,2,"There is not enough time for people to focus on sports here at this school. The school spirit is low and since it's a commuter school, everyone leaves once class is over."
College Sophomore,2,There is really hardly any school spirit which hurts. I would like there to be the highest/most genuine kind of school spirit. But the fact that my school is a commuter school makes it hard to turn up the spirit. I do see a lot of students try to joint clubs just to represent the school somehow which I greatly appreciate.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I was a club sports player for 3 years. The team was good and one of if not the only D1 team on campus and the sports office was almost not willing to help us at all with anything.  We had to pay tons of money only to never see where it went.  As far as varsity athletics, they didn't seem popular at all, the school would probably do well with a football team again but the other sports don't seem to be attended that often."
College Freshman,2,"Campus housing isn't the best, it's convenient, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you have to because your international or from outta state."
College Sophomore,2,Since the school is close to Downtown LA it sort of makes up for the lack of parties the students at this school have to offer. Nightlife sucks. Just go clubbing on Downtown.
College Sophomore,2,"No parties, ever. It sucks."
College Sophomore,2,I have visited the career center once but did not find it helpful.
College Senior,2,We really do not have true Greek life on campus at my school.
College Senior,2,Lately there have been a lot of assaults and thefts on campus.
College Junior,2,I honestly just come and go.
College Junior,2,It's not really a big thing here.
College Sophomore,2,"Although the career center often invites firms and corporations to recruit students for internships, student involvement is quite lacking. The Career Center is a very ineffective way to find a job on campus, there has been several situations where the staff loose the applications and fail to turn them in to the department that is hiring."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life at my school is not really popular. In fact, nobody really knows about the fraternities/sororities there are in this school, and the campus is strict on allowing them to have events. Therefore, there is not an eventful greek life in CSULA."
Recent Alumnus,2,It's a commuter school and a lot of people do not stay on campus for very long
College Junior,2,No football team no school  Spirit.
College Freshman,2,"They have it seem as they are really trying to help you with career prospects but they don't really seem to be helpful and don't prioritize it, even though its the reason you went to school."
College Freshman,2,I can never get the classes I need for my major and there's never enough math classes for everyone trying to get in. The school's administration doesn't want supply all the classes need.
College Senior,2,I dont know much about Greek
College Senior,2,CSULA needed more security personnel available on campus.
College Student,2,im not there at night
Recent Alumnus,2,Everything is just too expensive. Might as well be a mall food court. Not enough coffee or healthy food stands since they closed down Dolcini. That was the only student friendly dining option and now they've been kicked out so we get to buy Sbarro pizza for $7 a slice.
College Freshman,2,I didn't receive the financial aid at first but later on in the next quarter I was able to receive it and buy the materials I needed for my classes.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the off campus dining options are fast food restaurants.
College Freshman,2,"The whole financial aid process is such a hassle if you do not get the right help. What is unfortunate is that Cal State La does not do a very good job at helping with the process. I went to the office many times because every time I would try to send my financial aid a problem with my account would always pop-up. The people at the office answer no questions and to set a meeting with someone who can help, they are either over booked or not in. With all of this commotion I still did not receive financial aid."
College Student,2,I haven't seen many outside food places and many people wonder what their might be but dont know about much.
College Student,2,As far as I know many people complaing because that college experience many people want like partying is not happening alot at this school.
College Freshman,2,There are not very many parties around. There are frat parties but they do mot seem to very popular.
College Sophomore,2,"As a commuter school, it is a very good campus that is in proximity to the classes.  The security on the campus grounds are very good.  IT services are available 24 hours a day!"
College Junior,2,"From what I have heard, off campus housing saves money from living on campus but only if you live with a handful of other roommates."
College Freshman,2,I don't receive much aid.
College Junior,2,need to build and additional parking structure
College Freshman,2,i don't feel that everyone gets the same assistance
College Freshman,2,not the best and extremely expensive
College Freshman,2,"I don't really like it, mainly consists of fast food restaurants"
College Freshman,2,There aren't that many parties.
College Senior,2,most people don't care of the greeks
College Junior,2,The nursng program is highly impacted which makes it nearly impossible to be admitted into.
College Freshman,2,"The financial aide office is so silent yet it plays a large part in the lives of student here and when both parties are not on the same page, it makes for headaches"
College Sophomore,2,Students that are not on a sports team themselves are for the most part not involved in team spirit or attending sports games. The sports we offer are also limited
College Freshman,2,I did not qualify for financial aid so it is a burden for my dad which stressed me out as well. Now we are struggling to find money because we do not want to turn to loans. My school did not give me any tips and only told me I qualified for loans. I do not think they understand how we are doing financially.
College Senior,2,"Applied to several scholarship programs. Received one departmental scholarship. Need more, hopefully I will receive something. I would not be able to finish without aid. Very close to the end."
College Senior,2,"There's not much in the immediate area, expensive and not the best"
College Junior,2,I think the city alone isn't pretty and it can be unsafe.
College Junior,2,Not the best neighborhood but has great transportation.
College Junior,2,Seems like most people aren't involved in athletics unless they are in the sport. School has low school spirit.
College Senior,2,financial aid people can be unhelpful.
College Senior,2,biology major is impacted. can be difficult to get classes.
College Sophomore,2,I do not enjoy beinging my my specific major just because it does not feel life I am part of the specific program to begin with.
College Sophomore,2,"For a film major, I have yet to experience what that feels like even after completing my first year of college. Perhaps it is due to the fact that I am still taking general ed classes, but I just do not feel like my major has an impact on my academics or student life in any way."
College Senior,2,No one is really social. People stay in their own cliques. Only way to meet people is by taking different classes. People who have the same major typically have the same classes. You see a lot of familiar faces. Overtime you make various classroom buddies.
College Senior,2,No one really pays attention to the athletics. It's not popular compared to University schools. I like it though so I don't get distracted. My focus should be on the books.
College Senior,2,There are a lot of Mexican/Americans. I barely see large groups of other cultures.
College Senior,2,crowded. It takes an average of 1-2 hrs.
College Senior,2,too much trouble and when you get aid it is late. sometime they forget ypur paper works. They never answer their phone. they change your aid without any warnings.
Recent Alumnus,2,I don't think there are any convenient places.
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of parties.
Niche User,1,"Unfriendly staff, and instructors. I didn't enjoy my experience at this university. I will not be returning here."
Niche User,1,"Unfriendly staff, and instructors. I didn't enjoy my experience at this university. I will not be returning here."
Senior,1,"I'm a senior mechanical engineering student here and the quality of the education here is abysmal. When you have to listen to professors stumble through PowerPoints, stuttering and mumbling while reading directly off the slides they supposedly created, have students come to the board to correct simple mistakes, and have a professor who will answer every physics problem with ""the right-hand rule"" and stare blankly into the space behind you, you develop a certain disdain for the education system here. You can teach yourself, and that's what many of us have done, but for a field where we're going to be responsible for the safety of the public, I would hope that the department would have the courage to hold themselves to a higher standard. As it exists today, I would advise all aspiring engineers to stay away."
Sophomore,1,"ehhhh its whatever really supeeeeeeeeeerrrrr lame not worth the hype going here. I suggest going to another cal state or transfer always packed classes and problems with financial aid, its also super hard to get into EOP it is not I repeat not worth it, I had to transfer out due to horrible experience."
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek life is awful.  It adds this air of pompousness to the individuals who partake in greek life even though they're nothing special.  Overall the individuals involved in greek life seem to have a lowered level of maturity as they are typically the ones who are more focused on partying over school.
College Freshman,1,The campus doesn't really help you find off campus housing.
College Freshman,1,There's never a free space
College Junior,1,"We do not have ""greek life"",  being that Mt. Sac is a community college."
College Freshman,1,nothing appetizing around the area
College Senior,1,I have never lived on campus.
College Senior,1,There are only fast food restaurants which are completely unhealthy and don't aid a growing mind.
College Senior,1,"I really don't see much partying going on. Everyone on campus, from my perspective, is really goal oriented. I only see enthusiasm when tents are set out for clubs."
College Senior,1,Its on the poor side. The atmosphere is bad. We are down the street from smoke shops and liquor stores. Campus is nice and clean but once your off its the tundra.
College Senior,1,The food is so unhealthy1
College Senior,1,There is not much promotion in this area.
College Sophomore,1,Too many impacted majors and too many people. Priority in class registration for those who really need it seems like there aren't any and is based off of luck. The nursing program is way too competitive and the acceptance rate is at or less than 10%. It is terrible.
College Sophomore,1,"Going into the nursing program is terrible. The acceptance rate is extremely low, and the pre-reqs science classes are always full. There is never a chance to get the classes you need for the pre-nursing major and it is extremely rigorous. Not only that, but pre-nursing students must take the TEAS test, WPE test, and have 100+volunteer hours to be even considered at the nursing admission."
College Junior,1,one day may be really hot or extremely cold
College Junior,1,Campus night life is Dead. Only dorms.
College Sophomore,1,Their is only fast food in the campus dinning. No healthy options or vegan options. Very poor diet chooses. Their is no variety of food.
College Sophomore,1,Nothing really goes on at the nightlife at school. If people want to party then they goes else where.
College Junior,1,"we are located in east LA, so yeah"
College Sophomore,1,Parking is getting worse by the year whether it is to find parking on or off campus and the parking permit cost really high for a quarter system. 
College Junior,1,"i dont like the area, its by freeways which isnt healthy"
College Junior,1,"small ass cafeteria, no healthy food options! just FAST FOOD"
College Junior,1,The computers are somewhat old and network is not very dependable.
College Junior,1,"The financial aid department is incompetent at best. They don't seem to know how to process paperwork in a timely fashion. It's staff cannot give you correct information or seem to know when things will be done. When things do not go well, they deny ever meeting with you or ever receiving any paperwork. My recommendation is to get proof that you submitted any paperwork as well as names of those who help you so they can be accountable."
College Senior,1,"I avoid coming to CSULA's health center because I have had only one good experience walking in through those glass doors.They only good experience  I had there was getting the seasonal Flu Shot. In addition, they need better physicians and more services to students. When I made an apppointment to see a nutritionist Ihad to wait two months and then I had my appointment cancel because the school's nutritionist was no longer working there. You're better off going to a local clinic."
Recent Alumnus,1,Mold Is In The Housing & Bed Bugs. Bull Doze Them.
College Sophomore,1,Its an open campus and anyone can get into anywhere like a lot of others but this school doe not have much security. especially in the dorms. So many robberies happen in the dorms. The school is not located in the safest place either so crazy people can just come in out of no where
College Senior,1,The dining at school is awful. It lacks variety. There are a handful of healthy choices and the menus are over-priced. However the places around the campus are great to try especially if you like Asian and Asian fusion food and Mexican dishes. There are also the major fast-food places and family-owned restaurants. The prices are also decent for the plate portions.
College Senior,1,It's mostly of a hispanic race in this school. There are some African Americans but the majority of this schools' race is hispanic. Occasionally you'll see international students and Asians.
College Freshman,1,"The parking permits at my school are about $300 something for an entire year.  If you park on campus and don't have a permit, you will get a ticket that is about $40"
College Freshman,1,We have a serious theft problem on our campus especially in housing.  The school does nothing to stop it.  Someone got car jacked in one of the parking lots on campus by four men. Homeless people walk on our campus all the time.
College Junior,1,There are not many chain restaurants around campus for when you want to eat something familiar. There is also not a lot of variety close to campus. Most restaurants are Asian or Mexican and I don't know of any that regularly offer student discounts. Pizza and a nearby Chinese place  will deliver right to your dorm.
College Sophomore,1,"They fail at being helpful. Not only is it difficult for in-state students to get their financial aid, but if you're out-of-state? Forget about it."
College Freshman,1,Parking on campus is horrible.Most parking lots get full by nine o'clock in the morning.It is a hassle to find parking every morning.
College Sophomore,1,"Permit is expensive, have to hunt for parking (go early get lucky), tickets are not so pricy, need car if campus is car from home. it can be a hastle to find parking."
College Freshman,1,"It's bad. Really bad. It's so bad that it's playing a major factor in deciding if I should transfer to another university. It's frustrating as hell trying to find a place to park. There is absolutely no parking for every student with a pricey $90 per quarter parking permit.

OTOH, this situation seems to be the norm at all California universities these days, so unless I go into an online program, I will probably stay put."
College Junior,1,The chemistry department is a pain. Not enough classes
College Junior,1,"I live in the dorms without a car, but from what I have heard from my peers that commute is that parking is horrible! A nightmare!!! Unless you live in the dorms with your own car, you have plenty of designated parking only for housing."
College Freshman,1,I've never seen anyone doing drugs in this school.
College Sophomore,1,"There aren't many restaurants around Cal State La. Only in the North side of Campus, towards the city of Alhambra. In Alhambra there are about 8 different kinds and very yummy restaurants. Other than that side there is only mcdonalds and burgerking which isnt very healthy."
College Freshman,1,There aren't many options and the dorms are small and disgusting.
College Senior,1,"They are very strict in housing. You basically can't have  a party without being caught.  You're allowed to have alcohol if you are 21 and older, but they don't really like socializing ""party wise""."
College Sophomore,1,It is very difficult to find parking. Best time to get parking is if you arrive around 7am.
College Senior,1,sometimes it could take up to 45 min to find a parking space.
Recent Alumnus,1,"It can be very difficult to find parking, especially if you arrive after 9:30 AM.  The good thing about parking is that the campus is so small, you don't have to walk too far for class.  Parking is best on Fridays since no one is on campus then!"
College Sophomore,1,Expensive Living – Apartments are expensive in L.A. and it is due to its location and surroundings.
College Freshman,1,Not Very Good – There isn't much transportation around our campus.
College Junior,1,Off campus housing is horrible because the houses are located in an uphill which are highly costly and have poor parking slots due to safety.
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you arrive to campus before 830 am or after 6pm you will have no problem finding parking. On the other hand, if you arrive during the time in between, you will definitely want to give yourself about 30 minutes to look for parking ... or you can park really far and not look but still give yourself plenty of time for walking"
College Junior,1,"Lack of Classes – The school is okay, however it's very difficult to get classes. I've been here for 3 years and I've always had trouble adding classes and not everyone is friendly"
College Sophomore,1,Strict and Expensive. parking is horrible and each lot has a restriction in either a permit being used or a daily parking permit being used. I leave an hour and a half before class starts to find parking. Tickets are expensive and parking police are always monitoring.
College Junior,1,"There is an overflow of students, there is almost no parking, you have to get there about 1 hr before your class to look for parking."
College Junior,1,"Dinning Options – Tere is not a lot of healthy options at CSU-Los Angeles. We have one cafeteria and the food is way to expensive. We have a food court and it consists of mostly fast food. I remember going to USC, and the cafeteria was incredible, there were many options where as CSULA does not."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no clubs, bars or parties around CSULA. It is very rare that someone throws a party because it either gets shut down or are not allowed to throw parties. The nearest nightlife would be in Pasadena or Hollywood which is a great distance away from CSULA. The parties that are thrown in CSULA must be either small kickbacks or parties based by school clubs or organization."
College Sophomore,1,"Bad Chemistry Department!!! I changed my major from Biochemistry to Biology because the chemistry department was never helpful. You cannot enroll in any chemistry classes before going to the department, which can be awful if you don't live on campus. Classes fill up and theres nothing you can do. They never open new classes based on student demand. On the other hand, the math department is amazing."
College Freshman,1,Never-Ending Rush Hour – The parking lot is always crowded unless you come in an hour earlier than the time your class starts.
College Student,1,"A Poor Set of Rules Without Enforcement – There are rules for no skateboards on campus, so essentially I would have to walk to every class, even though there are some nice flat strips of pavement to board down. Fortunately, this only applies if there are university police around patrolling, which they rarely do, if so sometimes they are out at night time. Also, the use of drugs and alcohol in the dorms is ridiculously high. I don't mind the alcohol, but so students at CSULA use drugs freely without fear of being caught due to poor regulation."

Sophomore,5,"I love the welcoming environment from all professors. They are more than qualified and very dedicated to helping students. Campus resources, support, and activities are exceptional. I am a commuter and love how it’s a small campus so it’s easy to go from class to class. Also, it’s a kind and close knit community. I’ve met some great people and hope to keep in touch even after I graduate."
Alum,5,"Nichols College is a small close-knit school that helped me develop as a not only a student, but a person during my four years there. It pushed me out of my comfort zone and left me ready to take on the real world after graduation. I was able to create relationships ill cherish forever with classmates, staff, and faculty."
Alum,5,"Going to Nichols was the best decision I made. Top notch professors, top notch faculty. Close proximity to major cities. You get out what you put into it. 10 years later I’m still good friends with many classmates and faculty. Renovations to campus since I graduated make me 100% jealous of new students coming to campus. Athletic facilities are superb. Get involved on campus and you won’t be disappointed!"
Alum,5,I am a Nichols College alumni and had the best experience imaginable. I loved the small campus as it creates a friendly and comfortable atmosphere. It allows students to have personal relationships with professors. I also was very professionally prepared after college because of Nichols and had no problem getting a job due to my preparedness. Couldn’t have pictured myself anywhere else!
Senior,5,Attending Nichols College has been a decision that I am very proud of . The school welcome me with open arms when my previous college shut down . The school has provided me a ton of opportunities athletically and as a business professional. They have given me the tools to run my own business effectively and how to improve it .
Niche User,5,Nichols is a hidden gem. The school genuinely cares for the students and works to create opportunities for them. The focus on business ensures students are prepared for their career and the students go on to get great jobs after graduation. The campus is beautiful and they have made some amazing upgrades recently as well.
Alum,5,"Going to Nichols College was the best four years of my life. I say that being a student athlete and heavily involved in the program I studied. Nichols is a small school so you will leave feeling like you are part of a family and there is no better feeling than knowing that no matter where you go in life you’ll always have the small school in Dudley, Ma a forever home and you’ll forever be a Bison! Bison Pride is something not many people take lightly. It is an actual thing whether you are an athlete, a hard working student, a faculty member, Coach, the list goes on. You feel it instantly from the first time you walk on campus as a freshman. Everyone is there for you and your future success and Nichols will prepare you to take on anything beyond graduation. It is a very special school and community to be a part of."
Senior,5,"I love the small class sizes and the personalized experience you receive when interacting 1-1 with the teacher. In addition, there are amazing opportunities and so much room for growth to help you become a leader on and off-campus."
Freshman,5,"it is a great college very good all around campus student life on campus is great, food is very good lot to chose from, sports are very good. diversity is good,"
Niche User,5,nice campus when I went to visit for an open house.  Welcoming and organized. professors seemed engaged and knowledgeable.
Senior,5,Nichols College is a great school. Once you enter the campus it is so inviting and positive. The campus is beautiful.
Sophomore,5,"Nichols College is a friendly and welcoming college. It has many resources to get a great education and they care about their students very much. You make great friends, given great opportunities, and memories you will never forget."
Senior,5,I loved the close-knit environment that Nichols creates with its students and faculty. It truly feels like one big family that is supporting you in your goal of building a career. My experience has Nichols has sufficiently prepared me to enter the business world.
Freshman,5,"The facilities were excellent, people are very nice, opportunity for employment is very good.  It is a well run college."
Alum,5,"Nichols will become your home away from home. The professors and the staff truly care about your success and preparing you for life after college. You'll take four years of Professional Development Seminar (PDS), which offers students the opportunity to create a resume and cover letter tailored to your intended career path, take part in mock interviews with industry professionals, and obtain financial guidance on a successful transition from college life to professional life. I found this to be one of the most valuable opportunities Nichols had to offer. In terms of student life, you have to put yourself out there to make the most of your time on campus. Leave your dorm and go to events (they have pub nights, dances, speakers, etc.), join one or more of the many clubs offered, or just hang out on the quad when the weather cooperates. College is all in what you make it and I'm so happy that I chose Nichols."
Alum,5,"I had a great experience at Nichols. The faculty really went above and beyond to help me get my internship and that led to a great job. If you are looknig for a school that will prepare you for a great career then Nichols is is for you. 

In addition to the academics it was awesome to see our basketball and hockey team win championships."
Works Here,5,"Warm, welcoming community driven to help students develop skills to be successful professionals. A successful, enthusiastic and connected alum base supports current students and the future of the school."
Sophomore,5,"Great small college environment.  Very engaging professors. Staff cares about the students.  The professors make sure you learn the material. They go above and beyond.  They motivate the students.  New dining hall almost done, big beautiful space."
Sophomore,5,"A close student-professor relationship, because of this many students can achieve more. 
Food is not very good but they are re-doing the dining hall 
Campus is very safe, nothing ever happens"
Senior,5,"Everyone at Nichols truly cares about the success of their students. You are able to form personal relationships with all of your professors that carry on long after your class is over. Also, as a commuter I have still been able to be a part of campus which was really important to me."
Sophomore,5,Nichols College is small and very friendly. The academics are beyond supportive and the teachers really make sure they have a close relationship too you in the classroom. Athletically the coaches are always there making sure you are playing to the best of your ability and pushing you to do the best you can do.
Niche User,5,I applied to Nichols with the intent to pursue a future in the business industry. I want to better myself off and I think after applying and getting accepted I am ready to help better off my self in my future as it unfolds.
Freshman,5,"Nichols College has made me into a young, strong independent Latina. I have stood to on campus because of the multiple ways Nichols has allowed me to be involved on campus. I am a member of the Nichols Women's Basketball team and I will also be involved on the Track and Field team. I also enjoy the academic part of this excellent experience here at Nichols because of the small class sizes and professors that are willing to get to know you on a personal level."
Niche User,5,"Nichols is a really nice, small, four year school that is available to many. The academics keep you challenged while also supporting you on what you want to do."
Alum,5,At Nichols College I absolutely love how student life would be as a Bison. They provide as much help as possible and the average classroom size is around 16. I also feel in love with the soccer field and hopefully have the opportunity to play in college. The dorm rooms were very nice and have enough space. The staff at Nichols College are very nice and want students to succeeded in the future. When I first went on campus I knew it felt like home. I would definitely recommend to visit Nichols College and see if it's a good fit for you.
Sophomore,5,Amazing faculty that are always trying to make you succeed.  Classes are interesting and useful.  Food is sort of crappy.
Sophomore,5,The environment is so friendly and welcoming. you get a great education and one on one focus because the classrooms are roughly 20-25 adults so the professor actually knows your name. its not just a lecture you have to go to.
College Sophomore,5,I enjoy my class size and style
College Sophomore,5,There has not been many problems on campus
College Freshman,5,Public safety department is 24/7 and they always answer the phone.
College Freshman,5,The athletic facilities are beautiful and at least 3 teams won their leagues last year.
College Freshman,5,I would not consider picking any other school. The sports programs are excellent and their are many clubs and activities.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love how much my professors wish to see each individual student succeed. That is something that I am definitely going to miss since I am not coming back next year.
College Junior,5,"You're lucky if campus safety is the first to discipline you. The student body is not supportive of assault both sexual and not, and friends of the victim might take the discipline into their own hands. There is no victim blaming."
College Junior,5,Small classes. Nice Classrooms. Variety of teacher personalities. Excellent facilities. Great sports. Clean tap water. Nice dorms with a/c. Hard courses and easy courses. Great power from majors.
College Junior,5,"If you have the grades and effort, getting a job or internship through Nichols is easy. The alumni network is huge providing many opportunities for success. It is up to the student though, Nichols must see that you are taking initiative in your future and will not do all the work for you, just provide you with the necessary steps and connections."
College Junior,5,"The new athletic center puts Nichols on top of even some of the smaller Division 1 schools, everything as of fall 2015 is brand new with the exception of the turf field which is expected to be renovated by 2017"
College Junior,5,"The students that don't like Nichols are the ones that are not in college to learn and think that if you don't party, you will die of boredom and that grades are not worth it. If you want to get good grades, Nichols will place you in a tough major with many job opportunities"
College Freshman,5,Love the school.  They are very helpful and fair.  I am having a great experience and doing well.
College Freshman,5,The dean takes safety very seriously. It's a small school so nothing really happens and if it does everyone knows about it and taken care of.
Sophomore,4,My professors were more active online and they were very helpful. They were consistent and lenient due to the pandemic. They would reach out to us constantly to make sure we were doing okay and that all of our questions were answered.
Niche User,4,"I like the set up of the campus but having it be on both sides of the road make it a little hazardous for student. Especially in the winer time with ice on the roads, there must be more caution."
Junior,4,The overall atmosphere here at Nichols is great. You will always know someone wether you are going to the gym or class! Professors work hard to see you succeed and want you to do well. Once you are on the hill you are a Bison forever!
Sophomore,4,"I love the community at Nichols! Everyone is very kind to you and since its a small campus you know everyone that you pass when walking to classes, or when you're in the dining hall"
Sophomore,4,Great place to learn. The weekends get boring but if you want a small school and are serious about learning this is the place for you.
Freshman,4,Every single time i have visited Nichols college everyone has been so friendly. You truly do feel at home. The dorms are well kept and spacious. Every piece on campus has a modern but historic feel enhancing the scene as you go about your day.
Sophomore,4,Very good for athletes and those that want to learn. Professors have lots of connections that they are happy to share with those that reach out.
Sophomore,4,"I love Nichols College it's very small and it feels like a small community.  My professors are fantastic, and everyone is always helping everyone.  The athletics are decent, but the athletic center is very nice.  The dining hall is currently being renovated, but the food itself could be improved.  Overall Nichols is a great school and I'd recommend it to any high school senior looking for a small private college."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love Nichols College! Though it is ""in the middle of nowhere,"" it is still very fun and easily accessible. Their are a bunch of major cities (Boston, Providence, Worcester) within an hour drive. The school does a great job of keeping students entertained and happy on campus. The dorms are really nice, and everyone on campus is so helpful. All administrative and financial offices are responsive and open to any and all questions. The professors are down to earth and really interested in you as a student. I could not imagine going anywhere else. Go Bison!"
Senior,4,"My experience at Nichols has shaped me for the real world in many ways. By becoming very involved in both academics and the community, I have made numerous connections. The staff and faculty at the college pushes you to be the best you can be. They offer any type of resource to make sure that you're successful upon completion. If there was one thing I would change, it would be adding a multicultural office to campus. Currently, the number of minority is rising and there is no place for us to come together and advocate for ourselves."
Freshman,4,I had doubts about this school. I mainly decided to attend so I could stay home and be there when my family needed me but I was pretty wrong. My favorite high school instructor went here and now he is doing incredibly successful. I am getting enough work to keep me stabilized and interested in what I am learning. The professors seem actually legit in the passion of the topic of what they are serving or maybe they are just really good actors. I don't take part in many activities yet but I do have friends that still say good things about the things to do on campus.
Niche User,4,"On my visits to Nichols College, there weren't many things I disliked. For the most part, I loved the school as a whole."
Sophomore,4,"Nichols College has a great small community. The professors really care about all their students and want them to succeed. Professors are so willing to help students individually with class work, internships, and job searches."
Junior,4,"Thus far, Nichols College has given me a quality education. The college has allowes me to grow as a person and has given the tools that are necessary to be successful beyond education.  While the food and local area lacks, it is made up in campus activities and student life."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my time at Nichols College. I was not a good student the first two years, but once I am turned around with the support of some professors, I began accomplishing many great things and enjoyed the campus, as well as the surroundings and the people there."
Senior,4,"Nichols College is a great business college. Professors are required to have office hours to help students, and are helpful and eager to help students any time they can. The school prepares you my having a Professional Development Seminar class to master resume and cover letter writing, interviewing, and budgeting. The classes at Nichols have a lot of presentations and group projects. It is ridiculous to have to take two humanities courses and a social science course that are irrelevant to business and students majors. The food on campus is a hit or miss. The housing (dorm) situation is horrible. Some dorms are aweful and shouldn't be lived in. The social programming board and various clubs try to put on weekly events."
College Freshman,4,My professors were super helpful and helped me a ton. Especially in calc.
College Freshman,4,"The gyms are good, but fairly small."
College Freshman,4,I've had nothing but positive experiences. However there is not much around to do. I have to find my own fun on campus.
College Freshman,4,I think every professor is passionate about their class but manage to make classes Linked. I do think there should be more handwritten work for those who prefer to be more hands on especially with math. Class sizes are perfect close to high school size classes.
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus. But it depends what dorming hall you end up in honestly. Sometimes the three to a room

 Makes it extremely crowded in most rooms. And the heat is deathly hot on a top bunk even when on warm."
College Freshman,4,The athletic center is amazing just recently renovated so everything is new and shinning. Sports are well taken care of especially varsity teams.
College Freshman,4,"I love my school so much. The people, students and faculty, are amazingly welcoming and outgoing as a community. There may be problems when it comes to money and how it is spent. But they make your experience so great that it's worth the debt."
College Freshman,4,Great basketball courts and workout rooms
College Freshman,4,Working with the basketball team is helping realize my future in the job market when i graduate.
College Freshman,4,Have had great experience with the professors and staff at the school.
College Freshman,4,I always feel safe on campus public safety is always around to help.
College Freshman,4,The classes are small and the teachers do what they can to make sure you succeed.
College Freshman,4,Many people that graduate go into very good careers.
College Freshman,4,Shamie is a great place to live we have our own bathrooms and a pool table in the common room.
College Freshman,4,"The campus works on networking as a high priority. I believe that this school has a high esteem when it comes to looking for graduates to work in their field. Ultimately, the degree earned here will be very beneficial for all the people who graduate from nichols."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy my new room. i had moved to a new room at the beginning of last semester because I could not deal with my old roommates. My new room is twice the size of my old one and it is a lt more spacious. I also really like how the washing/drying machines are free so I dont need to pay for my clothes but they are not he best washers and dryers though.
College Freshman,4,I participated in the Varsity Cross Country program in my Fall 2015 semester and the coach was very personable and understanding about each students' athletic ability. I had injured myself in the beginning of the season so I had to take it easy during the season at practice and my coach was understanding of that. I had competed in 3 of the 6 meets and I had done pretty well in them despite my minimal training. I feel like a lot of the coaches take a lot of care in the athletes' progress academically and athletically.
College Freshman,4,The school has a lot of connections.
College Freshman,4,The Dean of Students is very dedicated to preventing assaults on campus and has started a program to teach students about how to prevent assault. There have also been some policy changes in hopes of further preventing assaults.
College Freshman,4,There is a brand new state of the art athletic center for both student athletes and non-athlete students.
College Freshman,4,"Nichols is a small-town business school that is invested in their students and the success. Career-readiness is a key focus through their ""PDS"" program and professors are readily available to help."
College Student,4,Always something to do and entertain you.
College Student,4,The safety here is great
College Student,4,Most people that graduate from here find work within six months.
College Freshman,4,I feel super safe on campus just because of where i was previously
College Freshman,4,Most degree holders that come out this school own big businesses
College Freshman,4,athletics are very important to the school and the schools culture
College Freshman,4,My school is small and fun!
College Sophomore,4,I love the small campus atmosphere. It is nice to be able to say hi to people you've never met and become friends. Everyone is so nice and welcoming. I love being so close with the professors. It's nice when they know your name and remember who you actually are.
College Sophomore,4,"I attend Nichols College in Dudley Massachusetts and its shaped out to be everything I could ask for in a university. Also, as a private college the classroom sizes are great as well as campus life and I can't wait to go back ."
College Student,4,The coach was friendly and helpful my major there
College Junior,4,"With what I want to do with my life, Nichols is the right place for me. I've already gotten some great career advice and met some great people and created connections. Although I am just 19 years old, I feel confident that I will be successful in my future and Nichols plays a huge part in that."
College Senior,4,"The Financial office works with students who seek help. It's a small school so they really do take time to help you out. There's a $10,000/year scholarship for just have a 3.0+ GPA and many others for a variety accomplishments."
College Senior,4,Quality of the dorms are great. Half surround the quad and the other half near the athletic center. They're renovated about every 10 years so they're in pretty good condition.
College Sophomore,4,We have some great sports teams. Lots of people play sports. Attendance for games is alright. Playoff games have major support by fans. Not in a huge stadium.
College Sophomore,4,The college is not overly strict. Public Safety does their job. Sometimes they do their job before they should (such as breaking up a party before quiet hours of rooms with people over 21). It is easy to have guests on campus. Guests only need to be checked in if they drove are car to campus in which they would need a parking pass from public safety. Nothing really bad to say.
College Sophomore,4,The amount of scholarships that are given out are great. The better you do in school the more scholarships that the school and Alumni give out. Between what the school gives out and what I get over half of my bill is taken away. The process is not a hassle.  There are no athletic scholarships.
College Freshman,4,There is some people of color but not super colorful and there are a lot of lesbians. Sexual orientation does not matter and neither does anything else.
College Freshman,4,You can get into everything with ease and applying for school is easy to do.
College Freshman,4,As long as your visitor has a parking pass and you have a parking pass your good.
College Freshman,4,It is a mostly business school but the other options like criminal justice and education are really good too.
College Freshman,4,The ratio is great for girls and the guys are hot.
College Freshman,4,The teams may suck sometimes but the spirit is up
College Freshman,4,You can tell all of the students are happy to be Nichols students. The alumni are amazing and are always there to support current students.
Sophomore,2,"I had a very hard time at Nichols college. It was hard for me to adapt to the setting because the school is not that diverse. I was discriminated, harassed, and bullied. I was called some racial slurs while being there. I reported my issues and they did nothing about them."
Sophomore,2,Nichols College is garbage. This school has little to no atmosphere and brings the worst out of kids. Has changed my whole mindset from senior year of high school to sophomore year of college.
Alum,2,"Small school that is poorly managed by the administration. The student lofe office does nothing new to try to make life on a small campus more exciting. Some of the professors are amazing, but the coursework is not challenging. I would recommend starting at a community college and the  transferring to Nichols because that's what it feels like."
Niche User,2,Nichols is much better at getting people signed up to go then actually sustaining it later. Middle of nowhere and everyone goes home every weekend if they live close by. I transferred out after just 1 semester. Do Not recommend.
Senior,2,"Nichols College does a great job at attracting students to join the ""community"". Things greatly change once you actually become a student and see what life is like on campus. One of the best ways to judge a school is to look at the parking lots on the weekends. Nichols loses about 70% of resident students on the weekends. Resident Life is a horrible and has become extremely strict on enforcing rules and regulations. The professors are friendly but outdated and the curriculum is behind many of the other great business schools. Nichols tells you alumni are connected and love giving back, however, the institution is over 200 years old and has less than 16,000 alumni. Most alumni have stayed local and do not have major success. If you are looking for an education that will prepare you to work for a large company you should choose another institution."
College Junior,2,"No greek because of such a small campus, the parties would add to campus life but ultimately is not even noticeable."
College Freshman,2,It's too easy. Most of the classes are useless. I learned nothing so far.
College Freshman,2,Most of the athletic teams are terrible. Most of the students are athletes. The only workout class is Zumba.
College Freshman,2,I came here for sports and realized what I actually want from a college which is the total opposite of this school. I'm transferring.
College Junior,2,Nichols College will do anything to get you to come here becuase they need students but your overall college experience is A BUST there is no parties on campus and no hard alcohol allowed. anything above 5% alcohol can results in suspension. Mostly everyone goes home on the weekends. There is no weekend / nigh life here at school. The food is awful. As a junior here at nichols i have not had a great experience I moved off campus to get away from the things you CANT do here. The only good thing about the school is the education you come for great class sizes and Majors / degrees. If nichols didnt have a great name in the business world then I wouldnt still be here. It is NOT  the college experience you want.
College Sophomore,2,"The Freshmen dorm (Shamie) get the best housing on campus.. Each room has a bathroom. That housing was excellent until they started shoving three people in every room. The other dorms either have common bathrooms, have 6 people in a room with a shared bathroom, single gender housing which is bad is you have guests of the opposite sex, or a really run down building. Seniors get great housing if you are willing to pay extra money. 

The housing lottery process is terrible!!!"
College Sophomore,2,"The school will deal with all of your problems internally up until you get the boot, I met with the dean over being transported, and she was extremely hostile to me at first when I refused to admit to everything little thing that she said. However respected the fact that I would not rat out any friends and thought I was a business like person so she let me off with seeing the counselor to decide if I was an alcoholic, where you are completely allowed to lie about your drinking"
College Freshman,2,"The school loves their athletes, but it is a D3 school. They need to start paying attention to the none athletes..."
College Junior,2,"You'll get sick of it very fast. But if your on a strict diet, eating there can be beneficial"
College Junior,2,Not too too many black kids on campus...
College Freshman,2,I got absolutely no finical aid and when I talked to the people in the business office they told me that my scholarship was enough to get me through school. They were not happy when I said that the money I save through a scholarship and the money and I need through finical aid had no relationship.
College Freshman,2,I saw the nurse when I had some strange virus that made me puke four times a day. She told me to sleep it off and said that she can only write a note to teachers if I went off campus for treatment. So when I missed class I had to email my teachers and ask them to get confirmation from the nurse that I was sick.
College Freshman,2,"No one really pays attention to the sports. Football is big for the first week then because they never win games, everyone loses interest. People make a big deal about the Rugby team but they are just a bunch of partiers, hence the team being disbanded for hazing this year. "
College Freshman,2,"It is obvious when there are parties and it takes way too long for anything to be done about them. A lot of drinking on the weekends and it can get really loud, before public safety does anything. The three strike policy for alcohol violations means nothing to most kids. Had over 20 transports just for the freshman class in the first semester. "
College Freshman,2,"There are very few computers in the library and during finals there are virtually none open. The Wifi is terrible and is constantly being worked on, but sadly nothing changes. Wifi in every building but service is hit and miss. Printing quota is pretty good though 250 per year. "
Niche User,1,"I spent one semester at this college and transferred as quickly as humanly possible .This was the best decision I have ever made. There are 1000 people at this college... If you are looking to have fun this might be one of the last colleges in Massachusetts I suggest you go to. There is no hard alcohol on campus not a single party on the weekends, just ten guys and one girl cramped into a dorm trying to stay as quiet as possible while drinking to avoid suspension. The college accepts legitimately everyone in hopes to get more kids to come through their far below average institution. Please make the right decision to not be in immense debt while working manual labor after you graduate. If anyone says they enjoy going here it is because this college is their only option. Oh and the food.. don’t get me started."
Freshman,1,"Nichols at first glance is very attractive and has some awesome professors. That does not make up for the atmosphere. I made my decision to go to Nichols for sports and the presentation of the campus. Many of the students seem bored and miserable and resort to locking themselves in their dorms drinking to the point of being transported. I wanted to go to a school where there is competition and ambition, but Nichols attracts a certain kind of person that does not believe in these values. I am glad I was able to find a university that will take me in regardless of the B.S. courses I was forced to take. This school will prepare you for the work force at the cost of a real college experience and dealing with bad people."
College Freshman,1,"We do not have Greek life at Nichols College, sorry."
College Sophomore,1,a sophomoric at UNH now and i live in a place better than copper beach
College Sophomore,1,"at Nichols you have to make sure that you are quiet when you drink, that is not a good thing. I now go to UNH and can say that whatever you see at is Nichols pathetic, I went from 4 guys pounding ruby to attempting to explain to the fire Marshall that the 400 person party at my fraternity was under control. If you only party at Nichols then you did collage wrong and i urge you to transfer for the real experience."
College Sophomore,1,"First day of class the dean told me not to go into Webster alone, and I agree. My mom called the school and asked if there was a place with a table cloth that she could take me to for lunch and she was told Panera, that about sums it up"
College Senior,1,There is no Greek Life
College Junior,1,"Almost no transportation. They recently came out with a shuttle that runs twice a week, but only goes to shopping areas. Unfortunately not many people use it anyways because most have cars so I don't think it will change much. They also don't run past 10, and there is only one so if it gets too crowded you have to wait 20-50 minutes depending on where you are. I've never seen it get too crowded though but it is possible I think it only sits around 10."
College Freshman,1,sucks. the school is too small to have transportation
College Freshman,1,Getting Around???Not – there is no transportation to get around.  if you don't have a car you are stuck. they need to work on having some sort of bus/shuttle to get you to a transportation station. Even if they have set hours.

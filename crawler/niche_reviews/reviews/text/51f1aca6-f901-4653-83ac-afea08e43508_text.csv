Alum,5,"Pillar College accommodated all my needs. The Professors and classes were outstanding. I am a Desert Storm Veteran and was diagnosed with PTSD and TBI. The school bent over backward to help me achieve and obtain two bachelor degrees and my Master's degree in counseling. I would give the school 5 stars.

Junior,5,"It is a really good college but too expensive. Classes are very good and teacher as well. You feel like home when you are in classes and every one is treat as a family and Christan perspectives. They a team that can help you with homework or anything else that you are confuse about. This college do not have campus they rent a space and itâ€™s very complicated most of the time because youhavw limitation. Also, they do jot have curriculum activities. Classes also have limitation and most of the time you cannot jave a flexible echedule becuse classes are for the most part morning and evening."
Alum,5,"This school changed my life for the better. Small class sizes, professors care, the staff is helpful, especially at the Somerset Campus."
Freshman,5,"I'm studying there, they're amazing! So recomendable, they care, they help you, all under the God word."
Recent Alumnus,5,The online classes are awesome and flexible because I can log on at night and early morning and it doesn't take away time with my daughter or ministry.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I had a little problem with my western civilization in the beginning because it was a lot of work, but the professor helped me and gave me helpful feedback and some tips for success."
Recent Alumnus,5,The courses I've taken so far are great and the professors are very helpful when you have questions or concerns.
Recent Alumnus,5,It was great and very helpful
Recent Alumnus,5,"The workload is intense, but you learn a lot and it' relevant and easy to understand. Also, with everything I've learned so far, I've gained wisdom I can implement in daily life."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Pillar offers a wide range of classes that all have biblical foundations. Also, professors are easily accessible and helpful. The registration process went smoothly and everyone I worked with was helpful and supportive."
College Sophomore,5,"I was intimidated by the thought of taking online courses because I felt I needed to physically be in a classroom environment to learn. I was surprised by the amount of communication that took place between my peers, professor, and myself. One of the classes I took required students to post and respond to questions/comments in a forum environment which encouraged us to communicate with one another. My professors responded to my email inquiries in a timely fashion and provided clear feedback which helped to improve my work. The workload in my math class was fair. The workload in my English class was a bit heavy, perhaps in hopes of compensating for it not being in a physical setting. The online registration process was easy. I would take online courses again."
College Sophomore,5,"Being a Biblical Studies major at Pillar College (formerly Somerset Christian College) has been a pleasurable experience. The school has a world-class faculty that has experience in both the secular and Christian teaching environments. I enjoy how the professors integrate Christian beliefs and doctrine into the learning experience. I am satisfied that the curriculum is of the same quality as secular universities (it is not diminished simply because it is a Christian school). I am enrolled in an accelerated degree program for working adults. The workload has been realistic but not overwhelming. I like that the Somerset, NJ location of the school is small, welcoming and clean. It provided me with the opportunity to get to know my professors as well as my classmates. I have not inquired about internship/job opportunities but I believe they exist since current students work in the school store and help with missions trips and different activities in which the school engages."
College Junior,5,The financial aid process was great and the counselors really help you.
College Senior,5,"My professors are awesome, knowledgeable, friendly and helpful.  I love what I learn and I never liked school before, but I love it now!"
Freshman,4,"Overall I enjoy my classes.  My professors were well prepared and answered questions thoroughly, classes were exciting and   Better communication with financial aid."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Online classes are a lot of work, but they are great if you have a busy schedule. You can log in at any time and not have to take from work or time with the family."
College Senior,4,"the student body at my school is very diverse, helpful, stand by what they believe in."
College Sophomore,4,"I have enjoyed the ability to go to school as a full-time student under the school's ""Traditional 9"" program in which I was taking two classes only on Saturdays (for four hours each, for 9 weeks, instead of taking a regular course which would take 15 weeks). The accelerated program is a huge help since I am a working adult with a family. I found the transition to online classes to be easy. It saved me travel time on Saturdays and I still received prompt and sufficient communication from my professors. The curriculum has been of the utmost quality. The only frustration I experienced is that due to the small student body, I haven't always had the ability to enroll in classes that I want or need to take due to low enrollment. This caused me to have to take some pre-requisite courses in my second semester instead of in my first semester."
College Sophomore,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to receive a quality education which also lines up with my faith in Jesus Christ. I applaud Pillar College for creating such unique and accommodating programs of study for working adults. I enjoyed going to school as a full-time student only on Saturdays under the ""Traditional 9"" program, in which I was taking two courses on Saturdays, for four hours each, in 9 weeks instead of taking a regular course that would last 15 weeks. This allowed me to be at home with my family during the week. When my husband broke his wrist, I thought I would have to stop attending school but I was able to transition to online classes which helped me to continue furthering my education. Since Pillar is a small school, I've been able to form a bond with my classmates and also have the added benefit of receiving the time and attention I need from professors. Overall, I would recommend Pillar to anyone seeking higher education."
College Sophomore,4,"We have a computer lab at the Somerset, NJ location which has a good amount of computers. I was usually able to print documents that I needed before, during or after class which was very convenient. I've never encountered network issues. The network is usually available and works quickly. I've only brought my laptop when I had class presentations."
College Sophomore,4,"I have been well-pleased with the majority of my professors at Pillar College. Many of them have a doctorate degree in their field. The curriculum has been appropriately challenging. I have not participated in the school's study-abroad programs but I believe they provide this opportunity annually. I believe there is room for the class registration process to be improved since I couldn't enroll in some classes due to low enrollment from students. As a result, I had to take some pre-requisite courses during my second semester, when it would have been more beneficial for me to have taken them in my first semester."
College Junior,4,Pillar is a wonderful  college to pursue a higher quality education
College Junior,4,I have an excellent group cohort.
College Junior,4,The class registration process was excellent. After I registered for class the intake person prayed with me.
College Junior,4,I enjoy my course of study. The professors are very knowledgeable about subject matter. Also my classmates have become like family. The workload is tremendous however it is do able.
College Junior,4,"The computer labs a great, I just wish printing was free to a certain extent."
College Junior,4,I enjoy the small classroom setting this makes for  an excellent learning environment.
College Junior,4,I am very excited to go to class each week!
College Senior,4,"I am a returning adult student and social scene, facilities and campus life do not appeal to me.  So for me, I am quite satisfied with what the campus has to offer.  The only drawback is internship opportunities are limited to North New Jersey instead of Central and South New Jersey."
College Senior,4,"The process used to be a hassle until Wayne came on board.  He is very helpful, knowledegable, reachable, and receptive."
College Junior,4,"What makes this school unique to me is that for one it is a christian college.  I can come here and not feel ashamed of my religious background as there are people there of all races and ages and we all share a love for God.  We are allowed to pray, discuss things that may be going on in our lives without being judged and/or criticized.  
There is a sense of individuality at Somerset. Everyone that I have come in contact with has shown me nothing but respect and are very friendly.  If you have a problem, there are more than willing to work with you.  You are always greeted with a smile an an occasional hug. You are definitely made to feel welcome.  
My last institution of higher learning (Essex County College) was a good school, but there are some classes that made you feel as if you didn't matter; as if you were just another body occupying a seat in the class. My psychology instructor for Psychology 102 made it clear that he didn't believe in ""a higher power"" and even went as far as to call anyone who did ""sun god worshippers"".  I felt so uneasy in his class that there were times when I just couldn't go in and do what I needed to do; so my grade suffered. I passed with a C, but I know that I am a much better student than that.  
As far as the campus at Somerset is concerned, I have only visited the Newark Campus and I like it alot.  It's a large spacious area with comfortable classes, a nice lounge and there is always someone there who is more than willing to help you if you need it."
College Junior,2,I not that my fault or the school.

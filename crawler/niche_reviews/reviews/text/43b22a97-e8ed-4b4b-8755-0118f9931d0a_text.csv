Sophomore,5,"So far, my experience here has been great! Everyone here is nice and accepting of all people on campus."
Senior,5,Easy to understand format.  Faculty and staff are very helpful.  I can work and go to school at the same time.
Senior,5,I have always taken a good amount of my classes online if it was available. The classes are typically easy to navigate.
Senior,5,I really enjoy Northern Kentucky University. The camps isn't too big and it is very easy to navigate.
Graduate Student,5,"Even though I didn’t primarily complete my major online, a lot of classes are offered online so students can do a hybrid system of in person learning and online if that’s what works best for them. It was very convenient for me to do in person learning and online classes due to working full time while going to college. The online classes are easy to navigate and have the same value as a regular class. If you’re good at managing time and keeping up on due dates on your own, then online classes can be a good tool."
Junior,5,I actually love taking classes online through Northern Kentucky University. I feel they are very well done and understandable. I have continued to obtain great grades through the online courses!
Sophomore,5,NKU has given me a chance to move forward in my academics. The faculty are understanding and try their best to assist you in all needs
Junior,5,Great college that allows you to get a great degree and has many opportunities. Smaller class sizes allow you to get the attention you need and support from your professors.
Junior,5,The online learning experience is a great way to take classes from the comfort of your room. They professors do a great job of communicating with students to ensure success.
Freshman,5,"May seem like a very local and popular school if you live in Northern Kentucky...  but the atmosphere is amazing, good communication from advisors, good people, and very nice campus!"
Freshman,5,"With the pandemic arising this year, all NKU students had to switch to online classes. Within the abrupt changes at the start, the teachers were very flexible and understanding. Now I never had any online classes (on purpose) but my experience with online learning during COVID is postive."
Sophomore,5,"The online experience at NKU was one of the best things about the school. At previous schools I struggled a lot with online classes. However, at NKU I had much more support and the expectations were much more reasonable."
Sophomore,5,"With covid-19 disrupting the end school year, all classes were moved to online. Though it was difficult at first due to the drastic change in the learning environment, students still received many emails from administration that informed them of online resources that would help students who may have been struggling more than others. The school also offered the opportunity to change our classes to the pass or fail system if we desired."
Sophomore,5,My overall experience with NKU has been amazing. They made sure to make the transition from high school into college as smoothly as possible as well as informing the incoming freshmen with different resources that were available to us within the first few weeks of school.
Alum,5,"Northern Kentucky University is a smaller university across the river from Cincinnati, OH. I have attended classes both in-person and online, and you will get a great education no matter which way you choose to attend. Their listing of courses and majors is large, and they really do care about their students."
Freshman,5,It was very easy to apply! I had coordinators helping me even after the process was completed. The application fee is cheap and the determination on acceptance is very swift.
Freshman,5,My experience in NKU is going good so far. There are lots of campus resources to help students to be successful in academic or outside world. Class size are smaller which helps students to interact with their professor more and get familiar. Lot of diverse students and all students are nice and helpful.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently looking to transfer to Northern Kentucky University in the fall, and I think it is my dream school when comparing it to where I am now. I really love how Northern is so diverse and unique, not just with the community and the students, but also in regards to the academics and different programs. Being a photography major, it is often rare to find schools that are not specifically for the arts to care so much about an arts program. but from what I can see, NKU has a special home for students who are interested in the arts. In addition to this factor, I also greatly enjoy the overwhelming feeling of belonging I experience when I step foot onto the campus. There are so many different extracurricular activities and organizations that students can be a part of, which makes it so easy to feel like a member of NKU's family."
Alum,5,"I loved NKU! It was a wonderful place to earn my undergrad degree in nursing. the location is perfect and easy to navigate traffic. It is near a huge metropolis with many things to do. The parking is hassle-free. The professors are second to none in terms of accessibility and helpfulness. The availability of extra-circulars is too numerous to mention but includes intramural sports, Greek Life, and all the normal college activities that would be expected. A beautiful clean campus that always feels safe and welcoming!"
Junior,5,Involvement on campus and inclusivity is like no other! Truly empowers you to be a leader on campus and in the future.
Freshman,5,"It is a great place and you meet different kind of people which makes it easier to move around because you won't feel out of place. The professors are very good and understanding. 
It is a good place to be."
Freshman,5,"Coming to Northern Kentucky University was definitely the right choice for me. The class sizes are small, which I enjoy, and the atmosphere of the school is just amazing overall."
Junior,5,"the campus at NKU is beautiful, the class sizes are small enough students are easily able to communicate with their professors . NKU offers hundred of programs for any issues students may have from financial aid to health care. The courses, programs, professors, and students at NKU are  unparalleled to any University in the area."
Graduate Student,5,Northern Kentucky was a very great university when it came to academics and the safety of the entire school. I loved going there and I would not have it any other way. I met my lifetime friends there; who now I call family.
Niche User,5,"I loved going to school here. I went here my freshman year and lived in a house off campus. Although I lived off campus, I still had many activities to attend and had many social opportunities. My professors were all great and everyone at the school is very welcoming."
Sophomore,5,"I am a transfer student.  The transfer process has been simple, easy to understand. Financial aid advisors have been excellent in answering any questions and directing to other resources if need me.  I am eager to start my education here."
Graduate Student,5,"NKU has a large number of enrolled students, though many of them are commuters. Though there are a large number of students enrolled, the campus doesn't ever feel overcrowded. Coming from a university where you were a number and not a name, I truly appreciate the small classroom size because it allows for more one on one educational opportunities."
Freshman,5,"I’m a musical theater performance major at NKU and I absolutely love it. I wasn’t sure how much I’d like it at first because I grew up in Northern Kentucky and I felt like I wouldn’t have a new experience going there, but I’ve made so many new friends, learned so much about theater, and made life long connections. I’m so lucky to be getting my education here."
Junior,5,"I loved the small class sizes. The class sizes allowed me to feel welcomed in my classes. Also, the smaller classes allowed me to get more attention from my professors. Professors also knew my name which was neat to develop that type of one on one relationship with professors. Also, a very safe community."
Freshman,5,What I love most about NKU is the size and diversity. There are a lot of activities to get envolved.
Freshman,5,"I feel welcomed, healthy and happy hear! NKU offers amazing study abroad programs and I love to travel and learn new languages. My professors are funny and interesting. I am learning so much here."
Freshman,5,I like how there are so many ways to get involved in activities and clubs on campus. I love that it is an all inclusive campus and the fact that the teachers care about each student and their success and NKU.
Niche User,5,I went to NKU on a college tour and learned so much from it. The campus was amazing and it was a nice environment
Freshman,5,"I love the advising and that they really take time to work with you. I feel that most of the professors care. I feel really safe on campus, but I haven’t been around campus at night so I don’t know about that. I’m very satisfied with the class sizes, I was going in thinking I would be In class with double the amount of students. The northern Kentucky home page is very easy to navigate as well, I like the quick links tool on there, it makes things so much easier. There are plenty of resources for the students to use on campus as a student which is wonderful. The location is perfect with plenty of restaurants around campus too."
Junior,5,"This school is simply one of a kind. No it isn't near any beach or ocean, but it is home. The atmosphere is refreshing and the people more so very friendly. Not humongous campus that you would see on a movie, but it has its niches and beautiful scenery. Nothing beats the calm, quiet and receptive campus. With the right friends, and the right mindset, you're bound to have the time of your life at this place!"
Sophomore,5,Things are going very well at that time the only thing I could suggest just study abroad scholarship
Freshman,5,"NKU is a very welcoming campus, from orientation to your first week of school, they always make sure people are around to help and they always have the nicest faces on to start your dayd off right."
Niche User,5,"During my time here, I've had amazing experiences with counselors and the overall environment! Would recommend to anyone who wants a moderately big, but inexpensive school near a big city."
Freshman,5,"Wonderful University. Very diverse with people from all over the world. Wide variety of classes and extracurriculars for students to be a part of. The staff is very caring and wants to help the students in any way possible to make sure they succeed. Not only is the college itself wonderful, but so is the surrounding area. Highland Heights is a great place to live with plenty of options for entertainment and unique restaurants. Walking from campus around Highland Heights is never a problem due to campus safety and the NKY police always protecting the area."
Sophomore,5,"This university is awesome. All the professors are very helpful and understanding. The people on campus are very friendly and I love all of my friends I have met. The housing is nice and the food is fairly decent. I feel right at home when on campus, and I always feel safe. I definitely made the right decision by coming to NKU. Lastly, I love all the sports, especially basketball."
Freshman,5,"I have enjoyed Northern Kentucky University immensely, even though I have only been a student for about a month and a half. The campus administration has placed major importance on campus safety and I have not witnessed any incidents within this semester. Also, the professors genuinely care about their students and their success. The only change that I would want to see within Northern Kentucky University would be adding a field of forensic nursing."
Freshman,5,"I love how when I go to campus everyday, I see different groups of people and events happening every single day. Also, I love that Northern Kentucky university has so many resources for their students. I have used at least 7 of the resources so far and it’s only the second month of classes! I absolutely love this campus and recommend this university to anyone looking for a college that cares about their students success!"
Junior,5,I love Northern Kentucky University. I am very happy to be apart of such a wonderful organization. The people are friendly and the professors really care about their students success. All of the teachers that I have had so far are caring individuals who want to help their students learn and grow.
Alum,5,"I thought NKU was an excellent school to attend for an undergraduate degree. I changed my major at least 3 times and all 3 programs I was apart of were wonderful. The teachers were passionate and caring and the advisers  were always there to answer questions and guide you. The campus itself was small and easy to navigate. Parking could be better, but I feel like that's every college."
Junior,5,"NKU is a great place to be! I love the environment, commitment to service and the campus life here. The  professors and staff are nice and reasonable. Students are very welcoming and eager to help out if you need. There are plenty of ways to get involved on campus as NKU has over 200 organizations. Classes are about a 20 to 1 ratio, so small and more personable. Books are a little pricey, but that's expected."
Junior,5,"My experience at Northern Kentucky University is much better than my experience at Randall K Cooper High School. I feel much safer here, the food is great, a majority of the student body is kind, and the professors will do all they can to ready you for your career. I really enjoy it here at NKU."
Sophomore,5,"NKU is a very diverse, clean, and comfortable campus. All the students, staff, visitors, etc. are very kind and are willing to help you if you have any questions. I love being a part of the Norse Family! Go Norse!"
Sophomore,5,"I really have enjoyed my first year at Northern Kentucky University. The campus is really beautiful. There are some older buildings that could use some work, but the Health Center is new and amazing. I am a nursing student so that is where I will be spending most of my time for the next three years. All of my professors so far have been very helpful and willing to set time aside to make sure that students understand the materials and make sure that they provide helpful resources."
Alum,5,"So much more than the backyard school! I truly enjoyed my time as a student and an employee at NKU. You truly feel like you're at home, while learning and exploring about college and yourself. I'd do anything to go back and do it all over again!"
Junior,5,I appreciate that the staff at NKU are always helpful and make available information for processes and easy access.
Junior,5,"I really enjoy the atmosphere at NKU. If you like the bigger school feel, this is a school for you! Our athletic teams are so supportive of each other and it is a place where you feel valued as a norse!"
Alum,5,NKU has the best professors. They are so kind and really take the time to answer your questions and make sure you understand everything.
Sophomore,5,"Over the past year as a freshman, I have become connected with this campus and I feel completely comfortable around anyone on campus. I have had the opportunity to be a part of Greek life on campus and make some of my best friends. I love spending time on campus hammocking or enjoying my day walking and feeling the wind rush through my hair. I love NKU and I would not want to be at a different college."
Sophomore,5,I really like that the professors are engaging and are willing to help you any time you need it. They are always there for you and check in on you regularly.
Graduate Student,5,"I'm an online grad student.  The online program was easy to figure out and the support is AMAZING!  They have enough staff and stay in touch and call you to make sure that everything is going well for you.  I had never taken online courses, plus I have not been in college for years, and they made the adjustment fairly painless.  The instructors are flexible and understand there's a learning curve and allow some adjustment for crazy medical work schedules!  I am so glad I chose NKU."
Junior,5,Very good school for the tuition you must pay! The campus is very nice and full of lush greenery. The atmosphere is friendly and welcoming and not overcrowded. The classes are small and are never huge faceless lecture halls full of people you dont know. I have learned a lot at this college and have grown so much as a person.
Senior,5,"NKU is our local university. We have many community colleges and vocational schools in the area, however, NKU is the only 4 year degree school. The campus is beautiful (the parking sucks), the faculty is dedicated, and the tuition is reasonable. I am a proud alumni and recently returned to NKU at the age of 50 to pursue my bachelor's degree in nursing (I graduated in 1997 with my associate's degree in nursing). I love NKU. Go NORSE!"
Freshman,5,I love how everyone is so helpful and nice. That really creates a great school atmosphere. I've met so many amazing people here at NKU. My professors are absolutely FANTASTIC!
Freshman,5,"Home to challenging academics, friendly faculty, delicious cuisine, exciting athletic programs, monumental amounts of financial aid, cozy study nooks, efficient dorm rooms and an extremely safe environment. NKU is 20 from downtown Cincinnati which provides plenty of entertainment and adventure. The campus life is always booming with diversity, newly acquired technology centers, friendly faces and helpful advice. Each major at NKU had a club dedicated to furthering ones interest and passion in their desired future. The health clinic offers free flu vaccines and HIV checks along with providing different types of counseling. Greek life does not dominate the campus, however it is a big part of the party scene. Overall NKU is amazing."
Freshman,5,I  toured  Northern Kentucky University the end of my Jr. year of high school.  I am now a Senior.  I was very pleased with the campus and the buildings present at the university.  Many modern upgrades have been made.  The location for me is within 40 minutes of my home.  They offer a wide variety of courses and fields of study.  I know quite a few students that attend the university.  They are becoming successful professionals in the workforce. I applied and have been accepted and will be looking forward to starting my academic career there this fall.
Alum,4,"Northern Kentucky University had almost anything you could ask for. Engaged students and teachers, inclusive campus programs, and a huge campus. I really enjoyed my time here as my teachers really pushed me academically and gave me good options to go forth with my career."
Senior,4,"With classes that are originally made to be online, the teachers are very prepared and I learn a lot during their classes. Of course, my year is during the covid pandemic so many classes I have are not equipped to be only, such as a public speaking class.  While the teachers are very understanding about the difficulties of learning all material online, I feel I have not learned much from this past semester."
Senior,4,Competitive pricing for RN-BSN online program.  Faculty and staff have been very helpful all through this experience.
Graduate Student,4,"NKU is a great college for students especially if you are a commuter or returning to college. The classes have a smaller class size and the professors are pretty knowledgeable. The only negative I have is the times of some prerequisite classes they offer. Because they are a smaller college compared to others, some classes are only offered one time at a certain time of the week and they don’t have many other options."
Sophomore,4,NKU has made me feel some welcomed. The staff and professors take interest in you as a student and as a person!
Sophomore,4,"The professors and staff are very understanding and helpful with the confusion of moving to online. They do regular check up calls and are always available to answer any questions you may have. They know this is not an ideal circumstance, but they do everything in their power to make sure you feel comfortable."
Junior,4,"Learning online at NKU is made fun, interactive, and easy. My professors made a very smooth transition from face-to-face to online classes, and I’m genuinely proud of our adaptability as a whole."
Sophomore,4,Faculty adapted well to the online change making it an enjoyable experience. I never once fell behind and my professors were always available when questions arose.
Sophomore,4,"Although things have been hard with COVID, professors are still helpful along with the TA’s. They may also offer a tutor depending on the class."
Sophomore,4,I like the size of the school and how everything isn’t far apart when considering walking distance. I think the staff are pretty nice and they offer a lot of help such as the writing center and tutor trac.
Sophomore,4,I had a wonderful freshman year at NKU!  The teachers are very friendly and really work hard to make person connections with the students.  Everyone was so friendly and helpful.
Sophomore,4,Classes were transferred to online learning due to Covid 19. Considering the situation professors were able to transition their content quite well.  The professors tried their best to convert in person classes to an online format. Through that experience all my professors were very understanding of the situation and worked with us so the students could cope with the changing learning environment.
Senior,4,All of the classes I stayed in after spring break were so accommodating to the national crisis. I feel lucky to have had the professors I did. I did drop one class because the professor did not transition well into online learning and he would drop 4-6 hours of work with a two day deadline which didn’t work for the schedule I had.
Senior,4,"A lot of the professors are dedicated to student learning, although I’ve had my fair share of those just here to do research. NKU has one of the best LGBTQ on campus communities I’ve seen and so many professors go out of their way to make sure students are doing well. Overall I’d say it’s a student focused college."
Sophomore,4,"Northern Kentucky is the perfect environment for me. I enjoy the small/medium sized classes, which help me concentrate and learn material better. I think everyone is very friendly and welcoming to new students. All of the teachers I have had were very passionate on teaching, and truly cared about their students. I also enjoy the attitude towards greek life, because it is still popular, but you are not pressured to rush."
Alum,4,All of the staff is friendly and helpful. Classes are very affordable. The accelerated programs are set up in a way that is not overwhelming. Very good experience overall.
Sophomore,4,I am currently a sophomore and I have very few complaints about NKU. Most professors are willing to help you when you are struggling. There are hundreds of different clubs for you to participate in and the food on campus is really good.
Freshman,4,I like the small college feel of NKU. The rec center is fantastic and it is one of the most common places I find on campus.
Graduate Student,4,"This is my first term at NKU. Staff seems helpful and resourceful. Classes are flexible, but tuition is a bit much. School should make more of an effort to help secure preceptors."
Junior,4,"Extremely good and cost-efficient but it needs more livelihood, attention, and work in order to really prosper. As it stands now, it's efficient and beautiful but it could always use quality of life improvements ranging from how they handle housing to how they handle funding focus."
Freshman,4,"I love the diversity. There is so many different types of people, and it really allows for everyone to get to branch out and meet new people. As far as changes, I wish the dining halls had better food, at the moment the food options are very limited, as well as when you can eat."
Junior,4,"Overall, my time at NKU has been fun and has helped me grow into the woman I am today. They have a great program for minorities such as their African American programs, and LBGTQ programs. NKU does a great job of making everyone feel welcome, which is very lovely to see in the community we are surrounded by."
Sophomore,4,The students and staff on NKU's campus are very friendly and will help you no matter what the situation. The professors are the same and if you are having trouble in class will even recommend the on-campus tutoring that is free for students. I just wish there were more clubs to provide a bit more diversity to NKU's already immensely diverse campus.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I love my experience at NKU. I love the small class sizes because they allow you to have more of a one on one experience with your professor, allowing you to receive the help that you need. Many people want to see you succeed at NKU and will help you in any way they can. I would like to see more scholarships and activities for minorities such as African Americans because there is not much for minorities on campus at the moment."
Junior,4,Good school and good professors. Academic advising could be better at communicating with students and returning phone calls and email. Billing and financial aid office isn't knowledgable or helpful.
Sophomore,4,"I really love the university, it has a great feel to the campus as a whole with a ton of activities to participate in no matter the interest. So far almost all of my professors have been extremely kind and helpful, and my advisor has been excellent in every regard. The dorms are amazing, but the food isn't the best as expected from college food, but there is a Steak n Shake which is pretty cool."
Niche User,4,"I really like all the diversity and acceptance at this college. As a transfer student I immediately preferred this college over my last one because of all the amazing professors and accepting students. It is a good location, very close to stores and restaurants so you are never bored."
Senior,4,"While most people don't attend NKU for an ivy league education or an extravagant campus, what NKU does offer is a close-knit classroom setting with an incredible amount of diversity. There are nearly countless organizations on campus for Hispanic students, members of the LGBT community, and charities on campus that help to create an accepting and diverse environment for the students. The professors at NKU really care about their students’ well-being and their education. Many of them would go to the ends of the earth to help students obtain post-graduate jobs, research opportunities, and internships. Overall, NKU provides an affordable college degree and wonderfully supportive professors to help prepare students for their futures."
Junior,4,"So far, everything about NKU has  been super welcoming and low-stress. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that there have been a couple times when different departments have told me conflicting dates on things regarding scholarships and payments and the like. Otherwise, I love this school!"
Freshman,4,I am a freshman and so far I have loved my experience here. The faculty and staff here has been very helpful and kind.
Sophomore,4,Northern Kentucky University is a very diverse university. It is very inclusive. I love the small class sizes and personal relationships you can build with peers.
Sophomore,4,"Been a good school so far. Educational to price point wise it's a very good deal for a respected university.

It does lack a little as far as campus life goes....you will not be getting that fabled 'college life' here. 

Not too far from Cincinnati, though. If you want to have a cheaper schooling than UC but still go the parties there you can. Good food options around the city."
Junior,4,"I am currently a student at Northern Kentucky University. Overall, I really like the college experience I have received at NKU. As a student who cannot afford to live on campus, I drive 30 minutes each day to attend my classes. While purchasing a parking pass tends to be a bit costly, parking is pretty convenient. The areas that my pass allows me to park are within a short walking distance to my classes from the surrounding parking areas. I feel that the instructors at NKU are helpful and seem to care."
Sophomore,4,NKU is a great school!!! The fact that it's a smaller school makes everything feel much more close-knit and inclusive. There's so much diversity and there are plenty of organization and opportunities for anyone and every one no matter what you are interested in.
Freshman,4,"So far everyone I have meet is looking out for your best education interest in mind.

The best part of nku is the rec center."
Freshman,4,"I’ve never seen such a diverse school, both in population and the availability of various studies. Everyone here is one big family, connected by their love for this school. Norse up!"
Junior,4,I liked that most of the professors are interested in their students learning the material they are teaching rather than just have you memorize the information and regurgitate it on an exam. I would like them to hold more informational meetings so students know how they can get involved on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I like the layed back atmosphere. Professors are easy to talk to; so is my advisor.
I am very happy with NKU."
Freshman,4,"I like the academic focus the atmosphere, everyone is there for an education, not just to party. There are a lot of different student organizations and programs that allow you to get involved in the campus community. They also offer a variety of classes, majors and minors to help you cultivate your skills and determine what path is best for you."
Junior,4,"I feel so connected at Northern Kentucky University. There are so many clubs and teams to join with many opportunities, so students can network to get a leg up in their field. I can tell the professors care a lot for their students, and they (along with other faculty and the policies of NKU) support the goals of ambitions of students to help them succeed. The only downside is that there are many significant fees for things that most wouldn't anticipate, or at least anticipate to be so expensive. Still, I'm so glad I chose NKU, and I'm confident that it's preparing me for my future."
Freshman,4,"Northern Kentucky University gives plenty of opportunities to get involved around campus and meet new people. The faculty is very approachable, friendly, and passionate about teaching. NKU also has many student organizations and clubs that hold fun events to participate in."
Freshman,4,"Northern Kentucky University is a great school because the people there want you to succeed. There are numerous clubs and activities that you can get involved in. Also, the teachers are always there to help and guide you, and they all know you by name. NKU is also a very safe campus, and it allows you to be yourself and reach your fullest potential."
Junior,4,"It's a small school feel with enough people to not feel trapped.  The professors care and work hard to do a good job of teaching, but the physical campus is open during limited hours.  Overall, a great school to go to, and it's up and coming as a campus to reside on."
Sophomore,4,"I love the community at NKU. From the professors to the advisors, they are always willing to go all the way to help you with anything you need."
Niche User,4,I believe this school has the potential to be one of the best colleges in Kentucky. From the amazing teachings and the amazing food they've. Not to mention Kentucky is an amazing state with beautiful sights to explore and new people to meet every corner you turn. If the could improve the smaller problems like parties I believe this could be one of the best colleges in Kentucky in my opinion. I would hate missing the opportunity of missing this school because of college loans and debts driving me away from it. Lastly I want empahsis the importance off going here is. The idea of coming here is good one that will change your life for the better.
Niche User,4,Northern is a very friendly environment and has lots to offer. I believe they are growing to be better and better everyday.
Junior,4,So far my experience here has been very delightful there are a few downside especially in the financial aid area. The customer service is not the best there and getting an NKU scholarship is hard so you have to rely on other sources but other than that the professors are absolutely great and so far my experience here has been fun and delightful.
Senior,4,"The overall campus is nice and the education program is awesome. The organizations make everyone feel welcome and comfortable even the upcoming freshmen. Overall, NKU has been great and I would recommend it to anyone in the area!"
Junior,4,"Love NKU, a great school. They need more involvement for students that live on campus like more dining options that are open more hours. Since most students are commuters it would be good to focus more on campus residents. Greek life is awesome too"
Freshman,4,"What I like about Northern Kentucky University are the diverseness, environment, professors, campus, and organizations.  Several people love NKU and have grown there.  I will learn, thrive, and accomplish many goals at NKU.
     What I want to change about NKU is to gain more students.  I hope it will grow and become a stronger college academically, athletically, and spiritually.  NKU’s purpose is to help and teach students to follow their dreams and learn."
Senior,4,I really enjoy attending NKU! The teachers are very helpful and knowledgeable. I feel that the staff really strive to ensure my success. There are resources to secure the skills ane confidence needed to perform inside and outside the classroom. The one change can be more diversity. I am the only minority in my class and sometimes it can be uncomfortable.
Sophomore,4,"Northern Kentucky University is a perfect school for anyone who wants the smaller school experience with everything a bigger school has to offer. Northern Kentucky, their teachers, staff, and students all are extremely welcoming and there is something for everyone here. The only downsides are the food is average and housing can be difficult to contact and deal with. Overall, Northern Kentucky cares about their students and provides a home feeling to all who attend."
Freshman,4,"So far, I love the campus and atmosphere at NKU. I have not yet started classes, but I am pretty sure I am really going to enjoy my time here."
Sophomore,4,"I consider NKU to be a local college, but it is open to everyone. When I say that, I mean that most students come from the tri-state area. I haven’t started classes yet, but enrollment was made easy by the college advisors and they also helped me form the perfect schedule for my sophomore year of college."
Freshman,4,"The students and staff are very friendly, it's very easy to get around and it's just a pretty campus overall. Also, the dorms are nice. The food could be a little better but it's not horrible. Lastly, the safety is pretty good. They have emergency boxes all over campus to alert a police officer of danger."
Senior,4,"More diversity in the students would be great and also things to do for commuter students, especially that's not Greek life orientated would be also a plus."
Junior,4,"Northern Kentucky University is on the rise. It is a great up and coming university that has many benefits that come with attending this university. If a big university is not the seen for you, then NKU will be. It is a very safe university with a great atmosphere including great diversity."
Freshman,4,I enjoyed my overall experience on campus I just wished a little more for my first year. One really doesn’t get the full college experience on campus and with it being a predominantly white college minority’s like me somewhat feel left out. The academic aspect is phenomenal however. I guess to each his own!
Sophomore,4,"I have met some wonderful students and professors during just my first year at NKU, and have been able to get plugged in to 4 different organizations. It has broadened all of my horizons and given me a grand number of opportunities."
Junior,4,"Northern Kentucky University has a welcoming atmosphere with a lot of diversity. The majority of my professors have been very good and genuinely care about their students. The campus is secluded in nature and only a few minutes drive away from the surrounding town. It has its own police station and I always feel safe anywhere I go. There's a million different clubs, groups, and activities for students."
Sophomore,2,"Learning online has been very difficult.  Some professors use Zoom, which can just make trying to focus more difficult especially with all the distractions, or technical issues. Other professors just post content online and expect you to teach yourself."
Freshman,2,"Northern Kentucky University is quite literally a concrete jungle. Coming from a small town under the stars, being surrounded by bare concrete has unsettled me more than I could have ever imagined. Also, I have the cheapest dorm at NKU and it is almost as expensive as a more expensive dorm at UK where the dorms are much much nicer. Knowing that I'm paying good money to live in a dorm room that creaks and feels like a cell when I could be paying a couple hundred more to have my own room inside a dorm room at UK is very aggravating and lowers the quality of experience tremendously. Out of my 5 teachers in the first semester, I only enjoyed 2. I had an okay experience with 1 and a bad/terrible experience with the other two. I feel the school is not good enough for me. The standards are low for the students and many of the professors as well. I had harder work in my AP classes at high school. I need more of a challenge and NKU isn't giving it to me."
College Junior,2,"It can be a hit or miss for students, because students are the ones who have to build their own portfolio for the most part and that can be harder because of competition and stress. Plus a lack of connections in networking can be somewhat difficult."
College Freshman,2,Our athletic teams aren't widely recognized yet.
College Freshman,2,Living in callahan is awful. It is so hard to get to class. The shuttle takes forever and makes you late often. If i lived at the on campus housing things would be a lot easier.
College Freshman,2,I hate living on campus because of the quality of the staff here and everything else.
College Freshman,2,"They include $4000 for work study as part of your estimate which you will never receive because campus jobs are hard to get and If you do get one, you barely get any hours."
College Freshman,2,Nothing exciting close by. Have to go to other schools in order to have a little fun.
College Sophomore,2,"Nobody really cares about the sports or athletes here, which I really like."
College Junior,2,"NKU is entirely too focused on things like keeping alcohol and tobacco off of our campus. I just feel like it doesn't make much sense to prohibit legal things like drinking and smoking in a place where about 2,000 adults live. I also really dislike the prevalence of rude, disrespectful, and disruptive religious protestors on this campus. Several come regularly, and have been known to be actively trying to upset people for personal gain (one films all reactions, and has been rumoured to try to get people to hit him so he can sue and collect money). These people go well beyond ""exercising their freedom of speech"" and many of them come specifically to incite hatred, but they are almost always allowed to stay. It creates a loud, obnoxious, and unavoidable spectacle on campus and it's so unnecessary I don't understand why it still continues to happen. NKU has also instituted a new attendance policy for the first day of class - be there or get dropped from the course. I don't think that's fair at all, nor is the ""miss (x amount) of classes and either get dropped a letter grade or fail"" policy that many professors use. I just think it's a little ridiculous - we're all adults here, and we're all PAYING for our own educations. It's MY responsibility to show up and if I, as an adult, make the decision not to, then the simple facts that A)I'm wasting my money and B)I'm missing material and therefore may not do as well in the class, is really punishment enough."
College Sophomore,2,"I have not received any scholarships from NKU, but have received federal financial assistance after countless forms and contacting the office."
College Sophomore,2,"There were several times, me and my sister went into finical aid to get things sorted out. My dad even had to come in there a view times because me and my sister didn't know what was going with the finical aid."
College Junior,2,"WiFi is unreliable if you can connect at all.  Buildings are old, outdated and block any cell service that might have afforded you internet access.  Phone and tablet batteries just drain as they constantly search for service.  Plumbing is super slow and has no pressure"
College Senior,2,"I have to pay for school on my own. i still have to use my parents information and i barely receive financial aid. I have to work a lot during school to be able to pay tuition, and I'm always late paying and can't register for classes on time."
College Sophomore,2,Really around NKU there are only fast food places and a Kroger store.  Not all bad options but if you are trying to save money its not very helpful
College Sophomore,2,"It's so hard to get any aid here.  I have been trying and trying to get some, but haven't had any success.  My only option was to get a job during school and having three over the summer to help pay for every thing and I may still have to take out loans"
College Freshman,2,there wasnt much around adn the buses  dont always help
College Freshman,2,to get into NKU i applied online and paid my  application fee. then i got my acceptance letter. after that i sent in my conformation fee. the i picked out my room and meal plan. then i waited for my orientation date. after that i got to pick my classes then i got my room information.
College Junior,2,Not many options and expensive.
College Freshman,2,I have had a lot of issues with our financial aid office this time around.
College Sophomore,2,"I was not eligible for an unsubsidized loan because of the scholarship I received through the University, which I found to be absolutely absurd. I was also not notified that I was not meeting the scholarship requirements because I was told my AP credits would count towards the scholarship credits needed, which they did not. I did not find this out until I received a letter in the mail revoking my scholarship because I did not have enough credit hours, making me need to take classes in the summer."
College Junior,2,"It's always really extreme, extreme wind, or rain, or heat, or snow."
College Freshman,2,I don't feel like there are enough scholarship options for middle-age Caucasian males.
College Freshman,2,"Most of the parties take place at downtown clubs where it is open to the public and you have to pay about ten dollars to enter. Most parties are for the students who are a part of Greek Life, so for me since I am not in Greek life there isn't a lot of parties that I can go to."
College Sophomore,2,"Wind tunnel, lots of snow this winter. Late spring/summer/early fall is nice though."
College Sophomore,2,"We have had a lot of snow last few weeks, this makes it really hard to get to classes"
College Freshman,2,I have seen many students taking part in illegal activities in their cars. Also I have seen students openly walking around with beer bottles. My roommate always has alcohol in our refrigerator. My dad came over for dinner once and thought it was mine. My roommate and I constantly argue.
College Freshman,2,"It is very hard to find an available computer. And with lots of classes they require you to print a lot, and when you are in multiple classes like that you run out of prints."
College Freshman,2,When I moved into my dorm it was covered in mold. Housing sent out a cleaning crew which didn't even remove all of the mold. I had to clean mold off of the air vents off the bedroom ceiling. The shower molds up easily and my roommate does nothing to help clean. She breaks rules and has alcohol in our fridge very frequently and also used candle warmers which are prohibited. 
College Freshman,2,The cost is outrageous and it is very hard to find spots. I drove around for twenty minutes and could not find a single spot. I finally parked on the edge of a parking row and received a parking ticket because I couldn't find a spot to park.
College Sophomore,2,The food is mostly gross all the time.
College Freshman,2,"nO ONE ATTENDS MANY BASKET BALL GAMES, tHERE IS NO FOOTBALL TEAM"
College Sophomore,2,The weather is super bi-polar.                                     
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty much everything in the area costs a lot of money to attend, especially since NKU is only a few miles from downtown Cincinnati."
College Freshman,2,"It's really snowing now, so I hate it but it's alright because I live on campus and can get to class still."
College Sophomore,2,No unique opportunities. Typical college
College Sophomore,2,"Food tastes bad, but its buffet. Expensive."
College Sophomore,2,Wifi sucks. Always goes out. No discounted M. Word
College Sophomore,2,"Not as good as schools such as UK, but improving"
College Sophomore,2,"Part of the basketball team, students dont support"
College Senior,2,"I suggest that every student brings their own laptop because although there are computer labs, they are 95% of the time always taken by someone scrolling facebook rather than typing that paper they have due tomorrow. The internet on campus at the moment sucks. The wireless is having issues, but normally it's fine. This semester the wireless has worked on my laptop maybe 2% of the time. And printing quota is ridiculous. They give a full time student 150 free prints, which as a history student is like enough to print papers for 1 class not including the regular prints for class readings..."
College Senior,2,"I was in Greek Life. It was stupid and you definitely are paying for people to talk to you, not necessarily LIKE you."
College Junior,2,Professors dont care if you come to class or not. Cheating on exams are a big deal 
College Junior,2,Network speed is really slow. Computer labs are nice and library has plenty of computers too. 
College Sophomore,2,I am not involved with Greek life but during Greek week it looked as if they had some activities throughout campus. I really have not seen much from them since besides people constantly wearing their shirts.
College Senior,2,There are a couple of choices for off-campus housing but it is expensive no matter where you go.  The best thing is to find a roommate but even then rent can be pretty high.  There are more choices the further out from campus you go but you will need a car or the bus usually runs just about everywhere.  But make sure you plan ahead because the bus does take a long time.  If I were a freshman or sophomore I would stay on campus.
College Senior,2,A Psychology major at NKU will most likely encounter great professors and interesting courses.  The workload is doable.  There are a couple of hard courses there but they are not so much hard as it just requires studying.  The professors are always willing to answer your questions and certain ones will bend over backwards for you.  The only problem is the major itself.  Once I graduated (with a 4.0 GPA) I could not find a job anywhere in my field.  That's a problem!!
College Sophomore,2,"Computer on campus are great, there are plenty of labs in the library and other classroom building. The building mostly have WiFi, though phone reception is hopeless. WiFi in dorms is another story. it's awful. Do not depend on it if your putting off turning in an assignment. You might want to bring your own router."
College Junior,2,"Greek life is there mostly for people that feel as if they need to be a part of something on campus, but isn't something that takes over the campus. Non-Greeks aren't treated any differently than Greeks on campus by others and vice versa."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know anything about Greek life at NKU, and don't want to know."
College Sophomore,2,"The area the school is around is pretty safe, but there isn't much to do if you don't want to keep eating at restaurants and going to bars."
College Sophomore,2,Classes are held and people still hang outside no matter what the weather is like.
College Sophomore,2,"The food and dining areas are fine, but the cost is high for most of it."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Ehh, you have to drive into Newport or Cincinnati for nightlife. Unless someone has a party at their apartment"
College Sophomore,2,"The off campus apartment complexes don't really look like a lot of the off campus apartments that you will see at other universities. They look like your typical apartment complex that you would see in a ramdom suburb throughout any major US city, and there is noting really unique or cool about them to entice college students to want to live there besides them being near campus. And while there is a good number of college students that live in these apartments, there is also a good number of old people who really do not like young people living in there neighborhood. I should note that I have personally never lived in off campus housing, but many of my fraternity brothers do, and I hang out at there apartments a lot so I do have some idea of what it is like to live in them."
College Sophomore,2,"You are bound to have a bad professor here and there but during ONE semester at NKU, out of FIVE professors, only ONE was well organized and kept in touch with her students. I had to switch to an online schedule last minute. One of my professors didn't even notify the class that the class was over (it ended up being one of those half semester deals) and if your opinion varied from hers, your grade suffered and she responded unprofessionally. Another one of my professors was so disorganized that she had to correct one quiz THREE times and made the class more chaotic and disorganized by making us make a separate email account and a separate account to upload assignments (which often malfunctioned)."
College Freshman,2,The best place to eat is in the Student Union (SU). The are a lot of different options and the food tastes really good. Commons would be second and Callahan Bistro is the worst. Commons stays open the latest and the food is decent. They tend to not season food at all on campus so most things are somewhat bland. The Bistro is a last resort and even then most students choose to eat out.
College Freshman,2,"In winter, NKU turns into a wind tunnel. Be prepared for biting wind and losing your hat if you're not careful. The campus is pleasant when the weather is nice, but walking to and from the dorms can be miserable if it's not."
College Freshman,2,"I am in the process of being in a sorority. I have not yet initiated because of many issues. Greek life is not half of what i expected. I rarely see sisters together. They aren't ""there for you"" as much as they say they are. It's like high school all over again. Although i have made a few great friends through it, i can't say i'd make the same decision if i knew then what i know now. Also the process of rushing into a sorority is very judgmental. Not so much with the fraternities."
College Junior,2,"I think the cost of a parking pass ( $200 ) should be apart of the tuition that we pay. It seems rediculous that we ahve to pay extra after tuition just to park. Parking spaces are always filled up and most of the time you have to change garages or park at the very bottom because there are just no spots. If you park in a teacher lot, or anywhere else your not supposed to, they will fine you."
College Junior,1,"Only people involved in Greek life are included in most activities. I joined a sorority my sophomore year and was kicked out for ""lack of interest"" because my big told me not to go to anything since I had to hold over. They took several hits Fred dollars from me then kicked me out without even giving me a chance to defend myself or explain why I didn't attend anything. I found out that they held a meeting with all 130+ girls and talked about me to decide if I should be kicked out. They let me play in a soccer game with them and told me I needed to go to a meeting the next day. When I asked if I was in trouble they said I wasn't. Pretty heartless to let someone think that when it's not true. Snobby isn't even the word for it."
College Freshman,1,I lived on campus last semester and it was horrible. I had three roommates who always had people over. It felt like i couldn't even be in my own dorm.
College Freshman,1,I only had one professor that was helpful and was interested in his field. The school was very empty for those staying on campus on weekends. There were far too few organizations to join on campus and not a lot to do in general. I felt lonely there because it was so hard to find things I was interested in joining.
College Freshman,1,Not a part of it
College Sophomore,1,"As NKU is a dry campus there is no drinking in the dorms. Also, highland heights I believe has a restriction that there can be no fraternity or sorority housing in the community because it is considered a ""brothel"". Lastly, there is nothing at NKU to even walk to, so the party scene is at UC or up in Newport."
College Freshman,1,They need to get more organized and stop lying about how much you need to pay. Also the scholarships seem really good but when you get them you end up paying more than you were suppose to. It's really bad. I have had a bad experience with them.
College Sophomore,1,I personally think people in fraternities and stuff are usually dumb but think they aren't.
College Freshman,1,School spirit is very lacking.
College Freshman,1,you couldnt drink or smoke on campus i feel if i smoke  i should be able to outside. i understand not in the dorm but i dont understand why i cant outside.
College Sophomore,1,"70 and sunny one day, 10 and snowing the next. Wind, wind, wind."
College Freshman,1,"I am not a party person, I don't go to party, drink or smoke. I don't know where the party are, or where the clubs are."
College Sophomore,1,Nothing around. Must go to Cincy for nights
College Sophomore,1,Old buildings that look like jail cells
College Junior,1,I don't hear of any parties or close bar/club scene at or around nku
College Junior,1,Needs more options to choose from for vegetarians and people that do not eat gluten.
College Junior,1,I am a commuting student but the few times I have eaten on campus the food was not very good and highly over priced. Not to mention the employees are rude.
Recent Alumnus,1,NKU's financial aid department is extremely confusing and can be extremely stingy. You hear talk of many schools being understanding to students needs and NKU could be A LOT more understanding. MOST IMPORTANT: WHEN APPLYING FILL OUT THE SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION THAT IS SEPARATE FROM THE SCHOOLS APPLICATION. I attended GSA and had a 28 ACT NKU requires a 25 with GSA/GSP attendance. The school's application ask about both of these and contrary to popular belief YOU STILL NEED TO FILL OUT THE SCHOLARSHIP APPLICATION!!! Even after inquiring and appealing multiple times and showing my financial needs I'm still going into my sophomore year being denied a full tuition scholarship. STAY ON YOUR GAME AND DON'T MISS OUT!
College Junior,1,I'm not impressed with the scholarships given at Nku. They want students to succeed and everything but at the same time they give very few scholarships away unless your a student athlete.
College Junior,1,Parking is awful. There is almost never anywhere to park and the parking passes are extremely over priced.
College Sophomore,1,The Financial Aid and Bursar office give you the run- around. I eventually got all of my financial aid in the first semester. In the second semester some of my financial aid was put on hold because I wasn't notified that I had fees to pay.
College Sophomore,1,"I never heard of any parties going on on campus, except for a few held by the different school clubs or groups of friends."
College Sophomore,1,"Highland Heights is literally the worst place to ever place a college. The town is boring and looks like a random exit off of the highway. It is full of old people and families that dont really care for a bunch of young college kids coming to take over there uninteresting town. The town doesn't take pride in the fact that they have a devision 1 university and if you drove into Highland Heights you would never even guess that there was a college there since there are no banners, signs, or anything around town displaying NKU pride. But probably the most annoying thing about this s****y little town that for some reason seamed like the perfect place to put a college is that they don't cater to college students. Rent for apartments is defiantly not at a college kid price, and for a typical 2 bedroom apartment in a boring and uninteresting apartment complex will typically set you back about $800 a month. There is only one legitimate bar, and anywhere eles that serves alcohol is usually your typical chain restaurant like Applebee's. There are no cool and unique places to eat near NKU like most other colleges, and the places that you are going to find near campus are going to be your usual Subway, Taco Bell, and McDonald's. Nightlife is also non-existent at NKU, and there are no clubs, one bar as I mentioned earlier, no movie theater in the area, and you literally have to drive everywhere to have any fun. Which if you are like me and hate driving and prefer to be able to walk to places, NKU is the worst college for that. Aside from the fact that NKU is a great college and you are getting a great education when you go there, NKU and Highland Heights really does not have much more to offer."
College Sophomore,1,"The food is your typical dorm food, which would be ok if they just served that food at the dorms, but they still serve that stuff at the student union. This is because NKU made a deal with a catering company(not a very good one I may add) that makes them serve only there food at all places to eat at NKU. And with only a Starbucks on campus there are very few places on campus that you would actually recognize on campus to eat at. Which is really disappointing, since many colleges throughout the country have McDonald's, Subway, Burger King, Chipotle, and other places that college kids actually want to eat at on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"There is NO nightlife at NKU. NKU is not really located in an urban college area so most of the surrounding community is comprised of families and elder people. If you want a ""night life"" feel I would suggest going to Newport, Downtown Cincinnati, or Cliton (UC area) which are all with in a 15 minute drive."
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible. I transferred here after complications causing me to move back to continue college in Ohio. The dorms at NKU were HORRIBLE. No A/C, tiny (so tiny that both students unpacking at once is pure chaos and almost impossible not to mention hot), and my RA was M.I.A. half of move in day and all day the next day. I ended up incredibly sick and either she was there and didn't bother to come check to see if I was okay, or she just wasn't there. Either way, it isn't good. I can't even remember her name because I met her for all of 5 minutes. I moved out the following day because it was such an uncomfortable living environment."
College Junior,1,"Permit costs are completely ridiculous. It's $210 for a full year. When I went to Xavier, it was only $100 for a full year. The law enforcement gives you tickets for ridiculous reasons. People have gotten ticketed for not have permits even when they have a valid permit in plain sight. Spots fill up quick, so you usually have to park in a gravel lot that's a million miles away from you class."
College Junior,1,Traffic and parking are terrible. I have to leave my house an extra half hour to 45 min early to get to class on time. There are way more students than parking places and the cost of permits are out of control high.
College Sophomore,1,"What Greek life?  I am almost positive they don't have any houses, just benches.  I have seen a few cars with bumper stickers that shows signs of a Greek life, but I'm not sure what they do or where they gather."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus can be a nightmare at times. If you have classes early in the morning, you need to get to campus at least a half hour before the start of class. If you have class in the afternoon, like around 2 or so, or at night, then parking is much easier to find. At least good parking is anyways. Sometimes, people have to park over by the dorms which are at least one mile away from classes."
College Sophomore,1,"Suburbs, boring, and hard to get around if you don't have a car"
College Sophomore,1,"The campus police will not tolerating any rules being bent.
You'll get locked up and kicked out of school."
College Junior,1,"NKU is a commuter school so the nightlife is non existant as far as I am aware of. I live off campus, as most do."
College Junior,1,NKU is primarily a commuter school and they charge an arm and a leg for a parking pass and yet there never seems to be enough parking. Your best bet is to get there at 8:30 to ensure you get a parking spot. Not to mention the parking patrol is extremely ticket happy. It became such a problem for me to find a parking spot I moved to an apartment complex that would allow me to walk to campus.
College Junior,1,"In the winter time or when its windy, NKU is horrible walking around campus! NKU is like a huge wind tunnel and in the winter with the wind its almost to bad to even go to class."
College Student,1,It's most just chain restaurants there is a Kroger so that's helpful if you live on campus.
College Junior,1,There's a group of guys that live close to my apartment and they are extremely loud at all hours of the night and no one does anything about it.
College Junior,1,"It is very cold here. It's like living in a wind tunnel from November to March. Classes are rarely cancelled, and so we have to walk through snow on many days. They are pretty good about salting the roads and sidewalks so it's not that slippery. When it gets warmer, it's really nice to sit outside by the lake or at the picnic tables."
College Sophomore,1,The weather is always fluctuating in the area.  NKU is basically a wind tunnel because of all the concrete buildings and because it is on a hill.  This can make for a very difficult walk to class especially in the rain.  Umbrellas cannot keep up with the amount of wind flowing through campus and they often break.
College Junior,1,There is never enough parking and half of the lots are gravel which is bad for cars.  It can take up to an hour or more to find a parking spot and the construction around campus adds to that time.
Recent Alumnus,1,Information Is Not Readily Available – I am a non-traditional commuter student.  Trying to find an available computer is not too difficult but trying to figure out how to print anything...like pulling teeth.  The printers that are available to the students are not even in the same building as the computers.  When I asked how much it cost to print anything I couldn't get an answer.  I try my best to avoid doing any type of schoolwork on campus.

Junior,5,"it has been good and fun but not the right choice for me as a pre med student.
you should apply it is a family environment and is always good to bea round. the faculty are a great help to all of us and never say no to giving us opportunities. we are just very far from everything so you would need a car ."
Freshman,5,"I like how to classes are just the right size, the teachers are great at making sure you understand the material. I also like the fun activities they have on campus."
Freshman,5,Chowan University is a great school and has a lot to offer for different departments but the food is just okay. Which makes since when it's only a D2 school. I would like to see the more social societies at chowan.
Alum,5,"I went to Chowan University about 1,500 miles from my home with little expectation. I just wanted to play lacrosse and they had started a team. The town is pretty small in Murfreesboro, NC a town of I believe 3,000 but I think the university makes up most of that number. With less than 10 places in town to eat including two on campus dining halls, I would say a car is definitely necessary. Now, the best thing about Chowan is the people. College will be what you make it, so will night life. But, Chowan has some of the best and truly nicest people you will ever meet. These are those lifelong relationships people tell you about from faculty to staff, students and everyone in between. You can find your people here at Chowan."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Chowan was amazing because I really enjoyed myself my first year the teachers were amazing I made some really good friends, and the classes that I took were really easy also it made it more easier to transition from high school. I would encourage all new incoming students to come to chowan because it is alot that you can learn from here and it has a really good academic programs."
Junior,5,I  am enjoying Chowan because  I am enrolled in the Adult Degree Completion Program that allows all adults to complete there education as they work full time and go to school full time. I  work at my own pace and the staff encourage me to keep going and keep up the good work. The  staff are so supportive of me of every thing that I do. The staff there have help me  out so much and I am very thankful for that. The staff are so amazing.
Junior,5,"My experience at Chowan University has been amazing! Coming from a small town, much like Murfreesboro I really felt like I was at home. Chowan is my home away from home and everyone on campus as well as the community welcomed me with open arms. Chowan is a small and diverse university, and I have developed so many new found relationships with the students as well as the staff!"
Alum,5,"At Chowan I really excelled. I was on the deans and presidents list, tutored, joined psychology and criminal justice association. I was involved in clubs and other extracurricular activities. This school really pushed me to the limit and challenged me as I student. Definitely a great school and I enjoyed being there."
Niche User,5,"The fact that they show so much energy and spirit towards their new oncoming students, it gives you a sense of achievement by picking a great school, but also picking a environment that you are setting yourself up for greatness."
Niche User,5,My son has currently been accepted to Chowan University.  His plans are to play football with the team. My husband and I took my son to Chowan University for a visit. We were able to tour the campus and be introduced to some staff members. The campus was very nice and the atmosphere were great. The small class setting were perfect for our son. We even had the chance to speak with a few students about their experiences with the university. Everyone we spoke with had nothing but good things to say about their experiences.
Freshman,5,Chowan University is a very excellent HBCU to attend the school is very beautiful and lovely the campus is very nice and its a very nice christian school. The cost is very expensive I may must say but with the help and support of my family and scholarships and grant.
Freshman,5,The professors are very focused on what is best for the students. small class sizes allow for the one on one instruction that is so important for students. The student life is very involved in making sure there is plenty to do around campus. The only thing I would change is updating the school a lot of the buildings are older and could use a facelift.
Freshman,5,I like how Chowan makes one feel welcome and included. Thereâ€™s clubs for everyone and academic success is easy to achieve due to professors standards. I believe Chowan should change the appearance to make it more appealing for new students.
Freshman,5,Itâ€™s a boring school so you have no reason not to do your work you hardly can get distracted. The tuition is way to much ðŸ˜« . The professors are really nice there willing to help you
Niche User,5,What I like about Chowan is the way the students seem so happy although its in a small town I wish it had more eating places and more shopping places so I could shop. I can't wait to start in the fall seems like a very good school.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this university. Everyone from the President of the University to the cafeteria staff makes you feel like you're part of something bigger. The staff and the students on this campus truly want to make a difference in the world. Personally, I am inspired every single day to become a better person and a harder worker by everyone on this campus. Chowan University is more than just a solid education, it is a family."
Junior,5,Chowan University has been a great school over the past 3 years. As we all know college is what you make and I'm still making it home.
Niche User,5,I am a rising college freshman but in my experience so far with chowan university it has been very pleasant. The offices and professors are very helpful when it come to new students and making sure that you stay on the right path to success.
Senior,5,"Chowan is amazing! I'm a senior, and I wish I wasn't leaving just yet. I came in very uncertain about my academic potential. I will now be graduating with honors and an impressive resume. I owe it all to Chowan University!"
College Sophomore,5,"Greek life makes up most of the campus, it is important and even looks really good to be involved in Greek life. Greek life isn't ever viewed as a bad thing but most non-Greeks are not too sure on how to view Greeks so they tend to stay to themselves. Greek housing isn't provided at my University however, it is a great school and is still really good to be in."
College Sophomore,5,"This schools encourages you to maintain and get a degree. They want you to succeed, and want you to be able to make it in the real world. My teachers throughout school graduated and got a major from Chowan and it made me decide that Chowan was the place for me to get my degree. They encourage me as a student to get my work done and make sure I'm on the path to success."
College Sophomore,5,I love Chowan! I am more than satisfied with my choice of attending this school. The school has worked with me and has made it so much easy on me and helpful as far as me being a student!
College Sophomore,5,"They have programs at school that talk about the matters of sexual assault. The security wants you to have their number, they want you to walk with somebody if it's getting late. They put your safety first."
College Sophomore,5,I love the campus housing! It was one of the smoothest process at Chowan! I completely love my roommate and I love how the care about your concerns regarding your housing.

College Senior,5,This school is great with networking. It allows a lot of alumni to come back and work for the University.
College Senior,5,"The professors are great and are able to connect with the students on a personal level. The class size is an average of 30 to 40 students, which allows the professors to have a one on one relationship with the students. They really care about the students achievements in and out of the classrooms."
College Senior,5,Career Services is the best at Chowan! The Director of Career Services care much about our goals and accomplishments after college.
College Senior,5,"I love Chowan residence halls, and with the addition of campus apartments/suites is amazing!"

College Junior,5,"Chowan has upgraded their housing facilities having all of their upper class men living in apartments and suites that were build within the last couple of years. They are currently building even more suites and apartments. Every room has its own temperature control system, which is very convenient, and most residence halls have access to kitchens, which allows students the opportunity to cook."
College Senior,5,I love me school !
College Senior,5,It's a great  school
College Student,5,The professors are helpful.  You have to go to class though or you fail.
College Student,5,"if you're a freshman you have to live in residence halls but upperclassmen, we can live in Whites Crossing. It's new suites and apartments."
College Student,5,There is lots of team spirit. The smurf clubs paints themselves blue. We have a pep band.  Most students attend the events.
College Student,5,Chowan is in a small town. It allows me to quietly study but is close enough to areas that I can go do things. The professors help you as much as they can.  There are lots of activites on campus that student life puts on.
College Freshman,5,Our Athletic department are one of the best.
College Junior,5,"Chowan actually is a really great school, it's small so it's easier for the teachers to remember you as well as growing a bond with them and your colleagues"
College Sophomore,5,"So far, college is great! I love it! The reason why is because, Chowan University is small private school. Small schools fit me the best,so I go with what's best for me. I can learn more in a smaller environment. College is what you make it!"
College Freshman,5,All the greeks are nice to non greeks they speak and interact with everyone.
College Freshman,5,The library and computer labs are a great place to be.
College Freshman,5,No one is judgmental of anyone's orientation of anything.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is a Hawk and loves to show school spirit and support the other sports!
College Freshman,5,"The professor's know your name, you are not a number."
College Freshman,5,"They hand not only just hangout with their brother's or sister's, but also with other student's."
Junior,4,"I've had no problems taking online classes using Blackboard, but sometime all of the links for one topic could get overwhelming."
Sophomore,4,"Due to the coronavirus, they moved everything online and were able to still manage to teach despite the fact that the college itself wasn't prepared to go online initially."
Sophomore,4,The only time I did online courses was because of COVID-19. I havenâ€™t fully taken any courses online.
Sophomore,4,Chowan is a great school. The experience there was amazing. The staff was very helpful and was available during business hours to help new students and also help to adjust to the new college life.
Alum,4,"I went to Chowan University about 360 miles from my home. The reason for coming to Chowan was for soccer and the family environment on campus!  The town is small however, the residence of Murfreesboro wants you to feel like a second home!  Chowan University allows me to meet the best and truly nicest people you will ever meet! The staff and professors want to help you whenever you need help right away from classes to your future after Chowan University!  I am proud to be apart of the Hawks family."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year attending Chowan University and by far I am enjoying it. The students, staff, and professors are very nice and help you when ever you need help right away. Chowan University is an amazing college and I am proud to be apart of the Hawks family. Chowan has a beautiful campus that is really easy to navigate, and all of my classes are close to each other, so I have no excuse to be late to class. I appreciate the large amount of  staff that lend a hand and give motivational words to keep me on my feet and striving to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"My first experience and impression of Chowan University is that it is very mellow, I enjoy the small classes, the one on one contact with the professors, and all the events that the school host for the students; such as the paint run, movie nights and etc. It is isolated in a way due to being located in a small town and not having a lot of options for food places or grocery stores that are walking distance. Without a vehicle or knowing someone with a car it is a lot of walking and when it rains it floods bad, but it's great exercise. The changes I would like to see change is the Food, fix the bad flooding,  and to have a work-study or uber to take students to local stores."
Senior,4,I had a great time at Chowan University due to the people I was surrounded by.  The only downfall of the University is that you have to go over to the next city which is about 15-20 minutes if you want to have some fun outside of school.
Freshman,4,Chowan is a very friendly school and I like how your professors try their best to successes in class.
Freshman,4,"It's great, professors really focus on making sure the students understand. Though the town is small student life plans so many fun activities and sporting events are always great!"
Junior,4,This school provides a plethora of opportunities related to academia along with with athletic and campus involvement.
Freshman,4,At this school you need to really get involved or it will seem boring. There is not much to do around the campus. Fern involved with people. Meet and greet new people. Don't stay in your dorm
Junior,4,"what i like the most about Chowan University is the class size. The class sizes are small and the teachers have a greater chance of knowing their students one on one. If i could change one thing about Chowan University, then it would probably be add a bigger student union with more options of things to do"
Junior,4,"Chowan is a small school that which, I am grateful for. It really allows me to preform at my best. However, it is a bit of a party school. there is a party most weekends. The staff and faculty really care about each individuals experience. Great people! Great school!"
Sophomore,4,"It is a small community, friendly people, nice quiet environment, it's in the country which is miles away from civilization. Overall Chowan is a great university, has amazing academics and several sports teams that are apart of D2."
Freshman,4,"This a small university, but its still growing. The classes are made easy because the professors are willing to teach. They are available to to to me personally. The only problem is the location. When more places are built around the school, it will attract more students."
Freshman,4,"my experience with chowan university has been good so far. they are just a little expensive. they are a good christian base school. the students on campus are friendly and they have a lot of events going on for the kids. if there was something i would like to change, it would be the in state tuition. it is to expensive for students such as me. and they need to offer more scholarships for students in my major."
Freshman,4,"The university is very nice, and historical. Located in Murfreesboro, NC there isn't much to do off campus. The school itself is put together with great professors and instuctors that care about your education."
Junior,4,Chowan is very homey.  I love how small the classroom are and how the professors interact and get to know each student. What I would change would be more sociable places to go around Chowan University. For example a movie theatre and bowling allies to go to on free time.
Freshman,4,"Overall experience is alright. The college is not what I expected from my first visit. I have adapted to the boring campus with barley any places to eat near by. Academic wise is great! The only bad thing is comfort, finding joy in staying here."
College Sophomore,4,I have complete access to my professors and they make themselves available to help me at any time. The courses they teach are pretty enjoyable and the class sizes are never too big. There's enough to where the professor can remember your name quickly.
College Sophomore,4,"We have campus security and public safety that we have 24 hour access to. There is hardly and campus crime and i personally haven't witnessed anything in a harmful manner. Therefore i feel safe, and being a male i feel like i don't have as much to stress about as a female would."
College Sophomore,4,The athletic centers are in good shape and maintained really well as well as the team performance is displayed well. The school is entitled to a bunch of school spirit and everyone really attends all sport events including myself.
College Junior,4,Professors at Chowan are very nice and want you to do your best. They are there for you if you need help on the course. Very easy to get along with.
College Junior,4,"Greek life play a very important role at Chowan, a lot of people hold them to high standards, but there are also some who feel different. Greek Life throw all the parties which a lot of students look forward to."
College Sophomore,4,We are very big on the Greek life! The Greek life at school is a big part of the school and the community.
College Sophomore,4,The school has a wide variety of clubs and sports for you to join. I love how active my school is towards its students.
College Sophomore,4,I have encouraged all my friends and family into coming to this school. I explain how much fun and how much the staff truly cares for you.
College Sophomore,4,Chowan has a diverse group of people
College Freshman,4,"Our campus security is right outside of every dorm building almost, it makes us feel very safe but there are some things that could be improved. There are simple things like drinking that occurs and I am sure it cannot be completely stopped but when someone needs a ride back to their room late at night public safety is supposed to come, however they don't always do their job. They try to make you feel safe and secure for the most part although sometimes it fails, I feel protected and know nothing will happen as long as I am never alone at night."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is something I am a part of, Alpha Sigma Tau. However people don't know what all to expect from a Greek until they're one themselves. Greeks are important to the campus and actually are VERY involved with fundraising and making things happen on campus. Most Greeks are extremely sociable and easy to speak with as well as they know how to have tons of fun. Greek housing is not something that is available at Chowan, but there is a great deal of bonding within sororities and fraternities. As far as non-Greeks are everyone views the different ones differently. Some see Greeks as just another way to be ""better"" than someone while most see it as an unforgettable bonding experience and a new opportunity to be a part of something big. Overall the Greeks are great."
College Freshman,4,"In my opinion sports are highly looked upon at Chowan. Randy Harrell is a big fan of our sports and he makes that knows, as well as I attend as many things as I can, while I still manage my work load. There are plenty of fans and supporters at all the games no matter what season it is. There is many people who are involved and the teams do very well in playing from what I have watched."
College Sophomore,4,feels like home away from home and good class sizes
College Freshman,4,90% of the parites are greek life parites
College Freshman,4,There are many different services that students can take advantage of for help. The biggest help comes from the writing center when you are stuck on a paper.
College Freshman,4,The teachers help you to find job opportunities and the importance of internships.
College Freshman,4,There isn't much crime on campus other than stuff being stolen. Fight generally don't happen and school and local cops work together to keep people safe.
College Freshman,4,"I love this school and everything it has done for me. I went from being mediocre, to being tied for tops in my class. The teachers are excellent and care about their students. The athletic teams are getting better and providing more school spirit."
College Sophomore,4,Most parties at the school are hosted by Greeks
College Sophomore,4,"I mean I would prefer to have a higher girl to guy ratio, but this year has been more diverse than my freshman year."
College Sophomore,4,"The work ia   sometimes overwhelming, but it's college;  anything worth having you have to work for."
College Sophomore,4,Chowan is great you should check it out and consider it as one of your choices to further your education.
College Sophomore,4,I haven't really been involved with that.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the housing in Parker Hall, balls for the pool table will be nice, but it's great"
College Sophomore,4,Chowan is what you make it. It has been a great experience for me so far and I recommend anyone to give it a shot!
College Sophomore,4,The campus diversity is great.
College Sophomore,4,My major has a 100% job placement.
College Sophomore,4,I love the one on one relationship with my professors.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is great and it a beneficial assets in life.
College Sophomore,4,We have a great athletic department.
College Senior,4,This campus is safe for the most part
College Senior,4,The housing is great at Chowan University.
College Senior,4,The Greek Life is great at Chowan University. They serve their community and provide the students with fun activities to partake in.
College Senior,4,I have experienced a lot of positive adventures at Chowan University
College Senior,4,"The sports teams has improved a lot. They have a lot of support from the university, community, and the students."
College Junior,4,The party life here is great.  As usual you always have those who don't know how to act but that's nothing new
College Junior,4,This school is very diverse
College Junior,4,They offer a lot in academics. They allow you to be a well rounded person mentally.
College Junior,4,They are always sending emails about job openings for senior students to check out
College Junior,4,My experience here at Chowan has been the best experience every
Niche User,2,Chowan was an overall good campus but not a college I could see myself attending in the future. The academics were pretty good but the overall cleanliness of the school is what caused me to not like the school.
Freshman,2,"The experience was so bad. They kicked me out and the disability service is so terrible and the counselor didn't do her job right. The school system should be shut down,they're not doing there job right with helping students"
College Junior,2,They don't let us have fun and we get fines for the stupidest reasons.
College Sophomore,2,Barely places near by. Have to travel 30+ mins.
College Senior,2,There really aren't too many places to eat off of campus. The only fast food restaurant is McDonalds and Subway and they have the worst customer service. Walter's Grill and the China Garden have the best prices and both offer student discounts. There really isn't much variety though. If you want a nice salad or something healthy you have to go to the Tavern which is over-priced.
College Senior,2,"Chowan is a very small community. There really isn't anything to do there, we have local restaurants but only a handful. The community is very close with the University and they do things together. Murfreesboro has the Watermelon Festival in August that thousands come to."
Recent Alumnus,2,They are strict on the wrong things and they need to come more modern than being old fashion.
College Freshman,2,There's not a club to go to.
College Freshman,2,There are no clubs located in the town. The transportation can be bad if you don't have a car or if you don't know of anyone that has a car.
College Freshman,2,"This town is literally in the middle of no where. Its a small town of no more than 300 people living there. This town isn't fit for a college because of the lack of activities, shopping areas, and area attractions. There's only one fast-food restaurant in this town, and there a Chinese restaurant and they have a up-scale restaurant. In order to enjoy yourself you have to go to the next state which is Virginia. Its even worse when you don't have a car, because you have to call the taxi-driver, and he tries to over-charge you and make deals with you so that he can make more money.  Because we are college student the taxi driver tries to ""get over"", by charging a waiting fee while he has to wait for you. Its in everyone's best bet to drive a car to school"
College Sophomore,2,There is nothing to do if you do not have a car or a friend with one. There is nothing fun to do that is within walking distance.
College Sophomore,2,"Even though I recieved scholarships, it was not enough, i got called down a few times to see if I could get more."
College Sophomore,2,Only sports players and greeks live in the houses off campus.
College Sophomore,2,Everything is very expensive for the qualitly you are recieveing.
College Junior,2,"The football field looks like High school stadium. Every game I feel like I'm at a low budget game. No excitement unless its homecoming or rivals. We should have a REALThe Weight room is terrible, its to small, the weights are old and rusty,"
College Junior,2,"work on it. more officers. have call boxes campus is way too big for us not to have any especially since our officers take their precious time to respond. lights on the pathways, especially behind the football field."
College Junior,2,The majority of students drink and do drugs. It is rare to find someone who doesn't. There is always someone willing to get alcohol for underage students.
College Junior,2,"For such a high tuition, I feel that I did not get enough for financial aid. I had to get a lot of loans, which is why I am now looking for scholarships."
College Junior,2,There isn't much to do. Students get bored.
College Sophomore,2,They food and safety is not that good
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much to choose from, the only fast food is McDonalds. The local restraunts are kind of expensive for college students. "
College Sophomore,2,"Academics are okay, you just have to remain focused on your studies."
College Sophomore,2,There is nothing to do off-campus. 
College Sophomore,2,"The Greek life is average, nothing special."
College Sophomore,2,It's just not what I expected out of the college experience. It's sort of like high school all over again.
College Sophomore,2,"Athletics are average, some programs within that department have been threatened to be removed."
College Sophomore,2,"They are just here to make money, they don't care about the student body."
College Sophomore,2,There are very few places that can be chosen to eat from off-campus.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't an nightlife here on or off campus. The only options that you have is to go to the nearest college or city, which is an hour away. "
College Freshman,2,"There isn't mush to choose from to do on or off campus. The school is surrounded by an very rural area, anything dealing with shopping or entertainment is miles away. "
College Freshman,2,"I rated the off-campus dinning options here at Chowan a 2, because there are not enough places to choose from when you want something to eat. The cafÃ©'s and restaurants they have here are average, but still not enough. The area doesn't offer a lot of variety to pick from, including different styles of food, Vegetarian/vegan options, or simple fast-food restaurants. Not to mention the dinning places that do have above average food and quality doesn't offer students discounts and are way too expensive.  "
College Senior,2,"The dining hall is rather small and the food is not there great, there should be a larger variety."
College Sophomore,2,"There are many activities held throughout the week by the school itself, however, no where is there around campus to go out for entertainment."
College Sophomore,2,"When it storms, It STORMS! Heavy rain and scary thunder storms. I am not use to that back at home."
College Sophomore,2,There is not very much nightlife at Chowan University. But if you have the right friends you can still have fun and enjoy the college experience
College Freshman,2,You have to constantly watch your every move at Chowan. The campus is very small and the townspeople have major access to it. Campus security is horrible. Just be aware of your surroundings.
College Freshman,2,Some foods are good. Breakfast has a variety of foods to choose from.
College Freshman,2,I will say a C- because if you don't have a car or a friend with car you will be stuck on campus. There is stores in walking distance but they're mainly restaurants and gas stations.
College Freshman,2,I will say a C because you need a car to get soomething other than the restaurants around the campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,The diversity at the school isn't that much. Now that Chowan is a CIAA Division school it has more African American/Blacks than it use to. You may see a different ethnicity here and there but from what I have seen it is very bland with the diversity.
College Sophomore,2,The community that surrounds Chowan University is very small. If you come from a big city you may not be used to it. The towns people are very accepting and very nice. There isn't any malls or shopping areas around. You have to go to another city to do that.
College Freshman,2,"It is easy to walk around campus and down the street to McDonals and Andy's, but if you want to go to Walmart it will be a 20 minute drive, so you need a car."
College Freshman,2,"Murfreesboro is a very small town, that hasn't changed a thing for many years. It is very safe but you can drive right threw this small college town and miss it. You have to drive over an hour away to find a large city."
College Freshman,2,"It rains almost every day, and the weather is not consistent."
College Sophomore,2,"School Spirit Is Important â€“ The athletic program at Chowan accounts for a lot of fan support and school spirit for the students because Chowan is an underdog when it comes to sports. Sporting events are always packed and students are always showing their support. However, Chowan lacks a number of sports that a lot of the student body are interested in. A few of these sports are Track and Field, Swimming, and Lacrosse. Chowan only has one athletic facility specifically for its student athletes and its football field needs improvement."
College Junior,2,There is no type of special housing for Greeks. Greeks are typically seen in a positive light. Our greek students are active in a lot of activities. There are only a few Greek organizations on campus though.  Chowan is improving as it grows so I think in years to come changes will be made for the better. I wouldn't say Greeks dominate the campus but they are talked about a lot in a socail kind of way.
College Junior,2,"Public Safety â€“ Chowan Public safety is good because they are around 24 hours. The bad thing is they only respond if they are called from a phone. There are no safety polls on campus so if you are in danger and have no phone and no one is around there is nothing you can do. Chowan public safety also doesn't answer the phone sometimes. If you do get in touch with them, they are polite and respond quickly."
College Freshman,2,The food is somewhat okay. It could be better and with more options to choose from than just having the same thing almost everyday or other day
College Freshman,2,It Needs More â€“ The dining is very poor because there aren't really anything around the school other than a handful of places but to truly get a good meal we have to travel up to 30 minutes to Virginia to get a nice restaurant so that truly needs some work because that is a turn off to the school.
College Freshman,2,The One Cafeteria â€“ The Food Is Bland And There is little to no variety in what they serve on a daily basis.
College Freshman,2,Freshman Dorms â€“ freshman dorms are okay. one reason is there is no elevator. they did not tell us that during the tours and i live on third floor so that was a huge problem on check in day. there isnt a lot of storage space.
College Student,2,Computers are available but the amount of paper you can use is at a limit.The teachers give us so much to print off but the school does not give us enough paper to print all we need
College Freshman,2,"Describing My College â€“ Overall I Would Not Recommend Chowan To Those Who Are Not Use To Going Places Right Up The Street Or A Lot Of Places To Eat Out. This School Is Sort Of Easy To Learn, But For The Tuition We Have To Pay I Feel As If We Should Have Better Dorms And Better Food Choices."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone can have a car because it's like a city school where everything is close, driving is needed at a above average."
College Freshman,2,"The atmosphere is very quiet because it's in a small local town with a few restaurants and stores for simple shopping for the basic living items but not really any attractions for the students, there is talk about more being brought to the area soon. Since it's a historical area the do little things around the school for students to expand our knowledge. Overall it's a good school but they need more things to grab the attention of students so they can be more involved and enjoy being here."
College Junior,2,Small Quiet Town â€“ The housing off campus is okay for the most part. The school owns a few off campus university houses but you have to be picked for those. Everything is relatively close in proximity to the campus but requires some means of transportation at night. They are making progress by building apartment for next year but they are too expensive.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life adds a little excitement to the atmosphere here. They are the life of a lot of parties and they sometimes make it worthwhile to be in school.
College Sophomore,2,Lacks Variety â€“ Murfreesboro doesn't have a lot to choose from You have to go almost an hour outside of the city to find something that sparks an interest to you.
College Freshman,2,"I think that the safety on our campus can be improved. I feel that all the security do is ride around on the golf carts. They are not young, but rather old. If something was to happen, I would feel that their health would be in danger as well. We have already had a student to get jumped by people from the community and a lockdown from where a student was robbed at gunpoint."
College Freshman,2,You don't have to pay for parking. You just have to have a parking pass.And when it's time for class you have to leave early if you want a park.
Junior,1,i havent taken any online c;asses so i dont know how those are but the teachers are great and will always help
College Sophomore,1,All parties end in fights.
College Sophomore,1,"It's a party school. Their easy access to drugs and alcohol. If your underage, you can get someone of age to get for you. Transportation is your own responsibility or a taxi cab."
College Sophomore,1,"You can drink without getting caught. People smoke right in front of the dorms. People smoke and drink in their rooms. People store alcohol in their rooms. If you don't party,drink, and smoke you are left out."
College Sophomore,1,"Don't even apply to go to Chowan University they accept anyone! I recommend people go to community college and transfer to their choice university like i did. I stayed at Chowan for one year and that was the worst school year of my life. I had no friends and ate in my room. This school is not worth the price and the headache. They say its a Christian school it the opposite its a party school, the only thing you get in trouble for is saying a bad word. I never felt so unsafe in my life townies can walk on campus and do what ever they want. You go into stores and they follow you. The classes at chowan fill up quick and their not a lot to pick from. The only thing is the class size. The professors act like your in grad school and give you hard assignments."
College Sophomore,1,I really don't know about career prospects but you only benefit from playing sports
College Junior,1,We are located in area that doesn't have many or any of these things.
College Sophomore,1,"Yes, people are friendly. But that's about it. A degree from here is worthless. You will end up with students who don't want to do any work, so you don't really learn anything. Most students here only want an easy A, and some are (sorry, but it's true) flat-out stupid! They can't even spell! I feel like I've incurred student loans for no reason here. I am definitely transferring because I want my degree to be from a much better school. By the way, any time anyone asked where I went to school and I said ""Chowan,"" they are always like ""what?"" Nobody even knows about this school unless they are the locals, but this is a town of less than 4,000, so it's useless!"
College Sophomore,1,Small town means there will be few off campus dining options. You'll have to drive to the next town over to have more options
College Freshman,1,The main places we eat is Mcdonalds and the same chinese restraunts and subway. I want something different.
College Freshman,1,There isn't enough food places in mufreesboro!!!
College Junior,1,Tired of eating the same fatty foods
Recent Alumnus,1,"The food in the cafeteria is terrible along with the hours I think it should be open all day, everybody has different schedules and cant always make the cafÃ©."
College Freshman,1,We do have off-campus housing but I don't know anything about it
College Freshman,1,"The town is too small to have any kind of long-distance or bus transportation. Everything is in walking distance, but if you want to go shopping for food, you need a car."
College Freshman,1,You have to be border-line broke to receive a reasonable amount of money from this school. Even if one parent works and the other doesn't you still wont receive a reasonable amount of money which can be really upsetting. The only way I notice that you can receive a well amount of financial aid money is if your parents are separated and if you live with a grandparent.
College Sophomore,1,There is not much to choose from espically after 10. At this time the only thing open is Mcdonalds drive through.
College Student,1,its nothing to do at chowan university
College Freshman,1,Its crazy how nothing really affects our weather. It can be ice on the ground and most of the time we still have class unless the professor has cancelled.
College Junior,1,"There is NOTHING to do. Friday thru Sunday it is boring. No activities on the weekends like no parties no get together's no nothing. People leave every weekend and leave school after the semester because there's nothing to do. A lot of people don't have transportation. Anybody should get transportation free of charge if we paying 30,000 plus. There isn't a bar/club for young people to have fun at. Zakks?? is to small and half the campus be trying to fit in that little box. If we have Parties we are being watched like we are little kids. Who parties with the lights on or With staff watching us. I feel like if were grown we are entitled to do what we want. If one person messes up, don't jeopardize everybody else."
College Freshman,1,Murfreesboro is a very small isolated town.
College Freshman,1,Very cold and rainy in the winter. Super hot in the summer.
College Freshman,1,Has a lot of non students on campus. The security are old men. The crime that happens are mostly rape. The campus get very dark at night and is unlit.
College Freshman,1,"Have to pay for printing, once that gone your out of luck! Have your own computer and printer. The library fills up quick and so does the computer lab. The Internet is slow and wireless is bad. The library is long distance from the dorms."
College Freshman,1,Family own restaurants! Got an McDonald and a Subway.
College Freshman,1,"They cook you anything , and most of the time it's nasty. You wait in long lines in a small cafe. Not a big variety on anything. You can pick certain items to eat on your plate."
College Freshman,1,There are is no strictness. You do whatever you want. Girls have guys in the dorm all night long. People drink and smoke in rooms and public. 
College Freshman,1,It the wrost! I have really no friends and most of the time bored. Never going back to school. Happy to transfer and most people are.
College Freshman,1,"The towns people try to talk to you all the time. Most of them are ratchet.  It a  borning town, there none thing fun to do. Sometimes feel people are alway watching. "
College Freshman,1,There are parties but you have to pay. Also there are some hangout like a coffe shop and a bar.
College Sophomore,1,Everybody is always drinking and causing problems
College Sophomore,1,The school does not provide help to find off-campus housing. 
College Sophomore,1,Everyone usually goes home on weekends because there is nothing to do in the town itself.
College Sophomore,1,"Come here prepared to walk, or pray that one of your closest friends has a car."
College Freshman,1,There is no transportation offer here on campus. The only transportation the that is offer if from a church that come on campus and pick up students wanting to attend church.
College Sophomore,1,"Chowan is very strict when it comes to breaking the rules, for example, if you are caught drinking you get a $400 fine and possibly kicked off campus. If visitation rules are broken you receive an $25 fine and possibility of losing visitation privileges. The security isn't that great because most of the time they are in the booth sleep so they are not aware of the students surroundings. Security also doesn't have the proper training because when a student have anxiety attacks or pass out they do not handle the situation properly. Security at Chowan does not know how to control a large crowd."
College Sophomore,1,"Since Chowan is in a small town, there really isn't much to do there. Yeah there is parties but that is either on Thursday's or Saturday's and you would have to have a ride and a ticket. There is a bar called ZACC's but it's really small so it's not really anything going down there. As far as transportation, Campus Security used to help out a little with that. Say you were at the library and needed a ride back to your room or something like that, they would give you a ride. Well all that stopped. That is why this gets such a low rating."
College Senior,1,"The off campus dining options are very poor. We have a McDonalds and a Subway to go to. There are also little small family owned restaurants, but they are not really convenient with their hours or price. Our fast food option (McDonald's) is slow and the quality is not worth the wait."
College Freshman,1,"Chowan University is located in a very small, agricultural area. Therefore, there is not much to do unless you have your own transportation."
College Freshman,1,"Because there is nothing for college students to do around Chowan University unless you have a car to drive somewhere. Also there is no nightlife spots around the college, only places to work."
College Freshman,1,"The problem with drug usage at Chowan is basically the abundance af marijuana and alcohol. Chowan has ""Thirsty Thursday"", where drinks are only $1, and the smell of marijuana outside of the dorms can be unbearable at times"
College Student,1,There are not a lot of places to go eat at down here. There isn't much around here period if you ever want to go out you would have to drive about 30 or 40 minutes to another city.
College Freshman,1,The public transportation is terrible. The only way for anyone to possibly get around is if the have a car. For those that don't have cars they either have to walk to the places they need to go or ask someone for a ride. Chowan University needs some sort of shuttle transportation to help the students get around
College Sophomore,1,There is no type of transportation. You have to walk everywhere.
College Freshman,1,If your unfamiliar with the country life it's very hard to find an apartment off campus.
College Freshman,1,A great deal of the students at Chowan are childish and act as though they are still in high school. There isn't enough diverse people here for me. I feel as though they should change the name from Chowan University to Chowan High School.
College Freshman,1,"Dining at Chowan isn't the best. On the weekdays, we have somewhat of a variety but on the weekends, we get old meat and pink and brown (uncooked) hot dogs. The dining hall closes so early so during a exam week you need to have food of your own (due to late night studying which brings upon cravings and hunger in my experience). As far as Murfreesboro, it has very limited amount of dinig options and they a well close way too early. After a certain time, Murfreesboro is like a ghost town!"
College Freshman,1,Everyone is average if that. every one pretty much dont care how they look so its whatever
College Freshman,1,Nothing but nothing to do. Town is small and has nothing in it. please bring a car.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing in the town or the next towns. There Nothing on campus unless you like table tenis. If you come here please bring a car. you have to travel miles and miles and cross the state line to find any night life
College Student,1,"Murfreesboro is a small beautiful communtity but there is not a lot to do around the community, there are some great resturaunts and one or two good shopping places but over all there is not a lot of attractions around here."
College Senior,1,"I can't believe how difficult it is at ANY school to get help in the financial aid office. Some of the women are nice however, you're lucky if you can get a concrete answer out of anyone in under 2 hours after a game of 3971923947 questions. It's like a wild goose chase trying to get to the bottom of anything and it sucks that no matter what you do, if they're not in the mood to help, they'll let you know. Education is definitely a ""for profit"" endeavor and it's apparent at this school."
College Senior,1,"Oh Lord. Chowan isn't the largest campus in terms of students, but it is a large campus in the woods. There have been several instances of .. crime... on campus and security is lacking. It's really a matter of using common sense and making sure you're walking with someone if traveling at night."
College Sophomore,1,Athletics at Chowan are average they can improve in many areas though
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much There â€“ The off-campus dining is sub par at best, there are two Chinese stores a McDonalds and one other restaurant that is in my opinion just ok."
College Sophomore,1,"Unfortunately at Chowan University there is no off-campus housing. Chowan has just recently built an apartment building this year which will be ready to use this upcoming school year. This apartment building is on campus, however it is expensive and was just out of the question for me."
College Junior,1,"If you are not involved with sports at Chowan you may not be getting much financial aid. I do not recieve much financial aid at all and it is tough because I have to get a lot of loans. Being that it's a private school, Chowan is very expensive. Even though I do good as far as my grades go, I still don't earn as much financial aid as I would somewhere else. On the plus side they do not charge out of state tuition."
College Junior,1,Student Activities â€“ Chowan is strict on tradition so they are not very open to new ideas. Things such as Greek life statues or benches are not seen because they did not allow the greeks to display it. Organizations such as NAACP are not on Chowan's campus which is something I would like to change before I graduate.
College Freshman,1,"There is not really much to do outside of Chowan University unless you have a car to travel to places like Ahoskie, Nc or Virginia. There are malls in those places but nothing in Murfreesboro except the parties different people and Frats and Sorority's have."
College Freshman,1,Not Strict â€“ Whenever They are seriously needed they take forever to show up but tend to be places they aren't seemingly needed.

Senior,5,"Online learning has been incredibly easy. The switch to online was obviously something no one expected, but my professors have made it VERY accessible for everyone. One course even allows me to come virtually while the rest of the class attends in person."
Junior,5,"My online experience has been overall good. Each professor approaches the online things differently, with some setting required zoom lectures, and others having the class be complete independent"
Senior,5,I love peace! Everyone on campus wants to see you succeed! Students have accessibility to multiple resources on campus that will work with the student. My favorite thing about WPU is the emphasis on career readiness. WPU does a really good job of preparing the student to go into the field of their choice. Has several courses in place to prepare a student on the dos and don'ts of an interview and help the student obtain that internship.  WPU is a small campus but has a big heart!
Junior,5,"I enjoy the small campus, and the close relationships with professors and faculty. There is a feeling of everyone being welcome at William Peace, and a sense of community."
Sophomore,5,"I love this school! The campus is small yet very easy to get around. The class ratio is very small which is a plus, and the professors are passionate about what they do. I feel like I'm at home at WPU!"
Senior,5,They are always kind and caring and looking forward to helping students.  Ms. Lassiter in the office is always someone you can go to for help and she is able to take care of things quickly.  Same with Mrs. Garera.
Freshman,5,"At William Peace University, class sizes are very small. Therefore, your professors know your name and care about your success in their classroom. As a student-athlete it is important that I keep my grades up and I feel that it is truly possible here at Peace. Everyone is friendly. Everywhere you walk on campus you are bound to see someone you know. It is a blessing and a curse but I love the family feel that Peace has given me. We are such a small school and often get overlooked. Which personally I think is crazy because we live in the center of downtown Raleigh."
Freshman,5,I love William Peace! One of my favorite things about it is how small the class size is. It helps provide the students with a lot of one on one time with the professor and it helps to the student to have a better chance of succeeding! One thing that I would like to see change is the dining hall. I feel that if I pay $1000 for a meal plan my food should be pretty good.
Junior,5,"I really enjoy that the campus is in the heart of the capital of Raleigh, it gives great experience for me especially in my field of criminal justice. It allows access to the county courthouse and all the different bureaus in downtown."
Senior,5,"WPU has a strong sense of community, and a faculty that are eager to make your undergraduate experience a personal one. They are committed to the success of the students, and make every class, event, and extracurricular feel comfortable and easy. The classes are engaging and wonderfully taught, and provide ample opportunities for experiential learning."
Niche User,5,"William Peace University is a smaller campus compared to most campuses, and allows for smaller classrooms.  This makes one on one interactions between students and teachers easier to achieve and creates a better learning experience."
Freshman,5,Orientation was awesome and the dorms are well kept. They work with you to ensure that you get a job after you graduate. I wish the campus was bigger.
Niche User,5,"William Peace University is a wonderful college, with various aspects of activities for all students to enjoy. Taking the time out to visit William Peace University was worth it because it was not a biased trip, and very informal."
Junior,5,"William Peace has been a great school to me so far. The application process was very easy and I was able to work with someone every step of the way. Their advising office is fantastic and helps you plan for your major effectively and the campus is the most beautiful in Raleigh. The student teacher ratio is the big selling point for me on this university, it ensures you get high quality instruction and are able to succeed in classes."
Sophomore,5,"This is a very diversed small community that offers a variety of things any student could possibly think of . There are many things to do around campus because, it is downtown Raleigh . The school shows that they care about their students although the price could be cheaper , so that it is affordable to those in need . Overall I’ve had many great experiences here ,and I can’t wait to do it all over again in the Fall ."
Niche User,5,Being from a small town I love the overall size of William Peace University. Small class sizes allows for more interaction with your professors.
Niche User,5,It's such a beautiful campus and it has such a great back story to the buildings. The admissions staff is really sweet and helpful and the students will help you if or when they can.
Freshman,5,"William Peace University has been a wonderful experience for me as a student, it is a friendly atmosphere the professors are very professional they make sure that every student understand  the material that they are teaching.  Campus life at Peace is fun and safe the Campus Police are always  patrolling the campus ensuring student and staff safety, Dorms are very clean and are inspected weekly, the food that is served to the students is delicious and the cafeteria is clean and spacious, I am very happy with my Choice to attend William Peace University."
Alum,5,"My experience during my attendance at William Peace University was nothing short of amazing. During my first year, my university was all girls and that was quite an experience. I also was a student-athlete all 4 years where I was a part of the Women's basketball team. William Peace University was a small college that was very family-friendly oriented, just like the town and high-school I grew up in.  In other words, my university was like home."
Sophomore,5,"I love it here at this school. I've been here for two years and next year I will be the junior class Vice President. It's a small school, but a big family. The small school setting allows for a greater interaction and connection between students and faculty. The professors here care about each and every one of us. You won't regret coming to this school. It's very diverse and accepting. I wouldn't recommend any other school but this one."
College Sophomore,5,I love the class size! It's about 20 people and everyone is very open. Most teachers are very active and use power points
College Freshman,5,I feel safe in Peace.
College Freshman,5,Peace University is great and overall amazing. It's one school people should experience because Peace has a lot to offer and is very enjoyable for me.
College Sophomore,5,"I have had the wonderful opportunity thus far to have the most effective diverse experience with the professors at William Peace.  During my first year experience I claimed much success and I owe half of that success to my professors. I credit their accountability and teaching methods to create a atmosphere to where all students are able to learn and just having the one on one personal time with them makes the experience even more greater. I am very grateful for the professors at Peace because they take a lot of time and effort to work with their students, they have a passion to teach and create environments where all students are able to thrive and feel accepted."
College Sophomore,5,"The staff is very devoted to helping you find a job, whether it's a part-time job or an internship, they are very willing to help you."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe on and around campus. Public safety is always around and the Raleigh Police Department is right around the corner if anything goes wrong. In the previous semester, there was no threat to my safety or the safety of people around me."
College Sophomore,5,"The dorms are more spacious than other dorms I've been in. Also, everything is pretty close together so its not hard to get to class."
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this school! It's small, but that just means that you have a more personal relationship with the professors and staff members."
College Freshman,5,All the professors I have had have been extremely willings to help when needed and always very nice.
College Freshman,5,"Peace make you have an internship with a certain amount of hours before graduating, making it possible for you to explore the career field you are interested in and helping you to learn more about what it is."
College Freshman,5,"Our public safety team is always roaming, making sure everything is in place and all students are okay."
College Freshman,5,I love William Peace University. It has brought me close to so many people that I will always cherish and allowed me to extend beyond what I ever thought I would educationally.
College Sophomore,5,Always have security driving around and watching stuff
College Student,5,Feeling of safety at all times
College Student,5,"Class sizes are great, instructors amazing"
College Sophomore,5,Peace is a wonderful place for all kinds of different students!
College Sophomore,5,"I love Peace, the unity is what makes it so special for me. I'm use to small groups and teams and even though they don't have many men sports, I find myself surrounded by groups of dedicated students and faculty. They participate in community outreach work and events. Yes, it would had been cheaper to attend a state college but my personality and character belongs at Peace University. As an Eagle scout, High school wrestler and football player, I've learned that small groups, packs or teams commit and achieve and that's what makes William Peace University unique and I without a doubt, I would make the same choice."
College Freshman,5,There is always something to do.  The staff are always promoting something fun to do.
College Sophomore,5,"If you have a car then you are set!  NC State is only 5 miles away and they have a strip mall of food places to choose from.  Gumby's pizza joint gives student discounts and large pizza for $4 bucks.  If you don't feel like getting off campus the university offers 'city bucks' that you can use in participating restaurants close by.  We have a Donato's Pizza, Peace China, which are located across the street.  City bucks also work for Which Wich sandwich joint which is in Cameron Village, about 5 miles from the school.  

Campus is located in the heart of downtown Raleigh and so there is literally loads of places to explore including, but not limited to, vegan cuisine, sushi, pubs with live music, Belgian wafels at the benelux cafe (my favorite), and Nourish Raleigh which is a fitness camp and smoothie joint rolled into one.  So much to choose from!"
College Freshman,5,"I love the transportation here at JCC....I found a condom in the student shuttle that would help me with my genetic disorder, it was already used a couple times but it will work."
College Sophomore,5,The school does a good job of cracking down on drug problems if there are any
College Junior,5,No evidence of use that is improper
College Junior,5,Several options and opportunities in the area. 
College Junior,5,"Love the school, counselors, and professors. I have learn a lot and still learning. "
College Junior,5,"There were no problems getting into my program. There is not any process of declaring a major at WPU, you simply sign a form that states what you are going to major in."
College Junior,5,"I am very happy with my program. I would not do it over again as of right now because I am very pleased with the experience I have had so far. I am not too concerned about finding a job so far because the support and help of my adviser, professors, and faulty at WPU is outstanding and they put their all into helping students find jobs in the field they choose."
College Junior,5,I'm at WPU in the Psychology department. I absolutely love the program. The professors are always making themselves available to their students and helping them progress and do all they are capable of doing. They all have had experience in their specified field and share those experiences with the students. I have had all of the professors in the program and have learned more than I ever thought I could learn.
College Sophomore,5,"Its always beautiful no matter what the weather is, the school is always presentable for new prospects."
College Sophomore,5,"Raleigh, is a city that offers culture - a veriaty of things to explore that is interesting to all sort of people - from layback to partying; great location for professionals."
College Freshman,5,there is always a spot and its close to class and the dorm
College Sophomore,5,"William Peace University is great about transportation. We are a small school, classes are litterly 10 feet away from any dormitory, so walking is really easy. We are also in downtown Raleigh so a bike is an easy convenient way to get around. For those that prefer riding, we have the ""r-line"" which can take you all through Raleigh, and i believe its free to use. For events like ""Red Rose Ball"" and ""Fall Cocktail"" which are peace traditions, the college provides transportation (limos or party buses) to our locations!"
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is nice and very welcoming they help you get things done and on-time
Recent Alumnus,5,"What It Is Like to Be a Child Development Major – During my studies as a Child Development major, I have come to realize that my classes have a lot of overlap in them. This has made studying a lot easier for me because what I am learning in one class, I could have learned, or could currently be learning, in another class. I have come to know all of my professors really well. This coming semester, I will be pursuing my internship opportunity, in which I am really excited about. My professors are always enthusiastic about helping myself and my classmates in networking and finding job opportunities."
College Senior,5,"The Atmosphere of Raleigh, NC – The atmosphere of Raleigh, NC is a very lively one. Peace College is located in the center of downtown Raleigh, so there is always something to do, whether it be on campus, or off campus. Just a few blocks away are the History and Natural Science Museums. Both museums always have new and interesting displays. There is also a children's museum downtown that parents can take their children to that is very fun and educational. Several clubs and bars in the area provide an excellent nightlife. Raleigh also holds annual fairs such as the Fiesta del Pueblo to promote diversity. For those who love theater, Peace College has a great theater department that puts on several plays a semester that are open to the public. The local National Hockey League team, the Carolina Hurricanes have been a hit since they won the Stanley Cup."
College Sophomore,5,"My Program Bio. You just say I want to major in bio, and wham it's done"
College Sophomore,5,Peace college is a tiny college in downtown Raleigh. There are many busses in downtown that we are able to take but our school card is accepted at the R-line Bus system which is awesome and it stops right in front of the school and runs every 30 minutes.
College Sophomore,5,"Peace college is very diverse. First entering the school coming from a predominately white high school to a new school where there are people of all different races, and from many different countries. In my Cultural Anthropology class we had some of the student from Qatar talk to the class and they taught us about their lifestyle back home, It was a a truly amazing experience."
College Sophomore,5,"Peace Passport – My first year of college was AWESOME!! I had a great advisor who helped me with class registration and know what he is talking about. I also had great professors and tutors (who knows what they are doing). There are also many great clubs and organizations around, so that always keep many of us students busy. Plus, since Peace College is in the heart of Downtown Raleigh, there are always unique activities happening in downtown."
College Sophomore,5,"Well, it all depends on the weather now. LOL...it's actually really nice for the most part. Especially during winter and when it snow! Other than that there is always a cool breeze for the nich sunny days and most everybody hangs outside on the main lawn. Oh yeah just watch out for the rainy days."
College Sophomore,5,"Drugs, Alcohol, and Peace – Only if your out partying then that's where the scene takes place. it's a free tobacco campus, and alcohol free. The directory residence has very strict rules for alcohol and drugs usage."
Senior,4,"I am close to graduating now but the school is definitely the one I should have picked. I do not regret coming here, but there is still room for improvement. Several issues across campus were buried and avoided when I believe they should have been addressed. Several cases of discrimination in different ways were prominent, but I suppose that is the case at any university. However, the class sizes, professors, and especially Public safety made my experience amazing."
Senior,4,Very close knit community with small class sizes and the ability to build great relationships with professors and students.
Junior,4,"I love William Peace University! I've run into some issues with communications from financial aid and the business office, but professors and advisors are wonderful. Any time I have a question, my advisor is has been quick to answer and help resolve the issues. With the current pandemic situation, you are unable to meet with people in person, but they have made it very easy to schedule phone calls!"
Senior,4,"When we switched to online due to CoVid 19, WPU made sure every student was accommodated for. The professors worked with the students and were very understanding of the circumstances that they were in. WPU hosted events virtually for students to stay connected and did a really good job of keeping the students informed."
Senior,4,"My overall experience at WPU has been positive. I came to WPU because of the proximity to downtown Raleigh and small campus. The professors and courses that you will take here are probably the best thing about the school. If you are looking for a party school, WPU is not the place for you. Professors actually care about their students and will help them expand their professional network. Issues between alumni and past administrations have diminished the school's name a bit but the current president is working on regaining their trust and expanding the school. Staff are very friendly. It is very pricey to attend but if you have the right mind set and are looking for a small school with individual focus, WPU is right for you. If you're from a larger metropolitan city, Raleigh may not be that impressive though. Also, there is no Greek life on campus which I prefer. Most athletic teams practice and play off-campus due to the campus being so small."
Freshman,4,Super excited about attending WPU in the fall! I was blown away by my campus tour and open house. WPU is located near downtown Raleigh and I look forward to moving away from home and being a part of the Raleigh community.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman I thoroughly enjoy the school. This school is quite small, but convenient. The party scene is minimal, but it's easy to find where the parties are off campus! The cafeteria food can sometimes be a hit or miss, but it's pretty consistent! An occasional special food day where they match a theme like Caribbean  or Italian happens every now and then. The professors are really nice, and some even come from other universities  such as NC State or UNC- Chapel Hill. The dorms are actually pretty nice, and the maintenance who help take care of any issues with the dorms are quick. Public safety is on it when it comes to any suspicious activity or person on campus, and quick to alarm students of any issues. I have to say that the only thing that could make this place better are the events. Sometimes the events are very basic, and not really fun."
Junior,4,"My experience at WPU has been great so far, the teachers are great. The campus is small and beautiful"
Niche User,4,It is in a great area and very good looking. The people are nice and there is a lot to do in the surrounding area.
Freshman,4,"Peace is a welcoming campus with very forward thinking and kind people. Peace is experiencing transitions, by adding faculty and campus events. The small school environment is comforting, but some argue that it lacks structure."
Freshman,4,"William Peace is a small college right in the heart of Raleigh, NC.  The school has a family feel to it as most students know each other at least a little.  I love the easy access to things to do in the city.  I play volleyball at WPU and love the home games with the student section cheering us on very loudly and enthusiastically.  My teammates are my best friends and we do things together all the time.  The food is average, but not bad.  The dorms are actually decent with a fair amount of space for me and my roommate.  I am very happy with my decision to attend WPU and look forward to my next three years at the school"
Sophomore,4,"I really love the campus and the area it it is. It is situated in beautiful downtown Raleigh & there is always lots of things going on or things to get into and I love that. I also enjoy the different performances and various activities put on by the clubs at school. Plus there is always an opportunity to do community service which I am very fond of. I also enjoy most of my classes, which is surprising. I look forward to going to them, even though I may be a little less excited for my morning classes lol. Overall I really love this school & I think it is the perfect fit for me as well as many others."
Freshman,4,"For a year, I called William Peace my home. I loved it. The only part I would have to complain about is their love for money and money only. Education wasn't as important as the money you were paying. The school is very money hungry."
Senior,4,"William Peace University is a four-year university that offers a great opportunity for students to fulfill their dreams of receiving a collegiate degree. William Peace University stands by the mindset that they are capable of allowing students to reach their full potential and turn good students into great students. At William Peace University you are required to complete an internship, career development courses, a personal financial management class and a four-year writing program. Offering these requirements allows students to not only learn many essential needs that will be required when entering the work force, but however, also allow them to place their foot in the door to potentially receive a job immediately following graduation. William Peace University offers academic programs that are hands-on, skill developing and immersive to ensure that the students receive the best experience for their journey following graduating from this exceptional university."
Freshman,4,"I am a first year here at William Peace and my experience has been awesome. I got an internship with Love Wins recently and am excited to start working with them. There's so many clubs to join and if there isn't one, then any one could make one up. There's a lot of opportunities in Peace and hopefully I will be able to grab as much as possible."
Freshman,4,I think William Peace is a great place to be. It may be small but it really encourages a teacher-student relationship. The teachers truly care about the success of their students.
College Sophomore,4,I believe Peace is a very highly reccomended and almost everyone goes to grad school after or gets a job in their career of choice.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't had any classes yet, but the professors I've met so far are helpful and kind."
College Sophomore,4,"The prospects of a student having a career after graduating from William Peace is incredibly high. As of this year 97% of graduates who graduate from Peace are employed. Graduating and obtaining a degree from Peace opens the door to incredible opportunities. Peace creates and develops its students for their future standing on awesome principles and on a promise to believe, William Peace gives students opportunity for change."
College Sophomore,4,The Health and security on William Peace Campus is very thoughtful and supportive when it comes to the personal affairs of  their students.
College Sophomore,4,"William Peace Campus housing is great, my favorite part of their campus housing is having your own private bathrooms and personal space. During my first year experience I felt that I was very secure and that fact that William Peace has 24 hour security watch really gave me more relief because I felt comfortable in knowing that if I was ever in trouble I could go to them at anytime of the day or night."
College Sophomore,4,William Peace University sponsors awesome athletic teams and offers great support to all athletes.
College Sophomore,4,My over all experience at Peace has been very great so far I have truly enjoyed the journey so far. When I think of Peace I feel confident because I see great opportunities and just from the wonderful exposure while in the classroom makes it even more greater and most importantly I really adore the family atmosphere which is really a true blessing. I am very proud to be a student at Peace and thankful for what I've learned and accomplished thus far.
College Sophomore,4,"I love this school. My only wish is that it had a more diverse course line, but because the school itself is pretty small, options are more limited."
College Sophomore,4,Our Greek life is mostly centered around helping the community.
College Freshman,4,All of the athletic teams are well known and cheered for even if you do not know the players.
College Freshman,4,I feel William Peace University is a very safe school just because it is a small school. We have public safety walking around all the time making sure everything is going alright.
College Freshman,4,"William Peace University is a small school in a big city, it is an amazing experience but expensive."
College Sophomore,4,Love the size of the classrooms and how easy the professors are to talk to.
College Sophomore,4,"It's small, the professors are awesome!! I love my school!"
College Student,4,many career services and support
College Student,4,Student support is awesome. School spirit is off the charts.
College Student,4,"WPU is amazing. The instructors, academic counselors, and financial aid counselors are outstanding and really take a student-centered approach. Classes are moderate sized but well rounded. Instructors provide individualized instruction when necessary and are deeply considerate"
College Freshman,4,I have not had a teacher so far that i did not like personally and their teaching methods. every teacher trys their best to accommodate the students so they can learn at maximum effeciency.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is very nice. the atmosphere is great and a lot of the people around you are friendly and supportive.
College Freshman,4,"It's pretty nice, the people are okay though."
College Freshman,4,William Peace is a pretty awesome school.
College Freshman,4,"The safety and security at Peace is pretty good and is safe for the students and staff to spend there time there working or just spending the day at wonderful Peace College. At Peace you do not have to worry about sexual assault due to all the Public Safety Officers that Peace has. There has never been an crime or any type of killing or assaults on campus, nevertheless I personally hope that it don't be one neither at all. So therefore with Public Safety being on campus 24 hours and 7 days an week that is an lot of safety and support that they give to Peace."
College Freshman,4,"The degree I have chosen is an bachelor's of Science and minor in Business. The skills in which I will achieve will allow me to be able to go into my field of Pharmacy Science and someday own my general business. I have not yet completed my internship but I'm hoping that I am able to get an job in my particular field once I graduate with my bachelor's degree. The quality and compassion of the staff at Peace University is extremely wonderful and the staff and recruiting staff is outstanding in making sure that Peace is well organized. Here at Peace College we have a career center that can help you with internship opportunities, resumes, and job opportunities in your designated area of study. Career Services has been extremely helpful as I begin to make life lasting decisions that will affect my life after Peace."
College Freshman,4,The experience I've had at Peace with my courses has been challenging and hard. Some of them took up plenty of my time due to the information that was given. My professors played a huge part in helping me when needed. When I needed assistance they were available to help me with any particular area to help me understand the material much better. The class style is extremely unique because of the characteristics of the professors and students. The students are comfortable with the learning atmosphere and we find ourselves sitting in the same unassigned seats daily! Some may have the desk in a circle or straight in an line. The class ratio is fifteen to one unless it was a course such as biology that was a class of high demand and required more class slots.
College Freshman,4,"The life of living on campus is great because you don't have to mess out on nothing that is going on at campus and also not just that but you have peers that are also there and it's better to have to he college experience on campus and also to get involved with others and get to know people and the atmosphere, specially if you not used too it.. So it is really fun to be on campus and plus living up there."
College Sophomore,4,"Fantastic teachers

Small Class sizes

Teachers actually know your name"
College Freshman,4,Great choices however the prices are outrageous if you don't have student discounts.
College Junior,4,Places within walking distance and cost is pretty reasonable.  I have not been able to find place to accept my student id and give a discount.
College Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful, and has a smaller atmosphere. Classes are very close, and there is lots to do in downtown Raleigh!!"
College Sophomore,4,I will be living with my parents off campus and commuting to school but they were very helpful and supportive during my decision.
College Sophomore,4,"There are many types of restaurants off campus near school. Scratch kitchen organic to Lebanese cuisine, a full meal including a drink for about $10. Student discounts at most places downtown."
College Sophomore,4,I didn't have any problems receiving financial aid for this upcoming school year however the funds I received just aren't enough to cover the tuition cost.
College Freshman,4,Would love to live in Raleigh one day
College Freshman,4,I like living on campus.  You can just get up and walk right out of the dorm into your classroom
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus.  If there is ever a problem we are notified by email or text to alert us to the problem.  All dorms are locked 24/7 and no one can come in with a key.
College Freshman,4,"Being a small school, peace has a limited number of majors but they're all good!"
College Freshman,4,I don't live off campus but I heard it's great
College Freshman,4,There's a lot of good places to go in downtown raleigh!
College Freshman,4,There's lot of places to eat
College Sophomore,4,"William Peace University offers off-campus living to second-year and above students.  These are apartments located at Wolf Creek which is about 7 miles from campus.  There is a shuttle bus running back and forth from town, school, and to the apartments throughout the school year.  Only downside is it could cost gas money if you use your own vehicle and you still have to purchase a meal plan even though you're living off campus.  The apartment rooms have their own bathroom and you get a kitchen.  You would room with three other people and they often let you choose who you live with."
College Sophomore,4,"The office of Public Safety is staffed with some of the best people on campus!  They make you feel safe and are available 24 hours to let you in somewhere if you've forgotten your keys.  Student Resident Assistants occupy  room on each hall and conduct regular hall programs, and the occasional room check.  This is to ensure all safety standards are being met in the dorms:  No loose wiring, possible threatening health conditions, and of course to make sure no violations to the university rules are taking place.  There is a very helpful comedy skit performed during Pacer Camp by the RA's informing students about the university rules and regulations."
College Sophomore,4,"I am currently enrolled in a work-study position over the summer and they provide housing compensation for my work.  It has been a great experience so far becoming familiar with the professional atmosphere on campus.  Career services is really awesome.  You can sign-on for the newsletter and get weekly updated work positions from locals.  For example, lots of baby sitting jobs pop up and there is a mall very close by so there are lots of job opportunities.  The school rating for jobs within one year of graduation is high as well."
College Sophomore,4,"Curriculum is awesome, the workload is sufficient, especially since I am an athlete. The study areas are adequate."
College Sophomore,4,My major is business and I think that the school has great status within the business community. My school has a reputation for placing students in the business world and it is the main reason that I chose to attend.
Sophomore,2,"It's too expensive and finding money to cover the cost, without loans is extremely hard. This school is dragging me in debt and it just isn't worth it but they make it hard to leave as well."
Senior,2,"The education is okay. I do not like that I must have an internship in order to graduate. In order to pay for the insane cost of the tuition I must have three jobs during my time at Peace. That causes me to have little time for my school work, let alone time for an internship. Also, I do not like that books are included in my tuition. Professors usually do not use the books they assign anyway. I believe I am receiving a decent education, but the cost is ridiculous. I do love that it is a small school so I am given more attention than I would at a bigger school."
Senior,2,"Giving two stars simply because of the administration. If I could give the people four or five stars, I would. There is a lot of diversity at WPU and I had some great experiences with the people and professors. However, the administration simply does not care. They are unorganized and simply do not seem to bother much with students concerns. 

For example, this year Residence Life tried to require all students under threat of disciplinary action to take a sexual assault survey without taking into consideration that this could cause mental distress to any student that has experienced sexual assault. The matter was eventually addressed but I don't feel the response was adequate considering the error in judgment they made. 

They were also very lax and unprofessional about a concern I had with another student. The only reason I stayed for 4 years was because of the familiar environment and friends I had made. I would strongly advise incoming freshman to spend your money elsewhere."
Freshman,2,William Peace was not the most exciting school. Only freshmen and RA's live on campus. The school is very small and you will know everybody who goes there. Raleigh is very boring and there is not much to do.
College Freshman,2,My school doesn't even have a football team!
College Freshman,2,They have rules but don't necessarily enforce them. They pick and choose who to punish or let off the hook.
College Freshman,2,The scholarships that was promised to me wasn't what I expected.
College Junior,2,"I hate that I don't receive enough financial aid to cover my expenses. I'm struggling to meet payments, and don't understand why I'm not getting more."
College Freshman,2,Getting money here is like finding a needle in a haystack.
College Sophomore,2,there isn't very much nightlife
College Sophomore,2,Off-campus housing is difficult to find and the school is not much help in this area.
College Freshman,2,"not much to do, fun things are limited and get boring after awhile"
College Freshman,2,"Two Places – There is a small sort of cafe that is pretty good. It has different kinds of coffee and pastries. Then there is the cafeteria...called the ""dining hall"" but it doesn't deserve that name...There are always french fries: overseasoned mushy pieces of patatoes and there's always salad, which is probably my favorite part...Well, they do have good desserts...most of the time (today the cookies were pretty burned)."
College Sophomore,2,"No Boys – Peace College is am all womens College but now we have men who attend our night school who are ""older"". We really dont see many men on campus unless its a professor or staff member and/or a students boyfriend"
College Junior,2,"Needs Work – Peace College has definite parking issues. The main parking lot fills up fast and there is not much additional parking that is available. The price of parking permits ($100) is also horrible considering the limited parking. Although, a car isn't necessary as the campus is so small and the city bus has a free line that runs right by campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,More Options – The food is ok at times it could be better. I think they should have more options daily and stay open later.
College Sophomore,1,Our fields are not on campus except for the softball field and tennis courts. We don't even have a football team
College Freshman,1,i only say that cause William peace university doesn't have a fraternity.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking permits are outrageous!! Plus, there are never any spots open."
College Freshman,1,"There is little diversity here, everybody tends to come from the same kind of settings and there are almost no international students."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking at Peace can be a bit crazy at times. We have one main parking lot and at least 4 smaller parking lots. It works out fine most of the time, but when there are big events on campus, like a play, security closes the main parking lot and makes the students and professors find another place to park. This is a real hassle because parking is limited in the smaller parking lots and parking on the streets in downtown Raleigh means risking a ticket. It is also a problem since we just started admitting men on campus. This means that there will not be enough parking for the professors, students, and occasional guests. Also, parking permits are so expensive at Peace."
College Freshman,1,"Police and Safety Services – Lol, if you feel protected by golf carts driven by out of shape guys you will feel very safe here...but not really."

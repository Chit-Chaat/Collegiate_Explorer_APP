Freshman,5,Online classes was actually very easy to navigate and I had more time to complete assignments. My professors were very lenient and helpful.

Online prior to pandemic there have been many great resources we have used to assist in learning."
Senior,5,The nursing department is wonderful! Every teacher truly cares about your education and they are so helpful. I know I picked the right school. They have so many opportunities and the sim lab is very helpful in learning.

Freshman,5,Love the city life and diversity Drexel offers. Drexel also prepares you with real work experience and career skills.
Niche User,5,"Great school for ambitious people. Courses are face-paced, and the co-op program is hugely beneficial. Great for building connections and opportunities while still in school. Has a serious squash team."
Junior,5,I have enjoyed the information I have learned here. The overall experience has been very pleasant. All my questions get answered and I am never left feeling unknown.
Niche User,5,"Drexel's campus is beautiful! It is the perfect hybrid between a university campus and a city feel. There is so much to do on and off-campus, especially lots of great food options. The location is great since it is in Downtown Philadelphia. The Nursing program caught my eye because it is ranked #1 in the state and has an NCLEX pass rate of 95%."
Alum,5,Great co-op experience and I landed a job with a company which gave me an internship my junior/senior year. I have met so many life long friends of which i have kept in touch with over the years. I was able to experience a big city and go to school at the same time which was my ultimate goal going into the process. I would highly recommend for anyone that is looking for a big challenge and is willing to put in the hard work and dedication towards achieving their goals.
Sophomore,5,"The environment, as it is a city school, is perfect for those looking for a college that is not considered in a ""bubble."" It is so close to the city of Philadelphia, while still retaining its college campus feel. Steps away from the University of Pennsylvania, which allows for Drexel and its campus to be in this ""University City."""
Junior,5,"I could not think of a better college to pursue my Criminology and Justice studies degree. Being in the middle of the city, this university has a vast network of resources that have made my learning experience be inside and outside of the classroom, with teachers and or professionals in the field. The teachers actu"
Alum,5,Drexel providing both a challenging and rewarding education for me.  I am so very happy I attended their accelerated nursing program.
Niche User,5,I like that Drexel University offers programs to immerse their students in the fields they are pursuing.
Sophomore,5,I love the opportunities the coop program gives me as a student. I get months of hands-on experience that other students in other universities do not get.
Niche User,5,I visited Drexel University once. The students were very welcoming. The classes and its professors were very interesting. I liked the campus.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the campus as well as the program as a whole. Part of the reason that I chose Drexel was because of their Co-Op program, which helped me to connect with potential employers in the future."
Sophomore,5,Drexel is an oustanding college in Philadelphia area. I love the environment at Drexel. Drexel Administration Office is more than welcomed to have you as their transferred student.
Sophomore,5,I have learned more in the past year than I have learned in four years of high school. Not only do they have a good education system Drexel teaches us real world skills.
Niche User,5,"I was there for an open house, and the university was in the center of a beautiful city. There are many opportunities to excel in your major with all the different internships and co-ops they offer. The students care about each other, so different religions or race would not have to be afraid that they would be discriminated. The different level sports they offer can be exciting to individuals who love to play, and they also offer yoga classes to the ones that are less active, but would still like to get in a workout."
Junior,5,Drexel is a community full of driven and ambitious individuals. There is a lot to learn and motivation for success all around. This university emphasizes professional development through their cooperative learning program and many have their futures built on it.
Freshman,5,Drexel University feels like home. I look forward to coming to school every day because of the peaceful atmosphere of the campus. I would recommend any STEM major to apply to Drexel.
Niche User,5,"Great campus, great atmosphere, great people. Really good co-op program. Right in the city of Philly, where I want to be. They also have a great business program."
Sophomore,5,"The transition into Drexel is truly what you make of it. The community does an incredible job of easing students into the environment, while allowing the room to discover where you're most comfortable. Wherever you go, if you have a question, you're likely to get a helpful answer whether it's from your RA, the front desk of your Residence Hall, or even upperclassmen. Everyone around you generally has a vast knowledge of the campus. It's true, the curriculum does move rather quickly - seeing as each term is 10 weeks; however, your Academic Advisor is such an important, encouraging, and helpful resource to figuring out your next steps and where you stand."
Junior,5,"As a pre-junior at Drexel University, I have been extremely satisfied with my experience thus far. Drexel offers a wide array of majors and student organizations, there is a place for everyone. The co-op program is incomparable, and I would have never gotten the opportunities I have now without Drexel's assistance. My only complaint is that LeBow should monitor the quality of professors more. Overall, Drexel is a great school for forward-thinking students."
Sophomore,5,"Drexel is perfect. I am not being the slightest bit dramatic. I met the most amazing friends, my professors care so much about my success, and the campus is stunning. I have excelled academically and socially, and I would not change my decision for the world."
Graduate Student,5,I like the Co-op programs of Drexel University. It give the student the opportunity to apply the real life experience as the same time while they are in school. Majority of professor at Drexel University are very knowledgeable. They have both combination of working and classroom experiences. It was such a enjoyable in every single class that I had. I have learned so much. I also loved the design of each of the school at Drexel. It was such an interesting structure and artists. each building you walk by was different from the inside to outside.
Freshman,5,The ability to have a discussion about majors and minors. I was unable to get an answer and was referred to another person after waiting two weeks for a response.
Freshman,5,Close to home.safe place and great place to learn. Has a great program for what i am wanting to do for the rest of my life. Went there and the people were very helpful and i lerned alot at the meeting with them. Can not what to start college and learn more.
Freshman,5,"I'm a freshman, but the application process was great. My admissions counselor always got back to be very quickly, and communicated with me in a concise manor."
Freshman,5,drexel is a really great school with a lot to offer for people of all different backgrounds. very competitive environment which helps you achieve all your goals. 5/7 gg
Freshman,5,"Everyone is very friendly. I feel that I am a part of a family. People, there is supportive.  I think that Drexel is a great university and a good community. I had a good experience with this university."
Freshman,5,"I love it here! The location is amazing and I love Philadelphia! My program is very intense (architecture), but I love every aspect of it. I have made very good friends and am just excited for the future!"
Niche User,5,"Drexel University was like a breath of fresh air. The environment is very friendly, and the curriculum seems stimulating but achievable at the same time. It is a good choice for students who want to challenge themselves to do better and become a well-rounded student."
Junior,5,"I love going to Drexel, because I think the hands-on academic programs in combination with the co-op experiences make for a really great learning experience. I have a year until graduation but I have already gained so much valuable experience and made so many connections that will last a lifetime!"
Niche User,5,I visited Drexel University throughout spring break and was amazed of the campus and life in Philadelphia. Not only that but the program was extraordinary since it was hands on project based work that employs students. The school itself is a return on investment. I love it.
Freshman,5,"Drexel University was my first choice college because of their co-op program, which allowed students the opportunity to work alongside professionals of a career their interested in. Before really putting everything into one career, I think it is definitely beneficial for students to experience what's the work consists of. Professors and staff work together to make your time at Drexel worth it. I say use the resources provided to start off your career."
Niche User,5,Drexel University is a college known for its co-op opportunities. It is located in University City with other highly competitive colleges. It is very easy to transport to and from my house.
Freshman,5,Going to Drexel from my high school was a big change. The environment is much more diverse. I am Caucasian but when I walk around my campus at times I feel like the minority... which is great! I wanted to be surrounded by diversity. I have met some of the most genuine and compassionate friends... there isn't one bad thing I could say about them. What I love about college is how I have no drama with my friends. We are all their with the same mindset of finding nice people to have depend on and have a good time with. Another thing I love is how helpful my friends and peers are. I am always going to study group sessions. The education at Drexel is incredible. I have had some amazing professors that challenge you and really make you think outside the box. The professors really do try to make the education engaging and something that you would enjoy. Drexel also does a great job in keeping the area safe for the students.
Freshman,5,"Drexel University is a very nice college. Located in the city, there is public transportation anywhere and Chinatown is a short walk away. The campus is quite large, with University of Pennsylvania nearby. The classes are manageable and the difficulty mostly depends on time management. They offer a 10-week quarter system, which is fast, but it is worthwhile."
Niche User,5,"I attended a campus tour last year and loved it! The city of Philadelphia is such a great location to pair with a college. There are so many restaurants, coffee shops, and food trucks at every corner! Everything is in walking distance making it convenient for the college student. 
The schools are amazing too! The world's largest bio wall in held at Drexel's College of Arts and Science. 
A great school to attend for college!"
Alum,5,"I did both undergrad and grad at Drexel and I loved it! Their philosophy of experiential learning is what sets the school apart. I learn better through hands-on experience and I received plenty at Drexel. The campus has seen a lot of improvements over the past decade. Drexel's fast pace is not for everyone, but it's worth it for those willing to work hard.."
Graduate Student,5,"Great location in the center of Philadelphia with easy access to local restaurants, museums, and historical landmarks. Professors are excellent and complement to well-developed program curriculum. Although the campus is old, it still provides the necessary services to complete the program successfully."
Freshman,4,"Drexel University is an amazing college where students can truly gain a strong educational background in their major of interest, while also enjoying their pre-adult years."
Junior,4,"Fast paced program, some unforgiving professors, but allows so much opportunity to graduate with a leg up on peers freshly out of college."
Junior,4,"Being online due to covid, but also in general taking online classes was easy through Drexel. Professors communicate what they would like and the school has the technology to make it efficient."
Alum,4,"I really liked the focus on professional development that Drexel's co-op internship program provided. I also enjoyed the city experience and accessibility that the campus's location provided. Some of the things that I was not satisfied with are the lack of important amenities like ample study space, green space, and eateries around campus. Overall, I had a nice experience at Drexel."
Alum,4,"I rarely took online classes but when I did, I enjoyed them. I could learn at my own pace and the instructors were always very interactive."
Niche User,4,"loved the campus when I visited, everyone was friendly. had lots of good restaurants in the area which is good because you'll never run out of options. I don't attend this university but when i went on a campus tour i loved it."
Sophomore,4,The school is amazing. Small campus but the incoming class from each major becomes very well acquainted and forms bonds. Drexel has become a new home for me after my freshman year.
Sophomore,4,Online classes have been implemented very efficiently and the university has been transparent the whole process. No bad experiences so far.
Sophomore,4,"A fantastic technical and science school with a large focus on providing a fantastic education. That being said their administration and financial aid office are a mess. Drexel was one of the very last colleges to close during the start of the Pandemic, pussyfooting around it till the last second and forcing both teachers and students to switch to online less then a week before finals."
Freshman,4,"I did not take any online courses yet, but I have completed online modules with the University, and the program is relatively easy to use."
Junior,4,"The actual online learning at Drexel was, in my opinion, just average, but the professors made the experience great. They were very kind, understanding, and accommodating."
Junior,4,"Great School, Professors are really sincere in trying to help students be successful.  Advising is very efficient and helpful.  I really can't complain about the school. Many of the schools resources are readily available around the clock."
Junior,4,"During this time with Covid and the school being online only, my experience has been very good.  I am hoping that while we continue to be online only that the education provided continues to be top notch."
Sophomore,4,"The economics department is average there are some great professors and some alright ones. Textbooks are expensive and they rip you off if you are paying full tuition. However, if you get a decent scholarship it's a great school. Definitely right below Ivy status in terms of the rigor of the education if that is what you are looking for. Co-op is nice too."
Sophomore,4,"I've only been here for one year so far and I really enjoy the school. I think that  the curriculum is great, the community here is enjoyable, and I am looking forward to the coop experience this university offers. The only thing I don't like is the price."
Alum,4,"Drexel is centrally located to Philadelphia’s downtown area and transportation centers. The rigorous curriculum helps push you to achieve your best potential. That said, it requires a lot of self discipline"
Junior,4,"My online learning experience as pretty great. Even though I wasn't able to meet other students face to face, I was still able to communicate and make friends. The online courses however, can be a bit challenging since there is less interaction between student and professor. Sometimes it can be to stay focus in the comfort of one's own home because there are too many personal things that can get you distracted such as T.V and video games."
Junior,4,"Drexel University is an amazing school. Throughout your experience at Drexel, they will provide you with work experience that you can use later in your future. 

However, Drexel is a bit expensive and I hope it gets changed a little to better other students' financial needs."
Junior,4,"Very expensive, but great facilities, staff, activities, and the city dyaminc is also a plus. It can be worthwhile if you involve yourself into the social sphere and enjoy what the city has to offer."
Junior,4,"My experience at Drexel as I begin my Junior year, seems to have been worthwhile in retrospect. I gained a lot of friends, opportunities, got to experience a lot of new activities, and most importantly, got to take classes that I not only liked but that made sure to leave an impact on me."
Alum,4,"I only took 1 quarter of online classes and it was good. Drexel offered a pass/fail alternative to traditional grading which I immediately took advantage of as it was my final quarter at the school. My professors offered several different, efficient ways of contacting them, and all of them were sympathetic to COVID-19 taking a wrecking ball to everyone's mental health."
Alum,4,"I had very limited online classes, but the few that I did take were very well organized and easy to follow."
Niche User,4,I loved the programs available in my major. The design building is amazing. Philadelphia is a vibrant city and I feel I will like it at Drexel.
Freshman,4,"Drexel University offer great benefits such as their Co-op Program and the fact that they're located in the city so there is always something to do. However, the professors at Drexel University is a hit or miss most of the time. If you get a bad professor that will really hinder your grade and it makes you unmotivated to go to class. Also Drexel is very expensive when it comes to tuition."
Freshman,4,"Due to the COVID-19, classes had t be conducted online. For some of the classes, it was hard to get in contact with some of the professors, but overall, most of the professors responded fairly quickly."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I like this school. I felt like there is a mix of good and bad teachers in this school. I liked the community of Drexel. People are nice and we can relate to each other well, and if someone needed help, we were quick to give a helping hand. I would really wish that we wouldn't get shafted as much in this school."
Junior,4,"I took one class online in the Spring term, and the class was conducted entirely on Zoom with exams being assigned on the Blackboard Learn platform."
Junior,4,"Challenging coursework and timeframes for terms. Co-op system is brilliant, and career counseling is really helpful."
Sophomore,4,"I only took online classes with Drexel during the COVID pandemic, and so my opinion on them may not be the most objective. I do not like online classes as a general rule, but I definitely felt as if my professors worked hard to make concepts and projects accessible for the online format."
Graduate Student,4,I love the flexibility Drexel has with their programs and tracks. It ends up being very affordable and still allows me to work full time during most of my program.
Freshman,4,"Drexel is a good school, however we have 10-week terms so it’s a fast paced environment. The co-op program is amazing, giving students real life work experience. Most professors want to help you succeed, but there are some that could care less about students."
Freshman,4,Drexel is a great school with lots of research opportunities. The co-op program is definitely the best part of the school and is truly beneficial in securing a job after college.
Sophomore,4,"Choosing Drexel was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Of course, there are things that could always be better but I love it regardless. It is a place I am happy to call home."
Sophomore,4,"Drexel is a place where it's easy to find your people. You won't feel lost for long here because there is something for everyone. Sometimes you'll feel the Drexel shaft, but most of the time you'll be glad you chose Drexel."
Niche User,4,"From the Drexel college tour, I was fascinated by the life that the student were living and that they themselves showed interest toward the campus. I was really impress with the lectures that professors were giving out and was extremely into the hands on activities that these students were working on. Something that stand out the most to me was that everyone there was so passionate towards their major or clubs. Something that also caught my attention was the something called co-op, where you can apply for a job during the summer or fall. This was amazing, where you can learn and get paid at the same time which is useful in paying student debt.This made me want to attend to this college and I feel as though that I belong there."
Senior,4,I think the co-op program was the best part of attending Drexel.  I highly recommend this hands-on learning approach.
Sophomore,4,"Food truck food is great at Drexel. I also love that Drexel is so close to center city, literally just a subway ride away so there is always something to do on the weekend."
Senior,4,"I loved my time at Drexel. Classes are challenging and go quickly, but if you stay on top of their stuff you can succeed."
Sophomore,4,The staff here really cares about their student success. Many of my professors are personable and offer many outside sources to help with their coursework. It is very diverse with many cool things to do around/near campus.
Sophomore,4,"I love Drexel. The location is amazing and the opportunities are incredible. All of my professors actually work in the field the teach which is really good. The professors, for the most part, also go out of their way to support students and make sure they understand the subject and succeed in it. The one downside is the cost and that’s really with the financials in general."
Sophomore,4,Drexel online is very easy to attend. Everything is at tour finger tips. Professors make sure classes are easy to navigate.  I just wish it was more on your time. Instead you have certain days you have to post. I also wish they cared more about the working students.
Freshman,4,"The professors are nice for the most part. The exceptions are when you are dealing with classes where there's no clear purpose like CI101. In those cases, the classes seem to be a bit boring as nobody knows what they are moving towards. In addition, I don't like some of the rules drexel has for its students as it tends to be a bit money hungry. For example, Drexel has a mandatory mail of the university that you need to use. However, here, there's multifactor authentification which can't be disabled and if you don't have a phone, you need to pay 25 dollars each time to login. 
However, overall, I'm glad I went to drexel because I found nice friends in my dormitory through registering to a thing called a learning community where your wing will have the people of the same major. This leads directly to being able to help eachother, laugh about the same difficulties and overall have a nice time."
Junior,4,"I like the small campus in a great area (University City). Being so close to center city is one of the best parts about Drexel, along with the Co-op program."
Freshman,4,"Despite Philadelphia's crime reputation, Drexel is actually in a very safe area. Never have I felt in danger and I am able walk around worry free. 
It is an extremely diverse university with some great people. The most attractive thing about Drexel is its Co-Op program. For those thinking about applying, be sure you understand how Co-Op works and its schedules. My experience at Drexel has been enjoyable and being in Philadelphia is fantastic."
Niche User,4,My Drexel visit was absolutely wonderful! Talking to everyday students before my tour was really a great idea and helped me relax and really get a feel for the collage.
Freshman,4,"Drexel offers many opportunities to anyone ambitious and goal-oriented. I know I know this school for its Co-op program, standing out to be one of the top ten co-op schools in the United States. This school endorses a fast curriculum, then this is the school for you. These classes go by fast, so it is important to attend ordinary. If there is a class you are failing, there is an option to withdraw from it, and it will not go against your grade point average (GPA). One thing Drexel should change is letting upcoming freshmen choose their fall semester schedule. It may seem easy at first, but avoiding responsibilities includes attending class, hanging out, and not studying will hinder performance. If you miss two weeks in a semester, you will most likely fail the class."
Alum,4,"Likes: 
- Excellent co-op program
- Located in the heart of philadelphia
- Fellow classmates

Dislikes: 
- high cost of tuition
- lack of recognition outside of east coast
- engineering resources were not being allocated properly
- certain buildings needed renovations
- quality of education diminishing"
Niche User,4,"I am not a current student. However, I have visited Drexel's campus and classrooms a few times while searching  for a college for my freshman year.  The students seem warm and the campus looks safe, is convenient to transportation, center city, and plenty of places to eat."
Sophomore,4,"I am a current Sophomore here at Drexel University. This University has given me an excellent education inside the classroom, thus far. Being a future-focused school, Drexel has also provided many opportunities to network with employers and discover what career path fits me best. The environment at Drexel is very fast pace, which has allowed me to grow as an individual. This environment has forced me to become proactive, organized and good with time management. Financially speaking, Drexel is a very costly school. Living in the city and paying for a private education is very expensive. Unfortunately, Drexel has not been supportive in granting scholarship money or financial aid. However, overall, Drexel provides an excellent education."
Junior,4,"I like the atmosphere, all the people I have met there are very kind and easy  to talk to. I feel like I can be myself since I have the tendency to be shy, Drexel is very welcoming and friendly."
Junior,4,"The CO-OP program is great, it allows you to be able to apply the theoretical knowledge gained in class in the practical work environment. It is nice to be in a city that is not so overwhelming like New York can be. You have all the perk of being in a city but also have the option of experiencing places that is typically not the city. The whole city of Philadelphia is rich in history and culture. There is so much to see, and the great thing about Philadelphia is that everything is a walk able distance. Being so close to the city becomes a plus when school workload starts to pile up. Drexel has been a learning experience for me, not education wise only but has also taught me how to be an adult. It has taught me important life skills that I will forever need."
Freshman,4,The campus life isn't too bad. The food is pretty bad though. There are only two options on campus to use the meal swipes on the required meal plan for freshmen.
Sophomore,4,"College advisors aren't always very helpful here, I spent so much time floating between majors because the roles the academic advisors play at college often is very laid back. The advisors can override, give you credit and give you a brief overview on the major you are interested in but some of them that I have encountered here don't go out of their way to make sure you don't receive a w or to calmly respond to you when you have reasonable questions without frustration."
Freshman,4,"My favorite thing about Drexel University is all the unique events they have for everyone to attend. Another thing I like about them is that there is a campus police officer at just about every corner. Even though there’s much more I could go on about, the last thing I could say I appreciate at Drexel is that it is very diverse. The staff and students that attend my school are from all different places, religions, and cultures. The only thing I can complain about my school is that they don’t offer a lot in their dining plans. There are only two places on campus that accept meal swipes and a few places accept dining dollars. Otherwise, you have to use your own money or dragon dollars and there are too many paces around."
Junior,4,"I love the city of Philadelphia, where Drexel is. I believe the community is vibrant and unique. I love my program and the professors, however, I believe Drexel as a whole struggles with money allocation. We are building new honors lounges when we have dorms that need overhead lights, or just light in general. Our tuition has raised every year when we have an approximately $70,000 tuition ticket price and we are making new squash courts. I just want to see Drexel think about students affording  the school, or there will be no students left."
Sophomore,4,"Drexel University have been a new and exciting experience. I learned a lot from my peers and professors in such a dynamic and close knitted learning environment. Being enrolled in a quarter system has taught me how to properly manage time, to stay on top of heavy workloads, and connect with many different people within the college community. My classes have been extremely hands on and interactive allowing for a more efficient learning opportunity."
Sophomore,4,"I love it at Drexel University! It is my best fit school. However, I would like to see more cultural diversity at Drexel."
Graduate Student,4,"My professors were amazing, down to Earth, genuine, and always there. The resources the university has are endless, and can only work if you take advantage of them."
Senior,4,"I absolutely love the education I am receiving at Drexel University. With their co-op experience, I am basically graduating with a full-time job and real-world experience. However, the administration is not always the friendliest and most accommodating."
Senior,4,Professors care about their students and their well being. Only negative is that Drexel needs to add more evening classes for students who are working during the day but don’t want online classes.
Alum,2,"I graduated from Drexel in 2018 from the Westphal School of Media Arts & Design, top 10 ranked fashion program in the country. My major was Design & Merchandising, with a minor in marketing. Overall, I rate my experience a 5 on a scale of 1-10. The program and school as a whole lacked diversity, in students and teachers, there were very few resources for minority students, and I felt very out of place most of the time. The actual courses were helpful, however, and I loved the Co-Op system. My major only offered the 4 year 1 Co-Op option however so I was not able to have as many internships as other students. Also, the companies in our system for fashion majors was very limited or did not pay. Coming from a lower income family, I could not afford to take an unpaid internship, so I decided to do my co-op at a company where I focused in marketing. One of the biggest downfalls at Drexel was their career services. They barely helped me when I graduated and was struggling to find a job."
Sophomore,2,"Drexel University is best known for its Co-Op program, which is why so many students are willing to pay their outrageous tuition. However when you are paying for tuition, you are not only paying for the school, but it's location. Honestly I love Philadelphia, but Drexel not as much. Drexel is money hungry and does its best to charge you for anything it can and exploit you in the best possible way. Drexel does offer many opportunities and sets you up for a great future as you are able to make connections, but I am only a Sophomore, and based on my Freshman experience I don't have many positive things to say. My professors really didn't care all that much, and were not as responsive to questions and inquiries as they should have been. However, I did have really great TA's. Some of the administration is responding very inappropriately to current events, knowingly offending their students, making me question the leadership within our school. If I didn't love Philly I wouldn't be at Drexel"
Sophomore,2,"It was miserable. I did not learn anything while learning in online school. Mathematical concepts were especially difficult to pick up. Yet, students from other schools seemed to have it worse off than I did. Online school was an adjustment and it is understandable that they flunked it. However, the quality of education was not acceptable."
Junior,2,"Though I believe Drexel is a great school academics-wise, the handling of the money by the school is horrid. The cost of tuition is positively outrageous and the co-op advisors that they supply to the students that are a part of the co-op program are grossly incapable (from my experience)."
Sophomore,2,"I cannot recommend any student comes to Drexel. The tuition is overpriced, the professors are subpar, the administration is unresponsive. There are many colleges that are similar in ranking to Drexel but do a much better job at ""being a college"" Drexel is a path to a career but many will hate every step of that path."
Freshman,2,"Absolute bullshit professors. University is known to shaft its students.
Follows quarter system (10-week term) and midterms run from week 3 to 9.. absolute disaster."
Sophomore,2,Drexel University relies on its co-op program to make up deficits in its traditional classroom-based education. This is not an effective method because co-op experiences vary wildly in their value.
Junior,2,"The only thing I don’t like about Drexel is that you are constantly under an intense amount of pressure and stress due to the quarter system. The quarter system means you have class all year round: fall quarter, winter quarter, spring, and summer. No breaks unless you opt to take your own or you are on co-op."
Junior,2,"The advising for the school is very disorganized. I have been through numerous transfers for my coop advisor and my academic adviser. The food is not worth the price and the food staff are mean. The housing tricks you into signing early while also losing checks, power, water, and HVAC."
Niche User,2,"They only great things I can say about Drexel is that it is in Philadelphia and I have met some great friends while there. Unless you have a huge scholarship, what you're learning is not worth the money EVEN if they offer COOP. Like I saw say another reviewer say, you can easily get a summer job between semesters and gain just as much experience. Most of the coops offered to Drexel students aren't exclusively for them. I ended up transferring my sophomore year after realizing I could get a better education for a much lower price. Depending on the program you want to do, Drexel will not be the place you want to be."
Junior,2,"I came to Drexel solely for the Co-op program they provide. So far, I have had two co-ops that both undermine my ability to excel in my field of interest. I am sure it is a better situation for other students, but I feel completely ripped off by Drexel University. I am proud and honored to have been excepted into such a great school, but I guess I had different expectations for what my college experience would be like."
Graduate Student,2,I am going to finish my graduate degree online in the next year.  I have not been very impressed with the quality of education nor instructors.  I also feel that it has been hard to get through to advisors and have had little guidance.  The price per credit is also expensive.
College Senior,2,Some buildings are old and all are expensive.
College Sophomore,2,I don't really pay attention to the athletics at my school. I am a member of the dance ensemble and the studios and theater we use are great and the teachers are amazing. The gym is very nice and they provide free group classes and gym membership to all Drexel students. I always take advantage of the group classes because they're a great way to work out and there's a big variety.
College Freshman,2,"Drexel praises it's public safety, but they have no part on campus besides swiping ID cards at the front desks of residence halls. Drexel police is great though. They respond almost immediately. There are also emergency stations at almost every corner and building."
College Freshman,2,"Social atmosphere is good. The diversity helps with this. It doesn't matter who you are, you'll find a group within the first month. RAs don't do anything worthwhile and bug you to go to events that they run because they want attention from their bosses. The buildings themselves are pathetic. Most of them are in shambles. Hot water doesn't work for a couple of days each month. You don't get a say in temperatures, even if you have a heater/air conditioner, its either hot or cold. The only dorm with room to live in are suite-style, which is great if thats the dorm life you want. Unsurprisingly, the suite-style dorms always smell like weed."
College Freshman,2,"Drexel is diverse and expensive, but if you want a unique college experience, look somewhere else. ""Drexel is difference"" is plastered everywhere and thats the message the university pushes on new undergrads. I'll tell you what though: having reached the end of my first year, Drexel is built up of ambitious and greedy administrators who know how to manipulate students. 

While looking at Drexel as an education option, I recognized the challenge presented to me by the university. 11 week (including exam week) terms on a quarter schedule, with the average credits per term hovering around 18. I wanted a challenge and Drexel showed me they had it. What they don't tell you is that in the majority of these classes, there is no learning until the last 3 weeks. The first 7 being all busy work to ""prepare you"" for the exam/final project/paper. If you are absolutely sure that you want a degree from Drexel in whatever field, then by all means spend $70k a year for it. But if you have even a but of hesitation, don't bother. You won't have an actual class that is worthy of college until halfway through your second year, and by then you will already be in debt for the next 15-20 years. If you figure out that you don't want to pursue the major anymore, you can switch majors and start all over and go deeper into debt, or you can transfer somewhere else and start over.

Let's talk Civic Engagement. Drexel and UPenn have been effectively building up West Philadelphia for a decade now under the banner that they want to help the impoverished and the low quality of life. What they don't tell you is that all they are doing is making it impossible for those West Philadelphians to live. Drexel buys up a block in Powelton, tears down what was there (displacing anyone who lived there), then builds small and pretty-looking more expensive housing for it's students (low cost compared to the mandatory on-campus residence fess, not to the local housing). I'm out of space, but don't go to Drexel."
College Freshman,2,"The rooms are small, and I personally was forced into a triple. The common spaces are more often than not dirty, the elevators always break down, there's roaches all over the place, I could go on forever."
College Freshman,2,Most of the houses are pretty obnoxious and snobby towards the non-greek students.
College Freshman,2,"Cockroaches, occasional water shutoffs in the morning, gross carpeting, horrible lighting, and over priced. The most expensive housing options are campus housing. The cheapest option is greek housing, but then you need to pay dues as well. The campus-affiliated are cheaper for the least expensive units, but they are not connected to the financial aid plans."
College Freshman,2,The dorms were obscenely overpriced. It is ridiculous that the most expensive housing option is forced upon the students for their first year. The rooms are cramped and the facilities are very poorly maintained.
College Sophomore,2,"The general area around the school seems fine.  However, you will be notified of robberies at gunpoint around campus on a bi-monthly basis."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the people are lethargic, shallow, or just plain unintelligent.  Many of the professors are knowledgeable, but all too often you'll be taught by a recent graduate who has never worked in the industry.

In addition, school spirit is next to non-existent.  The campus is plain ugly -- absolutely no vegetation or green.  I wouldn't recommend it."
College Freshman,2,"Very few people are athletes at Drexel. The only ""good ""team is Drexel's girls basketball.  All other sports for the varsity level are quite subpar. Drexel does not even have a football team. As for school spirit, Drexel is pretty Avid to show up and cheer at basketball games.  A decent amount of people do intramural sports, but it is not an overwhelming population like at many schools"
College Student,2,"Since it is mainly a STEM school, Drexel isn't too big on sports."
College Freshman,2,I am just a freshmen.
College Freshman,2,Heard about a bunch of hazing going on but I'm not planning on joining so I don't care.
College Freshman,2,"When I visited, I saw a different Drexel than what it is now. If you are not a Business, Engineering, or Computer Science Major, your major is treated terribly. The food on campus is awful, and Drexel Dining staff exemplify the bad cafeteria lunch person who could actually make you feel terrible. The students are average, having kind of working hard in high school."
College Student,2,"I'm currently a freshman and there are many times where I am terrified to leave my room in fear that a cockroach or mouse will be roaming the hallways, bathrooms, or kitchen. Also the doors are impossible to lock, the elevators have been completely vandalized as well as the stairwell, the electricity has gone out multiple times, and package hours are at very inconvenient times."
College Student,2,"Drexel parties pretty much suck. If you're actually looking for a good party, try the sport houses at UPenn or the houses over at Temple. Definitely much better!"
College Junior,2,No longer take a food plan.  I cook my own.
College Senior,2,"There were times where I had to do the math for them because they forgot to subtract my scholarship from the tuition. However, they were helpful when I needed more help with getting aid or when I was struggling with classes."
College Freshman,2,"Hope you like ""pizza"". Drexel pizza tastes like it was defrosted then sat out for a few hours. There's Domino's, if you're into that sort of food like product."
College Freshman,2,"Even as a student who lives in one dorm, visiting another is a hassle at best, a barrier at worst. Freshman dorm guests can't leave without signing in and out with ID. Upperclassmen campus housing is outrageously strict requiring state ID even for Drexel Students. Can ruin a night. Desk monitors are rude and I've never seen one smile."
College Freshman,2,There's not much around and its fairly expensive.
College Freshman,2,It has been an ongoing process that never seems to end and keeps being dragged on.
College Freshman,2,Not much goes on during the weekends.
College Freshman,2,All the eating places under our meal plan are bad and all the places that are somewhat good need to be paid for out of pocket.
College Freshman,2,"Getting financial aid is a huge headache. It's an ongoing, confusing process."
College Freshman,2,"It's not that *everything* tastes bad but the value is terrible. You're forced to buy monopoly money that can only be spent at store that are marked up. A 5oz jar of nutella costs $10 for goodness sake! However, after your first year you don't have to buy the meal plan and eat quite well for less than half the cost :) There are really great grocery stores and restaurants in walking distance so it gets much better after your first year!"
College Student,2,"Drexel gives a lot of endowment grants which is nice, but the financial aid office is very unhelpful, it takes forever for documents to be received/reviewed, and you have to reapply for aid every year."
College Student,2,"There is a new alcohol policy this year, so the frat parties are basically nonexistent unless you are a part of the frat or a sorority. A lot of the frats will have parties at satellite campuses."
College Student,2,The Hans is terrible The food options are pretty much the same throughout the week and after the first couple days of school I found myself not even using the meal plan. It was a waste of money. The food is mediocre at best. Luckily the food trucks on campus are decent and there is a grocery store about a mile away.
College Freshman,2,"Very poor school spirit as we don't happen to have a football or baseball team, and our basketball team is nothing special."
College Senior,2,"The library here sucks.

There's a lot of concrete everywhere and Drexel's really good at performing construction on everything, every single year, even if it's recently been erected.  I'm not quite sure what look they're going for, aside from the large grey building look?

The athletic center is amazing.  I'd say it's the best part about the school.

The chemical engineering labs are pretty antiquated.  The chemistry labs are pretty antiquated as well.

The concerts they have here for Spring Jam and etc are great.

There aren't many campus activities and the events and traditions are...okay.  I mean it would help a lot if they had more popular varsity sports."
College Sophomore,2,"The off-campus housing can get a little sketchy. The closer you get to campus the more expensive it is but, it's worth the safety and convenience. Drexel offers ""affiliated housing"" which is essentially grown up dorms that are fashioned more like apartments."
College Sophomore,2,"Too many guys. As an engineer it's a struggle to get to know girls but, it's all major dependent. Nursing majors complain that it's only girls as do the COMAD kids."
Recent Alumnus,2,The proximity is good but the quality of the rooms aren't great.
Recent Alumnus,2,The administration on the Center City campus for Health professionals is very unorganized.
Recent Alumnus,2,I am on the center city campus. The library is very small. The building is old and the furniture in the library is old and dirty.
College Freshman,2,"The housing quality is extremely poor, there isn't much of a ""community"" aspect to the buildings. You get way less than what you pay for."
College Student,2,"Unless you want to pay $1000 a month for a decent place, you're a getting a rundown apartment or a converted victorian"
College Student,2,It's more expensive than on-campus housing and definitely not worth the value
College Junior,2,They don't seem to help much it is very difficult to pay for such an expensive school.
College Sophomore,2,"Drexel, in my opinion, really is not a party school. Most students are in the library. We are close to the University of Penn which is said to be one of the top party schools, so maybe some students go to those parties. I don't know."
College Sophomore,2,"Yeah, the biggest sport for Drexel is basketball and we are not even that great at it. There is a decent amount of school spirit, but it is nothing like other colleges. Joining intramurals is not easy unless you have a group of people to make a team of your own. On the other hand, the fitness/rec center is brand new and really nice."
College Student,2,No party scene besides powelton
College Freshman,2,"The five closest restaurants to campus all have the same foods. Pizza, and wings. Variety is terrible, on and off campus."
College Junior,2,There should be more late night and 24 hour options. I also wished they did not have as many chain restaurants as they do and try to incorporate more local restaurants and organic options.
College Sophomore,2,"Meal plans are forced onto you as a Freshman, but most get out since it's not really worth it."
Niche User,1,"I never studied online at this school, but some of my peers who have found it really frustrating. We're film majors so learning online without practical learning or access to equipment rentals is really frustrating when one of Drexel's biggest selling points for their film program is the hands-on aspect."
Sophomore,1,"My online experience with Drexel was less than satisfactory. Although I had maybe one or two classes with great TA's and professors, the rest of my classes were pretty awful. There were times when my teachers wouldn't show up for class, and my emails would go unanswered. I was not getting nearly as much attention or support Drexel claimed would be given. For the amount of money that I'm paying in tuition, I expected way more than I was given. Any complaints that I brought up, to not only my teachers, but administration, were dismissed. It's disgusting, that they care more about money than they do their students. If they care about money that bad, I at least expect to get what I'm paying for."
Junior,1,"Though the class itself was not a bad one, the problem I have is for students who do not have access to secure and fast internet. My computer has an issue with its internal antenna and because of that a lot of the time when I'm in class I get disconnected and miss important points during lecture."
Sophomore,1,"I signed up on this website just to give you a warning that I wished I received: Turn away. Yes we have fancy gadgets. Yes we have nice facilities. But what happens when a national pandemic makes the students face the high tuition as well as tackling online classes without any of said facilities? Any of said tech? They turn a blind eye to you. You are just another number. The professors are just as frustrated as the students - they feel for us, they talk ill about the institution as a whole. At this point, save your money, because it does NOT deserve to go into the pockets of this school. Do not make the mistake of committing to a businesses that which cannot commit to you in the face of a crisis, when they try to advertise family and community to you. They do NOT care. Stay away. ESPECIALLY if you are an art major."
Niche User,1,"Drexel runs like a business and don’t care about their prospective students. As a transfer, they just want your money. They don’t help whatsoever. The administration act like they’re annoyed when you ask them questions when it’s their job. This school is not worth it to me. I rather attend a school that actually cares about its students. Co op is overrated. You can get a summer internship and have it put on your resume. Drexel’s name is not as big as it thinks."
Niche User,1,"I'm being fully truthful when I say that attending this school was the WORST decision of my life.  Not one aspect of this university is worth the ungodly cost that they charge for tuition.  I will give it credit, the classes (I was in nursing) are challenging, and the rigor of 10-week quarters teaches you time management with your schoolwork real quick.  But overall, I would not recommend this school to anybody.  Upper management has no clue what they are doing, and even trying to file the paperwork to formally leave the university, should you transfer out, is a nightmare.  If you get some sort of mega scholarship to attend here, by all means come if you want to.  But if you'll accrue any major student loan debt from attending, please do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your education.  They try to sell you the name, but I promise you that other, much cheaper schools can give you just as good of an education."
Works Here,1,Campus is out dated. School of Nursing is even more out dated. I receive crime alerts 2 to 3 times a day. They only care about their status therefore accepting only elite students.
Niche User,1,The dorms suck! There's no light in many of the rooms besides the one from the desk. Many doors dont lock from the outside and some keys don't work. Food on campus isn't much better they give out expired milk. Overall I'm far from impressed.
Alum,1,"I can't put into words the relief and gratitude I felt when I was able to transfer out of this horrible, nasty institution. Never, ever go to this ""university"". They are money-hungry, greedy, and shady. They don't care about the quality of education, only about getting prospective students. They have one of the highest transfer rates in the country for a reason. It's ugly, the education never meets anyone's expectations. The administration is rude and disorganized. They are only concerned with your money being put in their bank account. Even years after I transferred, their administration is still berating me. Do. Not. Go. To. Drexel."
Niche User,1,The administration here censors political viewpoints and free speech rights of professors especially. Recent story out today in the news. Suppression of critical thought is not a good look for a University. I’m glad I decided in the end to accept the offer for a master’s program at PSU.
Sophomore,1,What kind of University backs a man like George Ciccariello? this professor is repeatedly extremely racist and calls for genocide publicly
Graduate Student,1,"I started out doing an online program with this school.  First,  the professors demanded things that could not be done across the country do to the computer configurations of their online program.  

One professor refused to hear or help and I began to hate being in this environment.  I talked the dean into letting me out and his comment was ""the university is going to be upset your leaving""--   it was never about me and what was right for me.

I have met so many more with the same kind of horror stories.   I moved on to a wonderful school.

This is NOT a happy school,  and I don't recommend it."
College Freshman,1,"Tough classes, but mostly busy work. Instructors are mostly top notch. You don't take meaningful classes until midway through second year, at which point a lot of people transfer out and are stuck with debt and a lease for the next year."
College Freshman,1,We have policies against drug/alcohol use?
College Freshman,1,"They're primarily assholes. To each his own, but frats are annoying. You'll know someone is in a frat less than a minute after meeting them because they'll shake your hand, tell you there name, and tell you what house they belong to."
College Sophomore,1,It's SO expensive! Students are basically forced to live in off-campus housing
College Freshman,1,I hate the Cells and Genetics course with Kabnick.
College Freshman,1,Tower's hall is nasty but the people are cool so it makes it a bit better. Without them my experience their would be terrible
College Junior,1,Drexel in general was a mistake. I am transferring to a new school (Sarah Lawrence College) and am very excited for that
College Senior,1,"I have had one of the worst experiences at this school. When you need help, you can barely get it. It's expensive and the financial aid is absolutely no help which is why I'm struggling at the moment to continue my education."
College Student,1,"Drexel is for sure the most stingiest institution with their money. For my family's financial situation, I should've qualified for a considerable amount of financial aid but was given none. Both my father and I had to write personal letters to the financial aid office and even then they only gave me about $8,000. Drexel doesn't give money to those who need it and it's a hassle to try and get anything out of them. I also had an athletic scholarship awarded to me that was taken away which i am currently in the process of fighting to get back through compliance. Drexel is terrible with their money and don't try and help you whatsoever."
College Freshman,1,"Frats- sexual assault central 

Sports teams- pathetic

House parties- 100 drunk freshman with the cops there by midnight"
College Freshman,1,"Campus dining at Drexel is absolutely abysmal. You are at the mercy of Sodexo, a multinational corporation with a reputation for making low quality food out of low quality ingredients. Food at the Hans is worse than hospital food, it its boring, bland, greasy, and gets cold by the time you can get everything you need to your (dirty) seat. Staff are indifferent, and who could blame them, their employers SUCK. 

The hours of the Hans (the only standard dining hall) are ridiculous and not suitable for anyone other than perhaps a senior living home. Want a meal past 8 on weekdays or  7:30 on the weekends? Too bad. Staff start closing stations over an hour before official closing time, so if you're hoping for dinner get there before 6. Lines get crazy.

Stations are limited on holidays, even though resident students still live and eat there every day."
College Freshman,1,I literally hate dealing with financial aid and this school. They are taking way too long doing my verification and I need to start classes but they don't care.
College Senior,1,"I'm rating it the worst simply because Drexel costs so much and so you would expect the financial aid process to be a lot simpler and easier to deal with.  

They've changed how they bill halfway through my time here and that made some things difficult for my friends with payment plans.  

Scholarships are hard to get after you've already enrolled (though it may also be like that at other schools) yet the school is ready and willing to bombard your mailbox with donation pleas after you graduate.

Financial holds have been placed on my account when loans were in the process of being disbursed simply because it didn't match up with their payment schedule and so I'd have to speak with financial aid reps multiple times to solve problems."
College Student,1,"After only ten weeks on campus, I can no longer eat it."
College Senior,1,The financial aid office is extremely difficult to work with. It's as though everyone in the office is so eager to pass the buck and hand you off to the next representative without even listening to what you have to say. I am self supporting and paying for school has been quite the struggle. This office has done nothing but made it one of the most stressful experiences of my college career and I am looking forward to graduating and not having to deal with them anymore. My only tip would be to explore any and all other options for financial aid before even considering help from this office.
College Junior,1,I only eat off campus because of how bad the food is.
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms aren't inviting, amenities are nonexistent, social atmosphere is apathetic, the cost is way overpriced, and it's as far from any of the class buildings as it gets."
College Junior,1,housing is very expensive and continues on going up in price
College Sophomore,1,"Drexel is unfair and money hungry. It sucks up money from students and barely gives back. Their method is giving a lot of financial aid to freshmen and handing them many work studies, then after the first year they take it all away and make the process so strict that you barely get any. That's how they get you, so you need to rely in outside scholarships too."
College Sophomore,1,"Philly weather is bipolar. It's extremely snowy and rainy in the winter and hot, sticky and humid in the summer. When it rains, it's usually warm and sometimes when it's sunny it's extremely cold so choosing what to wear is confusing."
College Freshman,1,It's pretty bad and expensive!
College Freshman,1,"Parties are not great.  It's all guys and a few sloppy girls, if that's what you are into.  The Philly life is great and there's an abundance of public transportation."
College Freshman,1,"The administration is just plain out terrible.  I was placed in the wrong major and I have been relentlessly trying to change my major for a year and a half now.  They refuse to admit their system security hole and that incompetence I faced when I met with several useless advisers and administrative staff.  I lost my scholarship along the way and I had to retract my case or else I get suspended.  I wasted my time, money, and future on this corrupted school.  This school is ignorantly unaware on how unhappy the student body is."
College Freshman,1,"The main dining center on campus, The Hans,  is always the first thing to come to mind whenever someone asks what to change about Drexel. Alot of students enjoy The Hans because it is a buffet and depending on if you have a meal plan or not, could be very beneficial. However, alot of students report that the food served at The Hans makes them sick immediately after eating it. "
College Junior,1,"Being in the city, most if not all parking spots are on the street, and unless you only plan to park for two hours in a free space a little off campus (which are also hard to come by), you'll be paying $1-2 an hour, if you're lucky enough to find a space. Parking availability typically depends on the time of day, but if you're trying to park during business hours, be prepared to park way out of your way. Drexel parking lots are also reserved for students with parking permits only, which cost $450 a term. Outrageous costs that aren't worth the money. Plan on walking everywhere and you'll save yourself a ton."
College Sophomore,1,I had to do a lot of verifying and annoying paperwork before I received the financial aid I was promised before attending. Even then I still did not receive everything I was promised.
College Student,1,You have to pay for parking since we are in the city and it is very expensive.
College Junior,1,Absolutely zero free parking spaces. You must either pay a parking meter or pay for a garage.
College Freshman,1,Awful food and service. If it wasn't my dining hall I wouldn't return
College Sophomore,1,There should be more scholarships for Drexel students.
College Freshman,1,Parking on the campus is not good. You will be better off catching public transportation of relying on the Drexel's  Bus that they provide to students.
College Sophomore,1,"Living on campus is nearly $20K, completely unreasonable."
College Sophomore,1,Its near impossible to get parking near wherever you need to go. The only time you get lucky finding parking is during the holidays.
College Sophomore,1,It's usually awful but there is sometimes the food can be surprisingly decent
College Sophomore,1,It's honestly awful there is no good place to find decent parking without searching for awhile
College Student,1,I hate this place. Don't go here.
College Freshman,1,"As an engineering major, I have taken classes that are completelty unrelated to my major and have had my GPA suffer because of it. There curriculum is stupid and the quarter system makes it harder to actually learn the material. Instead it makes it seem that your are just wasting time and you probably won't remember what you learned the next term"
College Freshman,1,It sucks. We are a D1 school but we can't even get to the playoffs. Totally not worth it at all
College Student,1,"Very unhealthy and has poor choice of selection. Supplied by Sodexo, the 
""Hans"", the dining hall, has gotten many students sick at least twice this academic year and is only vendor aside from food trucks. The forced dining plans are just the beginning as well."
College Junior,1,The cost of on-campus parking is crazy high and the locations aren't even that great.
College Sophomore,1,"The Hanz cafeteria at drexel is absolutely terrible. Of the two times i have been there, I had heard various staff swapping the N word back and forth to each other and at one point i was served raw/uncooked meet that flat out disgusted me."
College Freshman,1,"Drexel's calendar requires a new $425 permit every QUARTER. In addition to this, the parking garage is a 10 minute walk from the closest dorm. Parking by the dorms is free and metered, but this is the only free parking in the area, so it fills up immediately from students and Philadelphia residents."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campas is really not good.  Most of the time, you can find free parking in residential/neighborhoods but you have to walk far to get to your classes.  If you cannot find free parking then you have to park on the streets and pay at the meter, which can become costly if you do it everyday."
College Student,1,"LOL, you're funny. Just take the septa..."
College Senior,1,You never find parking and it is very anoying. The PA enforcement is constantly trying to make money off of students.
College Sophomore,1,"The nightlife at Drexel has two areas. Late night sports, and parties. I am not one for drugs or alcohol, which seems to be the most popular among most of the students. But the late night sports are fun. i have met people that i am still friends with, learned about people that i already met, and it allows for some friendly competition."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is both difficult and expensive. As with most places in the city, spaces are small and hard to come by. There are certain streets a short walk away from campus that aren't quite as congested, but beware spots that are open, they are sometimes handicapped spots or otherwise not allowed to be parked in. Tickets are expensive, and the PPA does have frequent patrol on campus.

You can pay to park in the lot or in the garage, but thats over $300/term. You're better off investing in a SEPTA pass that will take you anywhere at almost anytime, and you won't even have to pay for gas."
College Sophomore,1,Drugs Are Everywhere – Just this year - campus had a group selling stamps of heroine.  Actually made the news for once.  Drugs are prevalent unfortunately - it is philly.  Can't stress that enough.  Campus police do nothing to stop it.  Just stay safe

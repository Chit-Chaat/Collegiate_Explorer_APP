Alum,5,Eastern Mennonite University was a wonderful place to earn my Bachelors degree. It is a diverse school with an excellent STEM program. Something that makes EMU unique is it's required cross cultural program. There is so much to learn from studying abroad and I admire EMU's commitment to cross cultural learning.
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any classes online as I have just started, but I definitely plan to considering COVID is around."
Freshman,5,I  have just started my process into Emu's program for nursing and I'm also getting involved in their soccer team. Just starting out is really scary but I have gone through the process with extremely helpful people who have took me around and assisted me no matter the problems I was having. I am very excited to start there as the experience has already been great and I have heard numerous good things. Diving into this process was not easy but with the help of staff it was easy to get anything solved so this experience so far as been excellent and I'm ready for the next four years there.
Niche User,5,Good school and I love this school because they are give me more opportunity to get my dream and I will be make it to the next year
Sophomore,5,I feel very at home at EMU and I feel like everyone here actually wants to see me succeed and is willing to do all the can to help me get there.
Niche User,5,I love the beautiful campus and how small it is. Everyone is so close and gets to know each other. The small campus causes the professors and students to get to know each other better.
Senior,5,"EMU prides itself with being small and community-based, and I have been a benefactor of this community. EMU feels like a second home, with professors who take time to listen, share advice, laugh, drink coffee, and sit in questions with you. I hope to see more students take advantage of this gift in the coming years."
Sophomore,5,"My experience with EMU's staff and professors has been nothing less than wonderful.  Every one of them that I have had contact with is understanding and compassionate and genuinely wants to see their students succeed.  In addition to this, the housing staff I have experienced are genuinely caring and in tune with what is going on on their campus.  It has its flaws but I love this school and the people within it."
Niche User,5,This college is the exact representation of a small college that feels big because of the people around it. They have a great family based feel that makes you feel like a second home. The sporting events are very attentive and the food is second to none.
Alum,5,"Classes were fun and I learned a lot especially from having very good professors who actually cared about their students academics.  They always worked with me and were motivated and not at all hesitant with me.  This may seem unusual for most people but I only did well in a big class whereas small classes, I really needed tutoring.  Tutors at the Academic Support Center really helped me and I eventually had the chance to become friends with them."
Freshman,5,"This school is a wonderful University. It's small student body provides an environment where it is easy to make friends and get to know tons of people. The fact that professors go on a first name basis is wonderful to me, and they are super friendly."
Junior,5,"They have amazing staff  tat are friendly and always willing to work with you. They have a small but amazing community, from the students and faculty I have talked to. They have lots of opportunities for student growth, learning, and socializing."

Niche User,5,I have enjoyed all my visits on campus and look forward to attending this fall. They have great facilities but more importantly an amazing community of students and professors.
Graduate Student,5,"I just began my journey with EMU. I'm a graduate student in their Center for Peacebuilding and Restorative Justice. My application and acceptance process has been excellent and their staff has been exceptional help for me. I will be attending EMU as a long-distance student, and they have been accommodating at every step. This is a great University to attend."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy EMU because of their emphasis on community building, sustainability, and peace building. They are furthering diverse student demographics racially, religiously, by gender and cultural backgrounds. It is set close to JMU, and close to downtown Harrisonburg, so there is plenty to do on weekends on campus, with other campuses, and off campus."
Freshman,5,"I love the diversity. There are students form every nation, religion and race who work together without any conflict and issue."
Graduate Student,5,Eastern Mennonite University is a quality school. The professors and administrators very much have a heart for all of the students.
College Junior,5,"I'm pursuing a Bachelor's degree through the Adult Degree Completion Program. This program is organized, well-structured, and meets my needs in earning a Business degree in Leadership and Organizational Management"
College Senior,5,"Since I attend the Lancaster, PA campus, I believe that this program is one of the best ones out there. So many of my fellow co-workers previously went through the program and I never heard anything negative about it. It was absolutely wonderful! As I continue on in the program with my cohort, I believe that the quality of the employers at EMU strive for excellence and ensure all the students are happy and well taken care of."
College Sophomore,5,"I have enjoyed getting to know my professors. If at any point I need help, I merely stop by their offices and ask. They are always kind and willing to give advice and help."
College Sophomore,5,"I am a rising sophomore at EMU. I chose EMU for several reasons (small class sizes, small campus, Christian atmosphere, cross cultural program, honors program, and proximity to home) and I am very glad I did. It is truly like no other!"
College Freshman,5,I have never seen better dorms
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very friendly to each other
College Freshman,5,Lots of financial aid available you have to find it
College Sophomore,5,There is so much around that it is hard to pick something sometimes.
College Sophomore,5,They really work hard to help you get the most money that you can.
College Sophomore,5,"EMU is a wonderful school. It is a small, cozy college. The facilities are top notch and has all gold leaf dorm building. The school is very sustainable and we grow a lot of food that is eaten and cooked with on campus and in the broader community. It is easy to find housing and very convenient."
College Freshman,5,About 75% of the students are varsity athletes.
College Freshman,5,"There are epic parties at James Madison University, but one at EMU.  There are bars and clubs for 18 and older."
College Junior,5,"Number one is excellent faculty.  We are on a first name basis with all of our faculty on campus and they genuinely care about us as people.  I know that if I were to ever find myself in a tough spot, I could look to my nursing faculty to help me.  Those of us in the program have become a family--I would not have it any other way.  At times, the workload seems unbearable, but the faculty is understanding and very willing to work with each of us."
College Junior,5,"Our security officers are great.  If they see you out walking alone late at night, they will stop and ask if you would like a ride back to campus.  They are always willing to act as an escort in order to get students back to their dorm safely."
College Junior,5,Get to know people from all different majors
College Junior,5,There is virtually no crime on campus. About the only thing you might have to worry about is someone eating your leftovers in the fridge (in the dorms) if you forget to put your name on it. Students are very comfortable walking alone on campus at night.
College Sophomore,5,Here at Eastern Mennonite University you are supposed to live on campus for three years. Some students can get by with commuting but others can't. This makes it expensive and really annoying. So you are living on campus pretty much until you are twenty one and then you can live off campus. It drives people crazy and we want to be able to live off campus without being required to be a certain age or grade. 
College Sophomore,5,The Social Work program at my school is very good. We do a lot of practice scenarios and hands on activities. The professors are very knowledgeable and willing to help anytime they can. The workload is very manageable and there are opportunities out in the community to give back and volunteer. 
College Sophomore,5,"There is a small variety of majors offered. We have Nursing, Social Work, Peace Building and Development and several others. The core curriculum is tedious because some of the classes have nothing to do with some of the majors which is very frustrating. The registration process is simple and easy to follow. Most professors offer study sessions and tutoring for those who need it. "
College Sophomore,5,"Eastern Mennonite University is located in Harrisonburg, Virginia. It is right down from JMU and the mall is only fifteen minutes away. The mall has several good store and it is very accessible. every weekend in downtown Harrisonburg they have late night events which are a blast to go to. Students are able to get where they are going in a timely manner. "
College Sophomore,5,"Bus stop is located on the campus so transportation is not a big deal, campus is only 10mins walk to the downtown, the college has a good location."
College Junior,5,Dorms are clean and close to all academic buildings. Everyone is super friendly and there is definitely a close knit feel.
College Junior,5,"There is a small fee to park, but it is for all year and it is so so so reasonable. There is really no unsafe place to park and everywhere is well lit!"
College Junior,5,I am in the Vocational and Creative Arts department and I love every minute of it!!!
College Junior,5,The academics are so wonderful. The VACA program is new and so amazing!
College Freshman,5,"Well first off since I am a freshman, I am not technically in the nursing program yet. An individual have to take all the necessary prerequisites in order to enter into the program. During the end of sophomore year, if the person made a 2.0 or higher GPA, they will automatically get into the program. With that being sad, it is fairly easy with the process of getting into the program and any questions a person has can be thoroughly answered by their advisor."
College Freshman,5,Excellent programs and campus life.  Study abroad program - fantastic.
College Freshman,5,Harrisonburg City is nearby and has great dining out options.
College Freshman,5,"We have a Mac lab that's very good but sometimes the printer in there doesn't work. And other labs that are just as good as the Mac lab, but those printers work 99.9% of the time. But with printing over all they only give you $20 in the beginning of the year for printing but like that's all you get and if you want any more than that then you have to add money to that account. Sometimes they can take away your privilege of having internet on like your computer or phone."
College Junior,5,I transferred to Eastern Mennonite University because it was close to home. I loved the community of faith and the intensive to work for the good of everyone.  The university has a great business program with roots for peace and justice.  A lot of team work and dedication is seen on the professors and on the students.
College Junior,5,"Access to computers on campus is not taken lightly.  Everybody spends time a lot at the computers labs for homework, midterms, and final.  Everyone makes an effort to save electricity and money so the computer labs are filled and laptops are never seen.  The Computers are very helpful to everyone."
College Junior,5,Safe Haven – You could probably leave your door unlocked and it would be fine. It is a very safe campus. People leave their backpacks outside the cafeteria as they eat and can rely on it being there when they leave. Bikes are the only thing you have to cautious about. Lock those nice transporters up.
College Freshman,5,"Small Community and Tranquil Setting in the Shenandoah Mountains – Eastern Mennonite University is located in Harrisonburg, Virginia - a small town in the Shenandoah Mountains.  About 5 minutes down the road is James Madison University.  Harrisonburg is a small quaint town with a population of approximately 4,500.  The landscape of Harrisonburg is surrounded by the beautiful and picturesque Shenandoah Mountains with lots of green space, plum trees and blueberry patches.  There are several museums such as the Children's Museum, Quilt Museum, and Heritage Museum to name a few.  There is also the Massanutten Ski Resort several galleries.  Movies and plays are popular with several events such as Movies under the Stars - a park-setting movie watching event, and Fridays on the Square.  Harrisonburg's elderly population also serve as ""adopted grandparents"" to the students of Eastern Mennonite University.  They have a special seating area at the basketball games and they often provide baked goods to the students throughout the year."
Recent Alumnus,5,"There's an occasional snow storm. Virginia is far enough south that they panic about snow. The surrounding area will shut down over a dusting. Lots of thunderstorms in the spring, but in general, the weather is pretty awesome."
College Sophomore,5,"Dorms Are Amazing! You have to see it to believe it when I say they are amazing! The three newly renovated dorms are beyond spectacular. They are green friendly and packed with so many little things that make it outstanding. Each hall is loaded with huge 40""+ LCD TV's, automatic lighting and free laundry! All the dorms have hotel style living with the most up to date technology such as dual flushing, self controlled air systems and very fine smoke detectors which are set off even with burnt popcorn."
College Sophomore,5,Very Responsive Security – There has never been reports of dangerous mishaps on campus until recently. In all those small occasions security and the campus staff alerted the students promptly and well-mannered.
College Sophomore,5,"Besides the new Fall 2011 parking fee of $60 dollars per year, the parking at Eastern Mennonite is very lenient. There will usually be parking near the building you need to get to. Just don't park in the Faculty lots, they really do not like that and will give you tickets, it's just common courtesy."
College Junior,5,"I enjoy being joining with a university like Eastern Mennonite because as a student you are constantly prompted to be involved with class/group discussions, hall activities, and campus entertainment. The professors are brilliant and always push the students to shine through. They are incredibly accessible and are endlessly positive. Eastern Mennonite University emphasizes that it is a community and I see this statement as a fact because as a student, I always feel united with university."
College Freshman,5,DESTINED FOR GREATNESS – THE OFFICIAL VISIT WAS A CONFIRMATION. THE ATMOSPHERE IS NONE LIKE NO OTHER. MY FAMILY VALUES AND EMU'S VALUES ARE THE SAME.
College Junior,5,"Beautiful, Open-Minded School. Great Place! There is a nice emphasis on peace and environmental sustainability around campus. There is also very advanced fields of study in the area of nursing, religion, peacebuilding, and social work. Very nice and interesting people all around too. However, in general there is way more liberals than conservatives, so we need some conservatives!"
College Junior,5,"Significant Worship, Hang Out, and Talk Opportunities – I live off campus but spend most of the day on campus and its a whole load of fun. There are good activities planned by the school and a significant number of people to worship, hang-out, and talk with."
College Freshman,5,Always Feel Safe – There has never been a problem with any violence or theft on campus that I know of. Everyone is very friendly and polite and I always feel totally safe.
Sophomore,4,"I love how personal it is, you know your professors by there first name and they are always willing to help you!"
Sophomore,4,I took all of my classes online at first before we were allowed to move in and it went pretty smooth.
Freshman,4,"I am only a freshman at Eastern Mennonite University, but so far it has been such a wonderful experience. The professors are willing to help you out in anyway they can. All of the students are super nice. It was a true bummer to have to go into online courses for the remainder of the semester."
Niche User,4,My experience at EMU was decent. Even though I did only spend one year attending the university I did have a nice time. The environment was very warm and welcoming there were people there all willing to help you. The food was amazing. The view was Gorgeous!
Sophomore,4,"I have just started here as a transfer student, but have wanted to go here for the past 2 years, while I was in community college.  So far, the overall campus is great.  The grounds are well-kept and the dorm I live in is quite adequate. I have my own room (4 suites) and we have a full kitchen with everything except a dishwasher."
Junior,4,I really like the amount of students to teachers.  The class sizes are kept relatively small and each student gets good instruction.
Sophomore,4,"I love the warmth EMU brings to others. The students and staff have very close, first name basis relationships which helps the students here succeed in their studies. The only downfall is that this school is losing students causing majors to be taken away, and parts of dormitories to be off limits to students to save energy and money that the university isn't receiving."
Sophomore,4,"The professors at EMU are world class. Not only do they put forth the maximum effort in reaching students, but the professors also go above and beyond to help their students who need additional assistance. Professors can be seen at many extracurricular activities, showing their school pride."
Freshman,4,While only being there for a couple of weeks; I can't get over how helpful and friendly all of the staffers are. I mean any college will say they'll help or are glad to see you. The staff here at EMU really mean it. They make you feel so welcome and that you are truly wanted.
Sophomore,4,"I love the place. I grew up in Harrisonburg, and am now attending school here too. The Shenandoah Valley is a beautiful place for any college campus. The first name basis with the professors makes me feel right at home and wanted in the classroom. There's lots to get involved in on campus, but life kind of dies on the weekends."
Freshman,4,EMU has a very strong community feel. The professors are very invested in the students and they always want to make sure their students succeed.
Freshman,4,Very nice campus with very nice professors. The science programs are very good and the facilities are wonderful. Overall it is a good school but it could work on food service and residence life.
College Junior,4,"I earned an Associate's degree from a community college. As a non-traditional student, I wanted to be associated with a school that was not a diploma mill, that allowed me to transfer the most number of my earned college credits, and also enable me to earn a Bachelor's degree in the shortest amount of time as a part-time student. My persona preference was to be in an environment that fostered an active, real-time discussion of ideas instead of an exchange of emails. I chose EMU's ADCP because it met all of these factors."
College Senior,4,"Overall, I really enjoy working with the professors, because they are willing to work for me. I feel very supported and constantly motivated towards success. It is so welcoming to be a part of a university who doesn't just feel like they are taking my money or pushing me out the door. There are so many professors who are willing to meet one on one to make sure I understand the course content and I am successful. My experience at Eastern Mennonite University has been much better than when I attended another college for my ASN in nursing."
College Sophomore,4,I am pursuing a career as a high school math teacher. I know that in the local area EMU graduates are known for their quality of work. I know that this will be helpful when I look for a local job after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,EMU is a small campus and all of my classes are within a ten minute walk (from my dorm room to my desk in class).
College Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed participating in the new Pep Band. We attended many home basketball games and cheered on our Royals! It was a lot of fun and allowed me to get involved in and support the sports activities at EMU.
College Senior,4,"It's great if you're living with your friends - and if not, all the dorms are near each other so it's not too far to walk to another dorm to be with your friends."
College Senior,4,Our teams win about half to 3/4 of the time but we have good school spirit and it's a lot of fun to watch the games.
College Senior,4,"I've loved my professors, the social culture is enjoyable, and I've grown academically and personally during my time at EMU."
College Junior,4,It has been a great experience so far.
College Junior,4,I am not into sports but the athletic department from what I know is fantastic.
College Freshman,4,There could be more support for some of the less popular sports
College Junior,4,"I personally have not visited the career center yet, but my roommate has, and she said it was a lot of help"
College Junior,4,most professors are very willing to help students both in and outside of class.  I feel like the majority of profs want to see/help their students succeed.
College Junior,4,I love living in the apartments.  Its such a different experience than living in traditional dorms.  The only downside to living here is that everything is so far away.
College Junior,4,"Athletics are important around campus.  There are a lot of athletes, more than I originally thought.  Games are not as attended as i would've thought."
College Junior,4,"I came in as a transfer, and although there are a lot of activities for transfers, it was still hard to make my own friends."
College Sophomore,4,It is great! all of the professors are super nice and everyone is really welcoming
College Freshman,4,There are lots of spots.
College Freshman,4,I am not an upper classman so I have no idea how off campus housing works but I know that there is plenty of housing for students and people really like it and enjoy it
College Freshman,4,Some restaurants are high priced but you get what you pay for! They is a great variety you pass so many options
College Freshman,4,The school really enforces the policies here at school! You as students are held accountable
College Freshman,4,My tips are don't wait till the last minute and always ask questions if you don't understand
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is such a wonderful experience! I love being here and experiencing community and living with wonderful helpful people who go out of there way to make you feel accepted and want you to feel comfortable
College Freshman,4,One main strip with lots of places to eat
College Freshman,4,Has its Ups and Downs. More Ups than downs.
College Sophomore,4,They really work on you and try to get to know you.
College Sophomore,4,Best place to eat is anywhere in the Burg!
College Sophomore,4,The dorms really are amazing!
College Freshman,4,Harrisonburg is a great place to live lot's to do
College Freshman,4,Very safe! You'll never feel afraid at night.
College Freshman,4,Harrisonburg has a ton of great diverse options.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms were great. They definitely have much better dorms than any other college I have been too. Great heating and air conditioning, great bathroom facilities. They have drawers and closets for all of your items which was very convenient and unlike any other colleges I have visited."
College Freshman,4,There are bus stops right on campus.  The cost is only 50 cents.
College Freshman,4,Shopping downtown is something a lot of college students enjoy.  There are different cultural events including the African American Festival and the International Festival.
College Freshman,4,"The food is usually not that expensive because the owners understand that the town is full of college students.  There is a wide variety of places whether you want Chinese, burgers, Italian food, or Mexican."
College Freshman,4,Alot of places are available especially for college students. I think it is very convenient because it is close to the school and public transportation.  The cost usually is not that bad considering that everything is usually included in one bill.
College Freshman,4,The school is filled with alot of friendly people.  Class sizes are smaller so it gives the student a chance to connect with the professor on a more personal level.  They really are involved with the environment and give the students alot of activities to meet new people on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Won't be staying on campus
College Junior,4,"I play softball here, thus I think highly of the athletics."
College Junior,4,"The computer at school are good, sometimes they look dirty though.  I think the printing money is not enough."
College Junior,4,I am very happy with my nursing field and I would be in the same field again if I had the chance.
College Junior,4,I enjoy living on campus.  Everything is relatively close and I have enough space in my room.
College Junior,4,"I have never been pressure to do drugs, or felt left out because I do not do drugs.  There are some student that do drugs but they do not act weird or make it visibly noticeable."
College Junior,4,"My mother and I came in one time, sat down and spoke with a women in the financial aid office and had everything solved at the end of the meeting."
College Junior,4,The campus has good overall safety and security.  Campus security can always be reached and will to help where you are.  All the building have to be swiped into with makes me feel safe inside and my personal belongings are safe when I am away.
College Junior,4,Our basketball teams are usually the best.  This year our women had a large bid to play in the NCAA tournament and a few years ago our guys team made the final four in the NCAA tournament.
College Junior,4,"The upper classmen have the opportunity to live in two different housing options (both are types of on campus apartments).  It is nice for those of us who are juniors or seniors to be able to have our own space, but many do wish that the no drinking rule did not apply to us.  Parkwoods, where I live, is very social.  On nice days, everyone has their doors open, everyone sits on their porch, and it becomes a great big homework party!"
College Junior,2,Only good if you are a white Mennonite
College Freshman,2,The only good food is in the Den.
College Sophomore,2,I love Common Grounds but the rest is not great.
College Freshman,2,Very religious looking for very religious.
College Freshman,2,"Boring, not very inclusive. Not diverse beliefs."
College Freshman,2,You still have an RA as a senior. Let that sink in
College Freshman,2,The cafeteria provides the same low quality food.
College Freshman,2,"The school is very strict when it comes to drugs, alcohol, or anything breaking the Community Lifestyle Commitment"
College Junior,2,Our internet is awful.  I have to sign in multiple times a day to use the internet and it is so slow and unreliable that it has become a joke.
College Senior,2,"Unless you have a car or know someone with a car, bikes are the best way to go. The bus system is awful."
College Sophomore,2,The nightlife at my school is very boring. All people do is watch movies and knit. There are no parties and if you want to go to a party you have to drive and therefore causes people not to have as much fun at them. 
College Sophomore,2,There isn't a lot of diversity on campus and most people who are in those groups are not discriminated against others. The religion is really smothering and most are Mennonites.
College Sophomore,2,This campus is very strict. You can't have alcohol. You can't have a guy in your room if its after closed hours. There is nothing to do on the weekends and the activities that are planned are normally not fun. 
College Sophomore,2,Most students here drive or live on campus. The parking is very slim and most students go home on the weekends. Our campus is so small that we can walk to every class. The only time I use my car is if I decide to go out to eat or just to take a break from being on campus. The city bus comes every hour on the hour but I never use it. It's only sixty dollars to park on campus for the whole year which is nice and the gas prices are lower here because of college students and we don't have a lot of money. 
College Senior,2,for the amount of times i did eat on campus at the cafeteria. i thought it was ok. nothing special but it had a lot of options for selection.
College Freshman,2,"Winters in Harrisonburg is way too harsh. At times it is difficult trying to get out of bed but since I hate having to make up work, i simply put my laziness aside and walk faster to my classes. Even though it snows awfully a lot here, classes are still ongoing which can be agitating. Needless to say, summer times on campus  seems more lively."
College Freshman,2,There is definitely no Greek Life here. They don't believe in all that.
College Sophomore,2,"Quiet, but You Can Find Loud – It is pretty small, and my university is very quiet. The town is basically empty during the summer, but the school year livens it up. Lots of good restaurants, a few things to do at night. Not a lot of clubs...however, JMU is a few miles away if you want to actually go to a party."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a strong policy against drinking and drug use however it seems to be rarely enforced.  Even if everyone knows what's happening but no one seems to do anything about it.  However, when people are caught, the punishments are pretty strict."
College Freshman,2,"There is probably some stuff in town and JMU is right down the road, but not a lot of options around campus."
College Sophomore,1,Guys have to be out of dorms by 11 on weekdays.
College Sophomore,1,If you're not an Athlete your best bet is JMU
College Freshman,1,The Community Lifestyle Commitment was intrusive.
College Freshman,1,EMU does not permit Greek Life or partying.
College Freshman,1,Way too strict! Stricter than boarding school.
College Senior,1,Social Lives – It is a private college and the Christian views are forced . Very focused on out of country studnts and very forced upon others
College Sophomore,1,"It's a Mennonite School: Strict, but Understanding – Campus security is fairly strict, and RDs will not hesitate to take action of alcohol/other substances are found in rooms/possession of students.  Being a Mennonite school, men and women are separated by dorms floors, and there are closed hours (meaning that you can only be in the room of the opposite sex during the hours of 12PM-11PM/1AM)."

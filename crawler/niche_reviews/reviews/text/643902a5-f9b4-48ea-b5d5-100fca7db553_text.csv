Freshman,5,My overall experience with Augusta University has been the best. All the professors are nice. The campus looks beautiful up close.
Freshman,5,I took some of my classes online and haven't had any difficulty with it. My online experience has been fantastic.
Freshman,5,The online learning is so easy and user friendly if you are not tech savvy like some of my peers. Most professors are also very quick with their email response time. I only have one who can be slow.
Graduate Student,5,Everyone is very understanding and they have great patience when dealing with the online students. I like how the professors desire to get to know you so that they can be of better service to you. The class sizes are also just right so you can guarantee to be heard and attended to when you are in need.
Freshman,5,"I am taking most of my classes online. The online platform that I use to complete homework assignments and exams is D2L (Desire 2 Learn). It is a great platform to communicate to teachers, receive up to date notifications about upcoming exams or quizzes, completing homework, etc. It is a great resource for me and makes my studying more efficient and convenient. However, the only class that I have to take on campus is Biology Lab Class. This class, I have to be physically on campus because I have to perform mandatory lab assignments to pass the class. It is a good experience for me, because I get to put my hands on  lab equipment and do fascinating experiments."
Freshman,5,"Augusta University is a public research university and medical center dedicated to training the next generation of innovators, leaders and health care providers. Augusta University has fascinating buildings and scenic views.  The Elm Hall Dorm is amazing. The room is neat, cozy, comfortable and beautiful. Augusta University also gives me an insight that I am no longer a baby anymore. I have the freedom to sleep, eat, go out, whenever I want."
Sophomore,5,"I only took online courses due to COVID-19. The transition to online classes was definitely a new and challenging experience for me as I had never taken online courses prior to this. However, Augusta University ensured that the transition was a smooth one for both students and faculty. I was able to successfully receive A's in my courses."
Junior,5,I like how the professors at Augusta University really put in an effort towards the students that especially want to exceed and do well. They are always willing to help and explain things to you that you did not understand in class. I would like to see more technology being used at Augusta University but other than that its a great school.
Junior,5,"I just recently transferred from the University of West Georgia, they are super welcoming! The semester hasn't even started and I am excited to begin my Fall 2020 classes! Best decision I have made!"
Junior,5,"I haven't been able to experience them yet, but I have a friend who has! He really enjoys them and recommends the online classes here!"
Freshman,5,i didn't take any classes online but from other people I heard that the Professors and student teachers where interactive and made sure to connect with their students.
Sophomore,5,Online classes are fairly easy if you do the assigned work. The professors are an email away for help and the amount of work is usually not too much.
Sophomore,5,It is a great School. The student-to-staff ratio is great. The experience is very personal and touching. The help you need is always open to you and there are many services provided. The buildings are well-kept and clean.
Junior,5,augusta university is an amazing school with so many opportunities. there are several clubs to join on campus that will appeal to almost everyone.
Junior,5,the online learning experience proved to be difficult. covid-19 changed the way students learned but the professors adapted very well and were always there for their students. they were easy to reach and always responded.
Freshman,5,"AU is pretty great but it is also kind of expensive, and paying for the and gas and insurance gets to be alot of money, so this scholarship would be nice :)"
Junior,5,Augusta University lives by this saying “be boundless” Meaning there is endless opportunities for students. They will try to help you to there best of there abilities.
Alum,5,"Undergrad experience was so great, I'm planning on returning for grad school! (Tip: Make the most of it by getting connected with student organizations!)"
Niche User,5,"I like how the school and living areas are separate, the fact that they could help me graduate early so i could get a head start on my career."
Senior,5,"What I liked about Augusta University was not only the campus scenery but also, the broad services they provide for welfare, student life, financial, academic, and career. I also like how well trained the professors are and how the school provides many free services. I also like how the school recognizes the maintenance, custodial, and landscaping staff along with others whose work tends to go unnoticed."
Freshman,5,"I like Augusta University, because the staff is extremely friendly and easy to talk to. There are plenty of diverse and friendly students to get to know. If you study hard and do your work, it will be easy to succeed. This is my freshman year, and I love it so much. It is a good school for good people, even if you aren't a medical, dental, or cyber student. #GO JAGS!"
Niche User,5,my experience at Augusta was great. they knew who I was when I came to check in. they welcomed me with opened arms and open hearts. I actually enjoyed everything they had to offer as a whole. the campus was  pretty big but full of good opportunities that are just waiting to be explored by myself and the new class coming in.
Niche User,5,"I haven’t visited the campus yet but I’m set to tour next month and I’m already SO excited! I’ve been a prospective student since my sophomore year in highschool and I’m proud to say that it is now my senior year in school and it is literally the only school that has been on my radar! Ever since I found out that they were known for their medical school I couldn’t help but look further into the school. And look at me now. Applying for the 
fall semester of 2020! Wish me luck!!"
Sophomore,5,My experience so far has been great. Everyone here is so friendly and willing to assist me with everything that I need assistance with. The atmosphere is inviting and their academic focus is exactly what I require for my major. Their are a variety of activities that take place around the campus each week that welcome all students to come and participate regardless of academic year. Augusta University is a wonderful place to attend my classes and I am happy to call myself a student of this institution.
Freshman,5,"They have an amazing staff, very helpful and provide plenty of resources. They always have somebody around to help and are always hosting events on campus to create connections and get yourself out there."
Freshman,5,The campus here is beautiful! Faculty and staff here are very nice and respectful. I love it here because there is a lot of on-campus activities and resources.
Sophomore,5,Augusta University is a big university in a little city! They bring an excellent student atmosphere to the city of Augusta. Augusta University staff have been extremely helpful thus far.
Niche User,5,I had a very speady decision prosess. And they are very in touch with getting students invovled. With everything that a normal student goes through worrying for months or even days about getting into college can be ruff. With AU you get what you need there are multiple ways that AU is a great school. Being able to not worry about a college getting back to you a on a decision on whether you have been accepted or not is something you do not habe to worry about with AU.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Augusta University. I have been here for two years now and it is great. The classes are smaller in size which I love. The campus is beautiful especially in spring time. There is always something going on around campus. There is some club or organization for every student to join. The staff is friendly and you can tell they want their students to succeed. I would recommend AU to anyone who wants a smaller campus.
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere at Augusta University is so welcoming.  The campus is rich in history, and class size is smaller, creating a family-like environment."
Niche User,5,I honestly loved the fill of everything there.  The spacious campus is very beautiful.  I also think this is the best place to get my Nursing degree.  They have such a wonderful background in the medical field.
Niche User,5,I used to live in augusta a few years ago and i loved it. After doing reaserch i found out that the instate fees for this university is affordable especially if you live in the city of augusta
Senior,5,"Augusta University provides an excellent opportunity for a low cost school with a high value education and provides rigorous programs of study in medicine, business, education, and other forms of liberal arts."
Senior,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my experience at AU. In particular, their Social Work program has changed my life. I have been able to be mentored by incredible professors and have gotten to the opportunity to be a social work intern through their BSW program, which has given me my first real social work related experience. I will be graduating from AU in May of 2019 and I will surely miss it once I am gone!"
Niche User,5,"I took both the vitural tour and campus tour of Augusta University and it was amazing. They have so many majors and minors. They have a lot of medical majors too which is amazing. Also the school is affordable which is so amazing. The campus, majors, and tuition is what makes this school my number 1 school I want to go to!"
Senior,5,Every single one of the professors want you to succeed. I would like to see parking conditions improved.
Freshman,5,It has a good selection of courses. The security on the campus is great. I wish you didnt  have to pay for a parking pass every semester. It should last the whole year. It is a great place to go.
Senior,5,"I love this campus and the school itself.  Professors are wonderful and really know what they are talking about. Most of them have real world experience in their fields. Also, the campus is beyond beautiful.  Class sizes are small, allowing more room for questions and getting to know your professors."
Freshman,5,I love that it has a small campus (Summerville) feel and a large campus (Medical Campus) feel! The classes are small but also involve a lot of outside research that helps with everyday things. I am so glad that I decided to go to Augusta University for my undergraduate degree! Go Jags!
Freshman,5,"It is a really good school, the small classrooms have a better way of one on one connecting. The professors are friendly."
Freshman,5,"I will be attending Augusta University in august 2018.  I have visited the campus twice since my acceptance, and I have had great experiences.  Everyone there is very friendly and helpful, both students and the employees.  The campus is beautiful and relaxing.  The teachers seem to really enjoy what they do, and they care about their students."
Freshman,5,It is a rather nice school that is filled with wonderful people. I would recommend it to other people.
Freshman,5,"I am in the art department and its a great community, faculty and environment. I am constantly challenged and encouraged to grow and develop."
Freshman,5,"The school itself is really amazing. Some of the best professors are here at this university. There is such a huge family aspect here at Augusta, and there are events for every single person almost weekly. The atmosphere is super friendly and the university itself gives students so many opportunities to succeed."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Augusta University has been life changing. Professors strive everyday to help shape us into the young professionals we will become later in life. I feel that Augusta University is one of the best schools to attend to further your education.
Freshman,5,"As the semester ends, I can safely say that my experience at Augusta University has been great. As a student that cares deeply about academics, a stress on collegiality and success is important to me - this is a core value of Augusta University. From enthusiastic/well-equipped professors to dedicated study areas with qualfied tutors, Augusta more-than-adequately facilitates my academic desires."
Junior,5,I like the smaller environment on this campus. It makes you feel welcomed and invited by the community. All the staff and students are very nice and polite. I highly recommend Augusta University!
Freshman,5,ROAR Camp was a pretty cool experience to meet people before school starts on Wednesday. There were many activities and workshops to meet people and also gain community service hours.
Junior,5,Augusta is a great place to live and an even better place to retire in and live a relaxed and peaceful life.
Freshman,5,"It has a very friendly atmosphere and the campus is nice and small, so it is no hassle to get from class to class. The food is great, and being a smaller campus means I get to meet new people and interact easily."
College Freshman,5,My professors are very friendly .
College Freshman,5,This school offers work study for those individuals who need financial assistance.
College Freshman,5,Police are always patrolling the area.
College Freshman,5,It has a wide variety of sports.
College Freshman,5,The security measures that are put in place to keep students safe are amazing
College Sophomore,5,The professors are cool. they work with you in their office hours. They just want to see you succeed.
College Sophomore,5,There are a lot of internships at the hospital you just have to talk to the career services.
College Sophomore,5,The security guards roam all the time and its pretty safe.
College Sophomore,5,I like living on campus because its like little apartments. I can cook my own food if i want to.
College Sophomore,5,They bring life to the campus.
Freshman,4,"The admission process is stressful but my advisors helped me greatly during that time. When it came to registering for classes, they helped me push hard towards the classes I needed. Teachers are great and very personable."
Freshman,4,"The admission process is stressful but my advisors helped me greatly during that time. When it came to registering for classes, they helped me push hard towards the classes I needed. Teachers are great and very personable."
Freshman,4,"Augusta University is a great school, my only complaint is the communication between the school and it's students. I just feel uniformed and the only way I really get information is through my professors. Otherwise it's an amazing school."
Graduate Student,4,The staff members are very helpful when it comes to making sure you have everything you need in place for school.
Graduate Student,4,They have been very accommodating and have provided lots of supportive resources to make up for the loss of learning fully in person.
Sophomore,4,I really liked how diverse the campus was and the overall culture on campus.  It was easy to make new friends and to take part in on-campus activities.  The class sizes weren't too big and overwhelming so it was easy to get ahold of the professor to ask questions.
Sophomore,4,"Augusta University is a pretty challenging university, along with many other universities. However, they do a great job training their students how to be great leaders and how to be the best in their desired future career. I can honestly say I'm glad I made the decision to attend. In addition, I'm looking froward for what's to come this Fall semester."
Sophomore,4,Augusta University is a great school that offers many opportunities for its students to be successful. It feels like a family environment and everyone cares for each other there.
Junior,4,My online experience with AU was pretty good. When needing help with an assignment the professors get back with you quickly when you email them with questions and the peer review on your class mates assignments are helpful as well.
Freshman,4,For me transitioning from being a highschool senior to a college Freshmen has been hard but with the help of the business center my student leader and academic advisor it has be smooth sailing. It is a school that isn't afraid to held people who are starter college as well as helping new college students get ready to start there own college adventure.
Graduate Student,4,I took one class online at first and then ended up taking all my classes online because of COVID 19.  The professors handled the transition really well.
Graduate Student,4,Great school.  Professors are competent and know their subjects.  Maybe the only critique is the library of one of the campuses is in the student center so sometimes the music from events carry over into the Library.
Sophomore,4,I think Augusta is a great school for people who are motivated and determined. The university is very comfortable and appealing. I'm just finishing my freshman year and I must say that the teachers are excellent and I would recommend any one to come here.
Freshman,4,Visiting Augusta University you immediately feel as though you belong there. The teachers and admissions workers all feel genuine and are very helpful in your career goals.
Sophomore,4,"I love Augusta University! Augusta has given me opportunities to make something better of myself and to become a greater version of myself. I am a student hopeful of receiving the HOPE scholarship one day, and I hope that I could get money to satisfy my financial issue, as my family is currently struggling more than we ever have before."
Senior,4,"Overall, I am thankful to have a great experience at Augusta University. Over the past 4 years, I have faced a lot of different experiences which have shaped the way I view the world and myself. I have learned so many things professionally, personally, and academically. Augusta University provided me with incredible resources a pre-medical student. There are so many opportunities, but most importantly Augusta University taught me to seek. To seek knowledge. To seek experiences. To seek challenges. All of these combined have allowed me to grow as an individual."
Junior,4,"I love the bang for your buck you get at Augusta. Tuition is cheap, yet the academics are stellar. I’d imagine in the next few years the school will cost a lot more, as many departments are rising in ratings. One flaw is the lack of engagement, since for many students AU is a commuter school. That is, they attend class and head right home. We have so many nontraditional students that it does not feel like a “normal” university. I think this is a plus, though. Adults need a chance to get an affordable, strong education. Augusta University is the place for that."
Sophomore,4,"This school is amazing for academics, especially for medicine. As far as ""bang for your buck"", I would argue that Augusta's the best place for medicine in the state. The proximity to different hospitals compared to the tuition makes for an outstanding deal. Couple that with the fact that it's very near the Medical College of Georgia,  and you have a university with many opportunities for research and internships. The majority of science professors  are reasonable and care for your learning and well-being.

If you want the ""traditional college experience"", this is not best school for it. The University does have fun events , and there are many organizations you can join, including an expanding greek life. However,  turnout's a problem for many of the school's events. Students often take the drive to other in-state colleges when looking for a good party scene.

Overall, there is a tradeoff between student life and academics, but it's worth it if you're interested in medicine especially."
Sophomore,4,AU is a nice school to go to. The Summerville campus is very beautiful and there's  always activities and events going on throughout the year. Professors are so and so. Some are really good while some could be better. Check ratemyprofessor before you register for a class.
Freshman,4,"So far the campus is really great. The teachers are very active and engaged with students, especially if the student puts in the effort to get to know the teachers. The only issues I have experienced are with the housing and parking offices. The housing is located a few miles from campus so bus transportation to and from class is very important. The buses are pretty regular in their schedule however so this is a minor issue. Overall the school is pretty great and I recommend it for anyone looking for a good medium sized school."
Freshman,4,AU is a very good university. The professors are great and engaging and the people are extremely welcoming. It is also very diverse. The food could be better.
Junior,4,"Over all I have enjoyed my experience with Augusta University, the professors I have had seemed to really care about my academic progress. With all things there are some issues I had, but they were small such as sometimes parking could be hard to find some days."
Senior,4,The classes are pretty difficult but they are really good at preparing students for the MCAT and medical school in the future.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very beautiful, but it lacks parking. With the tremendous amount of growth the university has seen, the facilities need to accommodate."
Junior,4,"I love the school here. I am currently in greek life and AU is really improving with student life. While I do wish they had a football program, basketball kinda makes up for it. The relationships i have gained from this school will last me a lifetime throughout my career."
Graduate Student,4,I have been working as a cardiac nurse at Kennestone Hospital for two years now and am attending Augusta University for their acute care BSN to DNP nurse practitioner program. I have enjoyed the experience so far and feel like I am learning the necessary skills to become an effective nurse practitioner in the hospital setting.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus and campus life of Augusta University. There are always free activities on campus for students, as well as free services. However, the professors are 50/50. Some of them are very active in teaching, and some tend to teach primarily off of powerpoints."
Sophomore,4,"Augusta University is a amazing school to attend especially for any aspiring nursing or dental students. Augusta also offer many different undergraduate programs also. I love the size and teacher to student ratio, the campus is beautiful and the diversity is not disappointing. There are many clubs, sports and organizations to join for those that enjoy getting involved on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I love the people that stay on campus, but most importantly I loved the teachers that work for the university."
Freshman,4,Augusta University has some very good professors. Campus safety is widely enforced. Student life is good and there are alot of activities going on.
Freshman,4,"My first year experience at Augusta University was amazing and very challenging. I earned a 4.0 GPA in my first semester despite having 6 rigorous courses. My second semester was more tough, but I was very challenged and learned a lot of things that benefitted me towards my major. The professors are challenging but are great teachers, and are definitely great fits for Augusta University."
Sophomore,4,Good people come everywhere and Augusta University is certainly one of those places. The faculty in the kinesiology department are amazing. Great campus too!
Senior,4,I like the location and diversity of the school. It’s a great school especially for students going into the medical field. They also offer a lot of opportunities.
Junior,4,"Augusta University has a great staff that seem to love what they do. I have yet to have a professor that was not passionate about the subject they were teaching. The only downfall I believe is the cost of the student fees. They seem a bit much and after paying all of the tuition and fees you still have to pay for a parking pass, and the price just seems to go up every year. Not to mention there is incredibly limited parking. If you do not arrive to campus within 15 minutes of class, you aren't going to find a spot to park anywhere near the building you are to needed to be in."
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus, it was very beautiful and urban. My family is from the Augusta area and it has the perfect combination of city and country. The Augusta U medical center is outstanding."
Niche User,4,"I visited Augusta last week. The environment on campus is very nice, friendly people, great academics and I felt safe of campus. The town outside of the campus is the dangerous area."
Senior,4,The College of Nursing really cares about their students. I feel like all the teachers and faculty really want the students to do well and be confident in their nursing practice.
Sophomore,4,"My class at this school have been very challenging; however, I have learned a lot through the work I have been given and pushing myself. The financial aid office is TERRIBLE"
Freshman,4,"I am excited to get to know the campus, and the professors all seem extremely knowledgeable and caring. The small class sizes will ensure that professors will get to know students as people, and there are many ways to get involved on campus."
Freshman,4,I like the faculty and their prompt response and ability to help. They offer a fantastic cyber program and I've heard good things about the other majors as well.
Niche User,4,"I attend East Georgia College on this campus, as a result AU or GRU is an amazing campus with lots of things to do. The food is also Fairly good also as well as the classroom settings."
Freshman,4,Starting as a freshman at Augusta University will be always remembered. There was a camp in the first week called ROAR camp it was a horrid week of them making us wake up before dawn and not letting us back into our dorms till 12. I was hoping that college would be like this when college starts with them trying to hold your hand. They don't after that first week. They try to acclimate new students into to college life by at least helping you through the first week. Later when in classes start it helps you get used to wanting to go to professors office hours to get help for the next assignment or any other questions you may have. Overall Augusta University has be came my second home.
Sophomore,4,Augusta University is a very good college for any student that wants to be a science major. There are plenty of parties and other extracurricular activities.
Sophomore,4,"Augusta University is very much interested in your work and school life. They wish the best for you and want to see you succeed. With caring teachers and staff, they will work with you to help find a job after graduation."
Sophomore,4,"I think the food courts and booths could be better. However, the school itself is good for it's side, with quality dorms and campuses."
Freshman,4,"It's a good college, they give you what you need without bothering you with a whole bunch of unnecessary stuff, which they do but it's easy to ignore. However, if you like the unnecessary fun stuff, then it's great for you!"
Senior,4,"Professors' doors are always open. Most of them are there only because they want to be, really care about the students, and explain the material well."
Sophomore,4,"It's a pretty campus and it has a lot of pretty good seminars going on each week. A huge listing of clubs, though it's difficult to find details about th odd clubs in the website. It has multiple places just on the Summerville campus to get something to eat."
Graduate Student,4,The program I am in is very well rounded in the curriculum and prepares students for further education AND career based paths.
Freshman,4,"I love the amount of clubs and the involvement at Augustsa University. Here at Augusta University we try to make everyone feel welcomed and apart of the university and we do that by forming many clubs for people to join. I also like how the school is preparing me for dental school, the core classes at Augusta University are very challenging but I am very happy about that. I feel like the courses are doing a great job at preparing me for my program."
Freshman,4,"I like the school overall ... it challenges your education mind level . In high school I remember not having to study all the time to pass. Now in college if I don't study, that's automatically fail."
Graduate Student,4,"Augusta University, Summerville campus is situated in a beautiful area of Augusta.  The campus, itself, can grow in social justice and equitable practices, pursuit, and direction."
Sophomore,4,"Augusta university has two separate campus, Summerville campus and the Health Science campus. They are both separate but not far from each other. The professor are very accessible once you have made an appointment. Some will see you without. The basketball team is pretty good and the Greek life and student life is well know around campus."
Junior,4,"Augusta University is a rising College as it has made tremendous strides to become a top tier school. Since its merge with the Medical College of Georgia, the University is better known for its Science and Medical opportunities. Overall it is becoming more of an enjoyable University with a great pride and involvement."
Niche User,4,"The classes are interesting and the professors are very engaged.  Their are many opportunities for involvement such as honors programs, clubs,  Greek life, athletics.  There is a fitness center for students.  There are healthy food options around campus.  The academic advisors are very knowledgeable and helpful.  There are also research opportunities.  Augusta University has many different majors to choose from for your selected career paths."
Freshman,4,"At Augusta University, I received much information on how to be successful in my major as well as my minor. My academic advisor was very quick to assist me with any questions I had, and the professors are always eager to teach. The campus is quiet and beautiful."
Junior,4,"Augusta University is a great fit for anyone who does not like to get lost in numbers.  Class sizes are relatively small, lots of campus life activities, and it is a great atmosphere.  There is a lot of school spirit and school pride in Augusta."
Junior,4,"The entire faculty is absolutely amazing, some of the classes are interesting and very engaging. I would probably only change the speed in which they process anything in the business, registar, and admission office. Anything that has to go through those offices tends to take a very long time and/or they do it wrong. However, overall the institution is amazing, and every person that works there."
Junior,4,"Augusta University has a wide range of majors specifically science and allied health science. My experience with professors at this university has been positive. Although I did not live on campus housing, I do know that it is nice. The gym is fully equipped.  Many students who attend the university are local, so this is not really considered to be a ""college town"".  I do the tuition is overpriced for the experience but this college was right for me because of the major I chose."
College Freshman,4,"You are guaranteed a job once you graduate, because they hire their own."
Alum,2,"Online classes are disappointing. It is mostly independent work.. seldom do professors hold video lectures, it's mostly power point slides, online assignments and textbook review. I recommend taking in-person classes if you can.. you will have a better experience."
Freshman,2,I don't feel as if i had a very great 1st semester experience especially class wise. I felt as the teachers didn't necessarily teach but read off power points and summarize the subject.
Sophomore,2,My online learning experience happened mostly in this last semester when classes were moved to online.  We used zoom calls to have class but personally I didn't like having classes online and rather of had them in person because I would procrastinate on a lot of the work.
Freshman,2,I would like them to change that everybody should have to get a meal ticket because not everybody can afford it and not everybody going to use it.
Sophomore,2,I was there for two years and ended up transferring. There are a limited amount of professors and students always end up not getting the courses they need! Professors here are also extremely hard. Although the campus is beautiful it is VERY small and I think there are not enough students there. Dorms at UV are terrible and the parking situation is a nightmare for freshmen. Social/party life is non-existant and it is hard to get involved on campus or in clubs. I wouldn't recommend going here unless you are very academic-oriented and enjoy a small university feel.
Sophomore,2,It's just too small. I love the medical campus and dental college downtown. However the main undergraduate campus is small and far. The dorms are not anywhere CLOSE to the school and the shuttle system is lacking.
Freshman,2,"Augusta University, being the local college in town, seemed to be the most convenient, affordable college experience.  Although, I was able to experience a change I never expected staying at home, seeing many of my former classmates, and the lack of college spirit was going to be quite the unpleasant experience. In this freshmen experience, I almost lost my interest in college after finding that the most difficult part was the school, facility, and people rather than the school work.  From this experience, I learned to never stay home that first year of college unless you cannot healthily function without your family being close.  To fulfill your college experience, I truly believe that the fresh start should include a new environment, a dorm, and of course all the courses you need to seek your future goals.  It's definitely a huge college regret of mine."
Junior,2,"Augusta University is a fine school if you want to study medicine or science but terrible for art. Also, there's hardly any parking or student living because of the surrounding neighborhood."
College Junior,2,Our school does nothing of the such. Every now and then there will be a small gathering but nothing seriously fun such as a bar/nightclub.
College Sophomore,2,Theres only one housing unit. Its located on the worst side of town. Not worth the money spent
College Sophomore,2,"We have sports team, but no school spirit. No one attends games or events. Our school does not push for clubs or student involvement. The sports team we do have, are extremely bad."
College Freshman,2,I just don't really enjoy the school.. There are so many changes and I just feel like it has no stability. I can't wait to transfer.
College Sophomore,2,There is minimal school spirit.
College Freshman,2,There are only a few parties and they are probably about once every month or every other month.
College Sophomore,2,there isn't much of a party scene in Augusta whatsoever. Students normally go to Statesboro.
College Sophomore,2,"I received my financial aid through Fafsa.gov and they sent me to review it several times, saying there was something wrong with the information I submitted but did not indicate which part needed correcting. Overall, it took me a month to finalized everything."
College Sophomore,2,"we have buildings, thats how to describe the facilities here"
College Sophomore,2,havent i already answered this question?
College Sophomore,2,"School spirit is non-existent, no one cares about the school, people only use it to get thier GPA up before they transfer out. they college experience in itself is genuinly disregarded and non-existent. this is coming from a GRU orientation leader and you know were supposed to love the school. the i get closer to the school the more i hate it."
College Sophomore,2,not worth what you will pay.
College Sophomore,2,"you 21? you got a fake? are you greek? if you dont fall into any of those categories, have fun sitting in your dormroom with your bottle of burnettes and crying by yourself."
College Sophomore,2,all they care about is basketball? im sorry i thought this was america and in college we play football. no one goes to the game despite the school trying everything to get students to go.
College Freshman,2,With nothing to actually do students have adapted drinking and throwing kickbacks in the living areas.
College Freshman,2,The weather has been horrible. When it rains everything floods. Lately it's been bad winter weather.
College Student,2,Though I'd rather not attend the 'Nightlife' I feel like it would be gross and not a thing I would personally like to do.
College Student,2,I wish they could offer up more scholarships and grants rather than loans.
College Freshman,2,"Parking costs are a bit much, hard to find parking"
College Junior,2,"The parking is okay to a certain factor, such as the time of day in which most classes are starting or letting out students. It pays to find parking an hour early. "
College Junior,2,"The general area is peaceful and serene. The atmosphere isn't moody nor is it loud and noisy. General events may occur on campus pertaining to midterm, prevention awareness or support groups(alcoholic, abusive, cancer, etc.), sometimes even rare visits from celebs."
College Junior,2,"The campus shuttle bus usually takes 30 minutes to make it to each stop. There are two shuttle stops on campus, one at ASU dorms, and another in front of Christenberry Fieldhouse."
College Junior,2,One of my favorite experiences is the Pig Out event that happens usually twice a year. It comprises of BBQ and entertainment by the fraternity and sorority groups of Augusta State (now GRU).
College Junior,2,"Meal Plans can cost up to $140 to $1000 dollars. The main campus has five snack spots, one of them being Starbucks. All this is located within the JSAC (Jaguar Student Activity Center)."
College Junior,2,"The Augusta campus doesn't have any main gates that bar it off from the outside or anything. Most of the campus is surrounded by old time Civil War brick walls to maintain the campus' authenticity of history. Campus crime is generally low. Since the campus is merged with a major hospital in Augusta (GHSU), one of the special security measures the campus provides is handling pan epidemic influenza. Overall, the college has no major problems. "
College Sophomore,2,"Two ""cafeterias"". Good for school size but pathetic."
College Sophomore,2,Out of all the topics listed I would have to say that registration can be a bit confusing especially during orientation. I had no advisement on how to set up my classes for success and because of this I may end up being in school a little longer than I anticipated.
College Junior,2,It's georgia weather..what can I say...if hot and sticky isn't your thing...go North..I am
College Sophomore,2,You have to live in UV for people to know or associate with you.
College Freshman,2,"The Augusta area does not have the college feeling on or off campus. I am used to being around large colleges like USF in Tampa, Fl. So when i came to ASU it was a reality check for me. Not many places around to socialize or meet new people. The library on campus hours are not flexible during the times you need (for people that work until 5 PM). Augusta is a small city with not that much culture in the area. If i could choose another school to go to i would but there are not many options in this area."
College Freshman,2,not many options in the augusta area for apartment living to be around college students. There are many places that are not the best to live at around the augusta area which makes trying to find an off campus living situation hard for students coming from out of the area.
College Freshman,2,Augusta is hidden and it takes a while to really explore what the area has to offer. going to school at Augusta state university has been an experience but sometimes there isn't much to do here.
College Junior,2,"Campus activities end pretty early, usually around 4:30 or 5:00. Usually if there is a late night event, it is hosted in the student activities center ballroom, or in the performing arts center, there are also sports events that you can attend at Christianberry Fieldhouse, but there is no alcohol involved at any on campus event. Transportation is provided with Augusta State's shuttle buses. Off-campus there are bars and nightclubs around downtown Augusta, about 10-15 minutes from campus"
College Junior,2,"There seems to be many different races and religions at ASU but it is poredominately white. Coming from a HBCU it was kind of a culture shock for me. Although there are many different ethnic groups at my old university, it seems that it was accepted more to be different. At ASU i sometimes feel like an outcast."
College Senior,2,"Even with the addition of two new parking lots, it is still quite complicated to find parking places due to the large amount of students each semester."
College Junior,2,I haven't really seen many places out here then again i dont go out either
College Freshman,2,"Greek life isn't very dominant at ASU, soon to be GRU. There are fraternities and sororities around and they have their events but not too many people are really active in it."
College Junior,2,Most just go to the bars downtown.  It gets old quite quickly.
College Sophomore,2,"They're mostly annoying, and all I ever here from them is written on the sidewalk with chalk. Sometimes I see them dancing to loud music in the student center. Greek life isn't big at ASU anyway."
College Freshman,2,Night life is pretty average there is always a party around but it is usually far but there is really nothing else to do.
College Freshman,2,Augusta State is not very diverse most of the people went to high school in the same region making it more like a community college. But other than that there are many different group of people and everyone gets along very well
College Senior,2,"Not Many Locations That Are Close to the School – You can't walk to any restaurants from campus. The housing facility is closer to restaurants than the school is, but students usually have a car if they go out."
College Senior,2,"Safe on Campus, but I Wouldn't Go Out at Night. Campus security is always patrolling the campus, so you feel very safe while you're at school.  The neighborhood surrounding the school has its questionable areas, however.  Just be careful if you are out at night, especially if you are a female."
College Senior,2,"I Call the ASU Housing Off-Campus Because It Is Far from Campus – The ASU ""off-campus"" housing is pretty expensive and seems to always be packed.  The real off-campus housing in the areas surrounding the college vary in price and type.  I live in a 3 bedroom home for $800/month, but I am also married.  Apartments here are expensive and not worth it to me because I like space and privacy.  The homes are okay, but tend to be older."
College Sophomore,2,"Not the Greatest – Augusta State does not offer dorms, but offers Apartments. The apartments are located in a less than safe part of down, and are not in the nicest conditions. The price does not seem worth what you are getting, and there is little to know say in who you room with."
College Junior,2,"A lot of the buildings could use renovation, which I think the school is working on at the moment.  On campus housing is good for about 500 students.  I live off campus about 5 minutes away and I'd rather pay a little extra to do so."
College Freshman,2,The Financial aid process is long. Alot of  people get little to aid and have to work in order to cover tuition.  I received nothing at all.
College Freshman,2,Major Headache – Parking on Campus may be a headache at times. If you do not make it on campus by a certain time you will have to park on nearby streets.
College Freshman,2,There are hardly any parties and most of the people on campus just drink in their housing or go to bars.
College Sophomore,2,"Network Reliability? Not Really – Unfortunately, getting internet access through one's own computer can be difficult. There is a wireless network access; however, one often finds oneself unexpectedly without internet access despite having been connected only minutes prior."
College Junior,2,"Amusing and Frustrating – Augusta State is a commuter campus.  With that in mind, one would think that providing suffient nearby parking would be a priority.  It is not.  Provided a student can get to campus before 8am they will find a parking space.  Peek at the parking lot anytime after 8am and find the most amusing mix of parking lot vultures and road ragers trapped in their vehicles.  Amusing, as long as you aren't stuck in the middle looking for a spot as well."
College Junior,2,"It's Just Like High School – Considering the fact that most ASU students come from the Augusta area, everybody knows each other. You are constantly surrounded by the same dweebs and preps you were in high school. A lot of girls wear heels to class everyday. Every. Day. Because that's what college is for--attempting to look better than everyone else!"
Sophomore,1,The whole vibe of the campus is negative and depressing. The professors and staff are so afraid of the administration and getting fired that they are afraid to try new things or help the students. Even most of the students kinda search for the negative in everything instead of  any positive. It is just a depressing place.
Freshman,1,"I would give this school zero stars if I could. This school is a complete joke. They make you pay for every single thing imaginable and more. They don’t give a shit about you, all they care about is money. It’s absolutely disgusting."
Alum,1,"10 years later, still a thorn in my side. The administration is still a total nightmare. Every step in every process is made as difficult as possible. Attended (2005-2007) no classes related to my degree.  Did 8 years army and going back to school. But in 2014, AU made up a $1600 charge and held my transcripts ransom. 0 notification until this fall when applying for another school. Tried to dispute: If they say you owe it, you owe it.  Business office... ONLY TAKES CASH. to pay credit, had to go to website, doesn't tell how much you owe. Called to find out, on hold 45 mins. then website doesn't take AMEX.  After fighting with the transcript request, I finally got them, sent them to Augusta Tech, WGU, and Uof Phoenix. After all of that, ZERO credits were transferable to any of those schools."
Freshman,1,"Well, if you like to smoke pot, this place is for you. It smells like weed in Freshman housing, just smelled it again today walking through 4th floor Oak Hall (May 4, 2018)...it’s everywhere. If you’re serious about keeping good grades and are a good student, as well as keeping law for that matter (pot is illegal in GA) this is not a school for you. Honors students get squelched. Also, I wouldn’t feed Atrium food to my dog. It causes illness every time so it’s avoided to the hilt. Commuter school for sure; majority of the student body clearly doesn’t want to be there. Housing administrators give a whole lot of lip service with little action to actually solve issues. Do yourself a favor, pay a little extra for a better experience elsewhere."
College Freshman,1,The Faculty is just disappointing and fail to see student needs. I have lived in Georgia for nearly 11 years and the school is trying to say I am an out of state resident who cannot get a scholarship that will severely decrease the amount of money i will need to pay for school. They have had the documents needed to fix the issue for several weeks and have yet to do so.
College Junior,1,The campus housing is something you should only experience for a year. It is very pricey considering what they have to offer. Getting a room for the next year could be compared to the Hunger Games. Most people live here for one year and then decide to get an apartment in town.
College Sophomore,1,Its a joke at my school. No one joins and we barely have any.
College Sophomore,1,pretty sure ive already answered this question
College Sophomore,1,"you have all of 2 choices, you can drive dowtown to the medical campus and get wierd stares by the grad students, or you can eat in the JSAC. neither of which is cost effective or diverse"
College Sophomore,1,"As a person who joined a sorority while attending another university, I'd have to say that the greek life at GRU is sad."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is HORRIFYING here. if your classes start after 10am, you're out of luck basically"
College Freshman,1,I don't really know about the sorority 
College Junior,1,"The food is expensive and not very good. The quality is poor, but the staff is very friendly and helpful"
College Junior,1,There is not much for students to do unless there is a campus inspired event or they are twenty one
College Junior,1,There are over 7000 people on this campus with about 1/3 that many spots available.  We need additional parking and/or a parking garage on campus.  It shouldn't take 40 minutes of riding around campus to find a spot.
College Freshman,1,"Augusta is the second largest city in Georgia.  However, it's a very small city with little attractions and businesses within it's proximity.  The public transportation service is awful.  The restaurants and shopping centers bring this city to life along with the world famous golf tournament,""The Masters"".  "
College Freshman,1,"Umm, if you get caught for underage drinking you can get in some big trouble.  If you live in the University housing, you can get kicked out if you let your grades slip or get pregnant. No parties are allowed in school housing either."
College Sophomore,1,The parking at Augusta State University is absolutely a hassle! Waking up extra early to get a good parking spot is an inconvenience.  There are several parking spaces around the campus yet there is not enough.
College Freshman,1,"Off-campus housing at Augusta State isn't convenient for students at all. A majority of the students commute over twenty minutes to campus, and the housing the institution provides is scarce and over expensive."
College Sophomore,1,Stay Away – Stay away from the Financial Aid and Business offices.

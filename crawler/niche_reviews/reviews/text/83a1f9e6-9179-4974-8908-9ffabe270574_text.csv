Sophomore,5,I made good friends and good relationships with my profesors. Maybe is not the best college but is the best to begin when someone is from another country.
Sophomore,5,St Augustine is like a good school has calculated who is willing to help the student. All the students can go and ask the professor any question and he/she would answer it for you. The campus is always clean and you would never see anything that is out of place. They’re are alt of people from different ages and back grounds who attend.
Junior,5,"St. Augustine College is a bilingual college in the Midwest. As a current and returning student I have nothing for praise for this school. The teaches will work with you, and both faculty and staff want to see you succeed. Here at St. Augustine College you are more than just a number in the system."
Junior,5,I love the professors in st. Augustine college the help in so many way with your papers the tutors are flexible as well
Senior,5,"I really love this college, the people and teacher are really good and they make this collage like a big family that work together. Other think is that the staff at the collage are always for the students for example, if you want to talk with your advisor they are always for you. You do not have to wait a lot for the interview like happen in other collage. The quality of the classes is really good, the teachers are really prepared and organize in their subject and they know how to do a class. Something that I would like to change for the collage is the point that they have some bachelor programs but they just have associate degree for computer information system, I would like to see this collage grow up and make the bachelor degree for this profession"
Junior,5,"Starting college can be quite a challenge and yet stressful specially if you are the first one in the family to attend college. As I look back to my college experience I've come across so any things I could've done better. Someone to guide you through and help you make the right choices. But being the first one means making mistakes and learning from them. My parents never finished grammar school and they've never been the type of parents to support and guide you through rough and stressful times. But let me tell you, registering for St. Augustine College, was by far the best choice I've made on my career. Not only do they focus on you, by having small classes, but they treat you like family. They are very flexible with schedules, instructors are very helpful and will guide you through every step. Its not only a college, but they treat you like family!! I truthfully feel welcomed!"
College Senior,5,I love the way the new President of the campus has current students and alumni networking.
College Senior,5,I would choose my school again because it is small the faculty and staff know you by first name.  It is more personal.
College Junior,5,I was able to talk freely with my teachers and counselor. If someone didn't have a response to my questions they directed me in the correct direction.
College Student,5,"I am a social work major and so far my classes are going great. They all help me to open my mind to many subjects, they keep me thinking. The teachers are great, they let me to speak my mind and they keep asking me questions to push my mind forward."
College Freshman,5,"Saint Augustine College has a program called the Gateway program.This program allows older people who's been out of school for over 10 years,an opportunity to have a fresh start.It also allows them to graduated early with the information they need to start they're career."
College Sophomore,5,the library is great when it comes to resources it has everything your looking for. the school tries to provide activites that students can get involved in so they are have something to do in their free time.
College Junior,5,"Grad School Bound – A lot of the students from the Gateway program go on to grad school.  Even a few of the graduates from the Gateway program are professors of the program.  Some of those professors are enrolled in getting their PhD's.  As a student of the Gateway program, I too have plans to go to grad school so I can get my masters in education and once graduating from then I plan to enroll into law school."
Freshman,4,"St Augustine College offers study advantages to people who can not speak English. Hispanics can take classes in Spanish while they learn English. It also has very good teachers and staff in general. However, I think that it should offer more opportunities for scholarships and work to international students."
College Senior,4,It is a church oriented campus many students are very kind.  Also the staff.
College Senior,4,"I have had good experience with the campus, classes/curriculum."
College Senior,4,I have learned office work and also office attire.
College Senior,4,I really love the way the faculty put their time in to instruct and teach us.
College Senior,4,I have learned office work ability here at campus working in workstudy.
College Freshman,4,the value of a degree at this school is high because most students go to good graduate schools or get jobs.
College Junior,4,"The student body is diverse in sexuality and ethnicity. Politics, religion, and economic status aren't discussed. There is few interaction outside of the class."
College Student,4,"I learned a lot through this semester, they make sure you remember what you learn through the course. The teachers would even make sure to solve any questions."
College Student,4,"They are very helpful, and try to make sure that you are both in the same page. In addition, they are well-informed with everything."
College Freshman,4,"there are many resources that Saint Augustine's provides for study, including many sports and clubs to keep the students active"

College Senior,4,This school is a pioneer in bilingualism. They offer classes in both the english and spanish language.
College Senior,4,"The post-grad services are great. The transfer and career center offers a great deal of help by offering information on scholarships, job openings and events."
College Senior,4,The network for the most part is very reliable. The computer network is always running fine with good speed.
College Freshman,4,College Life – Saint Augustine is great. I come from a small rural high school that lacked academic discipline. Saint Augustine decided to take a risk and give me a chance to prove I could meet the challenges of college.
College Junior,4,"Classroom Enviroment – Attending Saint Augustine's College, classroom are small and you get that one-to-one learning."
College Junior,4,My School Focuse a Great Deal in the Community and Students – They partner with non-profits and community oganizations to make the communities better. Recruiting is out standing and they work hard to get you in school.
College Junior,4,"I Like My School,It's Close to School – before st-Augustine's I didn't have algebra yet my professor made it easy to learn. Small class,convenant and close to home.Yes I would choose my school again."
College Junior,4,"Very Diverse – Well, we have the traditional students and then we have the Gateway students (The adults).  Sometimes we do have classes with the traditional students but it is very rare.  The Gateway students do have their own campus and sometimes would have to go on to the main campus to take a class.  I will say that sometimes having traditional student in our classroom can be refreshing because it is interesting to hear how they think about certain situations and how they would apply it to their life.  And I'm sure that they are getting something from our experiences too."
College Freshman,2,you take the classes when they schedule them this is only like one class a semester
College Freshman,2,the overall experience has been terrible and im going to transfer form this school
College Freshman,2,The tuition at the school is way to high. they dont make improvements to the school so i dont know where my money is going into. financial aid loses your stuff and are hard to contact. they make it so hard to complete the college process.
College Freshman,2,the school is so small that most of the time there is only one teacher for a class or you can only take the class at a certain time. the registration process is really bad you are registering for hours.
College Sophomore,2,"What to Expect – Have not really gotten into the major classes so far, but overall the classes are great"
College Junior,2,"High Tuition – Tuition is to high for what I'm receiving.  I get some financial aid but my mom and I both have to get loans every semester to help cover the expenses.  The cost of books are extremely high, even used books. The financial aid office is slow with the paper work. They need to be more organized and make the process faster."
Senior,1,"St.Augustine college has great staff and professors, but favoritism with certain departments is very apparent. Rates go up and counseled do not inform the students of do,hoping they will oversee it, which a lot do."
College Freshman,1,"the libraries have limited computers, there are no activites on campus and the weight room is falling apart"
College Junior,1,There isn't a way to make memories i this school there are no activites
College Junior,1,the library is very far from me. there are no activities or clubs.
College Sophomore,1,"I am getting a good education, but the process is a hassel! The fees are outrageous and some things i pay for i never see! many of my friends pay less and get so much more! I also dont have many options."

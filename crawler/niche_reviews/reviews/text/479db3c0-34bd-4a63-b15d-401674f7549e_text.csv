Alum,5,I had a great experience at Western Illinois. I found the Professors to be knowledgeable and always willing to help. The facilities were very nice and up to date. Macomb is a nice town and its a nice way to spend 4 years.
Alum,5,WIU has given me a great education that I would love to do all over again if I could. The Law Enforcement and Justice Administration (LEJA) department is second to none. It has pride itself in being one of the best criminal justice programs in the nation. My LEJA degree has given me an edge over my fellow co-workers. As a police officer WIU has prepared me to excel in this career.
Alum,5,"I love Western Illinois University, I had a great 4 years there playing softball and am going back for one more year to earn a second bachelors degree. I would love to see a few new restaurants and businesses open up there just for more options for us."
Alum,5,I did take classes online at Western and they went pretty well. My professors were very helpful guiding us through the process.
Sophomore,5,Online classes at Western Illinois University are very good. These classes are very smooth to roll into and learn at your own pace.
Sophomore,5,Western Illinois University is an amazing university. The Quad Cities campus lacks the college experience but other than that it is excellent. The staff and professors are very helpful. And overall it is a great place to learn.
Niche User,5,This college is perfect for me. The staff are so nice and the food is great. The fields are beautiful and it's nice being surrounded by people who know what they are talking about.
Alum,5,"At Western Illinois University, I liked the different halls that the campus had to offer. Each hall was beneficial to the students academic needs and had a variety of events the students can attend.  Furthermore, I liked the security that was offered on campus because it makes the students feel safe at all times of the day. A change would be the restaurants that's on campus."
Sophomore,5,"All the professors want to do is help you learn, for the most part. There are a couple professors that don't have that goal, but for the most part the professors are great. The class sizes are small, so there is more individual help available. WIU has made my study experience great since I transferred here."
Freshman,5,Great environment to be in. Everyone is very welcoming and nice. The professors & other students care about helping out as much as possible and making sure things are maintained in a nice order.
Freshman,5,"When I visited this university for my college visit and then SOAR, I immediately knew I could call this place home. Amazing atmosphere, plenty of resources, and caring staff."
Sophomore,5,"i love college. the food in the dining halls could be better though. i really enjoy campus life and i am getting to be very involved in clubs and organizations. some of the teachers could be a lot better but some are very good and I am learning so much. i have made a lot of new friends and was so sad when my first year was done. the dorms need improvement. the showers and the toilets are all broken. the water pressure is very poor. i dislike that every single person gets fined for one person does. my floor was fined about a thousand dollars because people smeared blood on the walls, that was the stupidest thing ever. overall, i love western and can not wait to go back in three months."
Freshman,5,WIU provides everything you want from a university in a small town setting. The Law Enforcement program is top notch and makes me see a diverse future in the field.
Alum,5,"Western was the best! With the exception of the gen ed science classes with big lecture halls, the class sizes were pretty small. Lots of opportunity for campus involvement. It's a small little town with no frills but it felt like home."
Alum,5,"Western Illinois University is a professional, friendly, and helpful institution that works with students to provide the education that they need whether it be online, campus, or hybrid."
Niche User,5,The best school I ever attended. Everything about it is the best thing you could ask for. The academics here are really good and throw gods parties too!
Freshman,5,"Overall, Western is a great school in all shapes and forms. Although I have decided it is not the school for me, I will still always recommend it. The campus is large, but still small enough to get you to class on time. The sizes of the classrooms are just perfect. Athletics are a huge part of Western, and they do a great job at promoting the different sports, all of them. The only downfall to WIU is the location, there just is not enough to do in Macomb for college students to fully enjoy."
Senior,5,Western Illinois University has encouraged me to be more culturally competent and the drive to pursue my passions in my field.
Junior,5,I like everything about the school. The teachers and advisors really want their students to succeed. The alumni of the school want the students to succed as well so they help the teachers prepare the students for life outside of school in their professions
Senior,5,Overall my experience at Western has been a good one. My brother had recently graduated with a Bachelor's in business. The environment and campus is very laid back and friendly.
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful University! The Staff is beyond excellent, the students are welcoming as well as helpful. There are over 200 organizations on campus, and the student life is awesome as well! Academics are taken very seriously, and with small class sizes, more specialized attention is given to students."
Niche User,5,"It has a nice campus, people are great, and it feels homey, plus my sister is there so I will not be alone. It has my program that I would love to be in and it is third or fourth in the university overall."
Senior,5,Great staff and great friends. The teachers where there to help when need be. If I needed to miss class for work they worked with my schedule. They helped me keep my grades on track and keep up.
Sophomore,5,"It’s a fun experience. The classes are really cool. The teachers and advisors really want to help you succeed. I recommend getting in a study group of people from your class or even making a few friends from classes to help study for exams. The people in your major are like your family, you spend most of your time with these people in class"
Junior,5,"I am a distance learning student. All of my courses are online, I love the flexibility it gives me.  The only down side is that not all areas that I am interested in are online."
Senior,5,"I enjoy being a student at WIU because I am considered a non-traditional student and there are several of us that are older, work, have families etc. The professors are very helpful and knowledgable. They want us to succeed and do well and will help us in any way possible. The campus is a beautiful campus and over looks the Mississippi River which is neat to be in class and watch the eagles fly over the river. There is food catered in for lunch but I haven't ever taken advantage of that I pack my own or go home for lunch. The housing for students is apartment rentals just across the parking lot so you can walk to class. There are numerous activities and clubs a student can get involved in."
Junior,5,"Western feels just like home! Macomb has a small town feel, and the University provides tons of opportunities for students to get involved on campus!"
Graduate Student,5,"This is an amazing institution where professors, faculty, and your peers want you to succeed. I love the fact that my tuition remains the same for all four years."
Sophomore,5,Overall WIU offers a lot of opportunities and help to the students . It very safe and has many safety precautions for all students and faculty. The student life is good it’s a lot of active groups to get involved in.
Niche User,5,I love it here! Everyone is welcoming and nice. The place is best to relax and it’s easy to get around campus!
Graduate Student,5,"I received my bachelor's degree in Music Education at WIU in 2014, and was able to find a job as a school band director well in advance of the following school year. When I decided it was time to return for graduate school, WIU was at the top of my list. The opportunities the music provides are numerous and invaluable. The professors really work towards trying to prepare their students for successful music careers, and demand excellence in order to do so."
Sophomore,5,I love how Western has let me spread my wings and get involved. I learned so much pertaining to my major already and I feel that thanks to Western I'll be ready to enter my career field.
Sophomore,5,Western Illinois University is a very productive campus you will never go with out having something fun and interesting to do. Although they should fund more black organizations on campus. But they experience you will have will be great it just takes time to adjust.
Alum,5,The faculty are outstanding and will go above and bond to help out reach your goals!!!! Plus good personal relationships.
Senior,5,"I transferred to WIU from a community college my junior year.  The transition went smooth due to friendly/helpful staff and the opportunity to meet with other transfer students.
The campus is easy to navigate and there are plenty of activities/clubs to help students have fun while gaining an education.
The professors genuinely care about the students’ education and do everything they can to help them succeed.
WIU is also a big supporter of our military, which is always a plus in my book.
If students need a break from campus, the square downtown is only a few minutes away.  It has restaurants and shops unique only to Macomb.  There are also popular bars, such as The Change of Pace,The Ritz, and The Forum.
If you are looking for something involving the outdoors, Spring Lake is the place to be.  Only 15 minutes from campus, it provides beautiful scenery, places to fish, and several hiking trails to explore.
Overall, WIU is a great school to attend."
Niche User,5,during my visit to western Illinois i was treated well and giving a great tour of some of the schools finest areas. The tour guides were very respectful.
Senior,5,"I enjoy attending classes at Western Illinois University. The class sizes are smaller than much larger universities. The professors are very knowledgeable, friendly, and very helpful. Students are friendly. My courses so far are challenging but not overwhelmingly difficult. When I need help, there's tutoring labs, and the instructors have regular office hours."
Junior,5,"Western Illinois University challenges its students to achieve the best academic career. The school allows for students to attend in two different cities, allowing for a more nontraditional education. I myself am attending while living at home and working two jobs. I would not be able to do this and afford my education without the duel campus opportunity that Western provides."
Freshman,5,"Good school, though has a lot of safety concerns with students who do not exhibit college behavior. The school is losing numbers and needs to be more open to student option on campus without growing a lot of problems under the bus. The buildings are good and the food is average. Professors care and the LEJA majors have all the classes they need."
Niche User,5,Very good university. Affordable to attend. Not much of a party school. It's located in a small town. People are very nice
Freshman,5,"I love the campus size and all of the professors are nice and are ready to help when needed. The food is dangerously good, so be sure to pace yourself and don't become a victim to the freshman fifteen! The dorms are very clean and nice, rooms are on the small side but they get cleaned every week day. Overall a great college!"
Freshman,5,"Western Illinois university have excellent academic and the professors are very helpful and you can come to them when you are lost or struggling to understand the assignments. The Campus is small which is comfortable and good to have a close space to get to  know everyone and meet know people better. My experience with western is new but so far I like how this university gave me a better experience to come out my comfort zone plus its many organizations,clubs, etc .. So western is a good choice if you wanna experience that comfort and independent life"
Sophomore,5,I am current student at WIU and I love it. The school has awesome professors and they truly seem to enjoy their job and helping students. Also the diversity is amazing there are people from all walks of life and everyone is really friendly and amazing

Sophomore,5,"Great campus, super friendly, great environment. I absolutely love attending this university and will recommend."
Sophomore,5,"Western is an awesome school to go to, like every other college it has its flaws. WIU  is extremely diverse, and everyone is super friendly and helpful. I will be a sophmore at WIU this fall so, I haven't experienced all that I can yet. The professors are pretty cool, dorms are average, and there are plenty of resources on campus as well that tend to be really helpful."
Niche User,5,"Great communication to incoming students and fantastic campus. I would recommend the university to many students, especially local ones."
Freshman,5,Well as a student in WIU. I love how the environment is so quiet. I like this because I can enjoy the scenery and enjoy campus life with my fellow peers. Throughout Western I made many friendships and met so many people here at school. It is very hard for me since I'm Hispanic but by me coming here I realized that nothing is impossible. Western always gives me a chance for me to be myself and to always be the best student I can ever be. I always appreciate Western and the supporting staff they have.
Freshman,5,My experience at Western Illinois University has been amazing do far. I am in my second semesetr of my freshman year. The campus is beautiful and I feel safe wherever I go. I am also etting a quality education and geting the beneficial help from professors and advisors.

Freshman,5,I enjoy my time here. The people here are nice and helpful. There's a lot of organizations you can join. It's a small town and the campus bus takes u everywhere.
Junior,5,"What I like about Western Illinois is all the campus buildings are all close together. When I was looking at different colleges, for example University of Iowa, I did not like that the campus buildings were not walking distances. With the buildings being so close together I am able to go to the food court, gym, or library and not worry about being late to my next class. Also I recommend trying Dividends in Stipes building. Their coffee and walking tacos are amazing! The professors their are very helpful. They have helped me whenever I come to their office for help, even if it takes an hour or two, and they also provide tutors on campus."
Freshman,5,"It's a really great school and a beauitful campus. The staff are all very nice and ready to help any student whenever they feel like they are falling behind. Any help need, academic or personal, is right at the students finger tips and a warm staff to welcome everyone."
Junior,5,So far I have really enjoyed my time here at Western. The only thing I do not like is the Macomb area.
Sophomore,5,I have had an amazing experience here at Western Illinois University. The environment is encouraging and helpful. Each professor truly wants you to succeed and do well. I decided to join a sorority here and having that experience has changed my life and I would have never been able to do that without the opportunities Western Illinois has given me. 
Alum,4,I took a few classes online and they were for the most part well done. I learned just about as much as I did during in person classes. I would recommend them.
Senior,4,Ive never token an online class. I am a law enforcement student for most of our work is done in class and is very hands on. Meaning we rarely have assignments online because we’re learning to work in a partnered environment.
Freshman,4,I'm Looking forward to my education learning experience with Western Illinois University in the Fall of 2020!
Freshman,4,"I loved the process of enrolling into Western Illinois University and the information that they provided about housing, tuition, education, and social interacting. I'm looking forward to the Western Illinois experience in Fall 2020!"
Sophomore,4,The professors are very dedicated at Western. They really want to see the students do well. All of the faculty work overtime to make sure that the students get a quality education.
Sophomore,4,The faculty are very nice and are dedicated to teaching. Some of the facilities are outdated and I believe they could offer better resources for scholarships.
Alum,4,WIU makes it very convenient for the working professional to get a degree while still working full time outside of school.
Freshman,4,"At Western IL you would immediately feel at home as it's peaceful and everything you would want in the school. Easy to get around and it's a big school, but not to big. Only thing I think they could improve on is activities."
Junior,4,What I like about WIU is the fact they actually care about you and your future. The campus is actually gorgeous and I love that the class size isn't huge. As far as living on campus they should try better food options and better cleaning.
Alum,4,"Western Illinois University (WIU) is well known for its Law Enforcement program. In 2012 the WIU expanded Law Enforcement to work with the chemistry department. This made the Forensic Chemistry program available. Forensic chemistry is great because it combines law enforcement, chemistry, biology, and math.
The ecology program is also very good due to its professors and location. The main campus is about two hours south of the Quad Cities between Iowa and Illinois. This location in Central Illinois allows for a variety of ecology to be studied. 
 My biochemistry professor took me under his wing and gave excellent career advice. My toxicology professor worked in a crime lab in Minnesota and has awesome stories to tell. If you make an effort to get to know your professors at WIU and tell them what you want for a career they will be your greatest allies."
Freshman,4,"Unlike other schools that promote diversity and are actually predominantly white, this school is actually diverse.  I've had a great experience with the staff and the people I go to class with. There's an abundance of activities overall."
Alum,4,"Western Illinois University is a small campus, but with that I was able to meet so many great people. Class sizes were smaller so you could get to know your professors and classmates more. Making it personable."
Freshman,4,"Western Illinois is a great school with amazing hands-on and understanding teachers! (For the most part) No school is perfect, but personally I enjoy Western Illinois University and I am grateful for the opportunity to be there!"
Niche User,4,from every thing i seen about western illionis its a nice college nice campus the basketball team is good the coaches  are nice the area is not too much but not quite at the same time i love the college colors and the people are from all over the diversity is great many differnt races and personalites
Junior,4,"Western is a great Mid-sized university that offers multiple programs of study. I study on the Quad Cities campus. The atmosphere there is nice and the smaller campus size is definitely nice. I will say that I haven't had the best of luck with their academic advisors, and that I have had issues with staying on track. However, buy and large this is a great education at a cheaper cost than most universities. Check it out!"
Junior,4,I like the activities and the student life that’s offered to us. Western is in a rural area but us students on the campus always figure out something to keep us occupied. I love how everyone was a big family.
Niche User,4,"Western Illinois University is a mix of all people coming together in the community, working and studying in this good environment. The surroundings of this school is amazing with bus transportation and friendly faces from the professors and students."
Freshman,4,WIU is a medium sized school with so many things to do instead of stay in your room all day. The campus makes it a mission to put on all types of events that range from casino night to art galleries and music fests
Junior,4,"What i would like to see changed is a better use of the budget that the state of Illinois gives us and updates on dorming and wifi, overall the staff are very warm and inviting on campus and always willing to help."
Senior,4,"Overall, These past 4 years at WIU have been great for the most part. I have learned so much and it has helped me come out of my shell.  I will say that WIU is not for those who like the hustle and bustle. The school is in Macomb, IL. There is not much that goes on here and there aren't any malls. Students make the most out of it and if you want different food option, you can drive to Peoria, Galesburg and other places that are all a little over an hour away."
Niche User,4,I’ve visited Western Illinois University multiple times this past year. I have grown to love the atmosphere of the campus and the community surrounding the school. I wished they would have promoted the school to a wider area so it was more well known. I feel it would have made my college search experience as well as many other peoples’ search way easier to know that such a diverse yet familiar school was available to them.
Sophomore,4,WIU definitely needs to invest in more parking at the dorms. Overall I love Western and all the opportunities I’ve been given in my time here.
Alum,4,The gym had a good college campus community. It had good facilities. It had good and reliable public transportation systems. Most teachers were passionate about their subject and the students they taught
Niche User,4,"I really liked the rec. area, It was a very nice university but if I were to change anything I would make sure to schedule college visit days on days that the athletic program ca speak to the students."
Freshman,4,I love the campus and my professors are all very good! I would like to see better residence halls for freshman.
Freshman,4,Western Illinois University is a really diverse schools and is very military friendly. Being in the National guard I have been able to manage both lifestyles very smoothly. The staff and students always ready to help you in anything you need. The transition into being a new student is smooth and friendly.
Junior,4,I really enjoy Western Illinois University especially the teachers because they want you to be able to be successful in their class.
Sophomore,4,"It's peaceful, with challenges and experiences. I love my organizations such as Cultural Expression, which is a poetic group. I'm also in BMAN (Black Male Achievement Network). Those are my main ones that I'm currently in and as far as being here on campus, it;'s much to unconventional and get into to learn, acquire skills, and be around my true friends who's willing to help build each other up into better people of tomorrow!"
Sophomore,4,"WIU is a fantastic school. It's safe, diverse, and the professors are great. Unfortunately, Illinois is going through a budget crisis, and so aid can be limited. However, they do lock in your tuition rates for your time there, and so fluctuating costs is not something to worry about. The food is decent, and from what I know, the party life is good. Just if you're underaged, be careful, because there are four police entities on campus."
Freshman,4,"I've only been here for a year, but my experience was pretty great. I met a lot of new people and it was very different than high school. The only thing I wish could be changed is the food. There should be a wider variety of choices, as well as healthier choices. Overall, I think it's a pretty good school."
Freshman,4,"Here at Western Illinois University I have met a variety of new people. I love the diversity at this school, and the class sizes are small. The teachers are willing to work with you if you are struggling. Their main goal is to see that each student makes it pass their course."
Senior,4,I think Western Illinois is a great University. It is in a small town but honestly it was great for me because I’m not a fan of living in a city. It felt like home. Of course the classes were amazing! The professors I had were great and always helpful. Class sizes were a good size therefore I got the chance to talk to my professors when I needed help.
Freshman,4,"I like how well the entire faculty works to keep the campus safe. everyone wants to see the students succeed, and the resources available are so helpful."
Junior,4,"Western Illinois University is an affordable college in the Midwest region. There are plenty of fun activities to do on campus such as joining intramurals, Greek life, or video game clubs. There is a club here for everyone and the environment is very peaceful."
Junior,4,"What I like about Western Illinois University is that the campus is very nice and clean, the professors are kind for the most part, and you just get a very safe feeling being on campus. There is much diversity on campus, and most of the students are very friendly."
Senior,4,This is a great campus! Plenty of diversity! Everyone is welcome. I would love to see more student organizations like the Macomb campus has.
Niche User,4,I went to visit western with a friend that now goes there. He showed me around and we did fun things and I would like to go back.
Sophomore,4,"School is full of activities and there's plenty to do, however students are not as involved as they should be."
Senior,4,"The faculty and staff here are great! I feel that I will be very well prepared for what the future has is store after graduation. Being able to work with and study alongside great students and professors here at WIU, has been an experience that I won't forget."
Freshman,4,"I go to the satellite campus in Moline, Illinois and the class sizes are quite small. I think this semester the most I had in one of my classes was 20. The faculty and staff is very friendly. The campus was completely redone a couple years ago and it is so pretty. There are study rooms in the library which are great. There is also a lot of resources including a writing center. This campus is right along the river and it's very pretty."
Junior,4,I would like to see more involvement in helping students achieve and support. I like how challenging it is to be in Western
Freshman,4,"My first semester at Western Illinois was absolutely the best experience I ever Had. It was very different because I’m from a big city where you can go outside and see a lot of people and may not even noticed you seen them the next day. In Macomb, it’s a small town so you pretty much see all the same people plus their very kind hearted. The campus is very beautiful and the mascot “Rocky” is everywhere. The teacher are very helpful and there’s many resources  all around. The food on campus is very tasty and there’s a couple of good restaurants around campus that serve great foods . The parties are always fun and there’s always activities inside the residence halls for anybody that’s not going out or looking for any fun inside. I love Western and you would too !"
Freshman,4,"I would Like to see more diversity within the girls basketball team. There are many great aspects of this school, especially with academic resources and tutor sessions."
Senior,4,"I like the overall environment of WIU, there are a couple things I would change not academic wise but campus wise."
Junior,4,"Good place for an education. Affordable and still an accredited university. The food in the dining halls isn't the best, but edible. The union is a good place for other food options during the week."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at WIU has been satisfactory. I love how everyone is so connected around the campus which has made my experience even more enjoyable. However, if I would change anything it would be the dorms and the security of the campus."
Sophomore,4,I loved the diversity and the school spirit. I did not like the roommate matching systems. I did not get along with my roommate. I loved the food but it could be better and a little bit  more healthier.
Sophomore,4,I liked that western have free tutor resources for students that are struggling with classes or students that need more help taking test. Western have amazing programs and have excellent professors that will do anything to encourage their students to succeed. I would like western to change their food menu to more healthier choices for students.
Junior,4,"Western Illinois is a school of excellence in terms of campus life and social environment. However, this school is strictly set on teaching yourself how to learn. If your are innovative and interested in a certain major that they provide then I give this 5 stars. If you are majoring in a subject that they really don't provide but give a few classes for, then you are going to struggle because they try to put you in a major that is ""close enough"" to  the major you want and your abilities will be challenged in learning things all over from the start. I give this college 3.5 stars over all because when you are social and get the hang of things, you're time here will be amazing! The people here are spectacular and they make networking here a breeze. There isn't anything you can't do here if you really put your mind to it, but that is with anything and any college you attend."
Junior,4,Western Illinois University is a wonderful place to grow as an individual and as a student. Professors are there to help you learn and there are many ways to get involved on campus.
Freshman,4,"After spending my first year of college at Western Illinois University, I can truly say this is a great college. I would not have wanted to spend my first year anywhere else. I rate the school four stars because of the friendly environment, great teachers and many activities on campus. The school spirit is phenomenal, especially coming from a school. One of the most important reasons why I chose this school is because of the campus security. The security genuinely cares about people’s safety. No matter what time of the day or night, they will be there to help you if you feel unsafe. The only downfall that I have encountered is where the school is located. There is not many things to do in the community because it is such a small town. Other than that one problem, the school is great. I recommend it to everyone who is unsure where to go and the school welcomes you and makes you feel safe and at home."
Freshman,4,My experience at Western has been great so far! The professors are welcoming and the students are very kind. I felt very comfortable when I first got here and nothing much has changed. I would like to see more of a food variety on campus.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshmen at WIU and so far I ave had a pleasant experience. Most of the teachers always willingly to go the extra mile to assist you if you need it. The atmosphere on campus is pretty positive. The campus is extremely safe , nothing too crazy happens here. It's very diverse here, there's always someone where you'll fit in at."
Freshman,4,"I've had a good experience here at Western Illinois University so far. I have had very positive experiences in my classes due to my amazing professors. Living on campus is something that I would suggest anyone to do because it is a great way to meet new people, and all of Western's dorms are pretty nice. The dining hall hours at the North Quad are rather poor though. It stinks waking up extra early just to go across campus to get breakfast, or getting any meal on the weekend."
Sophomore,4,"Western Is in a small town compared to a city like Chicago, which is were I'm from. However, with an open mind and a fun attitude and knowing what you're here for, it will be the best 4+ years ever!"
Junior,4,Western Illinois University is a great school for people that want the whole college experience but also enjoy a small town feel.
Sophomore,4,What I love about Western is the community and the diversity. Student life is amazing and there is so much to be involved with on campus.
Freshman,4,My experiences at WIU have been exceptional great. There's a lot of things to do here and many ways to get involved. The school is diverse. Western also has many subjects and courses to choose from. This is good place to go to college!
Freshman,4,"Higher values in education. Back in high school I usually had things(academics) my way and learnt little. Just four months in, Western Illinois University showed a better perspective of life; ""following up"". I learnt good work ethics and health habits. I'm happy I school here!"
Junior,4,"I would love coffee shops in the local halls. Also parking isn't as bad, as people claim it to be, & im commute everyday to classes. They offer all sorts of classes online also for those who like to work at there own pace, or at home, to have more time to work on other classes."
Freshman,2,"Professors of this well know law enforcement school, teach students to have little respect for law enforcement."
Freshman,2,"Though this is my first year, my experience at WIU has been horrible. I'll start with a recent incident. About a week ago, in one of the computer labs there was a ""whites only"" sign. This type of incident should not have taken place. Not only have we had racial incidents, but also incidents with weapons. Since The beginning of the semester I've gotten two emails that have said there was someone with a gun on our around campus. I also don't feel like they did a great job connecting me with other students. Next year I will be transferring."
Niche User,2,"My experience at Western was quite poor. The faculty didn't care much about the students and if they were actually learning the material or not, then would get very frustrated with the low class averages. There's nothing to do on campus unless you like to go out and party every single night. The only good thing that came out of this school was the free stuff at the rec center. Overpriced for the quality of what it is. Not to mention one of the RA's had told me there was asbestos in the freshman dorms."
Sophomore,2,The School is losing people and tends to fine you for stupid reasons. But on other news. The LEJA program here is great and I love going to school here I mean I am in a Greek social group named Theta Xi it is a very small group with low numbers. I blame the school for trying to change Greek life here on campus. The OPS officers are very kind and are always there to help but the judicial board people are horrible and only want your money they fine you outrageous amounts for small violations. But overall WIU is okay.
Senior,2,"Honestly almost all of the teachers are great and you will learn a lot. My problem with this school is that I attend the Moline location which does not offer a lot of the classes needed for graduation so you have to go to another school. Also, the classes that are offered fill up almost instantly in person so if you need to change anything with your class schedule you will get stuck with online classes."
Sophomore,2,"When I took a tour of western I thought the school was going to be great for me. I like that the people were friendly, the class sizes were small and the tuition was cheap. The thing is you get what you pay for. The school has had a lot of budget cuts. If you're freshman they won't feed you in your dining hall on the weekends. My freshman year all the power went out the dorms because something malfunctioned. This year I'm in another dorm and the pipe exploded and flooded some of the boy's rooms and destroyed our C-store. I came to Western for fashion merchandising and the department is a joke. One professor literally had no clue what she was she doing so we learned nothing. Only one of the professors in the department actually does their job. There were three professors for fashion merchandising and now we're down to two. We could soon be down to one this year. This school was not what I expected and I will be transferring after this year."
Sophomore,2,I wouldn't recommend for nursing majors. If you are looking for a good nursing program do not come to Western Illinois university. You will be disappointed
Niche User,2,"If you don't party, then this is not the place for you. There are basically no stores besides Walmart and a very tiny JcPenny's. Teachers don't really care if you go to class or not, but be aware there are many pop quizzes."
College Sophomore,2,I do not enjoy living on campus whatsoever.
College Sophomore,2,"Because of our school almost having zero funding they had to lay off almost all of the cleaning staff, because of this the dorms and building are super gross."
College Freshman,2,"Almost everyone drinks or goes to parties. There is no peer pressure, but people do it of their own free will."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are gross, most are very old, and they are tiny."
College Sophomore,2,We are more of a business school and I'm in English...
College Sophomore,2,My campus barely offers anything and there are basically no options in the courses we take. You take what's offered and that's it. It's really whatever the professors decide. It's not about what can be offered for the students it's whatever whoever can/has to teach. We're like the step-kid no one cares about and often misses out on great opportunities.
College Freshman,2,"Students come to school perfectly normal, and leave becoming addicted to drugs or alcohol."
College Freshman,2,"Going to football games, the fan support is pretty low. My high school had more spirit and more students attend than we did here."
College Freshman,2,"This university does not know how to handle situations. Faculty has a tendency to discriminate against white students, and they are very unfriendly. When it comes to academic, if you'd like to hand WIU 20 grand a year for classes you won't learn anything in, simply do so. The dorms are beyond awful, they have mold which causes difficulties for asthmatics and the university does not care; they will not fix the problems. The staff for housing is beyond disrespectful, and feels that a student is lower than a faculty therefore they can act in a different manner to belittle you. Additionally, they are losing not only me as a student, but plenty more I know of due to similar reasonings."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am disappointed in Western Illinois University. There are a lot of nice and hardworking people here. However, this is the opposite of what I wanted my college experience to be. This school and I are just not a good fit."
College Freshman,2,The teams are OK but not the best
College Sophomore,2,I hate living in the dorms.  I want to move out next semester.  I hate living with the college students there because most of them are immature and act like high school students.  Also a lot of students create a lot of annoying and unnecessary drama.  I also don't like the fact that there are so many underage drunk students and I hate it when the girls on my floors are throwing up in the bathroom all night.  I also hate how expensive the food is there.  I hate that my dorm is a half an hour walk away from all of my classes (and it's a walk all uphill).
College Freshman,2,I choose bad because the freshman dorms are such dumps. The bathrooms have mold everything is so old and they just need to be demolished. We had a bad rain storm and rain was pouring into our rooms from the top of the windows.
College Freshman,2,Our whole damn Coaching staff got hired bySouth dakota so yeah shows the loyality and character of the sports
College Freshman,2,No cares aboutthis school its works because it cheap
College Sophomore,2,People are racists against blacks.
College Sophomore,2,I don't learn anything because the teachers suck.
College Sophomore,2,The professors are stupid and nieve.
College Sophomore,2,I don't even know if this degree will even get me a job honestly.
College Freshman,2,Usually just for partying and social status.
College Freshman,2,There is really no school spirit. The sporting events don't get as much attention and people don't really know the players. The football games barely get filled up but still there isn't any spirit at the games.
College Freshman,2,a lot of women have gotten assaulted on campus lately
College Sophomore,2,Fafsa does not provide enough money for students who really need it.
College Freshman,2,"Classes are far too easy, small work loads"
College Junior,2,Overpriced and not very good.
College Freshman,2,"The strictness is kept to a minimum due to the excuse ""we are all adults"" as often used. Policies are enforced when students are being suspicious but are otherwise ignored. Also race plays a large part, Whites are given more lenience on campus than Blacks simply based on stereotypes. However, without strict policies students do not have the desire to break policies and follow them fairly easily and well."
College Freshman,2,"The sports, intramural activities and clubs on campus are not as well viewed as most colleges. Varsity sports are viewed as poor and intramural activities are seen as a joke. However, all students still show their school spirit at the events that are attended and the athletic facilities pertain to athletes and non-athletes."
Recent Alumnus,2,"(This rating does not apply to ALL of the residence halls).

But for the residence halls that I lived in, I was disgusted at how unmaintained the buildings were. In the lobby of my residence hall, dead beatles and bugs are always scattered on the tile floor. How is this consistantly overlooked after many students repeatedly complain? I dont know."
College Sophomore,2,"Really don't get anywhere near enough financial aid and now I can't register for next semester because I don't make enough to pay off what my loans didn't cover plus pay to put a roof over my head. The school thinks that my family can afford to cover it however we actually don't have the money to pay for it, especially having two students in college."
College Sophomore,2,"They make the unhealthy foods really cheap and the healthy foods more expensive. With limited amounts of money each semester, it is more cost efficient to pick the unhealthy option. The healthy food needs to be cheaper so students can purchase it more often. There are too many fatty foods and fast food options."
College Junior,2,They tell us the rules but dont inforce them.
College Junior,2,There is not much of a variety off campus.
College Junior,2,"I know people from almost every frat and sorority on campus, and honestly, they're not the nicest people. They are not very kind to people who aren't in Greek life, and act like they are better than everyone else. The vibe I got from Greek like was that fraternities are much nicer, and sororities are a joke, filled with girls who are stuck up and mainly rude."
College Junior,2,"The students are supposed to be following a school code of conduct when they live off campus. The thing is, they don't seem to enforce it at all. Nothing is stopping the students from acting like fools out in town. This causes some animosity with the residents."
College Junior,2,Students frequently come to class stoned. Shameful
College Freshman,2,"Sodexo doesn't have the best quality, prices, or variety."
College Freshman,2,Barely anyone pays attention to the sports events.
College Freshman,2,Weather is just as you expect it to be in the Midwest- freezing winters and scorching summers
College Freshman,2,"Macomb is kind of sketchy, with very little to do off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is overrated. No one respects Greeks, to many of them get into trouble. They put up stereotypes with makes others want to avoid them."
College Sophomore,2,Boring town with little opportunity.
College Junior,2,They don't have anything that is great here. Even though they might have options I can definitely say that it is very expensive to eat on campus.
College Junior,2,The midwest is known for its bad weather. But the school will not cancel classes as long as the doors to the buildings are accessible even in severely cold weather and snowstorms
College Junior,2,"I have been looking at off-campus housing for a year and I have been very dissapointed in the choices I have seen.  Most of the rental houses I have seen are in very poor condition, the rent does not include many essential services, and are extremely expensive to rent.  The apartments I have seen are usually in better condition than the houses, but are equally overpriced.  Comprable housing in my home town, which is a similarly sized city in a much more developed area, is half the price of housing in Macomb.  The owners of the rental properties get away with charging whatever they want because the demand is high.

On a positive note, the housing closest to campus has access to the free and extensive network of public transport in Macomb."
College Sophomore,2,"Off-campus dining is pretty bad. There are a few family owned restaurants in Macomb but is mostly overrun by chains like McDonalds, Burger King.. etc. If you are used to the small town life then you shouldn't have too much of a problem. Although, most of the students attending Western are from the Chicagoland region, you will have a hard time acclimating to the miles of cornfields and no nearby large towns."
College Sophomore,2,Residence halls have some strict rules but mostly for the safety of the students. The parking services are terrible. There are specific passes you have to buy to be able to park in certain parking lots which are usually full. A Q lot pass is the most desirable and the university has a fair amount of lots for the pass but they are usually always full except for the large lot near the freshman residence halls. A parking garage could go a long way but the university has a problem with spending money on useless and unwanted welcome signs when they are supposed to be budgeting their finances.
College Sophomore,2,The town in which the campus is located is in the middle of nowhere. An hour and a half to the nearest halfway decent sized town is in Peoria. The weather is terrible as of lately and the town fails to take care of the campus or the streets when it snows.
College Freshman,2,The weather is not very pleasant.
College Freshman,2,"It took forever to receive my financial aid. I got a decent amount but not as much as I needed. I am having several financial hardships here. I'm struggling to pay off my balance to register for classes. It sucks, The financial aid process for applying to college wasn't the greatest but it was kind of awful for Western"
College Freshman,2,"From what I hear, parking is somewhat hectic be it that you could only find a few parking spaces near your desired destinations and you need a permit to be in each space. "
College Freshman,2,There pretty much isn't anything to do in this city. You would have to drive a pretty far distance to actually experience some fun. 
College Sophomore,2,It's fair but it can be much better
Junior,1,You can cheat if you take online classes. It doesn't challenge students at all. Might as well be another university of Phoenix.
Junior,1,"They spit out degrees. Worthless, please do not attend. It felt just as easy as high-school was for me."
Senior,1,As I went through the years of schooling I felt more and more apart of a system that spit out students with a degree. The LEJA advising department made all meetings short and quick. With the current cuts they made have left many departments short staffed or the staff is picking up work that was left behind. Veterans and Service members on the back burner. The University is slowly moving away from the philosophy of students first to faculty and staff first. Overall the faculty and staff are always focused on themselves.  They could careless and would rather appraise themselves and other faculty and staff than students.
College Freshman,1,"There was mold in my air vents, additionally I had no choice to turn my heat on or off. Meaning, it could be 90 degrees out and I still have heat blowing in my room 24/7. The cabinets have an odor, causing your clothing to smell old, and like wood. The floor always smells like weed, and the smell comes through the cracks between your doors causing your room to smell the same. The cost at our convenience stores are outrageous. For a pack of 24 bottles of water it is 50 dollars. Additionally, a bottle of night quil is $20, so Walmart trips are definitely a smarter choice. There are constant fire alarms because no one ever gets caught for pulling them randomly. The university does not follow rules, such as escorting guests in the building. Meaning if you are showering, and there are guys in the bathroom you don't know...they get away with it. You may be terrified but again, the school doesn't care. Furthermore, people have a tendency of shutting the lights when people shower, and let me tell you being a female it is the most terrifying feeling ever. Again, no one gets in trouble."
College Freshman,1,I hated living in the dorms. They definitely need to be renovated. The cost should also be lower because they are asking too much for the quality of those dorms.
Recent Alumnus,1,It is stressful even talking about the food complaints.
College Sophomore,1,"Dorm life is the worst thing at Western. RA's will always be right even if they are wrong, if you challenge them you will not win and get fined. For example my floor had an upcoming meeting, however my roommate and I did not receive a notice until the day after the meeting. My RA stuck the notice under our door not knowing I was there, then tired to write us up for attending the floor meeting, saying we were ""notified"".  Some front desk assistants have the worst attitude. I get a lot of packages and they would tell me I do not have a package, even though UPS tracking said it was delivered."
College Sophomore,1,Highly recommend applying for financial aid on your own. Advisors here will only give you loans.
College Junior,1,"The students in this area are terrible. Students raise the cost of living in this area, and they wreck the houses they live in around here."
College Freshman,1,I never go out because it is a waste of time.
College Freshman,1,Terribly empty environment. I hate it out here.
College Freshman,1,I did apply for financial aid but I do not receive much out of it. 
College Sophomore,1,"Because of my family situation I didn't really get good financial aid. Just a couple federal loans, most scholarships are for freshmen. So I was really expected to be able to pay for a lot of my tuition out of pocket"
College Freshman,1,"I personally don't like the greek life here at western.  From what I have heard from friends and family, its best to just stay away from them.  All the girls are stuck up and rude, the boys just want to party and being jerks."
College Sophomore,1,The Campus food is bad. We need to get more varieties of foods not the same ones every day. We need new menu's.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Painfully small town. No culture whatsoever, unless grocery stores and fast food restaurants count. People are friendly, though."
College Sophomore,1,My friend has gotten 4 tickets for parking in different parking lots because her was filled.
College Senior,1,"Landlords/Apartments Are Horrible – Cost is crazy $800+ for a two bedroom, some of the landlords either only care about fining you for every little thing or do not know what they are doing and have no answers for you other than ""I don't know""."
Recent Alumnus,1,"You'd better like it wet.  And hot. Western has a lot of aging buildings.  Most were built in the early 1960s.  Climate control is not good in any of them.

Macomb is located in an area of Illinois that gets plenty hot in the summer (and a lot of spring and fall) and is quite humid.  The air conditioning systems are an antiquated chilled-water system that is in poor repair and is becoming very difficult to maintain.     

Like so many other educational institutions, the comfort of employees is taken far more seriously than that of students, o you will notice a room air conditioner in every office in Sherman Hall, the main administration building.  Employees aren't asked to sweat it out for 8 hours a day but students get to 24/7.  

If the school spent in HVAC maintenance what it blows on dehumidifiers, both problems would be solved.  by dorm room was measured at greater than 75% humidity on many class days, with temperatures into the 80s in the room as well.  Sleeping was, obviously, a challenge..  

The library frequently has a very moldy smell to it, testament to the moisture control problem. 

The one place in the campus that is always kept exceptionally well controlled?  Western hall--the athletics offices.  They are always kept niiiiiice and cool and dry outside of winter months.

Western Hall was also built in the 1960s, so this proves that it CAN be done, it they want to do it.  It also tell you where the school's priorities lie.

  "
College Junior,1,"Dorms and Amenities – The cost is a little bit ridiculous to me, it is convenient to have your food to be freshly made downstairs but then the menu has next to no variety and everything is a la carte, instead of having a meal plan.  After a while you get tired of the food in the dorms and want better quality food."

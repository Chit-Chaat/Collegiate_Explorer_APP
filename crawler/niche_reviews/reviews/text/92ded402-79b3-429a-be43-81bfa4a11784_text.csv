Freshman,5,They are very helpful and very organized. They try to answer all questions and to make everything clear as possible.
Freshman,5,They are using Blackboard which seems to be very well organized and user friendly. This is the first semester that I am with them.
Freshman,5,Transitioning from life to online of course was not easy but SAGU somehow managed to make it easy. The teachers were super understanding and caring and I wouldn't want anyone else.
Freshman,5,"This college is one of the best colleges I have ever been too. The teachers care a lot about you since it is a smaller college and they can work one on one with you. So, I wouldn't worry too much about not passing. The cafeteria is a buffet and filled with delicious goods. Athletics are on another level; Yes they are a small school but take athletics seriously. The student life consists of everyone being a family and filled with energetic activities. SAGU is the place to be!"
Sophomore,5,Online classes for me were very easy. I had always stayed up to date on my work so I would never have to play catch up. The professors were reasonable and would give us a better deadline for are homework because of the situation with coronavirus.
Sophomore,5,"It very unique because I have never been to a Christian school before, but overall, I love it. I have meant long lasting friends and I have a church leader that will help me through the hard times. Plus, I’m a football player and the coaches are Awesome!!!"
Junior,5,"I love this university! I feel like it is my home-away-from-home, and I don't even live on campus! Most of the professors and students are really nice and genuinely interested in you as a person. Jesus, it present here."
Freshman,5,"SAGU is like my second home, and everyone there makes you feel loved and welcomed no matter who you are. SAGU's faculity and staff are always there to help you and make sure you have everything you need. This place really is the best of the best. It is all around beautiful campus with so many beautiful people inside and out. The dorms are all lovely, and there is always something to do and for everyone. It is an amazing place to grow spiritually and in your degree progress."
Freshman,5,The professors are very encouraging and work with you. They want to see you succeed. I haven't gotten to stay on campus yet but I deeply desire too. Overall being an online student it's excellent.
Freshman,5,"Great school! Everyone is helpful and complete invested in your success. Just with applying to the school, the staff were helpful , encouraging and positive."
Freshman,5,"One thing I thoroughly enjoy about the school is the community. There is a strong sense of community with not only the students but the staff as well. All the professors are very understanding and care about seeing your personal growth. I am more than just a number, but a person who is cared for."
Sophomore,5,"This university is so awesome. The people are amazing and friendly. They offer to pray for you in the beginning and towards the end of the semester. The professors also pray for students before major exams, and the campus also prays for different issues in the world. They have Chapel on campus and have some great speakers."
Sophomore,5,"I LOVE SAGU. My experience with Sagu has been nothing short of amazing. I would however, like to see more diversity in my school."
Junior,5,"I like the fact that SAGU is biblical based and has connections for graduates to succeeded in their field of study. 

Currently every thing seems fine. There is no change necessary."
Graduate Student,5,"The absolute best!  SAGU has excellent staff, dynamic programs and is located in an great area.  This school provides both theology based courses as well the science and arts degrees.  An all around great school with students as its priority."
Senior,5,"This is an incredible place to pursue God's calling on your life. The administration wants you to find your purpose more than they want your tuition or your enrollment count. 

If you're looking to party, don't come here. If you're looking to grow, then come and take advantage of relationships with friends, faculty, and administration. The academic rigor here is not exactly what I had hoped it would be, but a university's classes don't need to pummel you into the ground for you to learn beneficial information. 

Overall, this is an awesome place to be challenged in your faith, to sharpen and refine it, and to figure out God's purpose for you. This school holds fast to the Bible as its direction as an institution.

I can barely recognize the freshman me who came here a few years ago. Southwestern didn't ""fix"" me, but the people here modeled for what it really looks like to honor God with your life while still being a fun, normal individual."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at SAGU and was honestly surprised by what I found. I expected to find a school that was set in its rules and regulations. While rules are still expected to be adhered to, there is a lot of freedom provided. In addition, class sizes, professors, and the academic level are all above standard. I have been very happy with what I have experienced so far and am greatly pleased that I choose this school to become my home."
Sophomore,5,"It's a spiritual awakening, and puts you in a better lifestyle, mindset, and academic readiness. I love it."
Senior,5,I am a senior Elementary Education Major at SAGU. I am a distance Education student and I would highly recommend SAGU for distance education.
Niche User,5,"I have enjoyed every second of being on campus. The teachers devote themselves to their jobs, giving the whole atmosphere of the school such a positive vibe. The drive to serve God is evident within every aspect of the school and just overflows into the community around it."
Graduate Student,5,"I absolutely love this University! Everyone that I have encountered throughout my education at this University is so very nice, helpful, and wonderful! I cannot say enough about this campus! The campus is beautiful!!"
Junior,5,I love how it is God based and how much the professors care about each and every student. This experience has stretched me and my faith and trust in the Lord.
Freshman,5,"SAGU is such an amazing school, since it's such a small school all the professors get to know the student and so it's easier for a one-on-one with them. We have chapel everyday and the worship team and speakers are always so meaningful and I get something from it everyday."
Freshman,5,I love everything about my school. The teachers are helpful and understanding. The process of getting approved by the college is smooth. The school actually wants you to succeed.
Alum,5,SAGU has incredible faculty and staff - everyone was friendly and wonderful to work with! The courses were engaging and interesting and I enjoyed almost all of my professors.
Sophomore,5,"This place is truly a amazing campus. If you love the lord, and want to get closer to him while  simultaneously learn and focus on your degree this is the place for you."
Freshman,5,"The class flow is easy and I love the football games! The dress code is pretty lax now. There are not too many parties, which is nice."
Junior,5,"I absolutely LOVE SAGU! This school not only provides you with a great education, but a wonderful atmosphere for spiritual growth with the Lord. I wouldn't want to go anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"The first time i stepped into campus i was a little scared but as i made my way in, people that i didn't even know made me feel welcomed and comfortable. Everyone is really nice and have great manners, i love the environment and its a beautiful place to be."
Freshman,5,"What i liked the most about the university, is the close knit bond everyone has with each other. However, some things I like to see changed, is the amount of time students spend with each other"
Graduate Student,5,"You will not find a better quality college anywhere, that will offer the education and comradery that SAGU offers. The professors and staff at SAGU are a unique set of people who are willing to go the extra mile to get you where you need to be educationally and spiritually. As an alumni, I highly recommend SAGU to anyone pursuing a degree who is spiritually oriented. SAGU will educate you and grow you spiritually."
Senior,5,I love this school it is a great place to attend college and grow deeper in your walk with God. I would have to say the best thing about this school is the fact that the professors genuinely car about every student and you can easily build a relationship with your professors even if you no longer have them in any or your classes anymore. I love this school.
Freshman,5,"The campus is small enough that being late to a class is never an issue (unless you sleep through your alarm, which is more of a personal problem). The students are quite varied, but they're all friendly so feeling out of place will only last for a week, and the professors and staff are quite knowledgeable so the classes are challenging yet understandable. If I had to change one thing, it would be that the macaroni-and-cheese would taste less like blue-box mac and more like homemade mac."
Niche User,5,"SAGU was an awesome school.  The teachers were highly qualified and not only knew the material well, but loved the students."
College Junior,5,Great material and feel very well educated
College Junior,5,Very diverse group of people
College Junior,5,"I love being part of a college where students and professors are all God serving. Having God as the foundation is a school setting is such a blessing, as opposed to learning in a secular environment."
College Junior,5,Very good setup for safety
College Junior,5,"Super friendly, fast and personal process!"
College Junior,5,Really good variety of sport options
College Junior,5,"I absolutely love my school. As a online student, the DE program is amazing for students. They are very informative and you sometimes forget you are a distance learner because they keep you so close to everything going on on the campus,"
College Senior,5,"I never really feel afraid on campus. If I am walking around late I night, I do not fear anything."
College Senior,5,I don't know of an incident of sexual assault.
College Senior,5,"There is no Greek like, and I am not interested in Greek life."
College Senior,5,"I enjoy the dedication of the Bible professors. Even though I am not seeking a Bible degree, the things I have learned from the Bible department has made a significant difference in my personal life and with the volunteer work at my church. I also appreciate my other professors who teach from a Christian worldview."
College Freshman,5,I have only completed 2 online courses but both were great and the professors were fantastic.
College Freshman,5,I love my school! It's a Bible college and I love that everything and everyone is God centered!
College Sophomore,5,The teams and schools show alot of support.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are awesome and really care about the students.
College Freshman,5,"I am in a ministry school that is very small.  We all know each other and there is no crime nor do we have issues with personal safety.  The school is a safe environment.  Off of the school property out within the city, it is like any other city.  But the actual campus and our living quarters are very safe."
College Freshman,5,"My career prospects after completing my bachelors degree are outstanding.  The internship we do during our 4 years of college prepare us to take on a variety of roles within the church.  Our school puts us in contact with churches that are in need of the area we are lead to, which allows us to get a career relatively quickly."
College Freshman,5,"The course are structured to deepen my knowledge of God and the bible, as well as prepare me for a career in ministry.  The professors are all experienced ministry professionals and actively work within the church as well.  Our class sizes are very small with a very low teacher/student ratio which provides an excellent learning outcome."
College Freshman,5,We have apartments that serve as our dorms.
College Freshman,5,"My school experience my first year of college has been nothing less than amazing.  The love and quest for God is felt all around me.  The professors genuinely want you to succeed and have an invested interest in success of their students.  The courses are relevant and challenging, which makes for an exciting yet rewarding experience.  I would definitely recommend and choose going to SAGU over any other school."
College Student,5,I would say they are doing a great job being very strict about not having any substances on campus. Not to sure if people still do it behind scenes but I would recommend all students being followed up on it.
College Student,5,"The safety and security on campus is very well trained and aware. They have a lot of cameras that are always watching the campus like a hawk. They don't mess around they really do care for our safety. If your out late and in the parking lot and wanting to make sure everything is okay before you get out you can call the security office, they will the cameras in your area you are at. Around you as well and then let you know that he/is is okay and that he/is is safe."
College Student,5,"I appreciate them always looking our for us. If your majoring in a certain area they will make sure that they will help you meet those needs. Whenever they see an opportunity as in a guest speaker wanting to come in and speak about a mission, if you in a mission field they will schedule a day for everyone have more information on becoming a missionary or wanting to just travel around the world."
College Student,5,"Living on Campus is awesome! I Live outside Kendrick and that is an all girl dorm and I would recommend it to all girls who will attend. Its very spacious we don't share a sweet mate which can complicated sometimes using the bathroom and they forget to unlock the door haha. The RA's here is very sweet and helpful, the cost is worth it!"
College Student,5,"what makes my school so unique is that everyone here is very welcoming. It's like back home in Hawaii everyone has ALOHA and here at Southwestern Assemblies Of God University everyone has that character of loving and caring for each other. Everyone is just so welcoming and have a genuine heart. We do a lot of activities on campus, we have gatherings, dinners, devotional time with our dorms. The professors care about not only about our education wise but spiritually as well it is a very well balanced environment."
College Sophomore,5,"Honestly, I have never heard of anyone nor have I known anyone who has ever experienced, witnessed, or seen any physical harm being conducted on campus. There has been minimal crime and it has been very scares. SAGU is a very safe place where your stuff and yourself are not in danger."
Freshman,4,SAGU has a lot of really cool people that love meeting! The way it is run and some of the rules make it not as enjoyable.
Freshman,4,What I like about Southwestern is that you get to strengthen your relationship with God. And also can find the greatest people there.
Sophomore,4,"I've enjoyed my time at SAGU. I've made friends. I enjoy going to class because every day is different. Some classes are more discussion-oriented and some are lecture-style, but the classes are interesting. I like the spiritual emphasis. Just know that it's a small school. It's good to know everyone, but sometimes people stick their noses into your business. The rules are mostly okay. It's a Christian college. PDA rules could stand to be a little looser."
Freshman,4,The students and professors are amazing! I enjoy my classes. And I believe that is where God has me!
Freshman,4,It is all Christian based but they really get down and help there students get in touch with Jesus. But the only thing is that they do not tolerate the students opinions.
Sophomore,4,Being an online student at Southwestern Assemblies of God University has helped me go back to school later in life to pursue my purpose that God has placed on my heart. I am grateful for the opportunity to go to school online even though I work a full-time job and my time is limited.  The structure of classes and the encouragement that I receive because I am an online student are helpful walking the path towards the counseling degree that I desire. The grace that professors have shown to me when I have faced challenges with homework is something that gives value to me as an online student.
Niche User,4,In the process of enrolling. A good experience so far. Trying to obtain my Bachelor's degree in counseling there
Niche User,4,"I will be new to the university this coming season . I can talk about what attracked me to the school. Online student reviews. That fact that's located in a nice and very peaceful small town. The fact that's based on Christian education is a major plus, for me. Amoung other things, the fact that I will be able to take 100 percent online 2 years associates degree is very helpful for someone with a  very busy schedule like mine. The day  I went to the admissions office , the lady was extremley informative, patient, friendly, easy to understand while providing  list of all documentation needed for financial aid purposes.
I would recommend this school, to anyone looking for a good quality education."
Junior,4,If you are looking for a place to draw closer to God but also get a great education; Southwestern is the school for you. Its also located right outside Dallas Texas which makes living pretty cool. You're never too bored.
Sophomore,4,This  is a good university with Christ centered education. The faculty is focused on the students. The facilities are nice and neat. The degree plans are thorough and student development is important to all of the staff.
Senior,4,"Southwestern Assemblies of God University is the type of place where you just feel right at home and welcomed as soon as you arrive. The students as well as the faculty go out of their way to help others when they need it. One of the best parts of living on campus is the dorm life. Upon reading this, you may seem a bit skeptical seeing as how its an ""Assemblies of God"" campus which in your mind is summed up as ""reserved, strict, and overall an anti-'good time' living."" However, although the University are somewhat strict and frowns upon most cases of going out partying and drinking and has a curfew during the academic year, the atmosphere on each of the halls I wouldn't describe as anything less than family-like. Living on a small campus may seem to some as a disadvantage, but it enables you to become familiar with almost everyone on the campus which can have several benefits."
Sophomore,4,I have spent one year at this university and I have enjoyed it from the student activities to the personal connections with the teachers. The only thing I would want to change is the cost to go the this university it is very expensive and a lot of students can only afford to stay for a year.
Junior,4,"Southwestern Assemblies of God, 
 Man that is a mouth full. What I enjoyed the most about this University is the environment that everyone creates. Not only do you get to enjoy a great education that is taught by some of the most caring professors in the game, but you get to experience the presents of the Lord. While attending this University I have grown both spiritually and mentally. I have learned to grow in my walk of faith and to let God lead my life. This school helps you with life goals and it helps you with creating the person you want to be. The campus life is live and friendly. We have some of the best people on campus, and the athletic scene is loved by all. Being both a student and a student athlete I can proudly say that I enjoy Southwestern Assemblies of God and the balance that I have created while trying to focus on both school and athletics."
Senior,4,Southwestern is a great school. You will find friends and become family. Professors know what theyre teaching. I would like to see the Communications and Digital Media Arts departs grow more.
Freshman,4,"I love the tight-nit, Christian environment that is offered at Southwestern Assemblies of God University. The professors are awesome and they really care not only about the student's education progress but also their spiritual progress. Some things that I would change about Southwestern would be the dress code and the curfew. I mean we are college students and use should be treated as so."
College Sophomore,4,They helped me a lot to get my admission process going in just a few weeks. They were very helpful with letting me understand things and answering my questions extremely politely and with a good attitude.
College Senior,4,"The courses, depending on what one is taking, occasionally could use more work, but pretty much every professor genuinely cares about their students."
College Sophomore,4,We have new building and old buildings
College Sophomore,4,The cafeteria food needs improvement.
College Junior,4,People feel it's almost 'too' safe here!!
College Junior,4,"The Christian courses are really informative and wholesome. They push beliefs on you, but lay out what they know in a respectable manner. Your major course profs will really care about your success in and out of the class. They pray for you!!"
College Junior,4,"I know this school has a good reputation for sending out awesome teachers, and that schools in the Dallas are always want to hire from SAGU"
College Junior,4,"Depends where you want to go and how much you want to spend. The newest dorms (Teeter and Bridges) are the most expensive, but also the nicest...including have a bathroom shared between you and your suitemates. Other forms, which are a lot cheaper, have community bathrooms, so it's up to you."
College Junior,4,The gym is actually pretty good and has good open hours. Running track upstairs and racket ball rooms downstairs.
College Junior,4,"The school is a little small and closed in. However, if you are considering this school then it might be exactly where God wants you."
College Freshman,4,The dorms are a great place!!! Every dorm has great RAs and you can make friends easily
College Freshman,4,The gym has a wide range of machines
College Freshman,4,I think SAGU is a great place because everything you do is to honor God. The professors are great and really understanding.
College Student,4,The courses I enrolled into has been very helpful! The professors really don't expect you to know everything but are always helping either if its the smallest thing to know about from basics to experts big things to help you get educated and to grow.
College Sophomore,4,Professors are top notch. Curriculum is engaging and even challenging at times. Class registration is an easy and simple process. The workload is pretty heavy but is very doable. There are many opportunities to receive help and provide help for studying and being successful.
College Sophomore,4,Students are provided with a wide variety of internship opportunities on a regular basis. Alumni serve in a variety of fields and uphold the Southwestern standard and name.
College Senior,4,I have never used the facilities but that is because I am a Distance Education student.
College Sophomore,4,There are enough classes for me to be assured I will have a quality MBA degree at the end of five years.
College Sophomore,4,Professors and courses are great but challenging.  Professors do care about the student but sometimes not available due to their class schedule times.  This can be both the professor and the student time management.  Courses are challenging and engaging.  I definately feel I have learned a deeper side to even how my basics are taught.
College Sophomore,4,I am a sophomore but am in the Lead program.  My goal is to obtain my MBA within 5 years.
College Sophomore,4,I have lived in two dorms while at SAGU.  Both are very enjoyable.  Social life is great but only if you want to be involved.
College Sophomore,4,SAGU is involved in many athletic sports.  I was a cheerleader and enjoyed my time with the team and usage of the facilities.
College Sophomore,4,"I have not been much involved with this area of my school yet due to only being a first semester sophomore, but from what I hear it is an easy and great experience."
College Sophomore,4,"I love living on campus in my dorm Collins. It is a very homey as well as reasonably priced dorm that offers plenty of space, family life, and cleanliness. It is close to about half of the stuff on campus and not too far off from everything else. The people in the dorm make it the best. Other dorms include lots of space, family life, and cleanliness as well. Each dorm is unique and offers people a variety of characteristics to fit their needs and wants."
College Sophomore,4,"While sports are important on campus, they are not the main focus. Your relationship with Jesus as well as academics, of course, come first. Sports follow behind closely. Intramural's are a hot topic on campus as well and take up a lot of free time in students campus life. The number of fans you should expect mainly depends on the sport. Each sport however typically brings out a decent crowd. The coaches and team are nothing less than supportive on and off the field or court."
College Sophomore,4,The class size is small and the class lectures are very informative. The professors know you by name.
Recent Alumnus,4,"It is absolutely the best atmosphere I've ever experienced at a college. The only drawback here is the rules. The rules at this school, though they be far from what they once were, are still strict compared to what the rest of the college world looks like. There is a dress code and a curfew, along with a daily chapel service that is required. Once you get in the routine of these things, it becomes easy, but at first it seems really constricting. It is these rules that provide for such a safe, spiritual atmosphere at the school."
College Sophomore,4,I love my my school and all that it stands for.
College Junior,4,"I absolutely love my school and the atmosphere it has to offer. If I could change one thing about the school, it would be to have a better variety in the cafeteria. The one thing I find most unique about my school is the warm acceptance of an amazing student body. I love being able to go to chapel every morning and have devotions with my dorm. Not very many schools have the opportunity to be a much as much as Southwestern Assemblies of God University. The only reason I wouldn't chose this school is due to the cost of tuition. It has many great things to offer, but the price is not worth attending."
College Freshman,4,I love my school! It's CHRIST-centered atmosphere helps me grow and has been truly eye opening.
College Junior,4,"I love my school, the people are amazing, the classes are amazing, and I get to worship Jesus everyday and be in a Christian environment. It is the best place for me."
College Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere of this school. The student body makes you feel like a part of the family. The extracurricular activities are great and the professors care about you.
College Student,4,The school is great for Christian fellowship and learning. The teachers are always willing to help and guide. The prices are a little high and wish they had more ways to pay for it. But I would not change schools.
College Senior,4,"It is a good God centered school, it may be a bit pricey, but the classes are good, and many of the teachers are passionate about working and teaching there."
College Junior,4,"According to Career Services, a free service offered to students and alumni, our career prospects are great. They work well with students and alum to find them careers."
College Junior,4,I seriously love SAGU profs so much. They have never hesitated to pray with me when I needed. Most of them offer their cell numbers for easy access and answer their emails in a timely manner.
College Junior,4,"There is someone for everyone, or not...haha I mean, I don't know..."
College Junior,4,There are a lot of options for athletes and non-athletes alike.
College Junior,4,"Waxahachie has a great selection of fast food restaurants as well as a few local cuisine and ""sit down"" restaurants. But Dallas is also only 25-30 minutes away, and there are tons of options there."
College Junior,4,"There are three options for dining on campus. The first is the cafeteria, which is not as bad as what people make it out to be. We just got new management, and I believe it will get even better. There is a fresh salad bar, a burrito bar, pizza and fries, a sandwich bar, and ""home made"" food lines that offer a variance of food depending on the day. There is also always a variety of cereals available. There is the Lion's Den, which is in the student center. You can use munch money to buy meals, drinks, smoothies, etc. You can also use your meal replacements for a selection of meals, usually some kind of hot sandwich and fries/chips, but also including premade salads and cold sandwiches. Einstein's has the best selection of food and a large variety of coffee drinks and smoothies. The only problem is that you can only use munch money or real money here."
College Junior,4,"The greatest problem with campus housing is the price - but this is a private Christian university. We all know how expensive the school is when we enroll. Bridges and Teeter are the newest of the dorms, and arguably the nicest. They are definitely most expensive. Other dorms are Guynes, Savell, Kendrick (all girls), Collins (LEAD program students mostly), and the Regents Senior Apartments. Most people would say that Savell is the least nice of all the dorms. It is where the majority of jocks live, and it is the cheapest of all the dorms. Bridges has Pancake Monday and hosts Thankful For ___ in the student center every November. Teeter has Taco Tuesday and hosts Teeter Coffee House every semester. Guynes does random all-dorm events like ice cream socials and hosts Dorm Donut Shop once a year. Savell and Kendrick are close in proximity so they host all-dorm events as well. Each dorm as a different personality. Try a semester in one, and if you don't like it, move to another. The RAs and dorm pastors try hard to make sure that everyone feels at home. All of the dorms have free laundry facilities. Bridges and Teeter have three washers and dryers on each hall. The others have community washers and dryers down stairs. The apartments obviously have their own washer and dryers in each individual apartment. The campus is small, so everything is relatively close to where classes are held. Bridges and Teeter are farthest away from the HCC and the Admin, but right next door to the Garrison Wellness Center and the Shaeffer Center, where the chapel, classrooms, and the caf are. Guynes is right in the middle of campus and is almost equally close to everything. Kendrick and Savell are right in front of the SC and right next door to the student center, and still relatively close to the HCC and Admin. Regents is close to the HCC and admin, but not close to the gym or student center. The housing process is easy. I have never had any problem with having to wait for a spot."
College Freshman,4,The school is surrounded by plenty of typical fast food restaurants college kids love and enjoy.
College Freshman,4,"The campus is pretty safe for the most part, there isn't much that goes on where your safety is ever in question."
College Freshman,4,The people that work inside the offices are very kind and helpful. Make you feel important and give you everything your looking for.
College Freshman,4,"collins is the cheapest dorm, but the social atmosphere is amazing, it has a ""home"" feel to it. everyone is great. our dorm Pastors are awesome, they go around praying for each of us in our rooms. dorm devos are awesome, the presence of God is there!"
Niche User,2,"This college does not have many options when it comes to majors and minors. If you are planning on being in the ministry or worship music industry, then this may be the school for you. Other than that, good luck."
College Senior,2,"Although there is a sports program, it is not the focus of the school"
College Junior,2,We have two groups: one is gold jackets (all women) and the other I think is called men of God (all men.) kind of lame to be honest. I wish there were more active groups.
College Freshman,2,I have gotten under cooked food several times
College Freshman,2,There are no sororities or fraternities around the campus.
College Junior,2,"The community, surprisingly, knows little about SAGU. Dallas is only about 30minutes away, so if one is willing to make the drive, there is plenty entertainment there."
College Junior,2,Off-campus housing consists of a few apartment complexes....that's about it.
College Sophomore,2,"The dining experience would most likely be SAGU's biggest disadvantage. The quality of the food is absolutely nothing compared to what we pay for. If there was any way we could go about not having a meal plan and being able to supply ourselves with food.. I would totally pick that option. Although, the staff is absolutely the sweetest people on campus, along with the maintenance people."
College Freshman,2,The cafeteria has improved over the years but it still lacks overall good food. The meal plans are over priced for the value of the food you eat. The other option is Den but the employees do not know how to cook food their. It is usually burnt and gross.
College Freshman,2,"This is a Christian college that does not participate in such activities, nor are they allowed."
College Junior,2,"To quote a fellow student...""if it were any worse, it woukd be nonexistent."""
College Student,2,There are very few options that are open late at night.
College Junior,2,we do not have greek life.
College Junior,2,There's no public transit . Mostly students with cars drive every one else around . 
College Student,2,Small town environment so there isn't much.  I like living on campus.
College Junior,2,The WIFI is terrible. Like awful. 
College Junior,2,Campus security has gotten better over the years but it is still very poor. Luckily we don't have a lot of crime on campus so I guess its okay.
College Freshman,2,When it rains/snows it is unpleasurable to walk in.
College Sophomore,2,Dinner starts at 5 and ends at 7. The cafeteria is average for a small university.
College Sophomore,2,"There are new more modern facilities but also out of date buildings. it is a Christian school so there really isn't much of a bar scene, but it is fun in a clean sort of way."
Sophomore,1,"Run and hide. 

The professors are the Lowest paid in the State of Texas. They do not care about you or your education.

The football Coaches and the Football team is horrible. 

The New dormitory does not have windows. The old dormitory has roaches.

Church and devotionals every single day is the only good thing!

If you like vape, juul and alcohol - Then you will like SAGU. If you don’t - The run and hide."

Freshman,1,"If there were a zero star option - SAGU would get zero stars! Words can not describe how disappointed we are with the Professors at Southwestern Assemblies of God. 

Q: What is MOST important? A: Good Education. Q: How does a student get the MOST important thing? A: Good Professors. Q: Why are we greatly disappointed! A: Horrible Professors. They don't teach. They don't care. It is horrible. It is embarrassing.

If you read reviews - you will see SAGU Professors are paid less than the Industry average. If you were paid less than the Industry average - how hard would you try?

Do they make no effort because they get paid very little? Or do they get paid very little because they make no effort?

We trusted good Reviews - but found out the truth - the hard way. Do your research!

Oh, btw. Great dorms. As long as your roommate isn't drinking beer and smoking vape or juul. Great food... when they're open. They close the entire campus and dining hall whenever they desire!

HORRIBLE!!"
Alum,1,"Do not go to this school.
Look at the stats.
They rope you in at youth camps, you feel ""called"" to take on 100k in student debt to do a job that doesnt even require a degree (most pastors got one after being a pastor, make the church pay), less than 50% graduate meaning half of the students halfway through their studies quit because they realize how insane it is, average salary after graduation is slightly higher than national average salary... that includes walmart employees.
It might be different if the academic integrity was there but there were people attending this school because their community college was too difficult. I once received a letter grade deduction because my math paper didn't have enough ""Jesus"" in it.

This school is evil and will set a generation into slavery because it funds their denomination. That's all."
Alum,1,"This school is run by the Patriarchal families of all of the head honchos, or rather, the members of the cabinet. They hire the family members of these higher-ups instead of qualified staff and faculty. This devalues both the academics and the spiritual atmosphere of the campus, as the nepotism is so thick, individuals who should have been fired decades ago continue to reign over the school. However, if you're an individual who likes playing games like this and you manage to get into the good graces of one of the founding families, your time at SAGU will be a cakewalk."
College Senior,1,"Well, we don't really have Greek life. The only thing remotely ""Greek"" is Phi Beta Lambda, which is a technically a business fraternity, but it is not the type of fraternity that would be considered a typical American fraternity."
College Junior,1,"Waxahachie is full of old people, and nearly everything is closed by 12."
College Freshman,1,"I rate that the party scene is the worst because it is near to no existent, as far as your typical college party goes. And that's how I like it!"
College Junior,1,Basically if you aren't a ministry major you wont receive any other aid besides the basic federal aid. 
College Junior,1,Wish we had fraternities and sororities on campus.
College Junior,1,I don't have any scholarships.
College Sophomore,1,It is a small town with not a lot to do
College Sophomore,1,It is a small campus so there is no transportation needed
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life
College Junior,1,They are very few bars in the area for those  who are 21 or older. There also are very few clubs for those who are 18+. At night we have weekly prayer and worship services. This can vary from once a week to a couple times per week. There are also games going on which you can go to to support whatever sport your friend or classmates are involved in.
College Freshman,1,"Almost everyone here is the same person. If you are looking for adversity, this isn't the place for you."
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife (drinking, dancing, etc) is discouraged at SAGU so that students constantly focus on Jesus and are always in prayer"
College Sophomore,1,"We Focus on Jesus. SAGU is a Christian school, so students are forbidden to drink alcohol, do drugs, or be sexually active. However, a school is filled with students and students have issues and some students may not adhere to every single rule in the handbook. Therefore, while drugs, alcohol, and sex are prohibited, it is simply ignorant to say that no one follows every single rule. The majority of the school do not do said things, but the student population who do participate in these behaviors are few."
College Sophomore,1,"Wait, We're Adults. Right?! We have curfew on this campus. 12 am Sunday- Thursday. 1 am Friday and Sat. It's pretty sad. We also have dress code. No shorts, pants with holes, or hats allowed in chapel or classes. Straps on shirts and dresses must be at least and inch long. Shorts cannot come higher than a credit cards width from the knee. Must must not be ""disturbing"". No facial piercings, and no more than 2 piercings in each ear. No new visable tattoos while attending school.... I'm just trying to understand how we are supposed to be adults, while we have all these rules. They bill us like we're grown, let us be treated that way too!"
College Freshman,1,"Very Basic – There is only the bare minimum there when it comes eating, and its only the usual you would see anywhere else."

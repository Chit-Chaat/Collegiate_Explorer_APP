Alum,5,"I attended SNU Online in 2016 and graduated with a Bachelors of Science, in Network Management in the Winter of 2017.  My favorite classes were Windows Server, Cisco Routers & Switches, and Network Security.  My professors were knowledgeable, patient, and willing to answer questions at any time.  Combined with my previous military experience, I have used this degree to propel me to a great job doing Cybersecurity full-time, making a six-figure salary.  I wanted a degree that would help me get hired, and this one did that, and did it well."

Junior,5,Southern Nazarene University is an excellent experience for adult students looking to go back to school!
Junior,5,I am doing college completely online through SNU and I am so thankful for the flexibility their online program offers for adults working full time.
Graduate Student,5,"Even with the quick transition to online learning, I have been impressed with all the instructors and the quality of the courses."
Graduate Student,5,Been very impressed with the transition to online and still with the quality of the instructors and online courses.
Junior,5,"Southern Nazarene is a place of inclusion and the motto that they stand for, Character, Culture, Christ. They are working to build individuals of character that have the potential to do great things in the communities around them, not just academically but also as people in general that will serve the communities around them. SNU is always working toward the idea of inclusion within the difference races that are represented around campus. Professors and individuals that work on campus really focus on making everyone feel like a somebody and to recognize their full potential academically and as an individual. We, as students are met where we are, we are encouraged to be better in every area of our lives and are told and represented as who we are. SNU does everything in their power to build and instill the Christian belief and morale in everything that they do. The faculty and staff make sure we are driven to be the best we can be with the resources that they provide."
Junior,5,"Since the pandemic that has occurred, like all universities, SNU moved online for the last two months of the semester. We were provided with an abundant amount of resources to make sure that we succeed in the midst of the changes that were made to our academic learning. As students it was evident that the University truly cared about our academic success no matter the environment. If ever I had a question I was always given an answer and the professors were very flexible but well trained in how to handle the online environment."
Freshman,5,"I haven't started my classes at SNU yet, but they have been amazing so far! Quick to respond, answered all of my questions, and have been there every step of the way so far!"
Junior,5,SNU is so different from what i expected from a college. The faculty and staff care so much about you as an individual and work to make sure you have the best college experience you can possibly have.
Sophomore,5,"I started school with SNU, the quit to get married and family.  Children are now grown and needed to go back to school .  SNU was the perfect fit.  Enrolling was so easy and everyone is so kind and helpful.  I chose to do school 100% online and love it!  Really wish I had done this earlier, but better late than never!"
Freshman,5,"Southern Nazarene University is a place that is very interested in the success of its students. Academics are obviously a big part of college student success, but something that makes SNU stand out from other colleges is its desire to help people grow individually and socially. There are always opportunities to grow in these ways at SNU and the faculty is rooting for the success of all students!"
Sophomore,5,The faculty really make it a point to know your name and actually take time to invest in your future. Their math and education departments are absolutely wonderful. The food in the caf isn’t that great. It gets old really quick. I have taken a few evening classes and always feel say when I walk back to my car.
Sophomore,5,"Love the Christian Atmosphere, the small school feeling, the professors are top notch.   I am so glad I choose SNU"
Junior,5,"I initially selected Southern Nazarene University because of their high quality music professors and strong sense of community. Now, as I'm beginning my junior year here I realize that SNU is so much more than good professors and great social events. The faculty here are genuinely invested in the success of their students, academic and otherwise. My friends who go here are truly my campus family, we have one another's backs no matter what. College is hard, so you should surround yourself with faculty and friends that will be with you every step of the way."
Niche User,5,I loved visiting SNU. Everyone is so friendly! The campus is beautiful and they are very accommodating.
Freshman,5,My experience at Southern Nazarene University had been such a great time. This school has helped me in finding my self in the world but also helping me know what I really want to major in. The teachers are very helpful.
Freshman,5,I recently went for my first college visit to SNU and I loved it and I look forward to becoming a full-time student and getting first hand what everything is going to be like.
Niche User,5,The atmosphere is phenomenal! Everyone seems so friendly and welcoming. I really like the location because it is not far from downtown Oklahoma City!
Junior,5,"This is a wonderful college environment. Small and close to home and work and in the wonderful city of Bethany.  The staff is always friendly, helpful and concerned with making your college experience enjoyable and fulfilling. I have never been more pleased with a learning environment than i have at SNU.  I enjoy the classes and the professors.  SNU offers a fantastic adult studies program to obtain  a 4 year and Masters degree in minimal time.  Attending 1 night a week has made a huge difference for me."
Freshman,5,"When I first come here, I was kind of worry, but that was just my opinion. Everyone at the school are super nice. The best thing will be Chapel. We have Chapel every Tuesday and Thursday, and I loved it. They always reminded us that , God is always with us."
Graduate Student,5,Southern Nazarene University is an amazing university that has the best professors and staff that I have ever seen! The professors truely care about their students and the classes are small so you get the attention you need to succeed in every course. I would have chosen my university differently the first time around if I had know the difference between a regular university and a Christian university.
Sophomore,5,"I have to say the campus is gorgeous! All the professors I had we're very knowledgeable. Overall I had a really good experience. Being a religious school, part of your requirement is to attend chappel twice for credit to be able to come back the next semester. This was really the only thing I did not really like"
Sophomore,5,"SNU  is and incredible school. Professors want to help you succeed and find your calling in life. Class sizes are very small (typically less than 25 students), so you can get lots of help from professors if you’re having trouble."
Senior,5,"I went to SNU to play college soccer! The atmosphere at SNU is excellent, it is the feeling that everyone on campus wants you to be there. All the professors are personal, they know who you are even after the class is over. At SNU, we get to learn and talk about God and I think to be able to do that at a university in this society today is amazing. I'm so glad that I chose a school to get my degree and to strengthen my relationship with the Lord."
Junior,5,The culture behind the university is second to none. The very first day I walked the campus I felt as though I belonged there. All of the staff is helpful and willing to listen to the voices of its students.  SNU addresses all aspects of the individual and desires to see all of its students excel at their highest level as they work to achieve there goals and degrees there.
Niche User,5,"Great college! My whole family has gone their and I'm excited to attend! I go to church within the district and they have always been involved in their community. Everyone who has gone their has not regretted it. Yes it is an expensive private college, but it is worth it."
Graduate Student,5,"I have been very impressed with this college so far. I completed my undergraduate degree at a separate college in eastern Oklahoma, and was not overly impressed with their degree options, or classes. However, I have been very happy with the Southern Naz programs thus far."
Sophomore,5,This was my first year at SNU. I am a transfer student and my experience this semester has been great. The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. I would recommend SNU to everyone.
Alum,5,"I spent 4 years at SNU in the 50s.  I met my wife at SNU and married in the 50s.  Been married to the same gal for over 60 years. My three children have graduated from SNU--One has been with UPS for 32 years and the other two are MD.s.   Three grandchildren have graduated from SNU and more on the way. We made many friends for life.  And the university professors  were there to teach and be helpful--to get you where you wanted to go.  I was a high school  teacher for 9 years and a university professor for 39 years.  Great college, professors and students"
College Freshman,5,I always feel safe as campus security is always patrolling the area.
College Freshman,5,School sets me up in the best environment and experience for success.
College Senior,5,SNU has a great reputation and a degree from this school is highly recognized.
College Senior,5,The classes are small and the professors interact with all the students.  They are available to their students for help and questions!!!
College Senior,5,The coaches care and put every effort into their coaching.
College Senior,5,SNU cares about each student and their success.  The campus staff is helpful and knowledgable.  SNU would be my choice of schools if I had to choose again.  It's the best!!!!
College Sophomore,5,I have loved everything about SNU.
College Sophomore,5,"Not a lot of amazing talent, but a ton of spirit and support."
College Sophomore,5,It truly is the best school ever
Recent Alumnus,5,"No alcohol/drugs visible and no peer pressure to do any, but if you try hard enough, you could probably find someone.  Strict no alcohol/drug/tobacco policy that is enforced."
College Student,5,My classes are not yest started at SNU. I am eagerly awaiting for the beginning of the fall semester as the experiences I have with SNU so far is praiseworthy.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I had very supportive and understanding professors while at SNU. Even after I graduated and moved away, I had professors asking me how I was doing and wondering what I was up to. I felt that all of my professors that taught classes relative to my major were very passionate about what they taught. There desire to see me excel was evident to me."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The reason I went to SNU was to have a better chance of being accepted to graduate school. When I applied to SNU they had a 90% acceptance rate into OU's Health Science Center (OUHSC), and they still have a strong connection. I, myself, have recently been accepted to OUHSC's Doctorate of Physical Therapy program. I believe that this was not only due to my merits as a student and working professional, but was partly due to the reputation that exists between SNU science department and OUHSC."
College Freshman,5,"All the classes that you take pertain to your major and,they are fairly small ."
College Freshman,5,Everyone puts their part so the event can be pleasant for the  guest and athletes
College Freshman,5,I like that it's a small campus and it's easy to get around.
College Freshman,5,"There is a little bit of everything. Several Study Abroad options, the newly renovated library with lots of study space, and quiet rooms in the dorms. The workload depends on your course but for a Freshmen it's normally light. Registering is easy and stress free."
College Sophomore,5,Love my school. The distance home is something to deal with but the school is great.
College Freshman,5,This is a Christian college and very much an 'at home' atmosphere.
College Freshman,5,"SNU really has a family atmosphere. Other than the cost, it's the best."
College Sophomore,5,Living on campus allows you to have that college experience.
College Sophomore,5,"The parties are organized by the university, so they do not get out of hand. At the same time it does not feel like the school planned the party; someone wouldn't know if it didn't say it on the posters"
College Senior,5,Located in a safe part of the city
College Freshman,5,Small campus and close parking to dorm and classes.
College Junior,5,"The campus is small, so transportation really isn't needed around campus. Everything is fairly close. There are people that ride bikes and skateboard around campus."
College Freshman,5,"The atmosphere is amazing!  Since it's not the biggest school in the world, everyone gets to know each other very well.  It feels like family!"
College Senior,5,"The professors, curriculum, workload and registration process are all fairly easy.  I have loved every minute of the educational aspect of my classes."
College Senior,5,The professors in the psychology department are the reason that I have stayed faithful to SNU.  They're the real deal. They care about their students and absolutely love the material that they teach.  The embody their lessons in their personal lives.
College Junior,5,"The weather is mild for the most part, and classes hardly ever get cancelled. We get SNU alert emails for weather notifications."
College Junior,5,I went to SNU because it offers an English Major with a creative writing focus. The professors are very knowledgeable and are willing to help you learn what you need to before test time.
Sophomore,4,although the school is small there is great ways to be active and involved. The staff is very suporitting and helpful with all your academic needs
Sophomore,4,the online teaching is very basic. Usually done through zoom calls and work must be done and turned in via Canvas
Sophomore,4,"I've only completed my freshman year, so I don't know a whole lot about the institution, but I did enjoy it quite a bit! There were some issues that weren't addressed in the best way, but they have a lot of professors who care, and students with kind, true hearts. The classes are alright too and I enjoy the foot."
Junior,4,"Southern Nazarene University is a fantastic school for those seeking out a faith-based college experience. This school is not the place for parties, sororities, or frat houses, but it is the place to grow in your faith with God. This school is also ideal for those wanting a more intimate experience, as the school is quite smaller than the average state school. This allows for more assistance from professors and staff, which is something that is hard to come by in larger schools."
Junior,4,"I had/have amazing professors that prepared me for my future. With the school being small, you really get to know the professors one-on-one, which helps learning. Also, there are many ways to get involved on campus, as long as you put in the effort."
Senior,4,"Overall, SNU is a great university. Arguably the best thing the school has to offer is the personal connection that is developed with the professors. SNU has plenty of resources to help students succeed. However, there are areas where the school could improve. The older dorms are in dire need of renovation, but the newer ones are fine. The school should have more/better eating options. Lastly, the school needs to do a better job of providing an environment of inclusion. There have been several instances of blackface, and the administration does not give consequences to these students. When these situations occur, the school does whatever they can to sweep it under the rug. While this hurts to see the administration respond so inappropriately, I am still glad I went here. I have grown tremendously as an individual and a scholar."
Junior,4,"Southern Nazarene University has been a very good fit for me. It's a smaller university, which I like. Similar to my high school, you know almost everyone there. I feel safe when I walk around campus, and all the teachers are very caring. This year will be my Junior year and i'm sad my college journey is starting to come to an end, because I have enjoyed it here so much."
Alum,4,It is a good university.  I liked how the professors worked with you to accomplish your academic goals.
Junior,4,"Southern Nazarene University is a great school. I love the small class setting, the caring professors and the overall environment of SNU. I am a psychology major and love the psychology department. They try to not only help us learn, but focus on helping us to become better individuals and foster important virtues. Some say SNU is restrictive, but they care about values and they care about their students. The only issue I've had is getting things figured out in the business office and financial aid office, but besides that, I love it. Southern Nazarene University was the best choice for me."
Sophomore,4,I have just enrolled and went to an introductory night.  It was very well organized and was moved by the whole experience of being there.  I would recommend this college to anyone.
Sophomore,4,"So far I have loved my experience here at Southern Nazarene University. I am not only challenged in my academics but in my spiritual life. I am welcomed and have personal relationships with my professors who genuinely care for me and my peers, and our successes. We also have a lot of great on-campus activities and events that allow for more friendships and getting connected with other students."
Junior,4,"I enjoy going to SNU, but there are some things that I think are lacking. The dorms are okay, but they are not very clean. The professors are good, but they tend to be kind of biased. The food isn't all that good unless there are visitors on campus."
Freshman,4,Great Community! Lots of opportunities to be involved. The professors are invested in the students educations and are very approachable.
Sophomore,4,"I think it could advance in technological application to things such as paying your bills and receiving scholarships., as well as communication between departments."
Junior,4,I have really enjoyed my experience so far with SNU. The financial department is difficult to get a hold of a majority of the time but the rest of the staff is extremely helpful and want to see their students grow and learn.
Niche User,4,I really like Southern Nazarene because overall it is a small campus and the people there are very welcoming. I really like the biology department and think they have great opportunities. I think having a cadaver lab is neat because not many college students get the opportunity to work on cadavers. Getting this experience will help me in my career. One thing I wish was different at SNU is that I wish the soccer fields were on campus.
Freshman,4,My experience at SNU has been really good.I have made really good friends and have really good teachers.My grades have been really good and I have a really good school schedule so I can do things.The thing I would change is the price of this school because they have really good programs but it cost a lot of money.
Sophomore,4,"I like the small-town atmosphere of SNU, as well as the accessibility of the professors. I you need help or advice on anything, every professor I've had is willing and able to assist."
Alum,4,The atmosphere at this school is phenomenal. The professors and faculty are personable and eager to help. Every professor I encountered radiated positivity and made me feel as though they wanted my success as much as I did. The campus is lovely and easy to navigate. The library is incredible and the staff there are knowledgeable and friendly. My overall experience at this school was extremely positive.
Freshman,4,"At first, I wasn't feeling too comfortable about SNU. Then, After being here for a couple months I actually really enjoy it. The meal plans are great. They know college kids can eat so offer us free food with two different cafes. The size is a really good part as well, You are close to all your professors and classmates and are able to get help during office hours. The events the campus throws is a great experience as well. They always have fun games around campus where you can meet new people and build a bigger friend group. The library is a good spot on our campus for essays or homework or to study. A two story building that has different zones for your need. A quiet zone, And a normal zone. It never really seems like a hangout spot until you and your friends go and get some Starbucks (Which I just started drinking this year) and study for hours. Overall, it is a great school, with great people and I love it."
Freshman,4,Southern Nazarene University is a very welcoming school. It does not take long to feel at home. Because it is a small university the community that it offers is outstanding.
College Freshman,4,"Class sizes are great, professors are great, classes are well timed, faculty wants me to succeed."
College Freshman,4,The value of my degree is on par with anyone else's. Employers are on campus frequently looking for the best in their department.
College Freshman,4,Boys dorms are not in the best shape but resident life is phenomenal.
College Senior,4,Living on campus it a great experience.  The campus is small so getting to class or anywhere on campus is very convenient and done with ease.
College Sophomore,4,I feel pretty safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,There is little or no crime on campus and I always feel very safe.
College Freshman,4,It's very spacious! The community is a great living environment.
College Freshman,4,Everyone has been helpful and friendly. It's a great community to live in!
College Sophomore,4,"Many people, after graduating, are able to get jobs in their field."
College Sophomore,4,The school is very safe. There are very few issues when it comes to safety.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Campus is small and well lit.  It is in a great/safe part of a small town. All dorms have ID badge scanners.  There 24/7 security and a security van, which can occasionally be creepy if you're out jogging the perimeter of campus and you see a large white van sitting there.  I feel comfortable walking alone on campus, even from one side to the other at 1am.  I don't think theft is as big as what it is at a lot of colleges, but does still happen.  Security tries to keep weird people from the public off of the campus. SNU is an alcohol/drug free campus, but I've heard there are a few times students do try to have it on campus anyway, but it isn't exactly a ""party"". During 5 years I know of a couple girls who were sexually assaulted and subsequently pregnant and administration told them they had to leave and were not supported by administration, but were supported by counseling, but little consequence for boys."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Career center looks over resumes, provides practice interviews, and has a good amount of information on part-time flexible student jobs.  Not as much information about full-time jobs after graduation unless it is in business, education, or theology, but do provide resume & interview skill sessions."
College Freshman,4,The University I chose is a smaller one so I am able to talk with professors more and get the help I need and make friends easier.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I never felt unsafe while at SNU. The area around SNU is not the best, but I never once felt like I was in any danger."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Southern Nazarene University was a place of growing for me as a maturing Christian and as a person learning how to live out my faith in the profession that I wanted to pursue. I felt that I was well equipped from my classes and rotations as an athletic training student. I was able to land a position as an athletic trainer at a premier physical therapy clinic I had completed a summer rotation at before graduating. As a result of my education at SNU, I have been able to excel at my current position and am about to pursue a Doctorate of Physical Therapy beginning in the summer of this year. I am very grateful for how my experiences, professors, and rigorous curriculum have molded me into a professional."
College Freshman,4,At the beginning of your freshman year you are given the sexual assault talk. They start it off by taking the girls to one building and the boys to another building.
College Freshman,4,"Graduating with a bachelor degree in athletic training from SNU will allow me to work in a clinic, school, or professional team."
College Freshman,4,I wouldn't know about the living style due to the fact that I don't live on campus.
College Freshman,4,"Before we start school, we sign a Lifestyle Covenant that says we agree to not par take in alcohol or drugs. I'm sure that there are still some students that use them, but I don't hear or see it. The rules are strict but it's to keep us safe."
College Freshman,4,I've never felt unsafe on campus. During the day there is always someone around. At night the campus is well lit and there is a security van driving around.
College Freshman,4,Classes are a decent size. There are many different types of classes to take.
College Freshman,4,There are several times throughout the year where they have career fairs and they are really good about posting job opportunities.
College Freshman,4,Applying and getting a dorm room is pretty easy. Dorm rooms are normal sized and clean. They are close to classes and have a great social aspect.
College Freshman,4,"Because the school moved up to NCAA Division 2, there is an entire new level of competition. This a huge challenge for our sports teams. Football just won it's first game in 3 years... If the teams would move back down to NAIA I think that there would be more student involvement"
College Freshman,4,"Many friendly people, great atmosphere, and fun events"
College Freshman,4,"I am currently going part time because of my living situation, so I have only had a few classes. So far, it's great. I really like the variety of courses and the professors seem to really care about individuals. The class sizes are small, which I enjoy and everyone is really friendly."
College Freshman,4,"The most popular sport at SNU is basketball and that shows in fan support. Other sports like football and soccer are definitely popular and have a following of other students and their families. However, basketball is the main attraction, athletics-wise. We always have a large student section at the games and they are actively involved in the game."
College Freshman,4,"I love going to school at SNU because it has such a positive environment. We begin some classes with a devotional and we pray at the end of cheer practice. The professors are passionate about the subjects they teach and they genuinely care about individual students well being inside and outside the classroom. I love being part of a university where I don't just feel like another number, but an individual."
College Senior,4,"They don't emphasize the adult learners enough, even though the adult programs float the school."
College Senior,4,"It was very unique in that they believe in community and getting everyone involved. Since it is a small school many of the faculty get to know you personally, which is great."
College Junior,4,"I really like the food, but there aren't that many options. However, next year they are adding more dining options, like a Baja Jack's. I love the Starbucks on campus, but this year they limited our flex money for that from $250 to $125. I wish we still had more since I'm paying a lot."
College Freshman,4,The school has several in place for the students safety.
College Freshman,4,So far so good. The school has an internship program for Theology students.
College Freshman,4,"Don't apply late in the year, apply for financial aid as soon as possible!"
College Freshman,4,Swadleys is great! There is also a sonic fairly close by.
College Freshman,4,I've never felt unsafe on campus.
College Freshman,4,"On campus housing is a great way to meet your classmates, and reslife will do events every once in awhile."
College Sophomore,4,You feel watched most of the time by campus police
College Sophomore,4,We all about Jesus here.
Sophomore,2,"My experience at SNU was a varied one. It was mainly ruined due to the athletic departments poor handling of my transfer situation, as well as my coach. If you don’t fit into the traditional “christian” bubble, it’s hard to fit in here. The food is also awful. But otherwise, good professors and helpful staff."
Sophomore,2,"I didn’t take online courses purposefully but was forced to due to the covid situation. Some of my professors were helpful, others were not at all. Many expected the same amount of effort and capability as before the pandemic which was unreasonable due to the circumstances. But many were respondent to me asking for help, even if I had to push."
Freshman,2,"Professores dont seem to care if you are strugling with coursework or not, seams like they are there just for a paycheck."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The administration was really into the school athletics from switching from NAIA to Division II.  The sports teams ended up playing schools several times bigger. Additionally, D II rules have effected non-athletics too, such as professors who are also involved in a local church can't give students a ride to church or there are professors who can't eat lunch off campus with students because it can be seen as favoritism in the D II world.  Football is slowly getting better.  Basketball is the best.  I think there is most fan/student support around basketball. The football field, soccer field, and tennis courts are just okay.  The baseball/softball facility, basketball facility, gym/workout space are excellent.  There is even a swimming pool.  The school even has an English & Western equestrian team.  There are constantly a variety of intramural sports durng the year which are popular with students."
Recent Alumnus,2,Almost non employers recruitment almost non existent
Recent Alumnus,2,"Southern Nazarene is a very expensive university. I served over 20 years in the military so I was able to use my Post 911 benefit. The curriculum was filled with a lot of ""busy"" work, however, I did manage to learn a thing or two. My main problem concerns the Business office. As I said earlier, I used my military benifits and made payments directly to the business office. Each time i made a payment, I recived a balance. I went into the office to make my last payment and was told that I was good to go and only payment remaining was from the government. Much to my surprise, when it was time to graduate, I didn't receive my diploma. After calling the registrars and business office a total of six times, I was told that I still owed over $1500. I was irate since I was told earlier that my portion of the account was paid in full. I was simply told that an accountant in the business office, the same person who told me my account was paid in full, made a mistake. She apologized and told me she ""understand how I feel"" but still stuck me with an $800 bill for a mistake they made."
College Freshman,2,They just want to get someone in trouble for the most part.
College Freshman,2,There is definitely a shortage of parking on campus
College Freshman,2,"They do not carry the major that I have, but do have a variety of other majors"
College Freshman,2,"There are good off campus housing options, but one has to find such places"
College Freshman,2,"They give you financial aid, but the school itself cost so much that it doesn't matter"
College Freshman,2,"The facilities, school support, and coaching needs to improve."
College Freshman,2,"There are just certain groups of people who hangout together; if you are not in that group you are just there
"
College Freshman,2,"The quality of food without a doubt could be better, and the cafeteria could stay open longer."
College Senior,2,Athletes and the rest of the student body are not typically in each other's circles.  Fan support is great at men's basketball games and that's about it.  People attend when they think other people will attend.  It's not about sports. It's about being seen.
College Senior,2,Network Reliability – The network is frequently down for maintenance and often interferes with meeting deadlines when students need to access the online library.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I do not have a car and getting around outside of campus is very limited. I usually have to call a taxi, which can get expensive. Transportation should be provided for students for free or for a small fare."
College Senior,2,"We have dorms, but their aren't any fraternities or sororities on campus."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much transportation around campus, considering we are a small town. Most everyone here has their own cars, and if they dont' they friends give them rides."
College Sophomore,2,"The options that we have here on campus are reasonable, but they have gotten old. I don't like to eat much here on campus because the options don't change. We have the same five lines to choose from each day. It's not fair."
Sophomore,1,"I believe it may just be me, but online school was awful for me. I almost failed most of my classes because I couldn't handle it. One professor even refused to help me when I told her that I couldn't understand the material in her class."
Niche User,1,This school has been trying to charge me an outlandish fee after being completely graduated from the program in 2015. Now I am getting collection call and no one can tell me where the fees came from just out of thin air 8000 worth of fees but none of them for cclasses. To make matters worse the person over the Nursing department rude and instead of trying to help she basically said ole well and hung up in my face. The program was great for the working adult but they will try and get over on you financially beware!!
Sophomore,1,Bullying is a huge problem in some of the female athletic departments.  Coaches encourage an attitude of entitlement among some of the athletes
Graduate Student,1,"this school is not really for African American students, they really do not accept us. my time here were not favorable due to the discrimination and experience. I had to change from nursing to another degree just to graduate, they were cruel and I did notunderstand it. I attended other colleges and never experienced this so this was a nightmare, but my faith got me through it. I meet beautiful people here but my overall experience was terrible and I pray No one experience what I experience here at this college no matter your race or background."
Alum,1,"After you graduate no one cares or wants to help. The campus life is only made for people that are Nazarene. The Prophesers seem to care, but at the end of the day, I'm not sure they do."
College Freshman,1,There is no engineering program so I am forced to be a physics major
College Freshman,1,There are so many rules on campus some people just leave after one semester
College Freshman,1,There are no sororities or fraternities in this university
College Freshman,1,There is no kind of parties what so ever around the campus
College Senior,1,"Because we are a Christian university, parties do not get advertised.  If they happen, they happen quietly."
College Junior,1,Punishments Are Pretty Severe – Have to take classes and be watched and evaluated..
College Sophomore,1,Very Strict – They are very strict about the life covenant at SNU. You can get kicked out or fined very fast if you dont follow the rules.
College Junior,1,True Love! You probably won't find true love here! There isn't much selection. Everybody dates everybody and everybody knows your business.

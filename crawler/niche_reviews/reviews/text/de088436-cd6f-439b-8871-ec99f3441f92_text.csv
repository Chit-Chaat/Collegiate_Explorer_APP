Graduate Student,5,"Saint Martin's has been very welcoming as an international student. The MBA program has an impressive selection of knowledgeable lecturers.  SMU also has an emphasis on Global management which is essential to remain competitive in the business environment. Situated close to bars, restaurants and shops there are many things to do on campus and around the local area. The graduate admissions team was very helpful and made my application process seamless."
Alum,5,"Wonderful community with small classes allowing your professors to get to know each student and are invested in their students success. The community is incredibly supportive, fun, and accepting."
Freshman,5,"My overall experience with Saint Martin's University was absolutely transformational. Currently, I am finishing up my first-year of my undergraduate degree here at SMU and I never felt more at home. There are so many opportunities to get involved on campus which helps you form special interpersonal and professional connections that will last a lifetime. Truly, this community is so supportive. I have made one of the best decisions of my life once I committed to this school"
Alum,5,"A true ""Home away from home."" I just recently graduated from Saint Martin's, and this university has left such an impact on me. Not only did I find some life-long friends of mine that I will cherish forever, but I also received an amazing education in classroom environments that allowed me to learn and connect with the material. There are some parties off-campus, but that's not the focus of the school, and the Campus Life department has some fun events on campus so there's always something to do! Some examples: Casino Night, Spring Fest, Open Mic Nights, Meet a Hypnotist or Magician nights, and MORE! With everyone that you meet at the school, you really see that Saint Martin's ""walks the walk"", instead of just ""talking the talk."" I did have to take some loans out to afford the tuition, but in the end it was definitely worth it and I know that I made a great investment in choosing this school for my undergraduate degree."
Graduate Student,5,"Saint Martin's University has very supportive staff and classmates. Their academics are great, as well as their safety. I highly recommend this school for anyone deciding to go to college."
Sophomore,5,"When interacting with the faculty and admissions office during application and recruitment they are so honest and supportive, really showing how much they care about every individual student and their path to success."
Freshman,5,"Overall the students and faculty are some of the kindest people I have met. I love the diversity and mix of diffrent personalitys you get to experiance there. Everyone is super kind and very helpful, the student body is there for one another and staff is always there to anwser all you questions along with help you on your journey."
Sophomore,5,I have never found advisors and professors as helpful as the ones at Saint Martin's. They go above and beyond to take care of their students. Excited to start taking nursing classes!
Sophomore,5,"Saint Martin’s University is one of the most magnificent places I have ever been to in my life. There is no other university I would want to get my Bachelor’s Degree at then here at SMU. I am currently a sophomore at SMU and my first year was amazing. I had some ups and downs but through those downs I was able to overcome all of them with the help from the resources provided at the institution and the amazing students and faculty there to support their fellow Saint. The university offers a variety of activities for their students from clubs, intramural sports, to study sessions, and many other events and activities. The academics and the educators are of top tier teaching. I always felt I could ask for help when I was struggling and never once thought i was getting a lack of education at SMU. overall, Saint Martin’s University is the school for me and I guarantee that there are many students out there who feel the same way."
Freshman,5,Everything about SMU is so amazing. The atmosphere around the school and each and every student makes you love school more and more everyday.
Freshman,5,I have gone to camps and love the atmosphere. I have never had a negative experience on this campus and always feel safe. The food is amazing and the campus is beautiful.
Sophomore,5,"Well I am a transfer sophomore and this fall will be my first year attending Saint Martin's University. I haven't attended any classes yet but the tour around campus was very cool. The architecture of this school and the overall scenery when you're walking around is very neat. I'm staying at the Burton hall apartment this year and my campus guide told me that these apartments here at Saint Martins have some of the biggest dorms in the western hemisphere. I guarantee that you will love the cafeteria here, it provides a huge variety of different foods. All dishes are very good and the cafeteria provide a lot of healthy, organic meals for students. It even provides brunch every weekend."
Junior,5,The faculty are well versed in their areas and the career center is more than willing to assist in preparing you for the job search.
Freshman,5,I love the community here and it is easy to access great academic help as well as making a difference in the school campus.  I am able to grow as an individual and become an overall better person.
Alum,5,"SMU gives many scholarships. The community is close-knit. My classes were small, and there was plenty of support. I had excellent professors! 

After graduation, I got a job in my field and was able to be successful because of SMU's strong academics.  Seven years later, I still love my profession!"
Freshman,5,Saint Martin's university is an excellent school with great people on campus. Everyone here are nice.
Freshman,5,Saint Martin's University is an excellent school. I'm so glad I applied and got accepted to SMU. The environment is beautiful and very safe for us students. I'm excited to be starting my college life at SMU this Fall. I look forward to meet the wonderful people that will be part of my educational journey at SMU. GO SAINTS!
Junior,5,"Saint Martin's is all about COMMUNITY. The core values are lived out in the lives of faculty and students alike.  Everyone feels welcomed and known.  The small class sizes allow for one on one with professors and extra help when needed.  There are a variety of majors for all people.  With a coffee shop located on campus, and some pretty great cafe food, you are sure to make Saint Martin's University feel like home."
Freshman,5,Saint Martins University is a welcoming place with rigorous academics. The teachers are fully understanding of most situations and are capable of giving advise on college life and life in general. They also have a healthy amount of open office hours and will also adhere to your schedule if absolutely necessary.
Junior,5,Small school means that everyone knows everyone and it is easy to make great connections with your professors.  My biggest class so far has been 32 students.
Senior,5,"Saint Martin's is listed as a top 100 regional university college because of its closed knit community that is bound by faith, its campus size, and shared goals and interests. The support I have received as a Saint student has been warm and tremendously helpful to my success."
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere it is very calming and friendly, the staff is absolutely amazing and has time do get to know every student instead of only know you by name or word association, it is an open campus but closed at the same time, as in it is open to all but closed off from the world where you cannot hear the cars passing by but instead see deer roaming the school grounds. There is many places you can go to relax or go to hang out with your friends. I would not change anything about this school except for the price, the price is high but this is a private university so it is about average for any other private university."
College Sophomore,5,"I love staying in the residence halls, the people make it feel just like home."
College Sophomore,5,"Our fans always color coordinate their outfits in the stands, as well as, bring huge posters in support of our athletes."
College Sophomore,5,I have really enjoyed my first year at my University.
College Sophomore,5,Most of the professors are really great but of course theirs a few who arent the best at teaching/
College Sophomore,5,"It's a very community oriented school. Its very small so everyone knows everyone, which is nice for making friends and connecting with teachers."
College Freshman,5,"The Campus Safety is helpful, and there are Police departments and Fire Departments near campus. Also the Counselling center is a safe place to be able to talk with someone when you need it"
College Freshman,5,"There is not a huge variety of classes, but the class sizes are small and professors are available to help in any way they can."
College Freshman,5,The best resident halls are Parson's Hall and Spangler Hall. They are the newest and cleanest. the Learning communities are wonderful for first-years!
College Freshman,5,"This school Is wonderful. There is a strong sense of community and an environment that focuses on the growth of the individual. Especially in academics, relations with others, and overall personal growth. Yes, it is a small school. Class options are limited for some majors and there isn't a huge party/ social scene. However the quality of the education is high. My class sizes as a first- year range from 12 - 20 students. The professors know who you are, what your goals are and are willing and ready to help you when you need it. These connections with faculty can help with careers and internships. My opinion is that these things are far more important than a busy social life."
College Junior,5,The school spirit is great even though I don't participate in the sports. I feel like I am a part of the team just being there.
College Junior,5,I AM ACCOMPLISHING MY DREAM!!!
College Junior,5,"I have had no problem getting questions answered or problems fixed, in person or over the phone. Several times when I have called, someone has picked it up within one ring!"
College Junior,5,"I am not vegan and can have gluten so I'm not sure about those options quite as much but I do know that the options are plentiful and fairly reasonable. Some places give student discounts, but I feel as if they all should. Late night dining is not bad either, but I cannot expect every restaurant to stay open all night."
College Junior,5,It is a beautiful area with plenty of incredible people very willing to help! I really enjoy it and I have intentions to live here after college!
College Junior,5,"I live about ten minutes away and love the entire area. There is so much to do and it is a beautiful area. The pricing can vary however, so finding a price in your budget can be difficult but it is possible to find one!"
College Junior,5,It is a no-alcohol campus. You are not allowed to have alcohol on the campus and they enforce this. They are extremely thorough with each and every rule and guideline that needs to be followed and do it in such a way that you still have respect for them.
College Junior,5,"Admissions, counselors and advisers are extremely helpful when it comes to finding a major that best fits you and your career to success. It's not rare here to be out and working right after college after just four years of schooling! Saint Martin's prepares students well for the real world."
College Junior,5,"SMU has one of the prettiest campuses in the state of Washington, if you ask me. There is a lot of green space, nice trees, and well maintained outdoor spaces. In addition, outdoor spaces are constantly being upgraded for greater aesthetic appeal. There are great hiking/biking trails that weave all over campus. Even though these trails are open to the community, they feel very safe. Overall, I enjoy the look and feel of campus. "
College Sophomore,5,"I love the dry campus. The public safety is very proactive about trying to make sure that people adhere to this, especially those underaged."
College Sophomore,5,"There is a great REC center with a weight room, track, and space for sports like volleyball and basketball."
College Freshman,5,This campus is a dry campus where alcohol is not allowed. This is really good because there are not much problems and the dorm is always a safe place for students.
College Freshman,5,"I personally dont have a car or need the parking lots. However, I have noticed that there is always space. Never does one have to worry about having to park somewhere else because there is always an open lot."
College Sophomore,5,Living in Washington means that we deal with a lot of rain and the occasional snow. The rain doesn't bother me at all. When it does snow we are quick to cancel school or at least delay classes. The classes are not that far apart compared to other schools I have been to.
College Freshman,5,"You have multiple options to go to and get something to eat. Late night is located in the dorms, cafe is open from breakfast-lunch and again at dinner time and the coffee stand is open all day as well."
College Senior,5,"As far as I know, there isn't much of one.  There certainly are parties and fun activities, but I'm not aware of ""underage nightlife""....although I would not likely to be invited to such events."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the housing at Saint Martin's University! Having worked for the housing department myself, I know how engaged the housing life is in making our college experience 100 percent positive.  The dorms are clean and definately a comfortable living experience!"
College Junior,5,"English Is My Way – As a English Major, people always question why would i choose that but honestly I choose it because the faculity at this school made it easier and much funner to learn. I get to have one on one time with my teachers if I did not understand what was taught. Being a student I wasnt forced into having to choose a major right away they actualy let me choose and give me time to explore other majors."
College Junior,5,"A Lot to See – Washington state is a good place to be there are alot of things to do in so little time. If you like twillight then Forks, WA is a great place to visit. Since Saint martins is located 10 minutes away fromt the states caplitol there are a lot of site seeing to do. if you wqould like to travel we have a\our famous space needle and wale watching and whats cool is you can take ferries and water taxies to different islands located in WA. Also we are about 3 hours from canada and 2 hours from portland oregon."
College Junior,5,"Social Life – Everyone at this school treats one anotehr like family, it is one big community. This may be a smaal school but you will find that the teachers are more deidcated to you and your sucess tha the other big colleges. There are many different clutures and many different types of people that attened this school. Its really nice to see the diveresity going on in this community."
College Senior,5,"Campus Is Clean, Visibly – You don't see people use drugs or alcohol but I am sure there is use, just minimal."
College Senior,5,There is always parking available whether it is by the staircase or by the pavillion.  It is not a bad walk to Harned Hall and up a few flights of stairs to Old Main.  We do not pay an additional fee for parking it is included in tuition.
College Sophomore,5,Must Go – The experience that I received from attending Saint Martin's University was one of the best that I have ever had. The people there make the experience one that I recommend to everyone. The overall atmosphere of the campus is great as well because the area that the university is located is laid back and suburban area.
College Sophomore,5,Feels Like Home – I feel completely safe on campus. I know I can trust all members of the faculty and staff and the location of the campus itself sets it up so that students are kept sheltered from the dangers that can be found in the outside community.
College Sophomore,5,"Progressive, Interacting – All students get involved in every event on campus and everybody gets along with each other and our communities."
College Sophomore,5,Love It! Why would I be taking my major if I didn't enjoy the classes and the learning material involved?
College Sophomore,5,I chose St. Martin's because of the curriculum and culture I would be getting.
College Junior,5,"Permit Costs – Unlike many schools, our parking permits are free, which is deeply appreciated!"
College Junior,5,Recreation Center – The rec center is an amazing facility that is always clean and comfortable to work out in! It's perfect for our small school.
Graduate Student,4,Online learning is new to SMU. So far my experience has been varied with some lecturers being very proficient. I understand that this will only improve over time.
Freshman,4,"Due to COVID, classes were taught online for about half of the spring semester. Most of my classes transitioned smoothly with minimal hiccups; other classes did not do very well. I suspect this was due to the unexpected shift from in-person to online, but it is still worth mentioning."
Freshman,4,"Saint Martin's University is a very friendly, academic environment. If you are a hard-working student, you will thrive here."
Sophomore,4,Some teachers don’t understand how the internet works but other than that they all try their best to help.
Sophomore,4,Everything is great about the school. I am an athlete who has a coach that goes above and beyond for me which is a characteristic that is very common among the staff here . I just wish I had more money to enjoy the full experience without the stress of paying for school.
Junior,4,"I liked how many opportunities there were me to grow as a leader on campus. From on campus jobs to Student Association positions and clubs there are so many ways to get involved on campus! Saint Martin’s is the true definition of a small school. So if you’re looking for small class sizes, a community feel, and a place to call home for the next 4 years you’re in the right place."
Freshman,4,"Saint Martin's is a really nice school, tons of people that are friendly and would help you. There really shouldn't be anything to change if the students do their own things. We walk around a lot. I just wish the dorms were little closer to each other and closer to everything."
Sophomore,4,"I love the size of campus. It is small enough to where you recognize a majority of the students and faculty, but big enough to where you meet new people often. The community of campus is extremely inviting and inclusive."
Freshman,4,"I like the gym, the opportunities, and the quality of the courses I took. However, I do not agree with the beliefs and motives of particular courses being pushed for. For example, any courses that involve Gender Studies."
Freshman,4,"Love the environment, it feels so safe. Very inclusive and really makes you feel comfortable in your home away from home."
Freshman,4,I am going to be going to Saint Martins University in the Fall of 2019 I have visited the campus and it was so pretty. The school is a nice small college that is surrounded by stores and everything you need. But one thing I don't like is that their is no Alaska Federal Credit union near it so your gonna need to find a different bank.
Freshman,4,From my first year her i have had an enjoyable experience from the classroom to time with my friends it is a very inviting and welcoming atmosphere around the school.
Freshman,4,"Saint Martin's is a small community oriented college. Like all environments/locations, the people make the place. The quality of your experience at this university will very likely depend on the students you would choose to surround yourself with as well as your involvement on campus (clubs, attending events, etc.) Because of the small student body, even freshmen can obtain leadership positions on campus."
Freshman,4,"Being a student from Saint Martin's, I was able to learn and grow as a person and a leader. I learned to value the Benedictine Values -- hospitality, community living,  incorporating those values throughout my daily life. Overall, it is a very great school that influences kindness."
Niche User,4,"I've visited the school on many occasions, both for camp and to visit the school. People there are always nice and smiling. It seems like a tight knit community that reminds me a lot of my home. We have shown up once where the girls in the dorms who were supposed to talk to us were smoking, but besides that we've never had an encounter with drugs and alcohol there."
Senior,4,I like the Student Life at Saint Martin's University. I would change the lack of transparency among the higher administration to students and faculty.
Sophomore,4,"Good experience so far, the profs are nice and the offices are easy to find. My only complaint would be that the school year seems to be frequently changing and most classes are planned around the same couple hours so its hard to fit all the classes you need into one semester."
Freshman,4,"At Saint Martin's University everyone is very accepting. The social events that the school offers are amazing, everyone is very involved. I have so much fun living on campus, spending time with the staff members, and engaging in the athletic events. Saint Martin's is a school that is very involved with their students, they genuinely care about the wellbeing of their students. I have never seen or been apart of a school that cares so much about their students. Even though Saint Martin's is amazing I believe that they could offer more ethnically diverse events."
Sophomore,4,"I love the small campus vibe. When it came for me to decide where to go to school, I wanted a place that was friendly and has a genuine community. That is exactly what happened to me when I first visited SMU. Random strangers greeted my Dad and I, always telling us ""hello"" or 'good morning""."
Sophomore,4,"With my my first year complete, my overall expierience has been pretty good. My professors have always gone above and beyond when I've needed help. Being a small school, I have also had the privilege of forming relationships with my professors and getting to know them better, in addition to normal class time. We can talk about our intrests and where we're from, instead of talking strictly academics."
Freshman,4,Saint Martin's University is a small campus with a huge amount of diversity. It is rooted in core values and the classes are small.
Freshman,4,"I did an online course at this school, and I had a great experience. The professor was always available. I never got to visit the campus, but the lessons online were always clear and concise."
Junior,4,"I love Saint Martin's University. I really feel like part of the community. There is an abundance of resources for the students to be successful. There are constantly student activities and various clubs to keep students busy. The food is decent which is nice since I live on campus and eat there for most of my meals. The courses I have taken so far have been very entertaining and the professors are easily accessible. I have met a variety of different people from many different backgrounds. I enjoy the diversity. From some of the people I have talked too, I have learned a few things that could change. It would be nice and convenient for some students if there was child care. Not only would it be helpful for the parents, but would provide an opportunity for various majors to have access to children for potential studies or observation. Overall however, I love Saint Martins. They provide many scholarship opportunities to make the school an affordable place to go."
Freshman,4,"Saint Martin's University is a school that strives to be for the students, with the students. The school has great professors, good financial aid, and a good campus. However the school is strict when it comes to partying and has a tendency to not be reliable when it comes to getting the help you need."
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors are always helpful and the students are so friendly and including.
Recent Alumnus,4,"My only problem attending this school has been advising. Their advising processes are atrocious and that has been a struggle. Besides that, it is a wonderful community and support system."
College Sophomore,4,"There could be more variety in the classes offered, but the courses provided and the professors are great!"
College Sophomore,4,"Engineering and natural science students have great connections after they graduate, however computer science and psychology majors are a little less privileged."
College Sophomore,4,There are many supportive measures on campus for student and faculty safety.
College Senior,4,I feel very safe and we get a lot of training and resources for all types of health and safety issues.
College Senior,4,It's rated #1 in Return to Investment in Washington State. And the Career Center rocks!
College Senior,4,I've loved living on campus and enjoy all the residence halls.
College Senior,4,"My school is small and is a home away from home. I love that when I get up in the morning, though my class is only five minutes away, it takes me 15 minutes to get there because of all the people who stop and talk to me on the way!"
College Sophomore,4,We have very observant public safety and I never feel threatened or afraid.
College Sophomore,4,They make a big effort to connect students to people in their future careers.
College Sophomore,4,Its very clean and nice. Some dorms have certain perks than others.
College Freshman,4,"Student involvement in varsity games is not always exceptional. Intramurals are enjoyed by many, and preferred by a lot of the students. the facilities are great, they are great for both athletes, and non-athletes"
College Junior,4,I enjoy the diversity and the academic support.
College Junior,4,"There is a lot of variety, options for everyone. Some of the food that tastes the best is pricier, but hey that's just how it goes."
College Senior,4,They are very serious about student safety.
College Junior,4,There is very good food offered and I personally enjoy the variety. I am very satisfied with this school food-wise.
College Junior,4,Getting into my program was not too bad. My grades are very good so I really did not have to worry about getting in much at all though. My program is well worth it!
College Junior,4,Everyone is very friendly and outgoing. It is easy to make friends and get along with people as well.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I definitely enjoy the surrounding, and even more so like the people around here"
College Junior,4,"I love the academics. I haven't had any issues with my professors so far, they're all great in their own way. The curriculm is good. The registration process can be a bit annoying and I don't think it is explained well. Also, I never know what classes are being offered each semester because although there is a course listing, it seems out of date and many classes are no longer offered while current classes aren't on their either. So, I feel like I miss out on what could be great classes. The workload is horrible, it just seems like a college level workload; it all depends on the class and the class level, not to mention the professor."
College Junior,4,"They are strict to a degree, such as no drinking or alcohol of any kind on campus, no drugs, and after a certain time no fraternizing. (i.e. no boys in a girls room and vice versa). It never seems too strict that its restricting. It's more at the level it should be to keep students safe and really to keep things simple."
College Senior,4,The security staff is wonderful at what they do and keep the campus very safe
College Freshman,4,The school is very diverse and open to everyone. Most students interact with others no matter who they are or how they live their life.
College Freshman,4,"I thought it was great that I was given a scholarship of $11,000 a year that I didn't know existed. Upon my acceptance I was notified that I received this since I was eligible for it. In order for me to keep the scholarship, my grades have to be in good shape all four years."
College Freshman,4,The location of Saint Martin's is around the main part of Lacey. There are quite a few of places to shop and hang out.
College Freshman,4,The students are very involved and show great support along with school spirit.
College Junior,4,The school offers some really good scholarships to those that are academically strong and in need of financial assistance.
College Junior,4,I think we have a pretty diverse campus!
College Junior,4,Some days it's REALLY rainy but then there are REALLY sunny days; they balance each other out!
College Junior,4,There is lots to choose from!
College Junior,4,I really like the small class sizes!
College Junior,4,There are scholarships everywhere. There are always workers in the Financial Office that are eager to help you find scholarships.
College Junior,4,Cheaper and convenient but freshman have to live on campus for at least two school years!
College Junior,4,It's very enjoyable and professors are extra helpful!
College Junior,4,"Lacey is a small town but in the middle of Seattle and/or Portland. So driving or catching the bus to one of these big cities, is always fun!"
College Junior,2,"The school is okay if you're choosing to enroll in either engineering or education (both of which also have issues, but are more funded than any other program at the school). However, if you choose any other major be prepared for subpar supplies in lab (if you even have enough lab equipment) and issues preparing for life after school. Like any school, some professors are absolutely amazing and make class both enjoyable and easy to learn, and other professors should consider another profession. The financial aid is pretty good, just make sure to regularly keep in touch with them so that there are no surprises. Also, make sure to really get a jump on registering for classes, and have a backup schedule handy to change to in case the classes are cancelled or more likely moved into another time slot after you register that you can't fit into the schedule."
College Senior,2,Nothing going on. Campus is pretty quiet. You have to know the right people to go to the parties.
College Freshman,2,"I stay in and play Magic the Gathering, because that's all there is to do."
College Freshman,2,"The Bon Appetite company has to stick to their recipes, but they all taste the same. The food isn't spectacular, but at least there's an ice cream machine. Dinner is unlimited, but the two hour time spans for each meal time is pretty terrible. Breakfast starts at 7:30 till 9, for example. "
College Junior,2,There is very little to do around campus unless you have a car.
College Freshman,2,"Public transportation closed at around 11 o'clock at night. Saint Martin's University does not supply transportation anywhere (besides to the airport for a small cost). However, Saint Martin's University has free parking which allows students to bring their own cars for no fees."
College Freshman,2,It rains for most of the fall and winter and stays cold up until march or April. You definitely need to buy a raincoat.
College Sophomore,2,there are days where its hard to go to class because of the rain and snow but its all about dedication!
College Senior,2,Below Standards – A lot of the departments have changed and I think that has really downgraded the experience at Saint Martin's University. New staffing means that people need to be trained and are failing to do their jobs correctly.
College Junior,2,Cars Are the Best. There are local bus routes every hour but weekends hard to find the right time. people living pretty far no bus is the right fit. Must have a car for transportation
College Sophomore,2,"Strict Rules Not Severely Enforced – Policies are pretty strict but not necessarily enforced very heavily.  For example, there is no drinking allowed on campus and you cannot have anyone of the opposite sex in your room after 1 am. However, if you are not excessively obvious and obnoxious about your activities, you usually don't get in trouble. As far as I've heard, first and sometimes further offenses are not punished very strictly either."
College Sophomore,2,"Could Use Some Improvement – Dealing with the Office of Financial Aid can be a frustrating process. The people are generally nice, but it can be hard to get in contact with them. It has also taken a very long time for paperwork to be processed, in the past, which can cause a lot of stress and complications. There are scholarships available through the school, but it would be helpful if there were more options. I have also had trouble with receiving federal work study, although I am qualified to receive it, and this has made it extremely difficult for me to find a job on campus. I am still struggling to afford to come back to St. Martin's. I would suggest talking with the Career Center about scholarship opportunities and checking Saints 4 Hire. Outside scholarships can serve you well."
College Sophomore,2,"There are quite a few options in close reach to the campus. There aren't many places that offer or at least advertise any discounts for students. I really don't eat off campus very much, because I try to make use of my meal plan as much as possible."
College Junior,2,"There are many different types of men and women at St. Martin's. I would not attend here to date though, a bigger school would be better for that."
College Sophomore,2,"Dying Night Life – the security has cracked down as of 2011, last year was great. all parties are off campus and when you come back expect security. dorm hopping is always fun when drunk/high"
College Freshman,2,The academics are great just wish there was more things to do on and off campus
College Freshman,2,The parking options arent the best and the Public Safety are too strict on fines. They dont even give people a chance.
College Freshman,2,"Dining Options Off-Campus – There isnt much to choose from off campus. They are all crapy fast food place, but then again I dont have a car to explore my options."
College Senior,2,It's Alright – Small schools tend to lack a good athletics program. The biggest sport is men's basketball which provides lots of school spirit and community involvement. The recreation center attracts many students housing activities from intramural events to personal fitness.
College Sophomore,2,"The Apartments Off Campus Seem Nice – The off-campus apartments seem to be nice, but I live with my parents, so I do not have much of an opinion."
Junior,1,Horrible horrible time here. Public safety are absolutely horrendous. If you like having fun at all do not come here. Also financial aid is constantly messing up and being confusing not only that but they aren’t helpful at all. Also food here is not good. They barely change it and you have to spend 3000 just to get 1000 worth of food. Complete rip off and I hate it here. Thankfully I’m almost done with this god forbidden place.
Graduate Student,1,"If you want a degree and don't care about the education this is the school for you. There is a reason they have less than a fifty percent graduation rate. There are passionate talented professors here but they get buried in the bureaucratic jumble. If they are going to continue to call themselves a university based on religion and ""Benedictine values"" they have some things to work on."
College Junior,1,Theres not much to do around campus unless you have access to a car.
College Junior,1,Unfortunately the financial aid services here stink. The people working at the financial aid office are rude and in order to get anything done efficiently and properly you need to go to the people in charge.
College Freshman,1,"Saint Martin's University has only one dining hall/restaurant. Hours aren't always convenient, however there is a little convenient store within the residence halls, that close at 11pm."
College Junior,1,Not Good – In the start they give you scholarships but later as you becoming a upperclassmate they slowly give less money. They always have issues and seem to not know what they are doing.
College Junior,1,Bad Housing – It is hard find the right housing. The social atmosphere is not much and can be boring for a while. The cost is very high and the food program sucks.
College Sophomore,1,Stay Within the Boundaries of Campus – The nightlife at our school is horrible. There are no activities to get involved in so students go out to houses off campus and party.
College Freshman,1,"SO people I know are involved in the ""underground greek system"" at Saint Martin's because the school doesn't accept the real greek system so yeah...SHHH DONT TELL lol there arent any parties or anything its really pathetic and I wouldnt join lol"
Recent Alumnus,1,Can Be Irritating – I've heard many students complain about the process and the customer service they get with the people that work in the financial aid office. But they do have some great scholarships out there that the school provides.

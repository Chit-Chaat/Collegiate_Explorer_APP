Junior,5,"I love the atmosphere and the people that work there, it's a college experience I will always remember."
Junior,5,The passion and drive of the staff and faculty sets the standard for an incredible learning atmosphere.
Junior,5,"I think that it is wonderful to have a 4-year college in Rochester.  It opens more doors for college students that wish to stay in Rochester.  It is small, which I do not mind, I really enjoy having a great personal relationship with my colleagues and professors. Thanks to Mayo Clinic, we are able to stay in Rochester for clinical and use their facilities for simulations. Most of my professors have shown a real genuine interest in seeing me succeed in my BSN program."
Senior,5,"I love the classroom style! The focus is on group work where you learn together and try to solve problems rather than attending a lecture and taking notes. Classrooms always have more than one teacher in them so students can get more individualized help and different view points from different teachers. Sometimes, classrooms will have teachers from different departments all teaching one topic (for example, a math teacher, a psych teacher, and a chemistry teacher all talking about the distributions of Skittles flavors, the recognition of Skittles and their flavors, and the sour acids in the Skittles respectively)."
Junior,5,My experience with the University of Minnesota has been fantastic. The things that I like are the wonderful professors and the great medically minded learning environment. Some of the changes I would like to see are things like more large activities presented from the University.
Freshman,5,"I love the classroom style! The focus is on group work where you learn together and try to solve problems rather than attending a lecture and taking notes.

Freshman,5,I really love the school because it's extremely small and healthcare focused. The college is all about work but also having fun. Don't expect a party every weekend but it's nice being able to know everyone by name. All the professors put out time to help you better understand the material. I personal love this school and would never have a second thought about it! 
College Freshman,5,"Again, we have great resources if we are ever victims of something such as sexual assault."
College Freshman,5,The value of a degree at this school is outstanding. All faculty as well as other students help motivate you and push you in a positive way.
College Junior,5,The University of Minnesota - Rochester is a school that aims to challenge their students and prepare their students for professional school The school allows for flexibility in changing major and the advisors are eager to help their students to succeed in school and future schools.
College Sophomore,5,I love downtown Rochester! There are many things to do and various restaurants to go to during the week and the weekend.
College Sophomore,5,"The school is small, so opportunities are limited and competitive."
College Student,5,It is an absolutely beautiful city to live in and be a part of!! There is plenty of restaurants and I love the city night life.
College Freshman,5,The weather does not affect my campus experience at University of Minnesota-Rochester at all because where we live there are sky ways to get to class so we can avoid walking outside at all if that's our desire. I know it would affect those that don't live at the provided housing or post secondary students but for most it isn't a problem at all.
College Freshman,5,"There is a lot of diversity at the University of Minnesota Rochester because of where the college is placed. Many different people come to Rochester because of the Mayo Hospital. Seeing as this hospital is very popular and people come to it from all around the world, it would make sense that this college which is placed in Rochester would also have much diversity."
Niche User,5,UMR is very culturally diverse with all the students and teachers. It really opens you up to learning other people's ways.
Niche User,5,"Since UMR is in the heart of downtown Rochester, there are plenty of great places to eat!"
Niche User,5,"Everyone at UMR is provided a computer with all the necessary applications as a part of tuition! Nifty, right? :)"
Niche User,5,"Located in the heart of mayo, this is the place to be for any future doctor, nurse, or other health specialist! You're basically brushing arms with the people you aspire to be every day!"
Niche User,5,"The curriculum is very challenging, but worth it. It serves as a good tool for weeding out those who won't make it in the health science field. However, if you can make it through, I believe that the heavy health science influence in all the classes will have you very prepared for a future in health care!!! :)"
Alum,4,"Online courses are available through UofM Rochester for a wide range of Twin Cities courses. Especially for writing intensive courses, the online options make completing your degree more in-tune with your schedule."
Sophomore,4,I love the small class size of the school because it allows for a lot of one on one attention from the professors. While the class options may be more limited it is nice we have the option to take classes from the Twin Cities as well.
Senior,4,Something that I enjoy about the University of Minnesota-Rochester campus is that the professors and success coaches care about the student's overall physical and mental health.
Alum,4,"2019 Alum. Majored in Health sciences. Worked as a teaching assistant for biology. Overall, had a good educational experience but it could improve upon campus activities and culture."
Niche User,4,I have just confirmed my enrollment and I have found it to be  a very easy process. The only thing that I would suggest is making it easier to know if your confirmation went through.
Junior,4,"I like how the universities housing is so close to the campus but also that it is apartment style dorms so I feel like I can ""go home"" after going to class instead of still being on campus. Housing is a little bit expensive but worth it for the quality that you get."
Freshman,4,"UMR I would say is a very good school. There's a lot of resources here that the students may use. Also, the faculty care a lot about their students. I've never seen some faculty willing to sit down with a student for hours on end."
Freshman,4,Very rigorous courses but the support here is great. There are many helpful on-campus resources that are available to students who are struggling in classes or in life. The environment and staff/faculty here cares about you and your learning process in the medical field. Everyone here is supporting and super friendly. One thing that does get in the way of all this is just the tight learning spaces. Individual rooms to study in on campus is hard to find since we are so limited in space. The study rooms can get quite rowdy since everyone is always there. Space is limited here but the environment is awesome.
Freshman,4,"So far, UMR has been good academic wise. The staff are very helpful and want you to learn and succeed to the best of your ability. The class sizes are very small which can be good to get to know your professors and your classmates. There are no sports teams and there are clubs that are very small. Some of the classmates will make their own cliques but people are very accepting and friendly."
Freshman,4,Hard but I love the way classes are taught here. It is very unique. The student body is fairly small but I didn't realize how big the campus was. You get to know almost everyone in your classes. The staff are all very helpful as well.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are extremely small. I love this. This allows me to have close relations with my professors as well as to understand the material on a deeper level. My largest class has less than 50 students. This is amazing considering that at other universities freshman classes may have hundreds of students.
College Freshman,4,Considering the school has a partnership with Mayo Clinic I will be left in a great place after graduation. I will have worked with one of the medical field's biggest names and gained tons of experience.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe. I can walk down the street and to my apartment in ease. I have nothing to fear.
College Freshman,4,"I love the apartments! They are absolutely gorgeous, although the rooms could be a little bigger. The appliances are up to date and the community is overall clean. I'm so glad that I have an apartment over a dorm so I can cook my own meals, do my laundry, and share a bathroom with two other females. It makes the college experience much better. As for the community, everyone is friendly and helpful. There are no major issues."
College Freshman,4,"University of Minnesota is truly at the heart of the medical world! All of the programs are designated towards making the students better medical professionals. I am very confident that my experience at this school will help me find to a nice line of work once I graduate. One of my favorite things about the school is the small size. The teachers will know my name and remember me for years to come, rather than just being a number like at other universities."
College Sophomore,4,"The Academics at UMR is very rigorous and demanding, there is indeed no redemption for lazy people which is why almost half of the freshmen transfer to other colleges before their sophomore year. The rigorous workload is actually good, because it prepares one for the of graduate school or medical school"
College Sophomore,4,"A small college like mine really has no problems with drug or alcohol abuse. Thee are obviously kids who indulge in such but they do it discreetly without really affecting other students. Majority of the kids at UMR are totally concentrated on their academics, leaving no time for drug or alcohol abuse."
College Freshman,4,I love the environment at UMR. Everyone is so welcoming!
College Freshman,4,Housing is wonderful! Very homey and comfortable.
College Freshman,4,"UMR is a great college to go for any Health Science related field. It has a challenging curriculum, but you will find that it is worth while."
College Freshman,4,"I would say that our campus housing is the best, because it really is in terms of quality, but it's so expensive and we don't have many options. The only student housing that we have downtown is 318 commons. Although they're luxurious apartments that's probably nicer than most colleges student housing, it's pretty expensive. Some classes are on the -1 floor of our apartment building so that's pretty great."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are incredible and easily reachable. There's many research opportunities and part time jobs that can play a huge role in your career determination and that can help you within your desired field. If you're going into health care, go to UMR. The class size is very small so you become very close with a lot of people."
College Freshman,4,the university is a great place to be in.
College Freshman,4,everyday learning is always a great experience. the small size of my school makes it unique
College Sophomore,4,"UMR has a great academic program for those students who are willing to work towards it. It is an advanced academic program that focuses solely on health sciences. It is great if you know what you want to do or have no idea because the degrees they offer have a wide range of variety for possible career options. 

The professors there are very dedicated to watching you grow as a student and they want you to learn and do well. Many hold 'Just Ask' hours which are office hours but in a more comfortable setting for you as a student. 

Classes are co-taught and no professors have ten year so if they aren't good the university has the opportunity to let them go. 

Plus if you live on campus you get apartments and your own room, no stuffy dorms!"
College Sophomore,4,"At the University of Minnesota Rochester, it is a small university.  This allows for more opportunities for the staff and students to interact and get help on the material presented in class.  The professors always make to for you and will make sure you actually understand anything that you need help with.  Additionally, in the classes, the classes are small and will have multiple professors for co-teaching and being able to help students with course material fast and effectively.  

Overall, it is a small school that is focused on its dedicated students who desire to enter the medical field.  The school's size allows for closer student to staff connections, which allows for better success at the university."
College Sophomore,4,UMR was a great choice for me. The staff are absolutely phenomenal when it comes to understanding the material for their course.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't started attending yet, classes will begin in September, but from my experiences so far it has been a good school."
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe in Downtown Rochester. I came from a small farm town and am extremely comfortable walking to and from class alone.
College Freshman,4,UMR is located right in downtown Rochester so there are plenty of restaurants to find somewhere to eat and spend some time with friends.
College Freshman,4,"I LOVE the apartment style housing. I felt like the transition to college allowed me to be an adult because I had to cook, clean, do laundry, and maintain my grades."
College Freshman,4,There are many off-campus dining options. The cost is expensive but some places have discounts and there are a lot of different dining places near our campus/dorms.
College Freshman,4,I received very good financial aid for UMR. The financial aid consultants help a lot!
College Junior,4,I have never had a problem.
College Junior,4,Rochester is a very professional town.
College Junior,4,There are a lot of options available downtown to eat.
College Sophomore,4,"I am attending a health sciences program, so we have wonderful opportunities since Mayo Clinic is across the street from one of our campus locations. Rochester is a pretty nice community geared towards couples and families."
College Sophomore,4,"The cost is about reasonable, better than on-campus housing depending on where you choose to live. The apartment complex I live in offers a shuttle service on week days. The shuttle picks us up from the apartment and has two drop off and pick up locations that are the same year round. This is beneficial for me because I can take the subway through the Mayo buildings to get to my classes and stay warm during the winter time."
College Sophomore,4,The campus is not horribly strict with things. If someone gets caught with alcohol they have to talk to the coordinator and have to write a paper as well. There is no fine when this happens. It is not very strict.
College Sophomore,4,"The courses at UMR are pretty science and math based. They are challenging, but are all interconnected at the same time. The quality of the professors are pretty good. Most of them will help students excessively to succeed and understand class content. The classrooms are updated with technology and multiple screens, and class sizes are very small with no more than 40 students in a given class. Students can expect to gain a lot of attention as well."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the places have pretty good food. Some of the restaurants include student discounts, and cheaper prices. China Star offers a lot of food for a relatively cheap price. There are a lot of restaurants and bars to eat at especially on 1st ave. There are all by each other and convenient to walk to."
College Sophomore,4,"It is not too hard to get accepted to UMR. The most important criteria I think would be GPA and extracurricular activities. The program is really hard, and challenging for many students. Since is is all health science based  the curriculum is very tough for students especially sophomore year. The admission department is very helpful, and is easy to apply for."
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is pretty safe overall. There is always a security guard working in the study area, and lounge at night. The campus always had security. Rochester is not too bad for crime, but we are located right new to the police station. There are always cops, and security driving around and making sure everything is safe. The public is generally safe even on the weekends with more partying as well"
College Sophomore,4,The professors are always willing to help. The faculty at UMR care about their students achievements and want to help them succeed in their future careers. The JustAsk hours are useful and can be helpful for extra attention on a given subject. Some of the professors will even stay later evenings to help students understand the material. We have study rooms to get homework done. Registration is easy and the success coaches help when that times comes.
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot more girls than guys at this school. The school is growing and their are a lot more attractive girls attending this school.
College Freshman,4,I love this school. The professors really care about their students and will do whatever they can to help their students succeed. The school is very challenging but offers a lot of support. 
College Sophomore,4,"There is zero tollerance for drugs or alcohol on campus. If someone is caught, there a strict enforcement on the student. Since it is also a small school, everyone knows who are the kids that party or do not party."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone at UMR is very helpful when it comes to a students learning. The classes are very small compared to other universities. If there is many students, then there will be multiple professors in the room teaching. The workload is very large, it can become very overwhelming at points. Stay on track with your studies otherwise you will fall very far behind."
College Sophomore,4,"UMR is very strict on policies. They have zero tolerance for drug use, underage drinking, and vandalism. Students are also required to attend every class- everyday."
College Sophomore,4,"Downtown Rochester can become a little scary at night or during the day. However, students are very safe at all times. If something does not seem right, students may call security. On the weekends, there is also police on the streets monitoring everything."
College Sophomore,4,Financial aid was not hard to complete.
College Sophomore,4,"The housing is wonderful. Connected by skyway to school, very new and clean, includes all amenities, and you are living in the same building as a majority of students. However, the cost is pricey. "
College Sophomore,4,UMR is very accepting toward any person. Everyone is treated equally and fairly.
College Sophomore,4,I came to UMR because it is all health based and the curriculum is set up to help you pass those big exams such as the MCAT. Most professors are very available to answer questions or even give one on one help with all topics. They want you to succeed and will help how ever they can. We work a lot in group setting because that is how you will work in the medical field and they push you to think outside the box.
College Sophomore,4,Each student is given their own computers and we have support that will help with any issues that may arise. The other computers on campus and very nice as well and always available to you. The only problem is printing in the dorms.
College Sophomore,4,Most of the instructors want us to succeed and have many resources and office hours. Some professors respond with google it.
College Freshman,4,Public transportation is very good in Rochester.  Most lines will probably drop you with 4 blocks of your destination.  Excellent variety of cabs.
Niche User,4,"There are very few majors, but the few that exist are very good for getting you into the medical community. The main major is in Health Sciences, which can help you get into med school or other graduate programs within the medical community. Don't come to UMR if you aren't interested in a medical career."
Niche User,4,"The campus is new and fairly small. However, everything is technically advanced and organized to provide the best learning environment possible. The campus works with the local YMCA to provide  free Y memberships to all students, which is awesome! There's always something interesting going on!"
Niche User,4,The off-campus housing is much more affordable than the apartments on campus and since UMR is located downtown it is very easy to find housing sites nearby.
Sophomore,2,"If you are perfectly fine with placing your future in teachers' hands then go ahead and apply. Let me explain, the teachers are basically free to experiment with their grading scales and how they teach. Nothing wrong there, except when they do it every year and can constantly cause the class to be ill prepared for finals. If you are not constantly communicating with the teachers good luck on getting above a C."
Sophomore,2,The faculty is great here but we are all  Guinea pigs for this school. Many of the classes we are taking have never been taught before and teachers are always changing how classes are taught. It's unfair to the students because we suffer due to this. There is also no curve due to us being research subjects.
Freshman,2,"University of Minnesota Rochester is too small to deserve a higher rating. There is so many cliques and I feel like I'm in middle school again. It's mostly girls here too, so there's always an exorbitant amount of drama going on. The academics are good, but the first year is certainly a ""weed out"" year."
College Freshman,2,My school doesn't even have varsity athletics.
College Freshman,2,"Downtown Rochester is not a very safe place at night. At least one student this year was mugged, and there is quite a bit of crime in the area right around campus. If I go out at night I take at least one friend and pepper spray. There are always drunk guys outside on the weekends because there are so many bars near by and they harass UMR girls a lot. My friends and I are catcalled about half the time we walk outside, and we have been physically grabbed by men right outside the doors of the dorms. There are usually a lot of cops around on the weekend but there is still a large problem. The dorms themselves are pretty secure though, which helps a lot."
College Freshman,2,"This school is marketed as having a really great outcome for their students, and I think that might be true if you take the BSHP program. The people that I know who graduated with a BSHS degree are either working in labs or are trying to get more experience to get into graduate school. A lot of them don't seem happy with where they are at but they don't have much of a choice because the BSHS program pretty much prepares you for a lab position and not much else."
College Freshman,2,"The housing on campus looks really nice and spacious. There are a lot of underlying problems however. The internet access is terrible, things break all the time. There have been multiple significant leaks in the building this year. The elevators are constantly breaking, right now one of them won't go to the 7th floor, it's been like that for a month. Sometimes the elevators stop working, one time my friend was in it and it started dropping down a few floors at a time. We think the only thing that saved her was emergency breaks. There are many issues with the dorms despite the fact that they look nice on the surface."
College Freshman,2,"There are no sport teams through the school. There are intramurals on campus but most of them require a lot of time, and most people don't want to commit that much time for athletics with the workload here. Also, most of the teams here are dance teams, so if you don't like dance, you are short on options."
College Freshman,2,The faculty members are very strict on a lot of things. Some things are what the average college kid does that does not harm anyone.
College Freshman,2,"There are hardly any parties. When there are those very few parties, the same set of people attend so yo never meet anyone new."
College Sophomore,2,"UMR is too small to have sports. We don't have any professional or college teams like most schools have. But, we do have intramural sports during the school year. Also, there are activities that take place at the YMCA as well. Our school has an annual kickball tournament every May which is fun to partake in. We try to make activities and sports for student to partake in."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many parties and if there is a party, they are not very great. Walking is the best means of transportation. There are lots of bars around campus, but in order to go in them after a certain time, you have to be 21 or older."
College Sophomore,2,"Rochester does not offer a dinning hall for students. Students have to make all of their own meals at their apartment. However, there are few restaurants in the area, but they do get tiring and are pricey for college students."
Niche User,2,"We have a mascot (Raptor) but no official sports. However, there are lots of sport clubs to join."
Niche User,2,"Guys? What are they? Just kidding, but there is a very large girl-guy ratio right now, so if you're a guy looking to come here...you're coming to the right place! :)"
College Freshman,2,"Only Health Sciences! Don't get me wrong, being next door to the Mayo clinic is a dream for any aspiring health professional, however the bachelor of science in health science program seems a bit high school (at least for freshman). The small school environment fosters this type of atmosphere but when coupled with the workload I sometimes question whether I am really in college. There are some projects that are assigned that would definitely not be assigned at any other university. Regardless, the opportunities this school has to offer are endless, so despite the program itself the proximity to such a prestigious health care system really does have benefits."
Sophomore,1,"Do NOT go here. Made the mistake of thinking that having a degree so specific will help them get into medical/pharmacy/dental school. The school heavily advertise their relationship with Mayo when in reality, it is nonexistent. You need to really network yourself for opportunities or else it will be very hard to get anything out of your time here. The teachers are not great teachers and most require attendance and check through clicker questions or a surprise in class activity. There are also very degree specific classes that will not transfer.
The campus also feels very high school due to the small class sizes along with students here being quite clique-y. 
If you think there is a possibility that you want to change majors- that is enough of a reason to not go here as there are only 3 undergrad programs and 1 graduate program.
I would have gone to the campus in the twin cities since it has a more established reputability, more teachers, more resources and opportunities for students."
College Freshman,1,I have never even heard of the Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"When I started here I thought that this school was going to be wonderful, in fact it's the only school I applied to. They sell it as never having ""weed out classes"", that's a lie, your entire first year is a ""weed out year"". The work load is heavy, there are few activities, and a lot of the counselors don't seem to care about you, only about the school. My advice is if you are looking to come here, look other places and don't let the facade fool you. This school will suck you dry, and do nothing to help you when you are down. Also, the connection to the Mayo that they advertise just doesn't exist in daily life here. Don't make the same mistake I did, look at other schools and take your time to decide."
College Sophomore,1,There are no sports at UMR. If you would like to participate in a sport- you may join clubs with the YMCA or the soccer club on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"No Dining Hall – At UMR, we don't have a dining hall.  All students are kind of responsible for themselves with getting fed.  We have to go out to eat or make our own food.  During finals weeks or just tough weeks, it'd be nice to have a dining hall so we wouldn't have to worry about things like food."
College Freshman,1,"Our school doesn't have an athletic program, all we have is clubs. People get really into the clubs at the beginning of the semester but them membership and attendance starts to dwindle down to almost nothing by the end. We definitely need sports but then again we need more students in order to make those sports happen."

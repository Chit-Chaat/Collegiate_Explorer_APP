Niche User,5,Made application process smooth ! Can’t wait to start classes in January. My visit is this week and I’m super excited !
Niche User,5,Instructors make sure you have information you need. Always there to help you out if needed. Don’t ever hesitate to ask for help
Senior,5,Being a student at The Christ College of Nursing has been nothing short of extraordinary. The faculty truly takes care of each other and their students. It's obvious that they will do anything to help their students succeed. They really do care!
Senior,5,"My online learning experience was better than I imagined. Prior to COVID-19 I had taken only a couple online classes. After the initial COVID outbreak, all nursing courses were online. The faculty quickly adjusted and the transition from in-person classes to online lectures was practically seamless. I would highly recommend Christ College of Nursing to anyone who wants to become a nurse!"
Niche User,5,I really like how committed they are to the success of their students. Their campus is really welcoming and so are their students. The college is affordable and there are many ways that the college can help you pay your tuition if you need financial help.
Sophomore,5,"The Christ college is an amazing college. The professors, staff, and students make you feel at home and it is a very fun and educational college. There is a lot of things you can learn there to better educate yourself to be a nurse. There is nothing I would change about the college."
Sophomore,5,It is a direct admit which means that you are guaranteed a clinical spot once you’re accepted. This makes students more willing to help students as well as easier to find friends. Everyone there is focused on getting their degree and have the same determination.
Sophomore,5,"Overall this is a great program and great school to go to Id you're a nursing major. I transferred from NKU and this was the best choice I could have made. They keep you to high standards as they should due to this also being in a Hopsital. There are so many opportunities given to each student being that there are no housing/dorms, athletics, and clubs. They allow you to follow nurses, intern, and also have plenty of ambassador opportunities as well to go to different schools and talk to students as to why this is a great school. If I could have started over I would have began at TCCNHS."
Junior,5,"The professors at Christ are genuinely here to help us and they show it in not only their lectures but the advice they offer outside of class. The professors are more often than not actual nurses that know the field and use their real-life experiences to help their students gain insight on the nursing career. The classes are made to be interesting which makes me want to attend class each day and coming from me that is a hard thing to do. Overall, Christ has taught me many valuable lessons that I plan to incorporate in my daily life and my life as a nurse."
Freshman,5,It is only my first year at the Christ College but it has already taught me so much. I wouldn't trade my decision for the world. The price may bee high but the outcome is worth it.
Freshman,5,TCCNHS has been very helpful to me coming in as a transfer student. When you believe that something did not transfer right they will look it over and get back with you in a timely manner. All of the stuff are very friendly and with being a smaller school you can tell that they want to be more personable with each of their students. I love the class sizes because it allows for more time for questions and you do not feel pressured that you can not do something because of the overwhelming amount of people.
Niche User,5,"When I walked into TCCNHS meet and greet I fell in love! I have never seen so many positive people in one place. I just knew I was in the right place. The tour wasn’t rushed everything was broke down all questions were answered. Everyone was so polite nice and upbeat. I thought the passport idea was amazing, any name or number you need was placed in the passport. I’m excited to start in the fall…Bonita T! !"
Niche User,5,I loved how the school was small and seemed personal. I also loved how close it was to the vast number of medical campuses in Cincinnati.
Freshman,5,I was accepted and I made my first visit and I love it! The atmosphere feels great and I feel I could be and do my best here. I love the smaller size and how there is no competition. I feel supported already and I haven't even started!
Niche User,5,"I will be starting at The Christ College of Nursing in the fall and I cannot wait! When I went to the Meet n Greet everyone was so nice and helpful!

Sophomore,5,"This is my second college experience. I previously attended a popular university for my first bachelors degree. The Christ College of Nursing and Health Sciences so far has surpassed my previous college experience. The staff here are so incredibly helpful, the college is very organized, and I truly feel set up for success here. If I ever have a question it is answered promptly and so many of the staff members have bent over backwards to be helpful during my transition into their ABSN program. I am truly pleased with them so far and am glad I chose this college!"
Sophomore,5,"I transferred to The Christ College of Nursing in fall of 2017. I cannot even touch on how grateful I am to be given such an amazing opportunity. The professors are great, they are helpful and there whenever needed. I have made so many amazing friends just in the past year and a half. I am one to utilize study tools and there are so many options at this college. You can make appointments with professors and tutors for just about any subject."
Freshman,5,I have recently enrolled  and was accepted into the Christ College of Nursing and Health Sciences Healthcare Administration Program. The option for online classes was a definate blessing for my demanding schedule. I was so nervous about this new journey in my life and all the ins and outs of enrollment. My advisors with the Christ College has made this transition easy and seemless for me. I felt at ease and at home at my orientation. and look forward to completing my degree with the Christ College!!
Alum,5,I've recently graduated from The Christ College in December 2017 with my ADN. The staff is AMAZING. Due to my excellent experience at the college I returned in the Spring of 2018 to continue my BSN.

Everyone I encounter there is always helpful and kind, even the students! I look forward to starting in the fall!"
Freshman,5,I am an upcoming student for TCCNHS and I have been on a tour two times in the past few months and I find new things to love every time.

Even just going to my registration day and the Mix and Mingles they offer have really helped me tog et to know some of the people and the staff. Everyone at TCCNHS have really been so supportive of me and my goal. They have helped me with all of my silly questions and concerns. They really have made my dream of becoming a nurse a reality.
Freshman,5,"My experience with TCCNS have been nothing short of excellent. I begin my courses in the fall and I'm already looking forward to graduation day. The staff have already been so kind and helpful. You don't have to wait days for your questions to be answered, and each individual that I've needed to assist me with completing enrollment have been available and ready to help. I know I can be successful here and I plan to put forth my best effort."
Graduate Student,5,As a recent graduate and currently enrolled student I have to say that this school is one of the best. The class sizes are small and clinical sites are gaureente. The professors are very helpful and do everything possible to help you succeed.
Sophomore,5,"The Christ College of Nursing provides the environment, resources, and people to help you succeed. The college expresses the importance of inclusiveness. There is no need to compare the program to others because this one is exceptional."

Freshman,5,This school is excellent I would recommend to any nursing student. They are great with getting students to know the school better and helping each individual!
Freshman,5,"I chose Christ because of the classes sizes and only hearing good things about it. I just took my first tour and did my mix n mingle night and I fell even more with the school
Elizabeth Chambers"
Freshman,5,"Everything about it is great. You always feel connect, it may not be like other schools but for me wanting so bad to be a nurse it’s perfect. The focus around what we need to learn and that anyone is always willing to help. I’m so glad I decided to attend next fall."
Niche User,5,I am so happy that I get to attend The Christ College of Nursing and Health sciences for my ABSN next spring. With the small campus and small class sizes I really feel like I have the support and direction I need to become a great nurse. Help is always available if I need it and I wouldn't want to go anywhere else!
Niche User,5,I had an amazing time at the Mix n' Mingle event this evening.  It was so much fun to meet with future classmates and faculty.  I got all of my questions answered and can't wait to start this fall!
Freshman,5,"I had an awesome time today at the Mix and Mingle for incoming Fall students.  I was very nervous about going back to school while being a mother and still feeling the loss of my middle son this passed fall. Everyone was so kind and welcoming as well as finally getting a visual of the small classes and building and hospital, I feel so much more comfortable now. I can hardly wait to finish registration and start classes in the Fall. I look forward to this new endeavor and being part of such and awesome small community."

Sophomore,5,"Choosing The Christ College two years ago was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Since 2016, I have made some of the biggest academic accomplishments of my life. I feel as if the Christ College staff has contributed to my success and my place on the dean's list the past 2 years. I have easy access to one on one's with my professors, and tutors are available if needed. 
The TCCNHS campus is always clean and offers a friendly studying environment. There is always somewhere for me to sit quietly and do my homework alone, as well as places for my classmates and I to sit and catch up. I have encountered awesome people here and made many new friends in just two short years. This college has not only taught me to become a nurse, but it has also taught me who I am at heart. I would recommend The Christ College to anyone who is thinking about becoming a nurse."
Sophomore,5,"Christ is an amazing school, full of amazing students and professors! Class sizes are small and it’s very easy to settle in and feel at home here.

You’ll fall in love just like I did!"
Sophomore,5,"TCCNHS is an amazing school for people of any age. The teachers are there for you and your learning no matter what. They will stay with you late, or even come in on their days off to help you better understand a topic. The school is small and quaint which makes it more friendly and welcoming. Everyone is guaranteed a clinical spot, which results in less stress! The Christ Hospital is right next door, and is used for clinical rotations all throughout the program. I love this school and what it entails."
Freshman,5,"At Christ College, there is not a thing I would change. I picked this school because it is small. I like how my professors can get to know me and can call me by my name in the hall ways. I enjoy the environment were in because everyone is calm and ready to learn. The resources are unlimited ranging from tutoring to self counseling. "
Sophomore,5,At Christ I love the fact that our classes aren't as big and the professors can get to know u personally. The only thing I would change is to have more class time then having to meet up once a week for three hrs.
College Freshman,5,Im so happy everything is great

College Freshman,5,They focus on what I need to learn where as a large university would make me take classes I don't need.
College Freshman,5,I love the small class sizes.  I come from a small school so this helps a lot.
College Sophomore,5,"During your entire four years at Christ College they are helping you find a job in the medical field, I don't know of another college that does that! They make you feel like they truly care about you, making sure that this is the field of study you want to pursue. Christ College is consistently have job fairs, so no need to worry about getting a job. Christ College has an entire field of staff working on helping students with resumes, interview questions, and a lot more. I feel like I'm going to come out of Christ College with the best resume!"
College Sophomore,5,"Christ College of Nursing has the most wonderful professors and staff that always make themselves approachable. Our professors are absolute experts in the field of nursing because they have actually been in the field, instead of teaching being their desks their whole career. Knowing that the person teaching me has been in the exact same shoes as me, makes me admire them and want to work harder. The atmosphere at Christ College makes you want to learn more. Having classmates and staff encourage you consistently that you can get through this, is the best part of the college....having that amazing support gets my through achieving one of the hardest degrees."
College Student,5,"Although I have only completed one semester at The Christ College of Nursing, I have been very pleased with my experiences.

Sophomore,4,"My online experience has been great! Even though it has been hard transitioning to learning online, christ college has made it a very easy transition and is making sure that we are on the road to success!"
Sophomore,4,I love my experience at the christ college of nursing and health science! Everyone is there to help you succeed and become the best nurse you can be!
Sophomore,4,What I like about this school is that it is a small school. Interactions between professors and students will most likely be manageable and easy compared to big schools. I also like how small the class sizes were because I get anxious easily whenever I see a huge group of people.
Graduate Student,4,The Christ College of nursing would benefit from being more hands on. As a nursing student I didn’t get the hands on that I wanted. Especially because we have all these great resources like the robots and other things that were only used about once a semester. Other than that it is a good but challenging school.
Alum,4,The college has many resources dedicated to the success of students and the clinical faculty are amazing.
Junior,4,Christ is a great college to attend. They give you resources and are reliable. The professors are very knowledgeable. The one thing I would change is the final at the end of the semester. It is worth so much of your grade. I know they are preparing us to be the best nurses we can be but you could pass all your test in your class and have one bad grade with the final and fail the entire semester while you held a high grade. I came close those semester luckily I still passed. Others weren’t so fortunate due to the high percent of the HESI. From what I hear other nursing colleges don’t do this each semester.
College Sophomore,4,"Online classes are great if you need to work a lot during one semester, otherwise I would personality not recommend them. Having classmates and a professor in person to help you out, is always the best way to learn."
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love how small the class sizes are, there are no more than thirty students to each professor. Making a connection with each professor is very important because they can help you with studies, but most importantly they can give you recommendations for jobs, scholarships, internships, etc. Having a smaller class size also helps you to get to know the students a lot faster and better. You never know, you might run into one of your classmates one day and they might be able to help you out in someway. Always a good idea to make friends!"
College Junior,4,I have had a lot going on this year and all of the professors are understanding and want to help you.
College Junior,4,"If you have any questions, all you have to do is email your professor and you usually get a response within 24 hours."
College Junior,4,They will help you find a job at a hospital. It is connected to Christ so you get your foot in the door very easily.
College Junior,4,I really enjoy the small class sizes. It is easier to ask questions and if you need help the professors will know you on a personal level.
College Junior,4,They really want to help you get into the field as soon as possible. They will work with you and since it is connected to the hospital you will already have your foot in the door.
College Junior,4,Everything relates to nursing. You aren't learning things that you will not need to know in the field.
College Junior,4,I really enjoy going to Christ. All of the professors are great and really want to help you succeed.
College Freshman,4,"The classes are all during the day so I have had to change my work schedule, however, I can honestly say it was well worth it."
College Freshman,4,"In my experience, registration was pretty cut and dry, the student advisors were very helpful.  The staff are always available to answer any questions regarding classes, registration as well as financial questions.  I am very excited and looking forward to completing the nursing program her at  Christ College."
College Freshman,4,"The possibility of advancing at Christ is amazing.  The college is on the same campus as the main hospital which is very convenient for those students who work at the main campus.  Transitioning from full time student on campus to working as a full time Registered Nurse is highly probable and extremely convenient as well. Job postings are readily available for students to view and apply almost immediately.  

I will be working part time at the main hospital while attending the Christ School of Nursing with every intention of accepting a full time position after completing the nursing program."
College Freshman,4,"Christ School of Nursing is extremely reputable and the quality of education is impeccable.  Recruiters from various hospitals and other health facilities offer bonuses to graduates who will accept positons as Registered Nurses at the facility they themselves represent.  

The staff at Christ College work extremely hard to ensure that every graduated is employed upon graduation.  The career center has an exuberant amount of information and job resources so that graduates are employed in a timely fashion.   As a student at Christ College of Nursing I am fully confident that I will be gainfully employed as a Registered Nurse upon graduation."
College Freshman,4,"Christ School of Nursing has an excellent program for students aspiring to advance in medicine.  The classes are unique in size and the instructors are dedicated to attending to the needs of every student.  The school offers many opportunities to excel and as a student at Christ, I plan to make myself available to every opportunity given.  Nursing can be challenging, but hard work and dedication will pay off when I am able to assist others in making life altering decisions that will ultimately prolong their lives.  

Nurses are in high demand and Christ Hospital offers many opportunities to advance in the field of Nursing.  Many students at Christ School of Nursing, including myself, are currently employees at Christ Hospital and are working toward a degree in the field.  As a full time student I will continue to work at Christ Hospital and I look forward to maintaining a life-long career in the medical field."
College Sophomore,2,Many times the wifi goes out and I am unable to complete homework

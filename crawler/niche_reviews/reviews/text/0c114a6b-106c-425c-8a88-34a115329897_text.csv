Freshman,5,"Fantastic! Affordable education with great classes and professors, and a fantastic transfer program to UCF. Highly recommend."
Freshman,5,Valencia has adapted to online learning and provides great classes depending on what professor you take.
Sophomore,5,I've only completed online courses since I work full time and I am a single mother. The courses are flexible and the teachers are super helpful for the most part.
Sophomore,5,I am taking my last classes at Valencia College and now because of COVID-19 all my classes have transitioned to online and I couldn’t be more happy that this experience happened to me at Valencia College.
Sophomore,5,I have been a dual enrollment student as well as a regular student Valencia College. I have enjoyed all my time at Valencia College especially how easy they transitioned due to COVID-19 making all of our classes online.
Sophomore,5,Online classes were definitely a change and a challenge for me but Valencia online classes made the transition very smooth from previously having been in classrooms. They are structured in a way that makes the work not too overwhelming but where you are able to learn and think and discuss topics and ideas with peers.
Sophomore,5,"Amazing experience at Valencia College. Teachers are passionate and friendly, as well as creating an environment that is challenging and intellectually stimulating. There are many opportunities to advance here, with programs and extracurriculars aimed at helping you achieve your academic goals and establish positive relationships with peers. Events are also hosted where you can learn about a variety of topics including things related to different careers, with experienced speakers to present new ideas."
Sophomore,5,"Every course I have taken online I have been successful. The professors give a clear explanation for what is required in the online course , tutoring services are also available online. All my online classes my professors have been available if I have any questions or concerns. They  have always been willing to help, gracious, and answering any questions I have in a timely manner. You have all the tools you need to be successful ."
Sophomore,5,"I couldn't have asked for a better experience. Valencia College Professors,  Academic Counselors, and resources they provide to help students achieve their goals is a guarantee. I graduate in 2021 I'm thankful for such an amazing experience."
Sophomore,5,"I did take online classes, and I am currently taking online classes too. At first, it was pretty hard to adapt, but Valencia now has the Virtual real-time classes, which is pretty helpful. It is like taking normal classes but just at home."
Sophomore,5,"It was pretty fun to attend as a Dual enrolled student! The professors are dedicated and after the pandemic, they found ways to teach us and acquire a lot of knowledge.  I would definitely come here again"
Freshman,5,Professors usually have their courses very well organized. They also reply to emails fast which is crucial. Online learning is really about time management and not procrastinating.
Freshman,5,"I love Valencia College! I currently attend the Osceola campus and have been for about a year now. All of my professors have been so caring. I really felt like anytime I asked any of my professors a question, they would carefully and thoughtfully break the concept down for me. I find that a lot of the work is graded based on completion (besides for English classes; English professors grade kind of hard). Valencia is also inexpensive, which is great! I get to start saving up for UCF early. The social aspect is alright. I'm a very social person but I did not make that many friends. I made some acquaintances though. There aren't parties (or at least ones I'm invited to). Overall, I get sad thinking that I only have a year left here! Campus is always clean too :)"
Sophomore,5,Valencia College is really great. The staff is very friendly and the school is pretty diverse and flexible.
Sophomore,5,Teachers take good care of helping students with whatever the issue and there’s free tutoring available at all times.
Sophomore,5,Valencia allowed me to grow my education and perspective before I even graduated high school. I was able to earn an AA while still begin in high school. This opened many doors for me as I was able to further explore my career options by transferring to a state college.
Freshman,5,It is my very first year at Valencia and I have had an amazing experience with the staff and counseling. My advisor is amazing and very helpful when it comes to talking about my future.
Freshman,5,I am currently enrolled in full time online. It has been the easiest transition for me and i am very comfortable and impressed in how much I have learned with the online tools and experience.
Junior,5,"The online learning experience is easy to understand and isn't complicated. Depending on who you get as a professor the workload might be a lot, but at the same time it's worth it. I'm currently taking all my classes online since campus is closed during this pandemic. The professors I've chosen seem nice and helpful. Sometimes I can even turn in assignments for a late grade. The profs are very understanding. I don't have any zoom classes because everything is posted in a nice schedule on what needs to be done."
Sophomore,5,"I took almost all of my classes online. The lab segment of the dental anatomy course I am taking is the only exception. So far, I have had a great and non-problematic experience with Valencia College's online classes."
Sophomore,5,"I love Valencia College, especially professors. Everyone I have met there genuinely cares about your well-being and success. Something I would like to recommend Valencia College to work on is adding more variety to events taking place on campus."
Sophomore,5,"Online is not as hard, especially with the professors you get. You can really pass these classes super easily. I thought online was going to be harder but it is way better because it is on your own time."
Alum,5,"Online classes are very independent and allow students to work according to their own schedules. Professors are typically pretty good at offering different modes of learning online for students whether it be though textbooks, online lectures, videos, and practice. However, since many instructors are very busy, communication can be an issue when it comes to trying to get help."
Alum,5,"I can't say enough about my experience as a student at Valencia College. There are tons of ways to get involved within clubs and different organizations. Their advising is very helpful and makes the whole college experience far less stressful. While there are always a few bad apples, the professors seem to be great educators with lots of real world experience to offer students. It is a great place to help you figure out where you want to go in your career and education. They also give you tons of ways to prepare for careers with their online formats offering assistance in finding jobs/internships along with help planning out your degree. They also Providences resources for you to succeed in your classes. Their Writing center and Math lab are particularly  useful in becoming acclimated to the standard of  work expected at the college level. Valencia is also really great when it comes to celebrating diversity and academic achievement."
Sophomore,5,That the Professors if you talk to them they will work with you and they honestly want to see you succeed. As long as there is communication than everything will go smoothly.
Sophomore,5,They work with you and they care about what is going in your life so they can help with manage your assignments.
Alum,5,Great professors to help you through the process. If you were struggling with a subject help through tutoring was available.
Junior,5,Never have had a problem with anything. Everyone seems pretty nice. Have gotten a few bad teachers and didn't learn anything from or they dropped me from the class. Other than that I'm happy with the school.
Junior,5,I am a person who loves online classes and valencia had a very easy platform to navigate. The learning was fun and easy.
Junior,5,"Valencia College is the best University I have ever attended. Valencia has the resources that facilitate the success of its students. The Valencia staff always seeks to help you in the best way. The atmosphere is relaxed and not stressful. Valencia has very good professors, and what is best is affordable."
Junior,5,"Valencia College makes use of Canvas Dashboard, which makes your online classes easier. Locating course material, following deadlines, and allows you to quickly communicate with your professors. Online classes can be challenging at first, but if you stay organized and follow your professors' syllabus it doesn't have to be stressful. Maintaining communication with your professors can be the difference between a good performance or a failure of your class. So far, my online classes have been constant and I have not had any problems. Again, whenever you feel that you are lagging behind, it is better to communicate with your professor, so that both of you can find a better way to help you understand the material."
Sophomore,5,Valencia is the perfect place to go once you are first graduating high school or if you decide that you want to get up and go back to school. The classes are diverse and have a variety of students from all backgrounds and ages. At first i thought that i had to go to a Big university right away then i realized that community college has everything other universities have to offer at a cheaper price. It's even better that it is close to home.
Niche User,5,the professor were very professional and flexible with the new unfortunate situation with the assignment we were giving.
Sophomore,5,"Valencia College is possibly one of the best schools I have ever been to. Everything about the school is organized and their online website is just as good. The service they have at the school is excellent and definitely beats other schools. There isn't many people that go to the school at the same time so you have plenty of breathing room to study or relax around the schools. They also have multiple locations so you're not stuck with one campus and they also do online classes. Due to the covid pandemic about 95% of the classes will be online. Valencia College uses Canvas for their online classes which is very user friendly and it's easy to navigate with and communicate with your professors. The textbooks and anything you need to pay for is cheaper than what most schools offer. I believe that the school should do better with it's tutoring programs, getting them to more people. Even though the campus and the school does encourage group studying. The professors are amazing."
Sophomore,5,I have taken classes online but only one. The classes online are just as difficult as the in person classes but nevertheless it is easy. Everything is organized on a program called Canvas and you can also communicate with your professor through it. I'll be taking two online classes this fall and it will definitely be exciting to take them.
Sophomore,5,"Valencia College is an outstanding school. The professors, academic advisors, faculty and staff take care of their students. I have learned so much at Valencia College, not only through my courses but through the community building and service that Valencia College has for its students. I have enjoyed every moment being at Valencia College, whether it be waiting for a class to start, or studying in the library, or taking part in campus activities."
Sophomore,5,A very welcoming environment with very helpful resources. Wish the process for signing up for classes was a little more user friendly.
Sophomore,5,Online classes professors are alittle more stricter and not as flexible. More for people that don't mind teaching themselves.
Sophomore,5,"Valencia College, though it is now a state college and not a community college, maintains the tight-knit feeling of community and importance with its faculty and students. Teachers are involved, concerned, and understanding. I feel welcome, cared for, and a part of something greater at this school - as opposed to feeling like ""just a number"" at some larger and less involved institutions. I can not wait to finish my four year degree in Nursing here."
Freshman,5,I'm taking all my next classes online. I don't know how the experience is yet but they had that option.
Freshman,5,It is good so far I have not started but they have been very helpful with difficulties I had. They had everything labeled online like where to get your books. Advisors have helped me a-lot especially because I had tons of questions and concerns on how everything would be operating. I got my questions answered very helpful. Looking forward to starting in the fall.
Freshman,5,I am starting college and I am very excited even though it is online I done it before and I was getting the hang of it.
Junior,5,"Online classes only started in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, and every professor went to great length to ensure all of my classmates transitioned easily,"
Junior,5,It's a terrific college to start out with. It really helps ease you into college life without being overwhelmed by the large campus feeling.
Sophomore,5,I love Valencia College. I have no regrets and so far no changes. I hope for more opportunity emails from the school since we can’t so much be involved on campus due to covid.
Sophomore,5,Personally i’m a fan of online. Having online classes help me to be able to create my own schedule throughout the week and take responsibility on making sure things get done!
Niche User,5,"Since Covid-19, classes moved to online platform and this transition was easy, at least for my classes."
Niche User,5,Valencia College’s dual enrollment program is the best. They will make sure you have a plan and will assist you every step of the way.
Junior,5,"Excellent teaching-student ratio, a superfluous amount of resources, and low cost make Valencia College a formidable institution."
Sophomore,5,All of my professors have been very understanding and helpful. Every time I call the main office I get all the answers I need.
Sophomore,5,All of my classes online have been great. I have taken all of my classes online and everything was very thorough. I’m very pleased.
Sophomore,5,"The online experience has been great, it is very flexible and allows me work and study at the same time. It is great!!"
Freshman,5,"Since starting online learning versus in person learning, I realized it is so much easier for online. To do schooling online with Valencia is really flexible to my work and life schedule while still giving me a strong education."
Freshman,5,What I like about Valencia College is how helpful they’ve been to me. I’m a High School graduate and i will be a freshman starting in the fall and i’m more than excited to start with Valencia because they made me feel comfortable and welcomed in. i personally wouldn’t change anything at Valencia College because i’ve received nothing but good attitude and help.
Freshman,5,My online hasn’t started yet but i’ve read reviews on professors and how they’ve accustomed themselves to online teaching. I’ve heard from other students that teachers are very helpful and will answer any questions you have on any assignment through online learning.
Senior,5,"This is the only way I could take classes. I have a set schedule from Monday to Friday 9-5. Though I would prefer to be in class, I do not get that opportunity really. Night classes aren't really my thing either."
Freshman,5,"I was able to learn, socialize, and perfect my craft at Valencia. I have been at Valencia for 3 years and I love it."
Freshman,5,"I was able to learn, socialize, and perfect my craft at Valencia. I have been at Valencia for 3 years and I love it."
Sophomore,5,"This college has been an amazing investment toward my future. They have helped me grow and decide what my true calling is in life, to be a teacher! I am on my last semester with this college and it just makes me so happy that it was this simple to get my AA."
Sophomore,5,"From the start of covid, everything has transitioned to online. I believe their transition was smooth, and the online classes are smooth as well!"
Sophomore,4,"They have many opportunities for students despite them not being a university and it is a great start for you as students, whether it is to become a scientist or a doctor. It's not where you start but the more important thing is where you finish. The customer service is great, There are plenty of different courses you can take, the expenses are much cheaper than many other colleges, It is very diverse, it is a vey clean campus/clean campuses, You receive a lot of information about different things so they keep you up to date,  There are plenty of clubs that you can join There are many transportation methods to get your education at this college (Valencia College). It may not be a university but it can give you a bright future whether it may be two years later or three years later. Many outcomes are made through this college and it  really changes your life, also there are many great professor's that help you learn better and faster and not to mention the great tutoring opportunities."
Sophomore,4,They have so many opportunities despite not being a university and it's a great start. There are many programs.
Freshman,4,Valencia is the best school to go to for prerequisites. The classes are small so the teachers are able to better help you understand the topic. Everyone is very helpful for anything you might be having trouble with.
Freshman,4,"With covid going on, most of my teacher have been understanding and helpful during these times. Even teacher I've had 2 semesters ago have sent wellness check up emails."
Sophomore,4,I had pretty great and wise professors! I have had great advisors help me with the process of choosing my classes and the right class for my career while still meeting my general requirements.
Sophomore,4,"Online learning has been going pretty well, my professors have made themselves completely available for any question and clarification on any assignments. They offer multiple tutoring sessions and lectures."
Sophomore,4,The classes are great along with the supportive teachers. Something that does need improvement are the academic advisors. They assume you understand the process and don't care whether you waste your time or money.
Senior,4,"Overall Valencia courses are a mixed bag. Depending on who's teaching the course. There's lots of great professors and some that are just okay. I've visited all campuses and they're all clean and easy to navigate through. The libraries, learning centers, and cafeterias available were great spaces to spend time between classes. Valencia doesn't have the greatest extracurricular programs but It seems like they're working on it. I'd say it's a great college go get your degree but not somewhere you'll spend too much time in or develop much school spirit or pride."
Senior,4,The online learning experience has been evolving and changing as more courses are moving to a strictly online platform during these times (2020). There's a few bumps here and there but overall the experience has been positive as a lot of face to face interaction is at a minimum.
Sophomore,4,The courses are now a lot more rigorous due to the fact that classes are online. Instructions have begun to give so much amount of work that is simply more difficult at home.
Junior,4,Valencia college is devoted to making and helping students get there degree. Even right now during this pandemic they closed their campus because they value the lives of their students. Only certain amount of classes remain on campus for right now. They also made sure to offer school services online because they want students to know that they will always be there for them.
Sophomore,4,"This is a great college to go! It is very affordable compared to other schools. I really like how most professors are very helpful. I have loved most of my professors. They explain everything very well. When we were doing face to face courses, the campus was always nice. The food is pretty decent."
Alum,4,Pretty hectic but  allowed time for work. Expectations were clearly communicated. Great experience I would recommend to any one.
Sophomore,4,Taking classes online is perfect if you are a student who also works part time which is what i did most of my time at Valencia. If you prefer to work at your own pace then online classes are a good choice and the professors are always quick to respond to anything you might need help with or any questions you may have.
Niche User,4,"What i like about Valencia collage is the friendly environment with nice teachers, Staff and the students."
Freshman,4,"Valencia has a very diverse environment, the professors are open for different cultures. Valencia is an accessible education with a lot to offer for the degrees to be complete.
I had the experience at Valencia as an international student and now as in state resident, to best assist the variety of students this college has it is necessary to have a better base for those who are having this first college in the US experience going over the details and how it works. Otherwise, the students have to stumble through college figuring out how this “world” works."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes are hard in general, but Valencia College online classes were harder in comparison to an in-person class. The only thing that I would hope to see change is if there were updated instructions for class projects. Sometimes the system will not show the updated rubric or syllabus from the professor, which makes the classwork load a bit challenging because I sometimes am not sure if I am completing the project or course work correctly."
Sophomore,4,Valencia was the best decision for me. The smaller classes made it easier to learn and also get help from my professors. The cost was significantly less than going to a University. Overall a great college.
Sophomore,4,"I took a few online classes. The biggest thing is your professor. Some do online classes amazing, while some don't. But even when the professors didn't do the best job, the course work was easy to manage."
Niche User,4,The online learning experience was a tough change but one that was greatly appreciated. I appreciated how hard the professors worked to communicate with us.
Niche User,4,I wish the teachers would be able to communicate more. I appreciate their accessibility for students and their resources to help us succeed.
Sophomore,4,"The transition to online learning wasn't easy, but the professors that I had at Valencia were not only extremely understanding, but they were also very accommodating. The 2020 Summer and Spring semesters brought some harsh and challenging circumstances for all of us - and Valencia was timely and understanding in the transition to online learning."
Freshman,4,It's a great community college and they help the students succeed. They have bachelor degrees and great transfer programs.
Sophomore,4,"I truly enjoy the diversity that Valencia College has across its campuses. As for the professors, the fact that this is a community college does not stop them from providing the best educational experience to their students. Moreover, there are many activities the college plans as an attempt to keep the students involved, even when studying off-campus. 
Besides that, I love that the class sizes are reasonable and, at least from my experience, I have never been in a class with more than 30 students, which has given me the opportunity to speak to professors personally."
Sophomore,4,Online learning is very functional. professors are accommodating and helpful if you reach out and are often times very good at getting back to you quickly.
Sophomore,4,Great resources for students. Great for readiness to transfer to a university or go straight to the workforce. Amazing hands on professors.
Freshman,4,"Valencia College is a pretty great college for people who have just graduated and are just starting out in college as a college student. It works well for students who do not have much experience in the field of college the administration an staff also work their best to help you when your on campus and all professors (teachers) and tutors are all pretty good in helping you with your own questions and such. Valencia College is an ideal starter college for most students looking for a cheap way to start college and later on transfer to different schools and such. The only way the college is lacking is their online services. Online services for contacting professors and staff is a very tedious task seeing how most of them barely look or reply to emails sent to them. The only way to receive official help is either through contact the admissions office, security, or the Answer Center. This is a very serious concern when it takes more than 5 to 6 days to contact an individual that can help."
Freshman,4,"The online class experience is fairly well. Most of the guidelines for the online course is already laid out to you, so you rarely have to ask any questions on the course and the subjects you are learning on. The only problem is that the few times that you have a question either for yourself or for the class there are some professors (teachers) who don't even take the time to read the email that you had sent to them or if they do they don't even respond. It really is frustrating when you require their aid and they don't respond to you, forcing you as the student to continue through the course exactly step by step how it was made to be by the professor."
Graduate Student,4,"I took classes online at my time at Valencia. The professors were very thorough on their syllabus and ensured that each student properly knew what was taking place in the online classroom. Dates for assignments were also advantageous;  certain assignments may not be due until a week or month prior- if allowed a student could also work ahead, thereby alleviating the work load to a manageable standard to their level."
Graduate Student,4,"Valencia College is a great school to attend within the state of Florida.  Its inexpensive tuition costs make it a very alluring college for most returning graduates or undergraduate studies. In addition to its lively campus life, Valencia college has a wide array of professors who offer the most complex in-depth learning strategies to help their students succeed. Valencia College is a great university to attend, and is a very popular choice among Floridians."
Niche User,4,"My online experience wasn’t terrible, I took 2 classes at a time and my professors were pretty easy going, and understanding. As long as you stay on top of your work, you’ll be fine."
Niche User,4,"The times I’ve been in Valencia the campus’s looked very nice and clean, the staff friendly and helpful, and the students seemed happy."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Valencia college has been quite nice. It is a great school to begin your college experience, as it is pretty inexpensive."
Sophomore,4,I like the class sizes and that they’re smaller which gives you more opportunities with the teacher to ask questions right then and there.
Freshman,4,"So far, I have had a rather decent experience. I have come across professors that are genuinely there to teach and you can tell it is their passion which I am highly appreciative of. There are, of course, some professors in which are the opposite, unfortunately. The advising staff has been very helpful in educating me on what I would need to be able to transfer to my desired school and which classes I should take. In-person assistance is much better than over-the-phone or online."
Freshman,4,"My online experience is mixed. I have had very good teachers and one abhorrent teacher. Most are great at getting back to me quickly, though and helpful. Baring the one bad experience, I have found the online classes to be easy enough to complete and to converse with my instructor. The online website can be rather confusing and the SLS class is a necessity for understanding how to navigate it."
Senior,4,I love the Student to professor ratio. It really makes learning more personal and more enjoyable. Also the flexibility of classes for my full-time working students.
Freshman,4,I have yet to start but due to the whole pandemic I will be forced to start my freshman year online and I will see how that goes.
Graduate Student,4,Professors are flexible to work with you. You can ask to meet in person if they're on campus. You can see your grades while your taking your class to see how you're doing in the class.
Graduate Student,4,Great school to start with and save money while getting your AA and getting credits. There's a diversity of people from different backgrounds.
Alum,4,"I really enjoy Valencia College. I think that there is a place for everyone. Whether you're looking to study hard and avoid people or build relationships that will last a lifetime, valencia has a spot for you. The professors also come in all different shapes and sizes. There are some ""easy A"" classes, some hard but worth it classes, and some that are just hard for no reason. All in all, Valencia has a place for you in whatever you're looking for."
Sophomore,4,"I have some technical issues with their student app. The teachers are good and most have an understanding of how to help those with learning disabilities and provide accommodations that are needed. Their are many campuses so if you don’t pay attention when registering for classes, you may get very lost on your first day."
Sophomore,4,"The online experience at first was tough. However, the professors and faculty helped the transition become easier for us students."
Sophomore,4,Valencia east is a small campus so its easier to make friends and connect with the professors. Classes weren't too work heavy and tutoring was made available at our convenience.
Sophomore,4,"For me personally online learning never really worked, however the amount of effort Valencia put into online learning among this current pandemic is astounding. Professors are very understanding and will do their best to help students understand the online curriculum  and if they do not have all the answers they will always give you references to people that can help with your questions."
Alum,4,"Valencia College professors and staff were always very accommodating and helpful, the course material was pretty relevant with current times and professors always tried to make it engaging for their students."
Sophomore,4,"Valencia College is a really nice public college and, personally, I feel like its a great place to get used to the College setting after the transition from high school. My only issue has really been a few bad professors, but that can happen anywhere"
Junior,4,"It has several campuses located throughout orlando, I've mainly gone to East campus which has a nice cozy vibe that lets you feel closer to nature with it's more open feeling campus. I haven't had any teachers I've hated yet, which is a plus. Give it a shot if you're in the area - not to mention it's good for transferring over to ucf!"
Sophomore,4,A lot of the professors go step by step to ensure you don't get lost or feel lost. You can always email your teachers ask usually they reply within a couple days
Junior,4,"Since  I  start  my bachelor   degree  I  take  all my course  online.That  very  good and   instructive.I think  every  college   student   should  experience  the  online  course,and  they  will  have  a new  way  to take  course  at  Valencia College."
Junior,4,Valencia  open  to  everyone  on the  community.I  like  the  Valencia  organization and  the  staff.I  have   access  to everything  at  the school.
Freshman,4,"Well as a online student you don't get much of the experience, but the professors sure know how to teach. The relationships established with the people you meet is really what means a lot from Valencia. The culture is involves as well people just have more life in them."
Freshman,4,"My classes online were decent for math and English. I didn't have the best experience online with biology and Spanish but I know if I can keep up and learn from my mistakes beforehand, online classes with Valencia will be a breeze for me."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are there for you when you are there for you. When you’re dedicated, the school rides with you to your degree."
Sophomore,4,"I really like almost everything in my school but I would like to have more opportunities and help for scholarships, also better food choices it would be great"
Freshman,4,"I haven’t taken any online courses since I am an upcoming freshman enrolled for the summer 2020. Nevertheless, counselors and admissions team have been constantly in touch with me to notify deadlines, future activities, or changes in plan due to the Covid-19 pandemic."
Freshman,4,"Teachers, staff and student body are extremely welcoming and at the best disposal to help or support each other. It counts with clubs and on campus activities that allow social networking and make it easy to truly feel connected with the college."
Alum,4,My experience at Valencia was pretty good. I was blessed enough to be given a full ride scholarship making school way less stressful. The professors seemed to actually care about their students future and will make an effort to ensure you're retaining the information being taught. The advisors however can use some work and proper training. I had one pretty much downplay my future and insinuated I was incapable of becoming a dental hygienist. Good thing it wasn't my passion anyways. and my teeth still look better than hers
Sophomore,4,"I believe that valencia is a very good temporary college. It has many programs, clubs, and places good for student success. So far i've been here about 3 semesters and only have had one bad professor all the others were very good. Valencia tries their best with safety and letting us know what us going and has security for us on campus. It's very clean and a pleasant place to be during your day. Only thing i would improve on is the signs because sometime it can be hard to find classes."
Junior,4,"I recently transferred to Valencia from a different college to take prerequisites for my major. Starting at a new school is always difficult but people at orientation were very welcoming and informative. My first college was a small local state college so it was a bit overwhelming to have more than two building on campus. Thankfully, the campus buildings at Valencia are numbered and there are maps all over campus. I started my first year at Valencia taking difficult classes like physics, not expecting the teachers to be so caring of their students and willing to provide help. I was pleasantly surprised by that and would definitely recommend the school to any new students."
Junior,2,"The college refuses to decrease tuition even though students will, for the most part, not be attending campus and its utilities. To some extent, an online class is alright, but for many classes, it robs you of the benefits of in-person instruction."
Sophomore,2,"I would not sign up for a online class. My experience was not the best. Some online classes, you have to still go on campus and meet with classmates."
Freshman,2,Better communication between staff and students. I was given wrong information multiple times. After inquiring about my account and asking multiple times if everything was good I got an email that I needed to update things such as my residency and high school. They did not inform me unless I ask more than two times.
Junior,2,"This is one of those ""get what you pay for"" colleges. I would avoid.... my experience has been nothing but negative. (The east campus being moderately clean is the only plus I've found.) 

I've taken both online and in-person classes and they have ALL followed the same process - pay for an online portal and teach yourself via YouTube. I'm not sure what my $$ is going towards or what the purpose of attending class is but generally the material covered by the professor is always something we've learned the night before from the portal. Why are they even here? Why am I even here?"
Sophomore,2,Valencia college is clean. There advisors are no help and disorganized rarely get anything done over in Kissimmee campus.
Junior,2,The only thing I like about Valencia is the price. Everything else needs improvement. The staff is never on the same page and rarely have all the information a student might need to solve a problem.
Freshman,2,"I didn't like that when I'd go to the academic advisors they couldn't help me with guiding me on which classes to take as a freshman. I'd ask for how to schedule my semester with courses and what would they think would be the best way for me to tackle types of courses. They wouldn't tell me anything useful but look online on the schools website for my answers. Like I didn't do my own research in the first place (I'm being sarcastic). I ended up not going there since I couldn't trust them and I've heard horror stories of how other students were completing courses that they didn't need for their program in the first place. Although, the OSD advisors are very informative and if anyone has a chance to speak with any of them you should speak with Ms. Robyns. She's amazing and very helpful, tells you what you need to know upfront and doesn't beat around the bush. Very caring and sweet, too."
Freshman,2,"My experience at Valencia wasn't good but it wasn't bad. The professor were ok but on my online classes my teachers were saying that I didn't turn in my work. Which isn't true, I don't know if it's a problem with blackboard or what, but I received an F for these classes because of it. Now my financial aid has been suspended and I can't pay for my classes."
Sophomore,2,"This is the type of school were you can truly say you get what you pay for. It's a hit or miss when it comes to who's teaching you. Some teachers understand work/life/school balance while others could careless and let you know that you are just a number at the school. Either way, understanding those dynamics can get you far with what your goals are at the school."
Freshman,2,"Unfortunately, I didn't have a great experience with this school. The professors and classes are okay, but the business office is a joke. They'll say you owe money that you don't owe. Also the campus is always crowded and trying to find any parking is a nightmare."
Freshman,2,"I liked it because the low tuition, But It can be a better college by adding sports teams and some more stuff to do."
College Junior,2,"There is no program for environmental science at my school, so I had to make my own program, in a way. I researched all of the classes I would need to transfer to my school of choice with my major of choice, but the advisors themselves were not well able to advise me and my track, as they had never seen anyone else do what I was doing."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am a hands on learner, and struggled with my online courses. Not much of an opportunity to get help with the material, especially depending on your professor."
College Junior,2,I feel like they try but not hard enough. They need to attract students more.
College Senior,2,i do not like the online course because the lack of help i get from a professor. the work is great and the organization is amazing but nothing beats the hands on approach a professor can give you in a classroom.
College Junior,2,Little to no options on campus available for the students to utilize
College Sophomore,2,With the online class there isn't any interaction. Not with your classmates or professor unless it is urgent. It lacks the connections needed to build up in any profession and life.
College Senior,2,"It may be because I'm traditional (classroom, one on one) but it was difficult keeping up with my online French class. The website used (came with the book) was okay, but when it cam e to viewing things like grades and interacting with students besides blackboard it was impossible. There wasn't much flexibility in interacting or looking at grades. There was no way to have the website send notifications via atlas or personal email. I only picked to do it online because the onsite classroom was full and I really wanted the Professor due to his rating on rate my professor. That was my first and last online class. Valencia couldn't pay me to do online ever again, I feel like I wasted my time. I thankful I passed with a B."
College Junior,2,"I dont qualify for aid. My parents make to much money, even though I pay for everything on my own. There is no program for students in my position, and my school offers no talent scholarships."
College Junior,2,"I have yet to be challenged in any class. I am always the student that every student wants to partner with. Most of the group projects consist of me doing all the work, and having the other students take a lot of the credit. I want a program that challenges me, and makes me feel like Im learning, not teaching."
College Junior,2,It's hard to find the information and classes I need to help me with my degree because my degree isn't common. It would help to have more classes and information in my degree.
College Senior,2,"Books are very expensive, often the teachers write their own books so they can profit off them"
College Senior,2,"not much information, you need to go to other schools to seek help !"
College Junior,2,Fees for my tuition are reasonable but i dont have the money
College Freshman,2,I don't think I am getting as much as I should be.
College Sophomore,2,Getting financial aid is very hard and little to no help
College Sophomore,2,"This is Community College, the whole point is to move into a job right away or to a University. Just get in, get out, move on."
College Sophomore,2,"My major is Fine Arts/Theatre so it's understandably not as easy to function in, but unless you talk to a professor you know, no one is going to help you. Career Center is a joke for anyone not going into nursing or accounting. Personal connections through professors to other schools or job options is the only way."
College Junior,2,"The online courses are great resource for students, but only a certain type of student. I prefer the traditional classroom setting as I found it easy to forget about my online course work"
College Junior,2,"I find it very frustrating that I do not receive any financial aid because of the amount of money my parents make, when my parents do not pay for any of my school. I get some Bright Futures money, but it doesn't cover as much as it used to. It is frustrating that I am a student who is trying to work to pay my way through school and I don't get financial aid."
College Junior,2,Onlie courses are very do-it-yourself. You have to teach yourself the material for the most part and the student/professor relationship is nonexistant.
College Sophomore,2,"Applying for financial aid was a headache. I made many trips to the school because each time i went, they asked for a new document or pieces of information depending on who i spoke to."
College Junior,2,"The financial process is so bad, they should tell you  all the fees your getting out, when you talk to advisors there, the amount I'm paying is definitely   not top education level, but I working hard to transfer out when I get my associate's degree."
College Junior,2,"The teaching quality of some professors are not in some great standards, the methods could better if the professor didn't go off topic talking about his life all the time, outside the classroom that doesn't even relate to the class."
College Junior,2,"The professor ask you to buy a certain book for the class, and it's not even needed, it's so bad because I could have save a lot of money. I really think that the professors are some-what rude to some students including myself, and not understanding of certain situations the students my inquire outside of the class room, basically attendance wise. if something important came up."
College Junior,2,"The Financial aid process is so bad, they give you the wrong dates, when the disbursement date, it's also hard to get work-study jobs here for low income students as myself, I'm really looking for scholarships now and paid internships now. Overall I can't wait to transfer my credits to a Bigger University."
College Freshman,2,I had/have such a bad experience with financial aid. I just moved to the area months before applying and applying as a resident has been the worse since the people who help out with this process never explained that you have to be living in the state a year prior
College Senior,2,The Career Center at my school isn't that great. I've been in there and everything is very disorganized and it's very hard to find anything. I was left frustrated and no one seemed to be able to help me.
College Junior,2,"lol Okay the student body here is not really a ""body"". ""Body"" refers to unity and operating as a unit; besides going to the same school, there really isn't much of the ""body"" concept. Students here are cordial. You can say hi or nod and they'll say hi or nod back. And it's not unusual to see students taking a second to hold the door for someone coming in behind them (or someone loaded down with items being carried). But while cordial, the campus (at least Osceola) really does not have a FRIENDLY atmosphere.

This is where the individual students become a body. Where you come and are included in and are approached by other students; Whether it's to join a group, come to an event, or just to introduce yourself.

The college has a very outdated, very hard to navigate online forum for finding and getting in touch with groups on campus. And many of these groups are dead/inactive. The group communication board is so outdated and so counter-intuitive that it's hard to use it to get in contact with others to bring a group back to life. I've opened multiple group pages only to see a handful of posts spread out over weeks, months, or YEARS asking if the group is still active.

Here, most of your friends will come from class. But depending on your professor, making friends in class will vary in difficulty. Some professors will allow you to choose partners for group assignments, others won't. And because this is a community college, you might be stuck working with the elderly, assistant nurse for the rest of the semester. -Not ideal match-up if you want someone cool to hang with.

If you want to make friends at this college, you will have to MAKE friends. Almost make it your mission on some days to go out, meet some people around campus and see if you hit it off. Last week I did this and made a new friend, it's certainly doable.

But if you're coming to this school expecting a thriving student culture, you'll probably be disappointed."
College Senior,2,"I'm not getting any financial aid because I already have an AA degree, so I am technically personal seeking with them, but talking with the financial aid people, they weren't much help for me. The only thing they truly told me was to look up scholarships and apply to them. They didn't even give me any places to look, which is disappointing since they know I'm paying for these classes myself right now."
College Junior,2,My experience with an online course is pretty bad and I'm not saying every single class is going to be like that but mostly the professor cares more about his other classes so online classes are the last classes they check to see if students need help and to grade stuff. It's usually difficult to contact them and the peer to peer interaction is bad because basically nobody wants to talk to their peers on online classes so basically you're on your own on those type of classes.
College Sophomore,2,It is not the classes that are bad it is the program they use. It is down for maintenance several times a week. It takes multiple login attempts to get into the system due to server error. The teachers refuse to use that as an excuse so be prepared to do your work ahead of time because if you wait to long the servers will be down and you will be screwed. The site went down for a few days and most of the teachers refused to accept late work.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the campus does not have wifi and many of the rooms do not get cell signal. If you bring you own laptop don't expect to be doing online research at school.
College Sophomore,2,I am interested in the nursing program and the wait list is so long I am choosing to leave and transfer to a better program.
College Freshman,2,"I do not like online classes, they are harder for me to motivate myself to work on"
Recent Alumnus,2,no closed caption or accessible for people with disabilities.
Recent Alumnus,2,The staff in the admissions dept is not at all helpful.  They make it very difficult to transfer from VCC to UCF when you have to obtain transcripts from out of state.  No customer focus at all.
College Junior,2,We don't have a lot of the things listed and our student center is the worse! Very unhelpful.
College Senior,2,The school tuition is cheap  but the book are expensive so I have to rented them from another company . The financial aid process is hard they require so many thing  but in the end you don't the financial aid
College Junior,2,"I rated this bad, because I had to take out a loan. This can be very tempting to someone who does not have much. I now owe for student loans, due to the fact that my college only goes on how much money you earn on your taxes. they don't take into account that you have other expenses. My tip to anyone looking to get a loan is to not fall into the trap of taking the full loan if at all possible."
College Sophomore,2,too many use the computers for foolishness and so others cannot use them for actual work
College Sophomore,2,Professors are terrible when it comes to grading and posting the grades online
College Sophomore,2,valencia is highly boring and nothing exciting that goes on at the campus
College Sophomore,2,Tuition is a little high for the type of professors we have 
College Freshman,2,The computer lab in the libaray is always packed. Theres not enough computer in my opinion. The cost of printing has went up since last semster.
College Freshman,2,"this is because I live 25 min away, all major arts classes are east campus, which is really out of the way."
Recent Alumnus,2,"You have to start in one room to ask your questions, then they will tell you another room to get the answers. Depending on the question it can be a complete run around."
College Freshman,2,A lot of the students here are sadly not the bright but we are diverse.
College Junior,2,"I am not a fan of online classes, I feel the teachers aren't as helpful."
College Freshman,2,Career services works well with students to help them find employment after school. 
Sophomore,1,"Graded discussions with liberal bias, so if you don't agree, your fellow classmates can hate on you and receive an ""A"".  I am not into politics and my major has nothing to do with politics, so the brainwashing of America's youth is taking place here."
Sophomore,1,"I am taking online classes, and there is absolutely no instruction. They tell you to read the book and take a test. They give you assignments and some you are expected to know how to do without an explanation. Even my classmates were complaining that they had to search youtube videos just to figure out how to do the assignments. If you email your instructor with a question, good luck on getting a timely response. Only a few teachers so far that actually graded their assignments in a timely manner and answered questions. Most of them are usually weeks/months behind in grading."
Niche User,1,My son went there for his MRI certification. During his practicum there were never enough MRI’s available for him to complete his requirements. He was unable to get his bachelors and Valencia’s answer is oh well we can’t help you
Freshman,1,Valencia college seems super promising and willing to help at first but once classes actually start they are super rude and have no intent on helping you. they drop your classes without telling you and their system is alway down.
Freshman,1,"As an out of state student that just moved to florida, I wanna say that they have a poor system and don't have organization. I have tried to talk to a dean the past two weeks and they always pair me up with an assistant instead with the dean also the financial aid advisor was giving me attitude since I got into the office. I don't recommend valencia at all if you are a out of state  because it is ridiculously expensive and you are going to take classes that are not necessary."
Freshman,1,"From my experience with Valencia College, most of the Professors are high school teachers with different degrees than the subject being taught."
Graduate Student,1,"My son attended the Film Program Valencia in 2012 & 2013. Awful experience!!  Fridays for the students are ""movie"" days. That's all they did was watch movies wow!  Did the school have a green screen? NO! How about hands on camera experience? Let's say, ""Nada""! The school invested 30 thousand dollars in one nice video movie camera, but would not allow the students to touch it. It would have been better if they invested in 15 or more older model cameras to give students hands on experience.  Did I mention the students never wrote a script? They didn't even get to produce a fake commercial or have casting calls for a scene. Nope!"
Sophomore,1,"Hated it, the teachers, the classes, and the school. There isn’t many resources for students and classes are more difficult than they should be. Moved to a new school and got all A’s."
Niche User,1,"It was okay.  Here for dual enrollment, and it transfers to UCF which is good.  The academics seem really easy though."
Alum,1,Staff is horrible. Long lines for any type of service. They will not listen and they have weird rules about everything. I would not recommend.
College Junior,1,it's terrible and teachers have work due the second they're posted
College Junior,1,Do not take online classes for a harder subject...
College Sophomore,1,Fiancial aid process was horrible
College Sophomore,1,I've seen no alumni work
College Sophomore,1,"Atlas is garbage, and making students try to do classes in it is ridiculous. No teacher agrees on a format for emails, work, submissions, etc, so you're really flying blind."
Recent Alumnus,1,I prefer taking classes onsite so I can not say much about the online classes.
College Sophomore,1,There is no sense of community. Students (ages ranging form 17-60+) go to classes and then go home. There is no interaction outside of that.
College Sophomore,1,"Horrible admin services. You aren't even allowed to meet with financial aid without going through the ""answer center"" aka work study program who know nothing. They screwed up multiple times and each time you go you can expect a completely different response. You can never get a hold of a supervisor to complain or handle the situation. You pretty much have to figure it out for yourself. On top of that they purposely charge hundreds of dollars in extra fees after claiming they are the most affordable college in Florida. The will also withhold your refund past the original release date. Beginning of the semester I went online and the website said a specific date. I came back a couple days before the release and they changed the date to a latter day. The new date comes along still no money. They released my funds 2 weeks after the last reported date which is still about a month after they originally claimed I was going to receive it. They purposely do this each semester to collect interest on the money. You have to go through higher one for your refund and I honestly can not tell you which group are bigger screw ups."
Recent Alumnus,1,"When i first enroll, i received no financial aid from Valencia. Also paying for the class and fee. it is ridcilous we have to pay more for the online for the homework assignments."
College Sophomore,1,"The student body is terrible, simply because anyone gets accepted"
College Sophomore,1,The financial Aid office is awful. I had to miss out on many classes because I don't have the funds to pay for them and Financial Aid is hardly enough to even cover one class.
College Senior,1,"Being an out of state student, I do with the tuition was easier for me. It does make it much to handle, but I do believe it is worth it."
College Junior,1,"I've only taken one online course and that's because a previous course of mine dropped at the last minute. The professor never really gave us instructions on any of the assignments, and since this was my first time I emailed him many times, which he wrote back 2 months after I dropped the class. Make sure you do your research on a professor who teaches an online class before you sign up for one or else it'll mess you up."
College Sophomore,1,everything is not offered at the campus near my residence 
College Junior,1,Valencia's wifi and its speed is poor. Everywhere you go the connection gets lost and then you have to wait up to 20 minutes for wifi to reconnect. The computer labs are always crowded or you have to come at a certain time to rush and try to get a computer. it's basically first come first serve.
College Junior,1,"My experience at Valencia Community College has been very frustrating most of the Advisors don't know half the things they're doing. The answer center is ridiculous because you have to wait in a long line. teachers there are helpful but some are too sarcastic. Majority of them are unorganized. If it wasn't for my classmates, I don't know how far I would have gotten."
College Junior,1,Valencia answer center is the main spot to get all your financial aid information and questions answered. At the library everyone is helpful the only bad side about the library is there's barely any room. Its always crowded. And trust me I wish they had an Athletic Center.
College Junior,1,"After almost nine weeks of registering for classes and eight different people telling me I had financial aid. Two weeks after school started, I kept looking at the not eligible though fafsa granted it, it supposedly changed and my major was no longer eligible for financial aid at this class. If I would had known I would have taken it at another College which was covered. Every person I tried to reach out to either was rude or just didn't care that. I have no gotten no help with it. It is an invest in me but it puts me in a real tough spot. I work pretty much paycheck to paycheck and thought it was my chance to make a better life for myself. But it is just stepping me back big time. I have no one to turn to."
College Senior,1,"I have tried to get financial at my school but they have taken so much time to process my paperwork. There is a lot of hassling for paperwork and many visits to the answer center for help. So far, I've had to spend my money paying for classes and books which has cleaned out my bank; money that was intended for my car."
College Junior,1,Trying to register and speak with counselors is extremly difficult.
College Senior,1,They don't stress the importance of continuing your education after one graduates.
College Sophomore,1,I have received very little help in Learning what my future major will be and I have there is no program for my major. I am currently studying to be a Physical Therapist. We have the programs but it difficult to find someone to help explain what my best options are for my future.
College Sophomore,1,"good luck!  you need to apply for fafsa  online before you even try to speak with anyone at the school because that's the first thing they will say.  also apply for the Valencia scholarship, it takes time but that's the only other scholarship they win suggest. I asked for more help and that's all they gave me."
College Senior,1,"I could write all day about how I feel about the financial aid process at Valencia. Honestly, nothing has made me more frustrated. It's the worst. I have changed my major last year and now hold too many credits that don't apply towards my major. I wrote an appeal about how genuine and dedicated I was towards my new career choice and just like they do with anyone else, I got denied. I have great passion for what I do, and I will do it, but Valencia's financial aid process is the one thing that has put me behind with graduating and I can't wait to complete my studies at Valencia because of how much stress it has caused."
College Senior,1,"My husband graduated from Valencia with his A.A. and has yet to find a meaningful job offer.  I know an A.A. isn't much but still the fact that it seems to be universally dismissed is a cause for concern as to the benefit of attending a two year college.  When he tried to go to the career center, they did nothing for him and simply scolded him for not haven joined internships while he was attending the school."
College Freshman,1,My life at Valencia College is not fun; they have 3 types of teachers. Ones that love their job and do great at it. Ones that hate there job and to bad at it. Ones that don't do there job at all. This is why it's hard to finish the school.
College Junior,1,The gym is not available to all students and the fee is more expensive than other facilities.
College Senior,1,I do not do online courses. I tried twice and didn't do very good. I prefer having a guide and someone there to ask question and have a reply instantly.
College Junior,1,Valencia college does not have an English program. I'm taking general studies now until I transfer. Many students are in gerneral studies and i believe we are set up for success.
College Sophomore,1,I don't really know how Valencia differs from other schools only because i've never visited other colleges.
Recent Alumnus,1,Nothing sets it apart. There are limited clubs and activities
College Senior,1,"Bad Teacher – Great class, great idea, horrible teacher. I will for sure take another class online though"
College Senior,1,"As much as they say they want to help you, the financial aid system is very strange. Apparently, if you have a certain amount of credits you cannot get financial aid, which doesn't make sense. So if I've taken ""too many classes"", they'll stop giving me money? Even if these classes were taken at a different institution."
College Junior,1,Non Existant – I feel as though when you graduate from valencia you are just let out into the world on your own with a Congrats and good luck.
College Senior,1,"Parking Is a Nightmare at All Hours. I'm not too sure if it's too many students on campus at once or if there aren't enough parking spaces. Either way, finding parking even at 8am is not a fun feat. Getting there super early is the only way you'll be able to find a prime parking spot. It's very uncomfortable to have to waste a tank of gas going from lane to lane trying to find a parking spot then having to run to class. Not the best way to start a semester."
College Senior,1,Learn to Teach Yourself – I was interested in taking an online class but do to my work schedule I enrolled in an online course. I will not be taking another online course because I felt like i was not learning and retaining any information. It was also hard to understand when things were due and where to locate different assignments. Not having direct communication with a professor  or students does not help me learn it does quite the opposite in my experience.
College Junior,1,"Student Services – Valencia must have one of the worst call centers! They always have a few people working and there is a huge line, that will take atleast 2 hours. And that my friends is if you are lucky! They also do not explain what you need to know in detail. They assume that you know already what has to be done. They just want to toss you aside so that the line could keep moving."
College Freshman,1,Online Classes – the teacher was nice but she never even took the time to update the site we needed to work off it is 2011 and she had 2007 up there. when it came time to work out of the bookshe gave us the wrong page numbers told us if that was not the right page # look at the front of the book.
College Sophomore,1,"There is not much diversity, almost everyone is hispanic"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Financial aid advisors can be a little confusing and sometimes give you wrong information that can cause you to back track or have problems with your taxes.
Tuition is not as high as a universable but it never hurts if it were lower."
College Sophomore,1,The enrollment process and the financial aid  process was very difficult. Every time I would go to the answer center the representative would tell me something different to bring each time. Instead of telling me want to bring the very first time so that I wouldn't have to make the 3 hr line so many times
College Student,1,Valencia College is just a school. You go to school to learn. What I have experienced is an environment where you solely focus on that. People Just go to Valencia to take their classes and leave. I feel people are apathetic in this place and the same is happening to me. I want to be motivated and have a great environment with nice people. Valencia just makes you not wanting to be there.
College Freshman,1,"Unless you are training to become an EMT or Vet tech, post-grad doesn't even exist here."
College Freshman,1,Register for Classes – There's not too much classes available to register.
College Senior,1,"I believe Financial Aid overall should improve on their policies. The parents of some students choose to not help with the process and therefore makes it difficult for some to not qualify. I have a friend who was denied Financial Aid because his parents make too much money. Yet, they are not helping him with tuition or anything and so he is not in school because he himself can't afford it. IS THAT FAIR???"
College Junior,1,"Horrid first semester.  My transcripts were mailed to the wrong campus and were not followed up with the anyone from any other campus or any freshman advisor that was looking to see that I was a summer student taking classes waiting also for transcripts to be posted to get financial aid, to get books, etc,  This created a major disability in my learning process in one of my classes that I could not share a book and that I had to have a lab book for with a unique code.  There was really no one to help me at all, even though everone kept saying there was."
College Junior,1,"Nursing Program Not So Great – I'm in the second semester of nursing and more than half of my class is failing. No one cares if you pass, they just tell you that maybe you need to ""hear"" the content again. Nursing 1 was totally different, they were nice and welcoming and you felt good all around. In nursing 2 it feels like hey are slowly picking each one of us off. If the program continues I think out graduating class with be less than 50 (started at almost 150)."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Tedious and Annoying – The tuition in Valencia is affordable for the most who works.
Do the FAFSA forms early as possible. I've seen female students broke down in tears because they did not turn in their FAFSA forms early. It takes almost two weeks for the FAFSA forms to process. Thus, do not procrastinate with the FAFSA forms!"
College Senior,1,"Similiar to a Root Canal – Avoid this school at all costs.  The administration is a joke. Everytime I mailed documentation they lost it. You have to physically drive down there just to ask a question (then you get the wrong answer)  I take online classes. the technology they use are in ancient times. Sure it's cheaper, but the price and time you must take to make these people do their jobs properly outweighs the costs. I have never seen so much irresponsibility in my life. 

I am transferring, I really do not have the time to spend with constantly correcting the mistakes. Better make sure you certify everything you mail to them, they will lose it."
College Junior,1,"Finance Aid – the finance aid process is very stressful and annoying. you or your parent (if your underage) have to file income tax. but what if your parent didn't file and doesn't have the means to file. they won't even accept you, at least for finance aid. the price compared to other school isn't so bad, it just the whole finance aid process could be better."

Senior,5,I have taken classes online and they have been great.  I feel like I learned just as much as I would have if I was in a classroom.  CUC easily made the transition to online learning during the Pandemic.  I am a commuter student so taking classes online has allowed me to reduce the number of days that I need to commute to campus which allows me to work more and also more easily complete my practicum hours for my major and graduation.
Senior,5,"My first two and a half years I lived on campus.  I enjoyed it.  The school is small enough to make you feel like on big family.  There are so many activities to get involved in and the location provides opportunities to explore Chicago and the surrounding area.  Professors have been amazing and my class size has always been small.  In my major classes there are generally no more than 20 students but most were about 10. This provided for more one on one attention from the professor and also interaction among students.  In addition, I was able to connect with other students that shared the same major."
Graduate Student,5,Online learning is still beneficial. There are assignments where instructors truly check for an in-depth understanding about the topics. There are often quizzes in each class as well.
Graduate Student,5,"I like CUC, it is very structured and predictable with each class having the same expectations.  I would like the instructors to be more clear on what they are looking for with each specific assignment."
Graduate Student,5,"Love the school and the environment, all of my instructors are great at communicating with me and ensuring that all of my questions are answered. They always reply to my emails and engage me in the assignments well."
Graduate Student,5,"My learning experience has been amazing here, I have caught onto the way Concordia functions very easily and I always have an easy time getting hold of my instructors for any questions or concerns that I may have."
Freshman,5,"I love Concordia Chicago. When I first joined the school, I was nervous of the new surroundings. The professors and students are really friendly. Faculty members won’t hesitate to help you around. Professors are excellent in their teachings and are clear that they are available for us if we need help. Overall, love this school and I’m so glad to be a cougar."
Senior,5,"Concordia has some of the most flexible, considering, caring, experienced instructors and I'm pretty grateful for that. As a student that has been moving a couple times during life situations and challenges, the understanding sense from instructors when I struggle help me feel comfortable coming to school to either seek help or continue to push forward in my educational goals. The school is still catching up in technology advances but overall, whatever resources that are available help."
Graduate Student,5,They have been extremely informative in all aspects and all staff is very easy to work with. Couldn't be more excited to be  graduate of Concordia!
Freshman,5,"Concordia University is honestly an amazing school. There are plenty of activities to enjoy while on and off campus, and classes haven’t even started yet. I enjoy going to chapel because the deacon has a wonderful character. The deans are very kind and helpful. Everyone here is usually high spirited. One thing that would like to see changed is the living area for my dormitory. They took out the kitchen for the dorms due to the students. It would be great to have them back. Other than that, the campus is great, and the people here are amazing. Im glad I chose this school."
Graduate Student,5,"I am an online student in the doctoral program in Leadership , so I can’t make any recommendations on the physical location at CUC, but I am really enjoying the program thus far.  I have had several excellent instructors and online learning experiences and have been academically challenged far more than I had anticipated, in a fun way! The coursework has been as challenging as I had hoped for and all the classroom experiences have been worth the investment."
Sophomore,5,"This school has a great small school environment. Everybody on campus is familiar, which is a nice transition into a college campus. Many sports are offered, especially for a small private school. It is very welcoming and the faculty are always there to help students."
Freshman,5,"I have not yet started classes, but I have visited the campus. It’s extremely beautiful and the tourists are beyond polite and welcoming!! What ever question you may have, they have it. The school spirit is so joyous and determined. Not to mention the admission counselor!! Very helpful and will always check on you to make sure everything is going great for the admission process!!"
Senior,5,"Very happy with my choice of Concordia University, I transferred here after an unhappy situation at another school. I was made to feel welcome from the moment I arrived.  I am a pitcher on the Baseball Team and felt a part of the team immediately.  Looking forward to my Senior year"
Graduate Student,5,The PhD program is fully online permitting me to continue working while learning and experiencing an international interaction with coursemates.  Very valuable learning experience!
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this school. The professors are incredible, the school community is great, and there are consistently events going on around campus. The surrounding area is gorgeous as well, and there's always something to do. It's a short train ride to downtown Chicago, so that's always an option on the weekends/evenings."
Junior,5,Concordia is amazing! Their admissions office and advisers are there to walk you through every process. Classes are well worth it!
Senior,5,No matter where you go on campus you always see a friendly face. The school makes sure that everyone feels involved and is there for the students 100%
Junior,5,Concordia is a great school with a small class setting. Teachers actually try to get to know you and don't consider you a number.
Freshman,5,"I like CUC because the student body tends to be very welcoming. The professors seem nice, the food is pretty good, and there are all sorts of things to do on campus and in the surrounding area. Best of all, they are very generous with financial aid, especially to those in need."
Graduate Student,5,"This college is a well respected institution.  The professors are knowledgeable, and the courses are rigorous.  The online format makes it easier to have a full time job while attending school."
Niche User,5,Concordia Chicago is in a very nice area of Chicago and has very friendly people. The staff are well equipped for their subjects and very amicable. I would like to see more scholarship opportunities there especially concerning sports since it is a private school and tuition is not that cheap. Overall it is a very nice place and I would highly recommend it.
Freshman,5,I enjoy the school very much even though I just started! The school focuses on each person individual to make sure they're on task to graduating!
Graduate Student,5,This university is staffed with instructors that work hard to encourage both your personal and professional growth.
Freshman,5,"Concordia University Chicago is a place where you go to feel at home. The students and staff are so welcoming and make you feel as though you belong. Being in Chicago allows students like me to explore and try new things with new friends. I have made so many new friends who I know I will be friends with for the rest of my life. College here was such a success that I would recommend Concordia University Chicago to anyone who wants to explore and to feel like you're at a home away from home. Overall, great experience!"
Niche User,5,I love the campus and teachers! The classes they offer are very diverse. The campus life is very active.
College Junior,5,I have truly enjoyed my time at CUC. It is very good school that really focuses on each student. The professors challenge the students and assure that they are successful.
College Freshman,5,"Our campus security is very active in their work, I witnessed an off-duty security worker run all the way across campus to respond to a fire alarm and help out with the other security workers. It was relieving to see that even when off-duty that they truly have a generally high care for the school and the people here. Security does not disclose a lot of their issues to the public of the school because they do not want things getting around and making it worse, but they have handled fire alarms, cops, assaults of all types and other types of calls very carefully and kept campus a very safe place to be no matter what time it is."
College Freshman,5,"The bathrooms on my floor were constantly flooding but that has ceased for the most part. The campus life really is like family, it truly is like a home away from home for me. This community that I am living in now is the community that I will be dealing with for the rest of my life. I am a Pre-Seminary student which means I am going to Seminary after college to be a pastor, the community of other Pre-Seminary and other Church Worker programs that I am building now will affect the church in the future and as well as me. I try to take my community serious and we build each other up, we also build up and constantly socialize with non-church work people to create the best social environment inside and outside the classroom and dorms."
College Freshman,5,"The community in and with this school is absolutely amazing, I have not found this kind of community in the other colleges I researched. People here are very accepting, no matter where you come from or what your beliefs are, and it forms a sense of family, not just friendship. I absolutely love my college because of the ministry groups that are available to everyone and those that I am involved in. I would choose this school over and over again and I am considering sending my future kids to this school because I am enjoying it so much. As a part of the community here at school, we build lasting friendships and those friendships feel like family and it honestly feels like home away from home."
College Sophomore,5,"I always see campus security out and about. I rarely hear of violence on campus. The few times we had suspicious behavior, the campus notified us immediately."
College Sophomore,5,"For me, everything is great. Yes, its like any school and you will have a crummy professor, but the really good ones make up for it."
College Sophomore,5,"I know for sure when I leave, I will have a job. I am very confident CUC will help me."
College Sophomore,5,I love the small school atmosphere. There is so much community. It was very easy to make this place feel like home. All of my needs are met and it is great that laundry is free! The food variety is pretty good and I see that the school is listening to student feedback to make the campus the best it can be.
College Sophomore,5,"I am in my school's track & field team and I love it. The coach is amazing and very understanding. The team is great. We usually finish in the middle pack of the conference. The track team doesn't get a big audience for away meets but when we had our home meet, we had a lot of people show up. The fitness center in our school is about two years old and it is great. I love it and it has a lot of weightlifting stuff and as well as treadmills."
College Junior,5,It is a great living environment
College Sophomore,5,The restarunts are all great and very affordable. It's a wide varitety of different foods to choose from.
Recent Alumnus,5,For and exercise science major the prof r wonderful!
College Freshman,5,I am not entirely sure.
College Freshman,5,The campus is small and is surrounded by nature. There are shops and fun places to go to close by and transportations to bring you there if you want to go have fun or eat. It is beautiful during winter time when the snow is falling and everything is white.
College Freshman,5,The lessons are very clear and the teachers are incredibly helpful in helping the students understand the course.
College Freshman,5,There are no drug visibility or usage in my school.
College Sophomore,5,I love my program! I am learning everything I will need to know as a teacher and there is always someone there who can help me and answer my questions.
College Sophomore,5,The programs I am involved in are fantastic. There are professors who have had experience in the field and teach very well. The courses are reasonably hard and you learn the things you need to. There is a lot of real life experience and internship opportunities in the fields.
College Student,5,"Love the area, it is small but once you step off campus, there is so much to do and see"
College Student,5,There are many off-campus dining very close to the university. They are all within walking distance and have a good variety of places to choose from
College Sophomore,5,"The professors in each of my study areas (education, art, and Spanish) are wonderful! In the beginning education classes there isn't a lot of outside of class work with the exception of field experience. Once you get closer to student teaching, there is a lot more work to do out side of class.All art classes require hours of studio time. "
College Sophomore,5,"Being an education major, they make getting pre-professional hours really easy to get. They work these hours in to class assignments, and some classes even will go do field work instead of having class on a certain day. The methods classes will go to a classroom, observe, and go back to the class a few weeks later to practice teaching. "
College Freshman,5,The computers are quite nice at Concordia University because they have both Mac&PC. There are I believe 4 computer labs and one of them is open 24/7. :)
College Junior,5,"Concordia is a small campus, so there isn't any need for transportation throughout the school. However, being so close to Chicago gives us amazing public transportation. The school is a short walk to the Green Line and there are always buses running. Concordia also provides shuttles to the airport and train station before winter break to make it easier for students to get home."
College Sophomore,5,There will always be parking available in the parking garage
College Senior,5,There all a lot of activities on campus that have us talking to get other but all the dorms floors have one gender. And the opposite gender has to be off the floors at night.
College Senior,5,I've been very satisfied with my education thus far. I have changed majors three times and all the professors in the majors knew their stuff it was great.
College Senior,5,River Forest is a small place. There are beautifull house all over and we are only a 30 minute eL ride from downtown Chicago so it great. The streets are great to walk down anytime of day and there is a feeling of community.
College Senior,5,"The classes here make you think and the professors know their stuff. It is great because the campus is so small, the class are smaller, this help everyone get closer and the professors encourage you to push yourself."
College Freshman,5,They are very good with safety and they make sure that everyone is safe.  There is always a campus policeman walking around and will always be there when you need him/her.
College Freshman,5,I think that all the athletes here at Concordia are really good.  They always try their best and there is always a crowd to cheer them on.
College Freshman,5,My financial advisor has helped me out so much.  She has answered all my questions and keeps me updated with new scholarships and reminds me to submit my FAFSA or other paperwork.
College Freshman,5,"For guys a lot are from the south or from Illinois.Most of them are athletes that like to party, but yet still do good in school. Same goes for the girls on campus, but they are more involved in clubs"
College Junior,5,"There is always something going on.  There are always games, clubs and outings for students to join."
Junior,4,Concordia University-Chicago is in a great location that is surrounded with a ton of different eating options and other activities. The campus is about 40 minutes on the green line from Downtown Chicago. The atmosphere at Concordia is so friendly and welcoming.
Junior,4,I take about one class each semester online and have never had an issue. Some professors will encourage group work throughout the semester to still get that in-class feel. Professors will upload a weeks worth of work at a time.
Senior,4,"Overall, I enjoyed going to Concordia. All the professors I had were friendly and actually enjoyed teaching. The campus is small too which I liked as well, it’s very easy to find your way around. As a commuter, I never had any difficulty finding parking which is a big plus for me."
Graduate Student,4,"The program is geared toward the working adult, and allows work and family life balance to continue while still getting an accredited education. Most of the professors are very accessible. I have experienced difficulties with a couple of professors being poor with follow up and canceling classes frequently, but it is not the norm."
Junior,4,Concordia has a great environment overall. The location of the  school is amazing and one of the best parts of the school. Many of the buildings and resources are very outdated and old. The professors are helpful and welcoming. There is a great small school and campus atmosphere while being in the city.
Senior,4,I have loved attending Concordia because of the amazing extracurricular opportunities as well as being able to be involved in a loving and Christian community with people and professors that truly care about you. I have made life long friends and the community by far is one of the best things that Concordia has to offer.
Senior,4,"Concordia Chicago has given me endless opportunities to explore my other options within my degree. The advisors made it possible for me to minor in different areas as well as focusing my major with my classes and clubs. The student life has also helped me venture out my social light. Since Concordia is a small campus, students and faculty make events so that students can easily interact with one another, making school and sports events enjoyable for everybody."
Senior,4,"This campus is in a good environment with access to lots of stores and restaurants that are helpful to residents. Regarding classes, I would prefer for it to not have as many required courses related to theology. However, I like the relationship students can make with professors as office hours are quite accessible."
Niche User,4,"I enjoy Concordia Chicago's dual credit online classes, and I like how they are explanatory in what the requirements are for a project. I have been to the campus, however, and the area around the college is not the safest. I do however, like the campus itself.  The professors, even through the online courses, are very understanding and personable. If I was ill one day or had a family emergency, they were extremely flexible in working with me on project due dates. I also appreciate how easy the website is to navigate, especially to the online library. Even though I enjoy the diversity of the projects assigned, I do suggest that less group projects are required. The project is difficult enough to complete by itself, without having to worry about a few other peoples’ schedules, as well. Overall, I really enjoy the school’s campus, staff, and curriculum and I am honored to be enrolled as a student at Concordia University Chicago."
Graduate Student,4,"I am an online student in the doctoral program for Health and Human Performance, so cannot make any recommendations on the physical location at CUC, but I am really enjoying the program thus far. In my first year I have had several excellent instructors and online learning experiences and have been academically challenged far more than I had anticipated, in a fun way! Although not all coursework has been as difficult or academically expansive as I had hoped for, the majority of classroom experiences have been worth the investment."
Graduate Student,4,I'm a distant learning graduate student in gerontology who has a full professional plate other than my school attendance so being able to do coursework virtually is my preference.
Senior,4,I like the programs that Concordia University has to offer. I currently attend the university as an online student. I love this program because it makes it easy for me to work full time and finish my degree.
Freshman,4,"Concordia I truly a place where I am able to find myself. The staff cares about every student and there are so many resources available to you on the campus and in the community. The campus itself is constantly becoming diverse and the ratio between commuters and out of state residents is incredible. Because if Concordia I am A proud Nursing Student, working on campus, and Vice President of the New Nursing club and first year cheerleader all within my first year."
Freshman,4,"I am currently attending Concordia University of Chicago and i have been very pleased so far with my first year. I am enrolled in Sports, as i am part of the Women's Soccer Team and the Women's Track and Field. I have met very great people through sports and have found the place to be of comfort. Academics wise i have enjoyed the majority of my classes especially the ones that have to do with my major. Overall you have the chance for additional help with the teacher or your teammates/students. The year has fluently gone very quick and very excited for next year."
Senior,4,"I choose to go to Concordia University Chicago because since they very beginning they have been helpful and answered all my questions. They didn't give me the run around to make me sign up for their school with out me knowing what I was going to get into as far as scholarships, financial aid, and what I needed for the school year.  Mostly all of the staff that work there are very nice and helpful. This school cares about their students future and education. The area in which Concordia is located is very nice and safe. This school is remolding the school and making updates to it so it is going to be even better. What I love about this school is that they have two different computer labs one for Apple and one for PC."
Graduate Student,4,I attend as an online student and am working on my Master's through this school.  So far my experience has been great.  Their online communication is speedy and they do a good job of answering ALL of your questions to their fullest abilities.
Senior,4,A great institution for those who are studying to be teachers due to all of the courses and preparatory requirements needed for the college of education.
Graduate Student,4,I'm very pleased. So far everything is going smooth. I would recommend for others. Can't wait for next semester.  Please consider this university for MA in counseling.
Graduate Student,4,I enjoyed studying educational technology online with Concordia. Most professors were up to date with articles and information.  They were readily available via phone and email for additional help. They gave a lot of support and resources to help with research.
Sophomore,4,"I was a freshman; miles away from home--only one hundred and ninety-one. So of course it wasn't the  most thrilling experience, but it was most definitely worthwhile. Although, the school is a non-for profit University I don't believe I was robbed of my investments. Instead, I gained an entirely new perspective of life, grew closer in my faith and even met some fairly incredible people within the process. 

My professors were helpful and extremely easygoing. I loved that. As far as partying goes, I made my own party scene in my dorm room because I had no roommate--this maybe was the highlight of my experience--plus, CHICAGO was only 15-20 minutes from the corner so it was never a dull moment. 

Overall, I fell in love with CU Chicago in my own little way probably way different from others. From the size of the University all the way to the simple fact that I made an honest hustle of providing hair services to students."
Freshman,4,"So far I love it so much, you get to fellowship with brothers and sisters, a great place to know more about our Lord and what he ha done."
Sophomore,4,"The staff and other students are very helpful and small in size, so you can get easily acquainted with everyone around you. The faculty are very helpful and you are able to get help on a personal level with them, which is something you can't experience outside of a school with an average class size smaller than 20-30. The education programs are excellent as I hear from fellow students and there is a strong emphasis on music and religion as well."
Sophomore,4,I love Concordia it's become home to me. But like other colleges there are nasty sides to it.  They don't take mental health seriously and while campus security is very nice they aren't always competent.
Freshman,4,"I love the atmosphere here at Concordia Chicago. While it is a small, D-III school, it is easy to get involved in many different activities on campus. Also, the College of Education is excellent! The professors genuinely care about their students."
Sophomore,4,"Concordia is  wonderful place if you enjoy being near the big city. You are literally about a half hour from downtown Chicago which can offer a lot of opportunity. The one thing I would change is the food. The food is awful, the food lacks nutritional value and there are such limited options. Students frequently use their own money to go out and get food rather than using the meal plan which is ridiculously expensive."
Senior,4,I enjoyed the campus life. Our school was always clean and have a very safe environment. Students were kind to one another and supported each other to achieve greater in their courses. 
College Junior,4,"The campus buildings are sligtly older, but have a lot of character."
College Junior,4,People enjoy going to games and there is a lot of school spirit even if our team doesn't do that well.  Games are fun to go to with friends!  I wish students could use the facilities even when they aren't athletes on a team.
College Freshman,4,"In my freshman opinion, I see sports as a great cause and very active force on campus. I did not really take part in sports because they really aren't my thing to watch. But I did get involved in watching sports, on campus, when CIT happened. CIT stands for Concordia Invitational Tournament, which is where all the Concordia Universities come together at one of their own campus's and play sports together and compete against each other. This is possibly the biggest influx and watched sporting event/weekend at Concordia University Chicago. It is a lot of fun with team involvement, fan support/spirit and school spirit."
College Senior,4,I feel like an individual and that I am important to the university.  The admissions department was very helpful when I needed information. I would definitely choose Concordia again!
College Sophomore,4,"The professors at Concordia care about their students and their overall success in their fields. I find myself better acquainted with the professors more than the students. Some professors in particular that I have had the honor of having class with have truly exceeded my expectations. These professors include: Dr. Do, Dr. Flynn, Dr. Bender and Dr. Smith who is no longer a professor with Concordia."
College Sophomore,4,"I have never really had any complaints, but I have always been blessed with great rooms and roommates."
College Sophomore,4,"The fan support at times is the most amazing experience you will ever get, but our sports teams suck. The never have a winning record."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Class sizes are relatively small and very intimate. The professors are great and all unique in there own. Concordia offers the same class as any state university but also theology, Lutheran classes."
Recent Alumnus,4,There are emails just about everyday regarding available jobs in the area. Anywhere from 'babysitting' to 'student work study' jobs.
Recent Alumnus,4,Security walks the small campus at night. Concordia is also a dry campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"As a Music education major, Concordia is a school that loves music. Incredibly intimate, the staff in your major really try to connect with you. All education class are taught by people who want to see you succeed. Athletics are encouraged! Just about every program at CUC travels/trips. It's a Lutheran school that welcomes EVERYONE."
Recent Alumnus,4,Majority of the student body is an athlete or live an athletic lifestyle.
College Junior,4,The thing that I love about Concordia the most is the people. Everyone is extremely nice and approachable. The dorms need to be updated and the tuition is somewhat extreme with really limited options for scholarships but other than that it is a pretty good school.
College Junior,4,"feel very safe

good security 

very protective and always looking out for students"
College Junior,4,"Good School.

Teachers are very helpful 

All the advisors there are helpful and want to help you out"
College Sophomore,4,The registration process was a lot to handle. Applying and all wasn't good but registering for class was a hassle and did take a lot of time because I had to look into the courses myself. The popular study area at Concordia is education and I think that the support we get from the professors is amazing.
College Sophomore,4,Concordia usually sends a campus wide email about assaults around the campus and it's usually an awareness email letting students know to keep an eye open. They are really good on arriving if there's a problem and the campus security guards are always on duty and walking around campus. The campus is a safe place and I do feel safe walking on campus at night.
College Sophomore,4,"I like how my school constantly sends emails about student-teaching internships to every education major. Even though I am a sophomore, I like to see those emails because I know my school is really notifying everyone about opportunities even though some of us are young and inexperienced in our college career. I can go up to anyone in the education building and talk about my future and what they can do to help and that's something I love about my university."
College Sophomore,4,"I have had great relationships with some of my professors. My favorite professors have come from my education courses and they have taught me a lot about teaching. Some gen-Ed courses to me made no sense like the noetics courses. As college students, I do believe we should have been given courses that will help us think more and be more independent and not just sit in lectures and hear about what this person has to say. I did enjoy them a lot because they did help me meet a lot of new people because of the projects invoked but I did feel like they asked for too much. I think the class sizes are perfect and I love how it's not lecture based classes."
College Sophomore,4,I commute to Concordia so I really can't give any good answers on dorming.
College Sophomore,4,I like Concordia University Chicago. It's a great school. All the professors there are super nice and always willing to help. I am in the track & field team and the coach is great and very understanding. He is one of the best coaches I've ever had. I would choose Concordia all over again because the campus is so welcoming and the the friends I've made there are really awesome. One reason why I wouldn't choose it is because tuition is a lot and it really has me working hard over the summer to pay for the fall semesters tuition.
College Junior,4,It's a very good school and it also is a small school to which is very helpful because you get to know everybody and they can help you more one on one.
College Sophomore,4,good education and nice area
College Senior,4,I like the option of taking my classes online so I don't have to try to drive over 2 hours a day to go to class.
College Freshman,4,"The people and staff have been amazing, nice, and helpfull so far."
College Sophomore,4,I got all the necessary scholarships.
College Sophomore,4,"very cheep, close to campus, you can eat actual good food"
College Sophomore,4,Usually we get off-campus food once a week and they are very good
College Sophomore,4,Dorms are average size but the people make it the best. Having a floor of people just hanging out is awesome.
College Junior,4,It is great when you know the right people
College Junior,4,Wish it could be more but Im not complaining
College Junior,4,Some people do not have cars so walking to school is great exercise
College Freshman,4,I got a lot of money right away from this school and was able to get more with out many problems.
College Junior,4,"There are a lot of near by local eateries, along with a few chain restaurants as well walking distance from school. There are some great places, and some flops, but they're all pretty good."
Freshman,2,only for covid but at the end of it sometimes it was just about the professors messing up rather than somethings
Freshman,2,"My experience as a first year student  at Concordia University Chicago has been good and bad. For starters the school is very small and for a school that size you would think the community of students would be tight knit, however that is not the case. The school is very split up in terms of beliefs. There are many catholic people who attend Concordia for  their curriculum and are treated differently by their Lutheran peers. The school is not as diverse as they promote seeing The school should focus more on their diversity and the comfort of their students rather than pushing us to go to chapel. However the staff that I have spoken to about help regarding finances have helped me tremendously. If you are ever in a difficult spot financially they are more than willing to help you. That is the best thing I have to say about my Concordia experience thus far."
College Junior,2,The dorms need to be updated and student life outside of classes would be nice.
College Junior,2,"There aren't a lot of amenities.  Some floors have social atmosphere, some don't, it depends on the building."
College Freshman,2,There is hardly any upkeep on buildings and they do not appeal to students. We also have too many rules for being young adults.
College Freshman,2,There is hardly any motivation to go to games and no one truly cares about sport life on campus.
College Freshman,2,"I am actually transferring after my first semester of being here because the lack of campus life, the college forcing religion, and the outdated programs."
College Freshman,2,"I personally haven't had the best experience, don't like living on campus and don't like many of my professors. I thought coming to a small private would be best for me but it has been the opposite sadly."
College Freshman,2,"Nothing special, like a glorified high school party."
College Freshman,2,"I personally don't like the athletics here, they aren't that good and not to many people care when they're going on. If I didn't live right by the football stadium I wouldn't we had football games going on."
College Junior,2,"It's a cute little area, but everything is just very expensive around this area."
Recent Alumnus,2,Everyone looks like they just rolled out of bed girls with greasy hair and guys with horrible morning breath
Recent Alumnus,2,Extremely strict except when it comes to enforcing parking in the parking garage and if there is an accident forget them help you
Recent Alumnus,2,The head of campus security was recently fired for masturbating into a coworkers shoes
College Student,2,More scholarships should be available since the tuition is so costly
College Junior,2,"You'll find that there is not a high diversity of race at this school. Majority of the student body is Caucasian. 50% Caucasian, 25% Hispanic 15% African American, 10% Asian. The typical student look for guys are football/baseball t-shirts with either sweat pants or shorts. The girls typical look is jeans with a t-shirt or a print dress. Everyone is either blonde or brunette. There is not much variety."
College Junior,2,"The programs are great... however, Concordia is horrible at keeping their accreditations. Even worse, they choose not to communicate the expiration of accreditations to students."
College Junior,2,"To get in, had to sumit resume? I do not know why?"
College Freshman,2,"Although the parking and convenience are great, the price to live off campus across the street is higher than what one would pay to live on-campus. The best way to save your money is to commute from home. To get into one of the apartments across the street, a person has to enter into a contest where upper classmen have the higher chances of winning."
College Sophomore,2,The School Counseling program seems disorganized at times. Our cohort seems to always be assigned a professor at the last minute. On more than one occasion we have arrived to our off campus location only to find the building is closed. We also feel lost in the sense that our advisor is not the best at communicating program changes to us. The director of the program rarely responds to concerns that our cohort has had.
Freshman,1,The only thing this school taught me is how to make the right choice and choose anything but this school. Believe me this school is not worth it!!!
Freshman,1,This school is a religion trap. They shove  religion in every class even if this said class (math) doesn’t involve religion.  The food is gross.  Tampons are $5 for a pack of 2.  The teachers seem to be as old as the Bible itself and they hold old views. And the counselors give zero f’s. If you are religious or are wanting to be involved in church for the rest of your life this school is PERFECT for you.  You will get along nicely. HOWEVER if you are thinking about going here because they offer you lots of money for mediocrity TURN AROUND it’s not worth it.  Trust me. In short THIS SCHOOL SUCKS.
Freshman,1,"I chose To go to this school at the last minute and now I totally regret it. The campus may have a college feel to it but there is no student life, the academics is okay but even if they say there is diversity there is none the only international students are the Asian exchange students. The faculty don’t give you enough information when it comes to your courses and tuition. Overall it’s not so great."
College Junior,1,"Finding scholarships for this school is next to impossible to find anything at all. I don't know what Im going to do, this school is so freaking expensive and they' offer next to no scholarships at all for the school."
Recent Alumnus,1,At cuc they force u to have a meal plan even if u commute. Food is always the same and is ok to have once a week but not everyday
Recent Alumnus,1,The snow is so overwhelming here.
College Sophomore,1,The computers in the labs are slow and unreliable
College Junior,1,As a grad student with a 4.0 GPA i get absolutely nothing from Concordia.
College Junior,1,"Counselors you have to chase down, it seems they are only interested in getting you in to the school. Once that get the money, you do not hear from anyone! You have to do the hunting for other financial aide that is out there. Not use to this when I was at SIU, they were on it(sholarships)"
College Junior,1,"No one follow up with you, you have to go online or call and check yourself. Recruit/counselors act like once they have you sign up! it looks like they are doing their jb in getting new people in. After that your on your own."
College Freshman,1,"Concordia University, because of it's prices, is not generally diverse. The people living on my floor were all Caucasian women and I was the Hispanic on the floor."
College Senior,1,The parking is terrible if you are not parking in the garage. The school will give you a ticket if your car is parked in a parking lot for too long. What's the use of having a parking lot if you are going to give tickets all the time?
College Junior,1,"There are many different diversities at Concordia, Each religion, sport, race, major have their own little groups within themselves. The athletes all know each other and hang out with athletes. The Latino groups have their own group. The music people have their own groups as well."
College Senior,1,"Campus Is Old – Concordia campus has not been renovated in some time. The newest building is an education center, so if you are not an education major, you will never go in there anyways. The dorms are the same exact dorm that my parents lived in when they went there, so dont be expecting nice living facilities. The are two connected gyms, but the hours are very poor, they close at like 3 on the weekends. They are also landlocked so its not like the will ever be expanding. The campus is pretty much controlled by the community around it, so its a dry campus, and the football games cannot reach a certain decible level, and there are no lights for night games. I started off giving this a C, but after typing all this, i realize that it deserves a D or F"
College Freshman,1,Nothing to Do – There is really not much to do. The campus is a dry campus. And there's not many sororities or fraternities.
College Senior,1,The dorm halls are horrible. The newest building has the smallest rooms. The showers are gross and no money on campus is used to fix them up.
College Freshman,1,The buses by Concordia University take a really long time. The trains are said to be dangerous. Public transportation stops extremely early like at 11.

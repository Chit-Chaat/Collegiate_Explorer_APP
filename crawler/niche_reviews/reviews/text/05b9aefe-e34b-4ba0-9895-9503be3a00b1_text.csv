Sophomore,5,My online learning with Eastfield College is average but I would rather be in class learning. It's in my opinion a better experience to learn from someone face to face.
Graduate Student,5,"Eastfield was refreshing because when I first stepped in the building I did not feel nervous at all, you know what I mean. Its one of those moments where you feel like everything is in place. The atmosphere was welcoming; staff and professors have smiles one, and they are more than happy to answer any questions needed to be answered.  I especially liked that it was not like high school because I had visited Mountain View College and everything felt lazy and lacking in something. And in Eastfield every class i attended everybody was attentive and engaging. But one thing I would probably change if I could would be to minimize the amount of energy the staff and students put in the morning because I take a will to wake up and its like they are blinding me early in the morning.  But other than that Eastfield was quite enjoyable."
Niche User,5,"I feel like to have a good experience, you have to have a good teacher. I liked my professor because he was reasonable on due dates and gave reliable resources."

I genuinely felt welcome, despite being younger and less experienced than a good majority of the people attending.

I genuinely enjoyed my brief experience at Eastfield and encourage any one to apply that is looking for a good two year school."
Sophomore,5,"I love how easy it is to sign up for classes, but the advisors at Eastfield College don't really know what they are doing. It's best to see them once a semester to make sure you're on track, but take their advice with a grain of salt. Otherwise, it's a good school."

My first semester I struggled balancing work, my personal life, and school work. My professors listened to me and understood the issues I was having at home which is why they worked with me.

Also the prices are fairly cheap, especially compared to a big university."

When I transfer and come back home to visit I'd definitely take a summer class here at Eastfield!
Alum,5,"Eastfield College is a good community college to go at. When I went to this college like 1 year ago, it was amazing in my opinion. The professors are great especially when you got exams to study for and then also the campus is great. I graduated from this school like last year which was 2016-2017 academic year and gotten my certificate for Computer Science. So if you want to save your money for a better college then I highly recommend go to this school."
Freshman,5,"It's a great institution that really cares for its students. It's very easy to get support for classes and schedules. It also has a very relaxed atmosphere and a Subway, so I find it absolutely perfect. There could be more clubs, but with the space they have they make it work well."

Niche User,4,"Online learning at Eastfield is just as good as learning in person. The same content is presented to you, but without walking to class, or carrying a lot of textbooks."
Niche User,4,"The atmosphere felt comfortable, despite it being in the middle of a large city, and the professors and students were welcoming and friendly."
Freshman,4,I liked that eastfield is a place where you can start out your college days before you transfer to university. It's classes are great for those who are nervous of the college work and also have prices that you can pay out of pocket.
Sophomore,4,"Eastfield is a great college and there is a lot of people that will help you to succeed. They have the best professors and advisers, they are always there to help you with not only college problems but also life problems. If you are having problems all you have to do is talk to someone and they will help you or point you in the direction of some one that can help you. This college is more like a big family rather than a school. The staff and professors actually care about you and want you succeed in life and in school. My experience at East field has been nothing but the very best. I have not been in school in many years but I am returning this fall and my adviser has been so helpful. I am stuck between two majors and she has spent so much time with me to go over all the different plans and routes I can take. I would recommend East field to anybody who wants to go to college but doesn't have a lot of money or time for a university but still wants a reputable education."
Sophomore,4,"I loved the community and environment overall. The staff were always friendly and very helpful when needed. The events were very fun and exciting to participate in and it was very enaging. Theres one thing that did concern me, and it was the open campus. Many strangers could easily walk on campus and roam around which has happened, but the campus security are always there when called and needed."
Graduate Student,4,"My online learning experience was great overall, the only thing that really ruined some classes was the professor, especially when they gave too much homework and expected you to be done in a short amount of time. But other than that, most of my professors were great, and I was glad that I didn't have to commute."
Graduate Student,4,It's a great school to get a cheap yet good quality education. One thing they could improve upon would be their communication and procedures. Not everyone is on the same page with the documents that are required to be turned in.
Niche User,4,I am a dual credit student in high school and I took classes here to get a jump on some college classes. Good experience.
Alum,4,"The Eastfield campus environment is nurturing and academically strong.  While this is a Community College, the education matches and/or exceeds a 4-year university .  The STEM program, library, and Disability Services Offices, and intramural programs allowed for an extraordinary and well-rounded scholastic experience."
Freshman,4,"I like a lot of professors here and the variety of classes is amazing. However, the faculty is not very good. I had so much trouble registering for classes because the person helping me had no idea what they were doing. I had to tell them things that were offered or ""acceptable"" because they were not sure. We even had to Google some things! I would expect an adviser to be more knowledgeable about the college they work at. Besides this incident, everything else has worked out. I got help from another supervisor and was able to do what I wanted and sign up for the classes that I needed, he was amazing. The ladies that work in the C building are very helpful, both the financial side and the advising side. If you want to get your degree and go, this is perfect for you. A lot of older people go here. If you want a more authentic college experience, this may not be for you."

Freshman,4,"Overall, Eastfield is a very good option for getting started with college, earning an Associate's, or simply taking classes. It's affordable and the classes are generally standard to any other college. The campus is usually very relaxed and easy-going. Personally, I love the 8-week course option because I'm able to get credits faster and focus on less at a time. I also enjoy all of the activities they have for students in The Hive and around campus; there is usually some sort of event happening and they're always fun to join in on. The only big issues are when trying to meet with an advisor or schedule for classes at the beginning of the school year, these things usually waste a lot of time. Other than that, it's been a very enjoyable experience."
Sophomore,4,I am currently enrolled in the AAS substance abuse program. The professors and director for this degree are great. They are all very invested in their students and they try to help us as much as possible. I have gotten much insight on the next steps to take to move my career forward

The only thing I find not so good are some of the advisors, who were previous students that are given the opportunity to help new students are really helpful and extremely rude.  Safety is not an issue at east field, through out the day their are officers walking around which is very good! the campus is big but everything is still close. another thing that is very good is how they constantly have different activity's going on! They have refreshment and snack for students."
Sophomore,4,"What I would like to see changed is the financial aid office. Multiple times I had to go to the financial aid office to sort out a few things or ask some questions, and not once have I had a good experience. The people in there are not friendly at all and act like they do not want to help you."
Sophomore,4,What I have experienced at Eastfield is simplicity. There are many buildings but you can't get lost. I like how they are slowly making changed to the appearance of the school. I like how they have many study areas around campus so that way I'm not always at the library. If I could fix or adjust anything then I would have to say reserved parking for pregnant women. The women can have a special tag made by the campus/doctor to prove that they are pregnant.
Graduate Student,4,I had great teachers that worked with me to help me. They made college seem less scary because they were there to motivate me and help ease the transition from high school to college. They gave me a proper education.
Senior,4,"Eastfield is a very good school. I have only ever had issues with Financial Aid but who hasn't.

Overall, Eastfield is a very nice school to attend, at least online."

Niche User,4,"I took Dual Credit classes my junior and senior years of high school at Eastfield. I took half of them online and half of them on campus. All of my classes were pretty easy; I would say my Intermediate French class was the hardest just because I was trying to take a foreign language course online. Overall, the faculty and professors were all really great and knew their stuff, and I didn't have any negative experiences with Eastfield."
Niche User,4,I had an amazing time and the teachers were very helpful and to be quite honest my speech teacher was the greatest teacher I ever had. He was extremely helpful and knew how to connect with us.
Sophomore,4,"Eastfield College is a part of the Dallas County Community College District which includes six other campuses. Out of all the colleges in the district, Eastfield is the most profound college. They offer Duel Credit classes for Mesquite ISD which allows high school students to obtain college credits and campus experience prior to graduating and attending a university. Most courses are easily transferable and affordable. I'm currently paying for tuition out of pocket which is costing about $800.00 per semester for 12 hrs. Eastfield also offer multiple forms of help for students who are struggling with a course and the staff is adamant about helping each student succeed. The classes are structured small so that each student has the opportunity to grasp the material as easily as possible. I would recommend this campus to anyone who prefers a one-on-one learning environment surrounded by a loving and caring staff on a friendly and helpful campus."
Alum,4,Eastfield is a great way to transition into a four year university. It offers many different degree plans and they want you to succeed outside of Eastfield.

No drama what so ever, the police are really patrolling the campus. Always see them around the parking lots. When I first started lots of people complain that eastfield, had one of the bad advisors in campus, I'm not going to lie it did. They were bad, we did not get as much help as we thought we did. So we made a table in the pit, which is where all the student gather together and we ask them, what they felt about the advisor mostly everybody agree they were not doing their job the proper way. Other than that the school has changed, and we have helpful people in campus. I really recommend eastfield."

Proffesor try to guide you to the right path, most of my proffesors give you advice of life, "" first 2 years will be hard, just remember the last 2 years are fun. "" professor Patterson. All the classes they offered I can take in campus and transfer when I finish my assiciates, I do not have to go to different campus because they all have it at eastfield. The class style is great, good time to interact with others, conmunication, share your opinions is helpful. The class size max that will be in class average is 25 to 30. Most of the proffesor do not stand up and speak they rather communicate with the students and I believe that is what makes the class fun."
College Senior,4,"Has been a wonderful experience in life, learn how to time manage my time wisely number one important advice I'll give out no a freshman. My school has help me I'm working on a job that will benefit me in he future getting as much experience as I can, by the help of my proffesor. The flexibility is there just depends if the student will take it, I try to make every second count. All credits transfer just depends where you transfer to. The frustration I've had is being at the fanicial aid office waiting, but now they have this new system everybody is helpful and guide you to the right path."
College Senior,4,"This summer was my first time taking summer classes summer one and summer two. I was full time taking 4 in total, in not going to lie I wanted to give up, not because it was had but because it was hard to manage two classes a month. I did like doing online classes reason is because you reach your self everything is on the system is now on you if you want to read but other than that I did like taking online classes. You interact with your calssmates online and I believe they are more open minded when they use the Internet to interact with others. However I would much rather take a course on campus because I feel like if I need to ask a question I'll just ask it, and not wait for hours to hear a respond."
College Senior,4,"The most recent post grad at eastfield college is really high, haves a strong numerous high rank of transfer student.

I'm going for criminal justice and my professor Patterson is one of the best, he is guiding and advising in life. He also help me put an application in law enforcement which is the FBI citizen academy, which I'm still waiting if I'm going to et accepted for the citizen academy. His not the only professor every professor in eastfield is helpful, fun, and interesting. With that being said, eastfield college is a good apportunity that will open doors for a  successful path."
College Senior,4,It's great. All in all I would not trade to go to a different one
College Senior,4,It's a great experience. If your lose you can contact the professor and they will help or set a face to face session if nessasary
College Senior,4,The teachers are well educated and passionate about their classes. They expect a lot from their students but they do not mind if their students have questions or are lose and need extra work or tutoring. They want you to succeed. The follow class mates are also their because they want to further they education so the environment is relatable. You feel more comfortable to talk to follow class members about the class or an assignment.
Freshman,2,My college online experience was not good because of the teacher i had that semester and cannot compare it to anything else since that experience showed me taking an online course was not the path for me.
Alum,2,"Overall, I think Eastfield is a pretty good school in terms of education. The teachers are great and the programs are great. My biggest problem was feeling no support as a student. I didn't have an advisor I thought I could trust (or that I thought knew what they were doing) the whole time I was there. I spent two years trying to figure out what I was doing, completely alone, until I graduated. My entire experience with Eastfield staff (other than the teachers) was terrible! It was to the point that I didn't even walk at graduation. I understand that there are too many students and not enough staff and maybe that's the problem. But, every interaction with advising staff was a negative one where I truly felt like they couldn't care less about me as a person, much less my education."
College Junior,2,The tuition just went up like $20
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of clubs or organizations to join.
College Sophomore,2,"The best advice I have is start the Financial aid process as far advance as you can. The FA process is long and very very confusing. Not a direct phone number you can call for help, the number goes to a district phone line and  they will take a message or tell you to go in person to your local FA office. Once you arrive be prepared to wait, and wait."
College Sophomore,2,I wish I didn't have to pay the out of city expense
College Freshman,2,"financial aid offices are bad, staff was somewhat unhelpful and I was forced to do everything on my own but I will get my education paid for."
College Senior,2,I don't feel I received very much assistance. I had to register myself. I thought that I would get more help than I did. I hope that when I officially transfer I get much more help than at Dallas county colleges
College Senior,2,"I think the tuition is not too bad, but still I struggle to get financial aid. I work to support myself so I do not qualify for assistance. I think that is not fair because if I don't work there is no guarantee that I will get assistance. It can get expensive with courses that are a full time load. The ability to rent textbooks definitely helps a lot."
College Senior,2,I don't feel that it has very good assistance in the academic program advisors. At least not in my experience.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Although I understand that this process takes time, I have not had one semester go smoothly when dealing with financial aid. Three of my four semesters there I did not receive my financial aid till one to two weeks before the semester ended. The other time it was about six weeks into the semester. The paperwork process was a mess as well. Being told that I needed different documentation and information every time I met with someone. It was a long an tedious process that could have been a lot easier to deal with."
College Student,2,I don't want an associate so I can't really say. I want to transfer so that I can get my bachelor's degree.
College Junior,2,It has taken me months to get my financial aid cleared up. It felt like I had to jump through hoops and go through extensive waiting periods just to see if a single document out of many was correct.
College Sophomore,2,It's a community college so not entirely unique. The academic programs have low standards catered to students with not a very strong worth ethic. The social scene is non-existent for the most part.
College Sophomore,2,The computer network is very rarely reliable. The WiFi will always drop you depending on which building you are in. The computers in the library are incredibly out-dated with very slow internet. The computer lab personnel are rather rude and unhelpful when giving info about building an account to use the computers.
College Sophomore,2,"The network is having constant maintenance, and even if it isn't it still has problems, sometimes even interrupting teaching. Frustrating really."
College Junior,2,"I am currently earning my associates of science, but the classes required seem completely irrelevant to my course of study. The classes are not extremely difficult, however it can be a large amount of work that is all thrown upon you at the same time, which can get extremely stressful."
College Junior,2,"The students can get careless at time which causes the teachers to become careless as well. The tests cover the material we learned, but if you got at all behind on a certain aspect of the curriculum, then it can really ruin your entire grade. The teachers can be helpful at times, but also seem to care more about their paycheck then your education."
College Freshman,2,Basic Classes Are Easy â€“ I have only taken my basics here and they have all been extremely easy. As far as the quality of each class that is a complete gamble. I have had great and interesting classes but I have also had my share of boring read out of a book type classes. There is little to no workload and your grade consist of two or three exams throughout the semester including your final exam.
College Senior,2,"A Big Headache â€“ There is no doubt that the tuition is great, everything is straight forward. The problem I have is financial aid. It has been a huge headache to get my financial aid. I have to wait for a long time to get to talk to one of the financial aid people. When I finally get to them they do not completely answer my questions. I can't even get enough money to pay for the classes them selfs when there is people receiving way much more money than they need. I know people that have a way higher income than me and get much more financial aid than me. I have seen people by coach purses with the money that is supposed to be to pay for classes and school related stuff. I think that is simply not fair. They can't give me enough money to pay for my books but they can give it to others so they can buy coach purses and a whole bunch of clothes, thats just sad!"
College Sophomore,1,I am not aware of any post grad services at Eastfield
College Senior,1,I felt like they didn't even care that I left. The advisor signed a transfer paper and I was on my way. It was not personal or considerate at all in my opinion.
College Senior,1,They Lost My Scholarship â€“ When I had won my first Scholarship I had already done 2 semsters at Eastfield. The people I had won my scholarship from said they had sent the check over to eastfield and that I should go see if everything was good. When I went up there to see they had told me they never recieved the check. I called the people who gave me the scholarship and they had the Date and Time that they had sent it to Eastfield and had documents to prove it. It took them 3 whole semesters to find the check and while they were trying to find it I had to be put on this list so they couldn't drop me from my classes.
College Senior,1,"Finacial Aid Department â€“ I have given Eastfield Colleges Finacial Aid Dep. an F because they are always full of people and it seems like eveyone has been waiting their for hours. Even if you are next in line it still takes them forever to get to you because they are either busy typing away on their computer or they went off in the back somewere and never come back out. Also they will never give you a direct response on when youw ill recieve your Finacial Aid. They pretty much tell you ""When I know You'll Know"". I feel like I'm just a number and have never had a pleasent experience when I go into the Finacial Aid Dep at Eastfield."
College Junior,1,They really are not up to speed and will quickly have you more confused with financial aid then before
College Sophomore,1,I personally have a problem with the way financial aide is always behind on distrubiting the money to students. There is always some type of hold up on you get the run around. I love my school but the financial aide process is very disturbing.
College Sophomore,1,"I have been attending this school since 2008.  I was enrolled in the TRIO program and it proved to be a disaster!  Instead of assisting me - the advisors (I saw all 3 on staff - never the same one) pointed me in every direction other than what I wanted to go in.  I was pointed toward graphic design, business administration and even elementary education.  I had NO interest in business admin but was encouraged in this direction.  I have tried taking my developmental math classes on two different occasions and have not been able to pass.  This time around I went to another Dallas County Community College campus and was finally told that I had been registered into the wrong level of class on previous occasions and that is probably where the problem was.  I have been pointed in so many different directions that now I am ""out of hours"" in regard to finacial aid at the community college level.  No aid left and guess what - no degree yet either.  So all in all this college has left a very bad taste in my mouth."
College Student,1,I picked this school because of financial situation. However as soon as I possibly can I will transfer because none of my professors were ever prepared and I fell that is a waste of my time.

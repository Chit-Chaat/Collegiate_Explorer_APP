Sophomore,5,"I have only attended God's Bible School and College for one year so far, but I can say that I've had an amazing experience so far! I never would have expected to love college as much as I do. I would recommend even going for just one semester to try and get a better idea of what you want to do in life and what you ""niche"" is! The environment is very positive and it's easy to build bonds and relationships with people! You never have to feel alone and you can always be assured that mostly everyone is there to support you and is proud of you! I'm looking forward to going back this Fall!"
Freshman,5,"God's Bible School & College is changing my life. The people, city, chapels, and everything about this college is great! God really moves in mighty ways here, His presence is felt in a great way during chapel and prayer time. There is also the Consortium of Colleges and Universities around Cincinnati - where you can take classes at another college and they will be the same price and the credits at your college. It is over all a great program to use."

College Freshman,4,Are school is contacted a lot about the students. Many companies are willing to hire us once they know what college we are from.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of restaurants nearby since we are located in the heart of Cincinnati
College Freshman,4,I enjoy living on campus. The housing is great and the people are too. We are located right beside many of the classrooms so it only takes a few minutes to reach the classrooms.
College Student,4,"Parking on campus is pretty good, you can usually find a spot with no problem and the fee is very resonable."
College Student,4,"The facilities at GBS are quite good for a small school. There is a small gym and snack shop as well as a growing library with new computers. There is a developing plan for a coffee shop to be added, or maybe replace, the snack bar in the near future."
College Student,1,A Lot to Be Desired. They need to improve on their food.  It is horable.
College Freshman,1,they do not have athletics but since they are a college they should have a foot ball team and the games it would be fun.

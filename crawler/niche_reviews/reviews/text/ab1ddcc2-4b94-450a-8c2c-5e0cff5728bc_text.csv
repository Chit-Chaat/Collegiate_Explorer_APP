Freshman,5,Morehouse is an excellent college. The curriculum is challenging and it encourages students think differently about society and better their approach to academics.
Alum,5,"I didn't really get to experience much online learning as I graduated nearly 10 years ago. So, I'm basically a dinosaur LOL!"
Alum,5,"I graduated from Morehouse 10 years ago and I have to say that it was one of the most significant, transformative, inspirational experiences of my life as a black man. Morehouse isn't perfect - dorms, food, admin - though I'm sure things have improved, those ""inconveniences"" help to perseverance/endurance and a bond with your brothers. It's one of those things that you value in retrospect a time passes.

The faculty and professors teach with love and attention. Morehouse also offers great opportunities to excel after graduation (corporate recruiting, feeder to ivy grad schools, etc) Campus life was very active (it was POPPIN!) lots of opportunity for service, fun, and personal development."
Sophomore,5,"Morehouse provides male students with a rich history, pride, integrity, and self-awareness.  Has an expectation that you and your brother have a responsibility to each other.  Every student is expected to gain a knowledgeable education, graduate and gain meaningful employment."
Freshman,5,Haven't even really started yet. Only seen the campus once on their admitted student's day and it was really good! It was just very cold.
Freshman,5,I haven't taken anything online related to Morehouse yet. I would be able to answer this question later on.

Freshman,5,"Hello I am a 19 year old first year student at Morehouse College, currently I am a psychology major and I am having a great educational experience at this institution. This institution, being smalls allows students to have a one on one relationship with professors ultimately helping students succeed at a higher rate."
Freshman,5,"I love Morehouse College, and I am glad I am attending this great institution. Coming to Morehouse, you can see the pride everyone from the students, to faculty and staff have at being here and it gives you a sense of self worth. No matter the major, every student here has the belief that they are on a mission to contribute to the good of mankind after their learning. One thing I would change at Morehouse would be the rising tuition costs. Over the years, tuition at Morehouse has steadily increased, and it is getting harder to help pay for education."
Freshman,5,I really love the campus. The campus is very sacred. The atmosphere is great and everyone is supportive of each other.
Sophomore,5,I am going to start this year at Morehouse as a sophomore.  This school has an amazing history and a great reputation.  I am very much looking forward to attending.
Freshman,5,"So far, I've really enjoyed my overall experience at Morehouse College. I'm currently an incoming freshman in the summer PSEP program. I'm from Cleveland, Ohio and the first thing that stands out and deals with the school is the weather. I'm not used to it always being this hot and just thinking about walking to all of my classes in this is horrifying. Besides all of that though, the people and staff apart of the school are very nice and courteous. The environment is very safe and clean. The whole atmosphere is very good since I have been here."

Freshman,5,They take in all types of young African American men and teach them tons of important morals on how to become and stay a successful man. I would not take anything away from this college. It is a wonderful experience meeting people from all different places and backgrounds.
Senior,5,"During my time at Morehouse I have made friends that will last a lifetime. I have met alumni who I know will help me in my career path, and become a part of a lifelong brotherhood. I know that the professors have my best interest at heart constantly, and everyone there wants to see me succeed."

Niche User,5,"Morehouse college is one of my biggest choices for college. As it is an HBCU , I love the enviorment"
Sophomore,5,Morehouse has taught me so much about my own culture. It taught me how to problem solve. Morehouse is truly preparing me to go into the world and do great things. They hold me to a high standard and expect excellence from me. Having that expectation for you and everyone else around you is amazing. It helps to push me to be the best person I can be. Choosing Morehouse as my school is the best decision I have made thus far.

Freshman,5,"What I like about my experience at Morehouse College is being able to learn and see the different cultures and history they have there. Being a student and being apart of Morehouse College is a good way of learning and gaining skills, abilities, and  brother hood from one another. As i begin to start, I know that I would gain a lot of knowledge, loyalty, and respect. A college like this will really show and prepare you for the world out there , that's waiting for you, I enjoy all cultures and history from this school. When I was touring and going to registeration, I saw and learned a lot of knew things coming my way, and as a Morehouse College student, I plan to take advantage of those things and learn more and more. My experience with Morehouse College is a great success, and I would be even happier to learn more as I start and continue to grow."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Morehouse College was beyond excellent. I love how the atmosphere at the school was both so positive and energetic. Every single student at the school helps each other achieve greatness. The one thing I want to see change is allowing  a more cheaper expense for all young males, so they could afford to stay in school and receive their education."
Freshman,5,"I love Morehouse College.  Coming here really is a life changing experience for me, really exciting.  They have people such as professors, advisors, deans, and mentors who really want to help you do the best that you can do and succeed.  They really want you to reach your full potential and heights that have never been reached before.  Student life on campus is great, there are so many activities to do on campus to be engaged in and many groups/organizations to be in to that will teach you a lot about academics, teaching life lessons and going out into the real world once we graduate."
Freshman,5,"I am a 4th generation Morehouse College Freshman and I have greatly enjoyed my college experience so far. Morehouse does more than just provide a great education for its students, it also creates an environment where its students have no choice but to excel and grow as men."
Junior,5,My experience at Morehouse College has been transformative not only on an academic level but also on a personal level. I admire the emphasis on character development that this institution and appreciate the continuously support I receive from faculty and fellow students. I would recommend this college for those who aspire not only to uplift their respective communities back home but to also change the world based on their work ethic and character.
Freshman,5,Morehouse College is one of the best Hbcu's out here. They teach you leadership and brother Hood. And you are surrounded by the beautiful AUC people.

College Sophomore,5,"I wouldn't trade my experience at Morehouse with any other school. The professors care and are interested in their students, the courses are relatively easy but challenging, the class size is perfect, and the students have a chance to make something of themselves at this institution."
College Sophomore,5,Greek life at Morehouse is something extraordinary. It's not for everybody but every one respects those who are apart of a greek organization.
College Senior,5,The nightlife on campus is really exciting
College Senior,5,Lot of work but the professors are very motivating.
College Senior,5,There are a lot of parties to attend at school.
College Senior,5,There is a lot to do at night and its very social.

College Sophomore,5,I have had a great experience at Morehouse so far! The students on campus are really friendly and courteous and the faculty members are always willing to help you.
College Sophomore,5,"Graduating from Morehouse or simply being a student carries a lot of weight whenever you're looking for a job, internship, or research opportunity."
College Sophomore,5,"Greek life is a huge part on campus not only at Morehouse, but in the rest of Atlanta University Center (including Spelman and Clark Atlanta). The Greeks throw great parties and do things in the community."
College Sophomore,5,"So far, I've had a great experience because of the people."
College Student,5,"Although I have only experienced one semester at Morehouse College, I know that I would not have received the same opportunities and experiences at any other school. I have no regrets and I am more than satisfied with my decision of coming to this institution."
College Sophomore,5,"Greek life is big considering it's at an hbcu, the Greek culture plays a pinical role in the schools overall experience."
College Junior,5,Our campus security has increased and has made it feel much safer on campus but also less crimes and incidents have happened.
College Junior,5,The main reason I applied to the school was because of the class courses and teachers. The classrooms are small so you have a better relationship with the teachers and the teachers have a better one with you.
College Junior,5,"The best part about graduating for this institute is our alumni is so envolved. No matter what major you choose if you work hard, network, and become active you will go so much farther than you ever expected too. Especially graduating from this school most graduate schools know how much our degree weighs from graduating this school."
College Junior,5,The Greek life on campus is great. You see them around campus all the time and most of them are approachable. But also they se very involved with on campus/off campus events.
College Freshman,5,The best place for networking.
College Freshman,5,I love Morehouse College! The atmosphere and brotherhood is amazing. The education is worth the money. I am on my personal journey in becoming a Morehouse Man.
College Freshman,5,"I love Morehouse, the atmosphere is great and the teachers and work push you to learn and become a nonpassive student. Before I came to Morehouse, I thought it was ok to just do well, now I know that I must strive, as a young black male in todays world, to do everything better than I thought I could and better than any man after me can/will do."
Freshman,4,"Learning online has been quite easy. Sometimes the system the work is assigned on crashes. Besides that, the work is challenging but in a good way."
Sophomore,4,"Morehouse started online classes March 24.  Students logged-in, professors took roll, classes started on Atlanta time as we were accustomed too, taught by sharing screen, interactive settings.  Online is not what I prefer but the professors made the best of the situation available.  Campus life is always going to be my/our preference."
Junior,4,One of the best HBCU’s in the country. Would recommend to anybody who has wants to be immerse in rich African American history.
Junior,4,Online learning is pretty new at Morehouse. It is has been a learning curve for students and professors but overall the outcome has been a success
Sophomore,4,What Morehouse lacks in physical aesthetic it surely makes up for it when it comes to the experiences that are on campus. Morehouse College is certainly a one-of-a-kind institution that you would be extremely proud to attend.
Sophomore,4,"The HBCU experience at Morehouse College is almost uncontested. Professors treat truly care about you and will do anything possible to help you. Athletically, I have thoroughly enjoyed myself as well. With a little time management, you can be able to do any extra-curricular activity you want. My only complaint is the freshman dorms. They are still very traditional, almost as if they were never renovated. Besides that, everything else is great. Be sure to network when you get there. Morehouse has a strong network of graduates."
Sophomore,4,"Overall this is the only institution in the world that caters to educating Black Men, not only with supreme academics, but also in building a solid foundation for shaping Black excellence and teaching us how to navigate in a world that is designed to see us fail. The making of a Morehouse Man is an experience like no other."
Freshman,4,Professors are willing and interested in helping. They provide an open door policy. They are easy to talk to and very relatable.
Freshman,4,There are a lot of things to like about Morehouse. You are surrounded by intelligent young back men who are all on the same track or have the same goal as you to be successful.
Freshman,4,"I love the brotherhood and community feeling Morehouse provides me. However, I'd like to see renovations done on the buildings in order to beautify the campus."
Freshman,4,I love Morehouse College. It has a small campus but a massive impact on young African American futures.
Junior,4,It’s an amazing HBCU experience. It’s great meeting Black people from different countries and states. The area outside of school is a little dangerous but they’re improving security and trying to build a relationship with the community.
Freshman,4,My experience at Morehouse College has been amazing so far. I am in the Marching Band and it makes your first year college experience a whole lot different than your peers. It is nothing but hard work and a whole lot of time consumption but the relationships I have made throughout my first year just from being in band has made it worth it.
Freshman,4,"Morehouse is a great place that is located in Atlanta Georgia. Though the walls outside of the campus are viewed in a negative light there is a beam of hope that seems to shoot from the campus. A light that says everything is possible ,that the things that surround a person mean nothing if you are able to center yourself with hope and hardwork."
Freshman,4,Morehouse is a good school that always want to push their students to new heights in their education so they can be ready go out and make the world better place with the new  knowledge they obtain  and Morehouse is great college to receive education.
Niche User,4,"I am a student that has recently enrolled in Morehouse and I plan on attending in 2019-2020 school year. I have toured the campus twice and on both occasions, the people and facilities have impressed me. The teachers provoke thought in the students, and the community is fairly close. The inclusivity extends to the other two schools near the campus, and all the students seem to get along."
Freshman,4,"Great school, helps all who attend. Never had a down moment here on campus. This a school I would refer many people to. Being in the city there are many things to do outside of campus. Homecoming is like no other here at Morehouse  College. Staff here are really helpful with everything you need. Whenever you have trouble in school there is always someone you can go to that can help."
Freshman,4,"Morehouse is a great school, as it is an HBCU, of course you will always have a good time. There are plenty of people to meet who might end up being some of your best friends. Only thing is this is an old school (founded in 1867) so the educational buildings and dorms are old, but well kept."
Senior,4,"What I like about Morehouse College is the environment.  It feels perfectly tailored for young African American men, like myself.  There are plenty of opportunities for us to grow academically, socially and spiritually.  I would like to see better quality dorms and a more efficient registration process."
Sophomore,4,"I am in love with my college despite its flaws. The people who I have met anf will continue to meet are truly a blessing. Had I not attended Morehouse College, I would not be on the track that I am on today."
Sophomore,4,"Morehouse College is an illustrious with so much history. I was always a very introverted person who never liked to go out, but after witnessing all the activities and organizations on campus, I couldn't help bursting through my introverted tendencies. There's an organization or an event for everyone's taste and the brotherhood that we preach here is real, so be prepared to have support in every way, shape, and form. I will always see Morehouse as my
2nd family and that's a feeling you won't get from any other institution."
Junior,4,What I like about Morehouse College has to do with the people at the college. The staff actually care for my education and not just my money.
Sophomore,4,Atmosphere of brotherhood and embracing giving back to the community. Easy to navigate the campus. Access to study groups & open communication with  Counselors and student aid office.
Sophomore,4,"I love the brotherhood Morehouse has. You literally can not walk past someone without getting a ""what's up"" or ""how are you"". I love how they strive on bringing people up instead of tearing them down."
Freshman,4,"Morehouse College is an HBCU in Atlanta, GA that has given me multiple opportunities. Morehouse is a challenging institution but it is worth it,"
Freshman,4,"I love Morehouse College for the many opportunities it gives me as an African American  male in a male, it really teaches black men how to thrive in a world dominated by many other races and cultures. However, i feel that because it is a private college it is much too expensive for the knowledge it gives the students that attend."
Freshman,4,"I'm currently attending Morehouse as a freshman! And it isn't to bad to be completely honest. But it's smart, very very smart to build a great group of friends to get through college with."
Niche User,4,"Excellent professors with easy meeting times and hardworking faculty that keeps everything going. The students are a little rowdy, but they are all extremely intelligent pursuing their dreams with staggering perfecting."
Junior,4,"There are some great students and individuals at this college, but the financial aid department can be difficult to deal with from time to time."
Sophomore,4,My experience on Morehouse was like no other. I able to meet and network with so many intelligent young minds. Each professor have every student best interest at heart and only want everyone to succeed. One of the main things I wish administration will notice is a lot of students really can't afford to attend and they should come up with better opportunities for students to succeed.
Junior,4,"I like the culture that comes with Morehouse College, as well as the professors that I am able to take. I would change the dorms if I could because there are only 2 suites on campus."
Freshman,4,I really like how morehouse is set up and designed for you to be successful in your field.   There are also so many activities that you can get involved in at morehouse to make friends and or real contact with the people that you are around.
Freshman,4,"Coming from a majority white high school, joining Morehouse college gifted me a complete new feel as I finally received the chance of experiencing black culture one on one. As a freshman, everything is new to a person as they must self discipline themselves to stay on top of their academics. As Morehouse may not be as efficient on customer service, relationships with professors are created as students have ample opportunities to meet during office hours. The campus itself could be renovated but overall, it presents a welcoming feeling."
Junior,4,I love Morehouse.  I've never questioned my college decision because I couldn't even see myself attending another school.
College Freshman,4,The new student orientation period was an eye opening experience. The upperclassmen's dedication to the period was very inspiring and made me want to be apart of the school system. I learned the history of the school and started to realize the importance of the college. It made me truly believe this was the right choice for me.
College Sophomore,4,There is something to do all the time.
College Sophomore,4,Morehouse puts a large emphasis on academics.
College Sophomore,4,You can always find acceptance somewhere on campus.
College Sophomore,4,There's a wide variety of courses offered. A majority of professors are approachable and willing to help. Class size can generally vary and are very engaging.
College Sophomore,4,The alumni are very hands on with helping current students. The school is very helpful in providing resources to find internships/career opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,The Greek life on campus can really steal the show with at school events. Many people aspire to join.
College Sophomore,4,The school really does encourage the use of the athletic facilities as both a way to build a routine and to relax.
College Sophomore,4,"So far, my time at Morehouse has been extremely challenging. My freshman year was really the first time I've been away from my family for an extended period of time. Although these statements hold true, I would not have changed my college experience so far. Meeting new people and the values Mother Morehouse has instilled in me has made my experience all the more worth it."
College Sophomore,4,"I myself am not apart of a fraternity however, seeing fraternities on campus and how admired they are it would be a lie to say it has never crossed your mind to possibly join one. Fraternities play their role on campus, hosting events doing cookouts for charity and things of that nature and as such they show that fraternity life is not solely about having fun but the exemplify brotherhood and community impact."
College Sophomore,4,"The experiences i have encountered at Morehouse College makes it hard to believe i have only been there for two semesters. I have met worthwhile friends as well as met inspirational individuals and listened to breath taking speeches on motivation and persistence, Morehouse College is in the process of grooming me into the ideal man. I recognize that it is not at many colleges where you meet individuals within your own year group who aspire to excel and encourage you to do the same. Many times i have been taken aback due to the maturity and scholarly attitude of individuals my own age, it is as if Morehouse had hand selected each individual not only by academic achievement but by personality as well. These aspects are what makes my college unique, Morehouse College is not an HBCU for idling however, lives up to its tradition of creating renaissance men."
College Sophomore,4,"Initially, safety was a big issue for students on campus. But as the year rolled around the school took notice of the issue and jumped on it as quickly as possible. Morehouse is becoming a safer place for its students and surrounding schools in the AUC."
College Senior,4,Very strict drug and alchol rules
College Freshman,4,"So far, during the two semesters, I had great teachers and a good class size."
College Freshman,4,It is a close community and that's what I love about it.
College Sophomore,4,"There are many people from different cultures, religions, and nationalities here."
College Sophomore,4,"Morehouse is strict on drug use; however, some people still manage to use them on campus."
College Sophomore,4,The residence halls may not be the most up-to-date but they are really convenient and spacious.
College Freshman,4,It's okay. I can't complain
College Freshman,4,I love the brotherhood at my school. They don't have the best things at the school but they are definitely trying make to school more appealing.
College Junior,4,My school really prides itself on brotherhood and they really cater to each individual students need. Great environment and you are sure to find support where you feel you may need help.
College Freshman,4,I had an amazing experience.
College Sophomore,4,There is alot presented withere as much given as you put in.
College Sophomore,4,"I am an artist , and as an artist, being in ATL is probably the best place to be right now. Also with my degree, I am presented with a vast amount of opportunities to help gain a vast amount of connections. Networking is the biggest thingredients a morehouse, everyone knows someone. Apply yourself with the right people and many doors will open."
College Sophomore,4,"The overall experience is great , so much so that it the minor obstacles are almost nonexistent. The professors believe in their students and the administration believes in their students as well. The brotherhood is beautiful despite differences , everyone helps each other. The only thing that may be a hindrance is the extreme financial burden, which is why looking for scholarships is probably more tedious than actual schoolwork. Other thend that, I am blessed to be here."
College Sophomore,4,"My school is great and filled with opportunity and experience like no other. I honestly would not trade it for the world and am extremely blessed to be there. However, the school overall is very expensive and finding the funds and getting the aid is extremely difficult which results in the schools low retention rate. I desire to stay there and seek to find the money. Finances are the only worries."
Sophomore,2,Taking online classes was a bit hard for me because I am one hundred percent a hands on learner and online classes never did it for me in high school and certainly not now.
Sophomore,2,"The online learning experience was poor. I attribute this to the Covid 19 crises that forced a hasty and unexpected transition from traditional in-person classes to online remote learning. Neither Students or Faculty was prepared for this and the appropriate online curriculum was not in place. I imagine this issue was not unique to Morehouse, but a problem in all colleges across the nation."
Freshman,2,"Since I'm a freshman the experience so far is still too early to gauage, but they have a somewhat inviting experience but sometimes you can feel unwelcomed"
Sophomore,2,Morehouse is very unorganized at the beginning and end of both their semesters. The financial office will have you on hold for day and wont give you a call back even if you leave them several messages. The food on campus is fairly good for the most part and the campus is not that big so you wont have trouble locating you classes.
College Freshman,2,There is a lot of work that needs to be done. I don't feel that the police do there jobs.
College Junior,2,Sexual violence is a huge problem on campus.
College Junior,2,Campus housing is less than desirable and expensive.
College Junior,2,Students typically don't care about our athletic program.
College Junior,2,Housing could use some improvement and renovations but there is a sense of community.
College Freshman,2,not very much offered for the amount requested
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid team is not there to assist with locating financial aid.  They merely process what the student brings to them.  It is frustrating not getting the assistance I need.
College Senior,2,Campus located in high crime area
College Sophomore,2,homecoming brings out the worst in people.
College Freshman,2,The Morehouse insurance is expensive for no reason. They often will not give out doctors notes for you teacher.
College Freshman,2,"Without a car, you would have to walk and thats not very safe."
College Freshman,2,"The Westend of Atlanta is terrible and I would not recommend anybody attend Morehouse. It is extremely dangerous to walk anywhere, and the shuttles are not good. It takes about an hour and a half to have food delivered."
College Junior,2,go to walmart and fend for yourself
College Junior,2,No attention given to them by campus
College Junior,2,"WIFI sucks, tech support sucks, hard line connectivity works most consistently"
College Freshman,2,"wifi on campus is terrible, and in the residents halls its even worse."
College Student,2,Almost nothing is open and if it is open than that area is not safe to go to. You might see a McDonalds open with ten dudes with tees selling drugs and waving pistols.
College Student,2,"Every time I go to a house party I see at fifty people smoking weed. There might be one of two guys who popped a ""molly"" and are acting crazy or pasted out. Then everyone has a drink in their hand. The drinks range from a very juicy drink to Tequila."
College Freshman,2,"Everything happens at the dorms, except for study. There's a huge library, but it all comes down to if you have a laptop. Life is significantly harder to live if you need a computer, which is almost all the time.

Nothing unique I can think about. I visited other campus last semester and the only differences were the people."
College Freshman,2,"It's hard, and along with me several of my friends couldn't get ends to meet and had to sit this semester out."
College Freshman,2,"Not the caliber I expected. It's almost remedial from high school. Professors are nice, and the workload is ALWAYS too light. the tests are easy, so the ease of classes never makes up. Essays are easy to write and more then 3/4 of people get away with writing and getting an ""A"" the same day."
College Freshman,2,"I don't drive, but I must stress that parking is an absolute nightmare."
College Freshman,2,"The teams are liable to go on huge losing streaks, and club sports are ignored unless you go looking for them. The gym is always full of sports players, which is intimidating to non sports players. the basketball court is pretty useable, but there is no public football field. Non-athletes are better off ignoring campus sports."
College Freshman,2,"When it's sunny, finding shade or getting out of the heat is impossible for all but the cats. When it rains, huge puddles form and masses of people either fall into the water or run over each other in lines trying not to get wet.
"
College Freshman,2,You usually get the runaround. From what I hear it varies from person to person just make sure your always making appointments and calling them if you really need the money.
College Freshman,2,Campus Housing is a love-hate thing. You'll love it because of the relationships you'll create with your friends. You'll hate it because it gets annoying being in a dorm hall with as many rules as a prep school and rather small rooms.
College Freshman,2,"Sometimes the network is working, a lot of the time its not. Don't come here if you can't bring your own computer. We only have one computer lab with about 30 computers but if you print something there its free and there is no quota."
College Junior,2,"The food is bad. There is no variety, its unhealthy and its overall just not good."
College Sophomore,2,"As a freshmen, there really is no need for a car.  They will boot any car that does not have a visible permit."
College Sophomore,2,"The off-campus dining options near Morehouse College are not quite healthy. Most dining options near the school consists of fast food places such as, Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy's, Taco Bell, Popeyes, and Church's Chicken. However there are a few notable and delicious restaurants such as Paschals, which is historically a very successful restaurant in the area."
College Senior,2,"Off campus dining at Morehouse is not too good, the area is not a good one in general so you cant expect there to be good places to eat around. The only reason it gets a C is for the recent additions of Papa Johns and Freshens to the campus."
College Junior,2,They're not to many dining choices in the west end where Morehouse is located
College Sophomore,2,A high amount of the stereotypical depictions of an HBCU so it'll have it's ups and downs.
College Junior,2,Most facilities except for the business department are very old.
College Freshman,2,"The Drug Scene at Morehouse is significantly growing. In the last few years, underage drinking and alcohol access has skyrocketed, in addition to the ease of access due to the surrounding neighborhood. One of the irionies of Morehouse is that the off campus police station is located right next to the house of a drug dealer."
College Sophomore,2,"There are three places to get to a computer: Douglass Hall, Technology Tower, and Brawley Hall's English lab. All of these places can become very crowded. At the Tech Tower their is no printing limit. Some of the computers in Douglass don't work or if they do work you can't print on them."
College Freshman,2,"Its the West end!.... watch a movie called ""Snow on tha bluff"""
College Freshman,2,Financial aid is one of Morehouse's weak points. make sure you have everything in early. on time will not do i'm telling you. there were almost 200 students that couldn't attend in my grade class because of financial aid issues
College Junior,2,"Resturants of Da Hood – Off-campus, there's a Popeyes, Churches Chicken, Taco Bell, McDonalds, Wendys, KFC, Wingstreet, & a few chinese takeout places within walking distance. I wouldnt walk to any of them after dark though if I were you. Popeyes offers a student discount to AUC students. Just tell them you want a student discount & you may have to present them your student ID."
College Senior,2,The Area – There are a lot of fast food restaurants around my school and we can't use student credit for them.
College Freshman,2,Bad Value – The education alone aren't worth the tuition price
College Junior,2,"The Run-Around – Way too many run-arounds. ""Go see this professor for this; go see this person for that."" Brings up a big laziness factor (no will to help the students in depth) in the faculty, yet they heavily expect respect from the young men of the college."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking Expenses – Driving is quite an essential aspect of most college students life. The fact that one must pay to park in front of their residence is absurd. Any student that lives on campus or even attends the school, should not have to purchase a parking pass to park their vehicles in the campus parking lots. However, the Parking Garage is a different story."
College Freshman,2,Fast Food – Honestly everything is fast food. There aren't any healthy places near campus.
College Sophomore,2,"the security is not up to par comparatively to most institutions. Plus, the location of the campus and the security can lead to potentially higher danger levels when it comes to safety. However, I have usually felt safe but theft is somewhat of an issue."
College Freshman,2,"No freshmaen parking!! It still not understood why freshmen are not allowed to parking. If your a freshmen be sure you invest in a Breeze card, because you are going to need one."
College Junior,2,Canpus Housing – Traditional dorming halls are the worst. The student suites are average. Would suggest living elsewhere also it's cheaper off campus than paying room and board fees.
College Freshman,2,"The CS Department Is Depressing – Yeah, there is a Computer Science department at Morehouse College and yeah, if you're already a kick-butt programmer coming in, you'll enjoy yourself here (I'm speaking from experience). However, if you are completely new to the field of Computer Science, you'll have a very hard time here (from what I've observed). Some teachers are bad (there are only like three professors in the WHOLE building!), some don't care, and some students can't even understand what the remaining teacher(s) is saying.

Be sure to take this review with a grain of salt. It's probably won't be as bad as I've made it sound when you read this (they're upgrading all the time). Besides, if you have a laptop and some serious google-fu skills, you'll be quite alright."
College Freshman,2,The athletics at this school are no much of a big deal. The school does not get the top athletes so they just play with the people they can. Morehouse is not an institution than an aspiring professional athlete would attend.
College Sophomore,2,No Variety – The food on campus is alright but we are only allowed to use our meal plan 3 times a day making us look for other sources of food.  And also or meal plans are only available in the dining hall so any other places on campus that serve food the students must pay for with their own money.
College Sophomore,2,Campus Crime and Security – A lot of stealing happens.Personal safety is pretty good on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Outside the college is where many of the drug addicts reside...that's why its important to be safe. As of the on-campus drugs, well many of the individuals smoke weed"
College Freshman,2,Pretty Solid but Seriously? The school has pretty decent enforcement when it chooses. Many of the times they follow the rules at the most inconvenient of times
College Sophomore,2,Not Too Sure – There is a presence of herbal substances on the campus  but prescription or other drug abuse has not been introduced to my social scene personally
College Freshman,2,"Barely Tolerable – The main cafeteria food quality  is rather poor. Cleanliness is bad as well. I go because I need to eat and the money is spent already. Next year definitely won't have a meal plan. However the cafe, Jazzmans is really good!"
College Freshman,2,"West End Dining at Its Finest – Morehouse isn't located in the best area, and it can be pretty unsafe to go to many of the nearby restaurants.  It doesn't help that it's about a three-quarter mile walk to the nearest restaurant off-campus.  The selection of eateries in the area is sadly lacking. It's populated heavily with fast-food joints.  The sit down restaurants in the area are seedy, at best.  Your best bet?  Try to take the Marta downtown to find some variety as Popeye's and Taco Bell can only go so far."
Junior,1,I took all online classes and they were no very good. I’m trying to close out the semester but it is hard to learn in this learning environment.
College Junior,1,"People smoke weed, but alcohol is strictly prohibited."
College Freshman,1,Its an HBCU not much diversity
College Freshman,1,"Many of the rules on our campus are pretty ridiculous. It honestly feels as if we are being babied. Many of our rules contain unnecessary time restrictions. These time restrictions dictate when we get to utilize facilities, eat, study and enjoy the company of others."
College Sophomore,1,"If you can't drive, there aren't many off-campus dining opportunities."
College Sophomore,1,It is utterly terrible. Morehouse doesn't care about physical activity. It only cares about the arts and sciences.
College Freshman,1,A lot of drug users.
College Freshman,1,"Housing is a joke. The Resident Director often charges randoms fees and pockets our money. We hardly have toilet paper, it is old, and dirty."
College Freshman,1,Morehouse College is extremely homophobic.
College Freshman,1,"If there are druggies walking around on our campus, the campus police are not very strict. The fact that they do not check any identification at the entrances is ridiculous and yes students have been robbed on their doorsteps."
College Junior,1,"Overall dining experience on campus is awful, enough said!"
College Junior,1,"Since I am a foreign student, I am not eligible for any financial or governmental aid. "
College Sophomore,1,"Campus police is not necessarily strict, however they become strict at the wrong times. Campus police can be very lenient when it comes to letting people on campus, however sometimes this is bad thing because if something goes wrong they suddenly change their demeanor and go about their job the wrong way. They do not successfully do their job until it is on the line."
College Senior,1,The neighborhoods in the AUC are kind of sketchy because it is in the West End area. Many times cars are broken into and students are sometimes robbed at night.
College Sophomore,1,"There is only one dining hall on campus called Chivers Dining Hall. The selection is terrible, they are always running out of food and the food is always running out of you. Do not get a meal plan if you do not have to and try to eat out, have groceries and have as many left overs as possible."
College Freshman,1,"The weather is Bi-polar atlanta weather. It can rain for an hour, then the clouds will roll back, only to rain again. There was one weekend where it rained all weekend, with slight flurries of snow (in March)."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I guess the campus police do there job, but they could lightin up a little bit."
College Freshman,1,No One Can Ever Help. At Morehouse the financial aid process is horrible.  No one picks up the phone in the office and no one can answer your questions. They give you the run around and tell you information that's not even needed. The people in the front office give little information on what you need to do. Sometimes it can take months to get to the basics of your financial aid. Its like they want to help you but they do not know themselves. Morehouse have been around a long time I would think that they would have the financial aid process go much smother then what it is now. I haven't gotten any tips form my financial aid office but one thing that I have learned is that if you stay constant you will get what you want.
College Freshman,1,Considering the amount one has to pay for a parking permit you would think that parking would be more readily available. It's worst if there is an event of any sort on campus
College Freshman,1,"Campus Security – Not enough manpower, not enough visibility, too many incidents and don't always feel safe. Campus is located in a high crime area so we must travel in groups for added protection but that's not always a guarantee."

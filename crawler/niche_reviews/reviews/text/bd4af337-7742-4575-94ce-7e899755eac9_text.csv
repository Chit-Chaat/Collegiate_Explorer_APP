Sophomore,5,The environment is friendly! Class sizes are small which allows me to build connections with my teachers that I would not be able to make at a bigger university.
Alum,5,"Understand before you go what you are there for.  A very hands on technical based engineering degree that has garnered the respect of professionals across many diverse industries as well as senior levels of government.  MMA is your fraternity,  for such a small school I think you will continue to be amazed at how far Alumi influence stretches (this from a 1991 graduate).  It is a school that promises when you graduate an immediate return on your personal  & financial investment but unlike so many out there it 100% delivers on that promise.  It is absolutely not for someone that wants Greek Life, a broad liberal arts program,  a cultural experience, etc.  If that’s your want then look elsewhere."
Sophomore,5,"The Ocean studies program is extremely hands on, and has you working in the field by the start of your first semester. All the professors are very personable and willing to help if there is part of the subject your struggling with."
Freshman,5,"Regimental program offers a hands on program for Marine Transportation. Attending Maine Maritime Academy is more than worth it for the degree and the solid reputation in the industry.  The class sizes are small providing individualized attention, the school is invested in the students and the professors are there to help you succeed."
Freshman,5,Best deal in Maine.  Best ROI of all Maine colleges.  95% have real jobs (75K+) at graduation.  One of only 6 State Maritime Academy's.
Junior,5,It has been a great experience. The classes are small and tailored to my major and the professors really care about your academic and personal growth. The overall experience so far has been amazing.
Freshman,5,"Though there's not much to do outside of school up here in Castine, Maine, the education is simply unmatched, especially for those of us in the Regiment of Midshipmen.  For those interested in obtaining U.S. Coast Guard License(s), Maine Maritime Academy is an excellent choice.  It is well worth the investment."
Freshman,5,"Maine Maritime Academy is a great small school in the small town of Castine Maine, the school has a very high percent of student job security after graduation. Which is the biggest reason of why I am attending the school."
Freshman,5,I'm in my first year at Maine Maritime Academy.  I am impressed at how well MMA has been there for me.    The faculty and fellow students have been very accommodating and helpful.  Student life is amazing.  I'm in the regimental program and have benefited from the disciplined schedule and policies.  I would recommend anyone to this college.   
College Freshman,5,It has a very high job placement rate
College Freshman,5,It is so safe I am able to leave my door unlocked.
College Freshman,5,Tons of job opportunities and great support to find a job when I graduate.
College Freshman,5,"When I say it's the best, I mean it's the best for me. MMA is an extremely unique school. It focuses on careers that have to do with shipping. There is the regiment, which is what makes this school militaristic, and to be clear, it is not actually the military, it only simulates it. There are many great activities associated with the regiment, such as drill team, or band. Then, if you decide to become a leader in the regiment, that has it's own great experiences. There are many division 3 sports such as cross country, football, soccer, and lacrosse. There is one division 1 sport which is sailing team, and then there are several club sports such as rugby and ultimate Frisbee. The options at the school make it so there is always something to do. The town of Castine itself where MMA is located has little to offer besides the ocean, but if you get involved in extracurricular activities you will rarely be bored. The school is comprised of about 950 students, about 120 of which are female. Most of the women here are not in the regiment, so those of us that are all get to know each other. The school really encourages each class that comes in to become close shipmates with each other (in the regiment, that is). So you are forced to make friends, and there will always be someone there to help you. The atmosphere of the school, of having shipmates, is what really makes the school worth going to. Yes, you will likely get a high paying job in the shipping industry, but knowing that where ever you go in the whole world, if you meet someone else who went to MMA, you have a friend in that person. The school has a lot to teach about living life and is awesome with hands on learning. There is no where else I would rather spend my first few years after graduating high school."
College Freshman,5,Number one public school rated by money magazine 2014 and 2015.
College Sophomore,5,The Business and Logic Degree is on the cutting edge of today's economy. There are few schools that have the teachers we have with real work experience who can let us know how business really works both within the United States and abroad.
College Sophomore,5,It is a Maritime Academy with the focus on transportation on a global and international scale.
College Sophomore,5,"A typical internship is doing something that you are majoring in, but you get to apply your skills to a real life job! It is a ton of fun, and I actually got a paid internship, which isn't rare for students at MMA."
College Sophomore,5,"Despite there being a lot of headaches when dealing with all the paperwork, it is still a great school and I would highly recommend it to anyone! It is up to the students to entertain one another and it is overall a great experience."
College Junior,5,The marine biology program is very small and very hands on. Both of which means that you get a lot of time with professors doing lab and field work.
Recent Alumnus,5,Random Test – Required by the school random drug test for everyone.
Sophomore,4,"Due to the recent pandemic of Covid-19, all students were moved to remote learning. I truly believe that if the teachers had more time to prepare that this experience would have been a little bit better."
Freshman,4,"Maine Maritime Academy offers students a fantastic chance to receive hands-on education in the fields of engineering, transportation, and business. Helpful staff, free on-campus tutoring, a strong alumni network,  and a beautiful location in Castine, Maine make Maine Maritime worth serious consideration. Its biggest drawback is a hefty tuition fee but given the variety of jobs available after graduation it isn't too much of a concern."
College Freshman,4,"As a member of the basketball team, I believe everyone attends each others' games."
College Freshman,4,"The school cares the most about football and basketball (as expected). The facilities reflect this. The locker rooms are highly disproportionate to the numbers of players per team. The locker room size is arranged where the more 'important' sports have larger locker rooms. Overall the facilities are great though. Students occasionally have to be encouraged to attend sports games, but participation in the sports is good. The club sports are a little less well maintained but are still pretty popular. school spirit is pretty high, however, since MMA is the major schools/teams of the sate, it gets overshadowed by the University of Maine."
College Freshman,4,"My school is unique because it has a regiment program that helps you learn how to deal with stress, be leader and follow directions.  I would choose mine school because it is the #1 school in the nation and has everything I want to become a Marine Engineer."
College Freshman,4,"Good staff, willing to help, parking tickets can be a bit crazy though."
College Freshman,4,"professors are great, advanced knowledge about their topics and passionate in seeing their students progress."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy my time here at this school, very small and close-knit community."
College Freshman,4,Plenty of options by the school to choose from. Many houses are always up for rent and most of the upperclassmen are able to live outside of the dorms.
College Freshman,4,"Lots of variety to choose from, always something to eat regardless of who you are or what tastes you have."
College Sophomore,4,It provides real world knowledge that is superior to other school that concentrate on liberal arts.
College Sophomore,4,"The current ratio of men to women is 9:1. The women have ""their pick of the litter."" It is often easy to make friends with multiple men as the drama is lessened. "
College Sophomore,4,"We have some majors that go directly to the Coast Guard. There are random drug tests and the use of drugs is very low. The drinking is higher than average, but no one exerts any pressure on those who do not wish to join."
College Sophomore,4,Marine Biology is an extremely interesting major. It has many different areas that the Professors cover very well.
College Sophomore,4,The science program is very well built. There are many options and it is very conducive for learning new material.
College Sophomore,4,"They are very strict, but most of the reasons are understandable and they only do it to keep the students safe."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of good quality buildings around campus, and very nice classrooms. There are a lot of labs for students ranging from marine bio to engineering to transportation."
College Junior,4,"If you want to be an operational engineer, this place is well known in the power and maritime industries. There are other majors, but the license tracks and engineering students are the most successful."
College Junior,4,We have campus safety who's seemingly only function is to right parking tickets and call 911 in an emergency. Health services is good and convenient as it is centrally located and can help with most things.
College Junior,4,The academic here are very defined and don't let you expand very much on what you are majoring in. If you are very interested in what you are majoring it offers amazing opportunities no other college does.
College Freshman,2,Not a lot available.  Small town.
College Freshman,2,I am a freshman and do not participate in parties.
College Sophomore,2,"Its expected at this school so I personally have no problem with it. They are strict in areas where it is unnecessary, such as campus parking or overnight visitations."
College Sophomore,2,There are two places in town that are open year round. The next closest options are a 20 minute drive into town. Giving the two places in town opportunity to be overpriced and average with food variations.
College Sophomore,2,I get no financial aid from the school and have reapplied every chance I can. And if you have a negative balance on your account they workers in the financial aid office are very rude and unpleasant.
College Sophomore,2,Living in the dorms is quite dreary. And if you have a few friends in one room you'll be sure to see an RA stop by to make sure you are not doing anything bad.
College Freshman,2,Not very many parties at school. When there are it's very close-knit with a group of friends or a particular sports team.
College Sophomore,2,The athletic facilities could be much better
College Sophomore,2,It is far away due to the schools location
College Sophomore,2,Scholarships are harm to get.
College Sophomore,2,A lot of alcohol usage
College Sophomore,2,There are very few options for a quick local treat. Closest place is Bangor which is 45 minutes away.
College Sophomore,2,We are in upstate Maine. Lots of snow cold weather for most of the year.
College Sophomore,2,"There are really only two year round options for eating anywhere, but the school. Both are expensive and do not have a lot of options, but sometimes anything is better than Sodexo."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is outrageous! It is nearly impossible to find a parking spot.
College Sophomore,2,There were a lot of disorganization with dealing with financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,"It is a very scenic campus, but there isn't anything to do other than hang out by the water, sail, hike, or go to the bar."
College Sophomore,2,"Average Maine weather; We get all of the seasons. I personally don't like snow, which it snows a lot here and gets pretty cold. Classes are hardly ever cancelled, also. We have a long driveway so shoveling this winter should be fun."
College Sophomore,2,"I've never lived in the dorms personally. If you're in the regiment, you have to for atleast 6 semesters or until you're 21. They're just like any other dorms, except a lot less girls and more rules."
College Sophomore,2,"There is minimal public transportation at Maine Maritime. Except for some school sponsored outings, it is difficult to leave the campus without a car."
College Junior,1,The hours are atrocious. The food is pitiful. The students are told they cannot leave with snacks (such as apples) after paying the equivalent of $12 for each meal. This system needs a serious change. If just the salad and sandwich bars were left open throughout the day (as a free option!) it would make the hours bearable.
College Junior,1,The dorm (singular) was built ages ago. It needs renovation badly and is extremely expensive when paired with board (which is required).
College Sophomore,1,"Its expensive, bad housing and the school doesn't let you get off"
College Sophomore,1,There is nothing to do but drink
College Sophomore,1,"Students rely on their feet, and carpooling with friends and classmates to get around."
College Sophomore,1,"The food is terrible. It isn't fresh, which is understandable considering how far the campus is from the nearest grocery store."
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't much of a Greek life. There is a fraternity for both male and female students to join, and they just do a couple charity or community events throughout the year."
College Sophomore,1,"Off campus housing is extremely hard to get! The school requires that forms be filled out, and some students even have to sit in front of the housing board to give them reasons of why you would like to move off campus. "
College Junior,1,Everyone here except for a handful of people are white. Many of which come from similar backgrounds and a large majority from the state of Maine.
College Junior,1,"Castine is a very beautiful place, there are a couple places to go hiking and the views are great. However a lot of that gets old quickly from being stuck there for so long. There are a couple restaurants and a convenience store, but there is very little else to do in town. To get to the next step up is at least a 20 minute drive and to get to anything larger is at least an hour."
College Junior,1,"There is very little to do at MMA outside of classes and homework. Reslife books some different comedians and speakers, but it is very rare that the entertainment is actually good."
College Junior,1,"There is not a lot of housing around Castine, ME. It is an extremely small town and the houses or apartments that are for rent are very expensive. On top of that, Maine Maritime Academy does not allow students under 21 to live off campus."
College Sophomore,1,There isn't any transportation.  We live on a peninsula and everyone has to car pool.  Security will bring students to an off campus parking lot during bad weather.

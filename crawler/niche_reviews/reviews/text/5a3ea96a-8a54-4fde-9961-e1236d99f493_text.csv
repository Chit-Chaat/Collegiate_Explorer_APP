Niche User,5,"I've visited Covenant College one time, but that was already enough to make me want to come. I am hoping to attend there in the fall of 2020. They have been so incredibly helpful throughout the whole process. They have reached out to me numerous times and went above and beyond when answering questions or helping with my application."
Freshman,5,"Covenant is a great campus. They are very welcoming, clean, friendly, safe and has beautiful views. Its a small college so everyone knows everyone, and it is easy to create a tight and friendly community. The students, professors and staffs are very friendly and they have great food."
Sophomore,5,"I love Covenant! When deciding where to go to college, I knew I wanted to be somewhere that aligned with my values and would help me to live according to the calling I have received from Christ. Though not a perfect school, Covenant has been the perfect fit for me! The classes are interesting and engaging, the professors are phenomenal and caring, and the people are genuine and kind. I love being on campus (which is beautiful... think: mountains). Chattanooga is about fifteen minutes away, too, which is awesome because it has a hip downtown area to explore."
Freshman,5,Great place with lots of community. Hard academic standard but great professors who are willing to help. A lot to do around the campus including exploring the city of Chattanooga. Overall a great experience! Highly recommend to anyone interested.
Junior,5,"Very welcoming environment from faculty as well as fellow students. your first week of orientation is a blast with learning more about the school , meeting your new peers, and having fun together. The curriculum is a beautiful blend of useful, real world knowledge and the Christian faith. The services are amazing, the food is okay, and the campus itself is drop-dead gorgeous. Beautiful view of Chattanooga. Every hall has it's own community and gets very competitive and can cause fun trouble. The college has a conduct and standards that every student is expected to follow, but it's for the best. You never feel on your own in a place like this (even if you're and introvert). Probably the best college experience I could've asked for. I truly believe that God is helping to guide me on my path he intends for me through this school."
Alum,5,"Covenant College was an amazing place overall. Challenging and engaging classes, professors who invested in their students, tight-knit and welcoming community and dorm life. Not to mention being minutes from Chattanooga and all it has to offer. I would highly recommend Covenant for your college education."
Alum,5,"I’m an alumna who can’t wait to get back!! I loved my 4 years as a Scot, from the tiny frehman dorm room to the professors who shaped me and pointed me to Christ. I’ve made some of the best friends of my life here and I wouldn’t trade it for the world."
Sophomore,5,"I have never loved learning more than I do at Covenant. It feels like home every way, even down to my relationships with my professors. The community is incredible and I have been pushed to grow in countless new ways."
Freshman,5,"Covenant College is an amazing place to grow your education, the proffesors care so much about each student and want to see their students succeed."
Freshman,5,"I really like covenant and its atmosphere, it is a great college if you are looking for a small Christian college but if you aren't then it isn't what you are wanting."
Freshman,5,I love how the professor’s are so willing to help students if they get stuck. I also love that it is a small school so you really get a sense of community.
Alum,5,"I was on my way to a highly academic state school and took a chance on a last visit to Covenant College. The Covenant experience was so radically different it was to take in. From visit to graduation you could tell that the school was going to invest in you. Real learning, real engagement - no wasted classes or an apathetic TA. Couple this with them investing in who you are as a person - who you are now, and who you'll be - I couldn't be more thankful."
Sophomore,5,"The environment is amazing, and the people make it a wonderful place.  The professors invest in their students and care about them.  There is a close-knit, inviting community."
Freshman,5,Covenant College is a wonderful school I would recommend to everyone. It is small and it is somewhat secluded on the mountain. Covenant is truly Christ centered and sees God in everything. The academics are rigorous and challenge the student to think critically. The one the best features at Covenant is the hall life. Hall life is a huge part and each hall has their own traditions. Covenant itself is full of traditions and I myself is an introvert and I want to take part in everything! Covenant College is the best place to spend the next four years.
Freshman,5,"We may be small, but we are mighty.  Don't listen to reviewers who are bashing the size of the school.  I like having only 1,000 students because rather than having a bunch of acquaintances you will have a lot of close friends, and it's a really friendly atmosphere since in passing you know a lot of people and say hi to them.  The professors are great and willing to work with you if you are struggling or need an extension on a paper.  On Sundays, the library is closed and students are encouraged to go to church and discouraged from studying.  Three times a week is mandatory chapel, but honestly if you are a Christian you will want to come here to grow closer to God and look forward to attending chapel rather than seeing it as an inconvenience."
College Student,5,Parties are somewhat prevelant but never with alcohol.
College Student,5,Great study parties. A lot of people hang out in dorms or have study parties late at night.
College Student,5,Very good professors and academics
College Student,5,Professors at this school do their best to help you succeed but sometimes stray more toward teaching you about the reformed beliefs of the school and less about what will actually help you in the real world.
College Student,5,Value of a degree from covenant is very good. I have many friends who have gone to get their masters and have found a good job after college.
College Student,5,Very good safety on campus.
College Student,5,Very nice dorms. Carter is a bit old but manageable.
College Student,5,Not really any Greek life but your hall is basically like a fraternity depending on which hell you are in.
College Student,5,The soccer and basketball teams are both pretty good for being in DIII and a lot of people come out to support. Homecoming soccer games sometimes have over 1000 fans.
College Freshman,5,high quality parties. very prevelelant
College Freshman,5,Tons of fun study parties where we can commune with one another and talk about new ways to learn and get turnt ! Super Fun! Very lit!
College Freshman,5,Decent amount of foreign students but mostly white people.
College Freshman,5,very good drug safety. no drugs
College Freshman,5,value of a degree is very good it really help u get job after
College Freshman,5,Very much smart professers. They know much information and teach very good.
College Freshman,5,i very healthy on campuse i am very safe no illnesses on top of mountain hahahahahaha
College Freshman,5,Very fun live on campus much stuff to do in hall very nice oh yes good dorms nice toilet very good living quarters very good oh yes
College Freshman,5,I am not from Greece so i doesnt know deese things
College Freshman,5,very good at sport they kick ball good shoot ball in hoop good very nice oh yes
College Freshman,5,Covenant has the great advantage of being connected to many companies and startups in Chattanooga. Being affiliated with Covenant carries some weight.
College Sophomore,5,"While there are a number of educational reasons I enjoy my school, the community aspect of it has made my college experience so unique and valuable."
College Freshman,5,There is basically no access to drugs.
College Junior,5,Nothing major to worry about in terms of health or safety on campus. It is a safe place and everyone is on the same page regarding moral issues and hold each other accountable. This seems to help a good bit.
College Junior,5,Courses are good and Professors are very helpful and caring. They sincerely want their students to succeed.
College Junior,5,The residence life experience is phenomenal.  The RA staff and res life staff are just incredible people who really are about students.
College Sophomore,5,The teachers are great and for com dev they really help us find a required internship and give lots of guidance as to opportunities after college
College Sophomore,5,I like the small class sizes
College Sophomore,5,The community of the halls is great!
College Sophomore,5,"I really like the community, the small class size, the professors who genuinely care about me as a person, and the sincere desire to follow after Christ that is seen everyday on campus in a multitude of ways."
College Sophomore,5,This college has been the best experience of my life. The community here is amazing. The students and professors are very caring.
College Junior,5,Chattanooga is 15 minutes away with many options
College Junior,5,We're right next to Chattanooga !
College Junior,5,I'm actually not a partier but our school has many social events
Recent Alumnus,5,"Through loans, scholarships, and grants things worked out well. I was new to school and knew nothing of financial aid.  Things worked out well and the financial aid office was very helpful my first couple of years"
Recent Alumnus,5,"I played volleyball all four years and got scholarships with because of it.  Many people attended the sports events, especially soccer and basketball games.  There are many sports fields and areas for athletes to practice"
Recent Alumnus,5,"My major was biology.  Some classes were more difficult than others but there were many opportunities to learn through labs and trips in the community.  There was a good variety of classes ranging from comparative anatomy to ecology, and a variety of biological specialties.  There are no criteria for admission or abnormal application process."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I lived off campus for a couple months. The rent was cheap, the landlords were helpful, the house was about what you could expect in terms of quality for the price.    The parking was ample and there was not a lot of ground maintenance necessary"
College Sophomore,5,"I have not done an internship, but I have had friends who have truly enjoyed and grown from their experiences. There are programs all over the world that are able to be partnered with Covenant. They work very hard here to ensure that your experience will not only give you practical experience, but that you enjoy it. Covenant will pay for certain internships and programs, but it depends on your specific major."
College Sophomore,5,"The dorms are full of phenomenal community and always have events and fun activities going on. Carter Hall was an old hotel built in the 1920's and is the hub of all activity at Covenant. The Great Hall is located in this building and the best hall traditions come from Carter because it is the oldest. This makes Carter the most conveniently located building on campus. There are 3 other dorm buildings that each have their own distinct character and hall traditions. Being on a hall of girls or boys becomes a part of social life here, and many of your friends would be on your hall and right next to you. Here hall community is very strongly encouraged and it is a large tool for ministry as well. The housing process was easy as you were able to give preference to which hall you would like."
College Sophomore,5,"The academic excellence and integrity here is truly unbelievable and unique. About 95% of the professors here hold doctorates in their field. Each is dedicated to trusting in Jesus and showing their students how to do the same, whether that is through teaching their subject field or through how they treat their students. Because there is such a small student-teacher ratio, you are truly able to get to know your professors. You are able to walk into their offices and discuss with them questions from class or questions about a paper and they delight in helping you. It is a rigorous environment to be in; much is expected out of you and there are many pages of reading and papers to read. All of this helps to reiterate what you have learned in the lectures. There are math and writing centers available to assist those who would like extra help in those areas, or just need someone to read over their paper to determine if it is able to be turned into class."
College Sophomore,5,"I have never felt unsafe on campus. It may be because it is small, but I trust each student immensely and that is reciprocated continually throughout the campus. We are able to leave our belongings in cubbies outside of our main dining area, The Great Hall, and never feel that anyone will take them. I can think of one time last year where some money was taken from a room and that greatly shocked the community. There are security officers that patrol buildings at night and if you ever want a ride back from a long walk to some of the parking lots, you can easily access an officer or student employee on duty to help bring you to your dorm building. I generally feel extremely safe on campus, even if I am walking around alone at night."
College Sophomore,5,"Chattanooga is right down the road, filled with many choices of where to dine and what to choose. The city is large enough to find a new restaurant, coffee shop, or hole-in-the -wall place. There are coffee shops to study with relaxing and warm atmospheres and there are classic ""college student"" places that allow quick service, good food, and a cheap price. One of my favorites is called the Yellow Deli, which is open 24 hours a day for 5 days a week. It is a unique and beautiful structure with wooden tables and railings, a spiral staircase, a pulley system, and murals splashed on the walls. There you can choose from a variety of drinks, hot or cold, such as Chai and Mate."
College Freshman,5,"My advisor is the most helpful person I've ever met. All the professors in Music have helped me work out small issues I've had with the program and switching my instrument concentration and instructor was no problem at all. I love studying and practicing in the department, and the workload is not overbearing."
College Freshman,5,"I love the music department so much, everyone involved is so understanding. The program itself is undergoing transformation, and it is apparently much more practical and student-friendly. My application process went smoothly, even though I wasn't able to physically be there to audition at the beginning of Freshman year."
College Sophomore,5,"I have never seen any bit of alcohol or drug use on campus, or off for that matter. I have no desire for any of it and feel no pressure to do it. Actually I don't know people who do abuse any of this but I suppose I have heard of some off campus houses that might drink some, I just don't care for it enough to pay any attention."
Senior,4,"I loved the community among students and the amazing professors and staff who do everything they can to support you. However, there is not much diversity which I feel like should and can be improved."
Alum,4,"I love Covenant College. It has a community that will be unlike one you've never experienced before, and the focus on Christ in essentially all of your classes is so empowering and breathtaking.   Hall identity is also something that plays a big part in being at Covenant and is absolutely my favorite part about being on Campus and at Covenant. 

While a WHOLE lot of good, there is some bad such as a big disconnect and power struggle between student development and students, a disconnect in cohesion between different administrative departments, poor diversity attempts with no resources to maintain students, and professors who have little sympathy to mental health or just say very insensitive things to students at times.."
Freshman,4,"The community and academics are the reasons I chose to attend Covenant, and they exceeded expectations. Every day I wake up excited to learn something new in my classes and ready to face the day with the friends I have made there. As someone who normally takes a year or so to get into the swing of friendship and school, Covenant made me feel welcome every step of the way for my freshman year. The teachers are not only amazing in what they do but are also happy to meet students outside of the classroom and help me if I'm struggling.  The only problems I've had so far was with the lack of safety on campus and the food could use some better cooks and more variety for students with food sensitivities."
Niche User,4,"Wonderful admissions team. Very helpful and intentional. Beautiful campus and interesting professors. However, very expensive!"
Junior,4,"I am doing this review in part for this scholarship, but now also get the chance to examine the institution of which I am a part. This Christ centered education is challenging and truthful, so I am thankful for it's impact in my life."
Junior,4,"Covenant College is a private, liberal arts college seeking to provide adequate training, education and christian integration to students desiring to step into the professional world and make a difference. The education that the college provides is excellent and rigorous, the view is amazing, access to outdoors is spectacular, carter hall is gorgeous, but the facilities are just decent, food is sub par, but the people are worth getting to know."
Freshman,4,"Covenant is a small Christian, liberal arts Colllege located on a beautiful campus on Lookout Mountain. It is a wonderful school to attend. They truly love their student body and strive to engage in meaningful interaction with the students. It’s a really great school!"
College Freshman,4,"It is great so far, I am excited to attend this school!"
College Freshman,4,"Campus crime is rare besides some theft, and personal safety is rarely a concern."
College Freshman,4,"It is hard for such a small school to have an impressive athletic program, but Covenant's basketball and soccer teams are heartily supported by the student body and school. and compete well."
College Freshman,4,"I am not an expert on the school considering I have not begun attendance yet, but the people I have met who attend all really want to be there, they are willing to put in ridiculous time and the money to be apart of this strange community, which speaks volumes to me."
College Sophomore,4,"Most professors have been fantastic - a few should probably be avoided, but I've been generally impressed by most."
College Sophomore,4,Most alums I've talked to have had little to no issues with job prospects after graduating.
College Sophomore,4,"Socially I had an absolutely fantastic first year at Covenant. Dorm life was even better than I was expecting. The room quality itself was not amazing, but honestly I didn't spend as much time in my own room as I would have expected."
College Sophomore,4,"While there are definitely some downsides to being at Covenant, for the most part the community and academics are pretty fulfilling."
College Freshman,4,"We're on the top of a mountain so we're probably not gonna get a lot of visits from terrorists or serial killers. So we don't have front check-in desks like universities in cities - technically someone could wait till a student with their card came by and just walk into one of the dorms. Overall, its a very safe environment because its so small, there's such a strong sense of community, and the majority of people strive to live their lives according to biblical standards of morality. Everyone has to sign a contract that says they won't drink or have sex while a student at Covenant, so that makes issues of sexual assault far less common on our campus than on most."
College Freshman,4,"Most professors are extremely approachable and invested in you as a student and as a person. The average class sizes are very small, which is conducive to this. There are some truly amazing professors here that I feel so fortunate to be able to work with and learn from. There are a few that aren't very willing to challenge their own views, and that is very frustrating."
College Freshman,4,"The two top statistical contributors to post-graduate career success, or getting a job in the field you want, are substantive connection with a professor and in-feild experience (internships). Covenant guarantees the former and makes the latter very accessible. For some majors, you need an internship in order to graduate. Graduates from Covenant usually end up with great jobs in their field."
College Freshman,4,"There's a good deal of housing options, except everyone has to dorm on campus their first year, there is very limited space in student apartments (which are kind of run down but a cheaper option), and you can only move off campus (way cheaper) if you're a senior by credit or 23 years old. The resident community is on each hall and of each building is definitely a distinctive. Each building has its own culture and many halls have legacies (historical prank feuds between Catacombs and Ghetto)."
College Freshman,4,"We're only a D3 school but people do get excited about our varsity teams. It's a very balanced, enlivening spirit. Intramurals are also very popular and a lot of fun."
College Junior,4,"The alumni network is very strong.  Job prospects within that network are great.  Chattanooga and surrounding areas specifically.  Outside of that it might be harder since it is a smaller school and not as well known.  Regardless, it is a great education and prepares student well for future career opportunities."
College Junior,4,"As a varsity golfer- I can say with confidence that the athletic facilities are well done.  The training staff is pretty helpful and the facilities are nice, especially the soccer and baseball facilities.  The golf course is nice as well.  Exercise facilities include four basketball courts, new tennis courts, and some great intramural facilities. Some of the exercise equipment could use an update (some of it is fairly new though).  Coaches are helpful and challenge players.  They really care for their players. 

The teams do well in the conference too. Winning a number of conference titles in the last few years. Student support for varsity teams is definitely notable.  People come out and cheer for their friends and classmates."
College Junior,4,"Covenant is a very academically challenging school.  I feel pushed and challenged in my studies by the on campus community, and by the professors.  It is a great environment.  Professors really do care about your studies and future, and want to assist you in whatever way they can.  Chapels are informative and often interesting.  Classes are great for the most part. Professors don't often make use of TA's, and teach their own classes.  Because of this, not a lot of research is being done, which is one of the school's shortcomings.  Research is done, just not a ton of it.  The positive is that with small class sizes, you get to know the professors who teach the classes.  Almost all of the professors i've taken have been outstanding people.  

Community/residence life on campus is phenomenal. RA staff and community coordinators do a great job of facilitating great relationships and a fun environment. I honestly can't say enough about how good the res. life staff is! 

The campus is beautiful as well.  Looking from my dorm window I can see the lights of Chattanooga at night, and mountains beyond during the day.   Sunrises and sunsets from the windows of the academic buildings and dining hall are second to none. It really is a beautiful campus, and rightly earns its ranking as the #1 most beautiful christian school."
College Sophomore,4,The mountain is not really in the middle of a big city so that helps it be safe and the campus security is good
College Sophomore,4,"I think Covenant does a good job of having athletics but always making sure that Christ is at the center and not our own personal glory. I Waldo really like the fact that we not only have varsity teams, but we also have JV teams which really open up competitive sports to more of the student body."
College Freshman,4,"The rules are enforced well here, mainly because I believe that many of the students would not want to break the rules, anyway."
College Freshman,4,"I love having healthy choices with all of the various vegetables, and I know the cooks genuinely try to feed the students well. My biggest complaint would be the lack of variety with fruit (I really miss strawberries), but at the same time I know how expensive healthier foods can get, so I can't really blame them. The rice and eggs I find a bit disappointing, but otherwise I don't really have a problem with the rest of the food."
College Freshman,4,"While there are struggles with living roughly 2,000 from my family, ultimately I am grateful to be living on campus. I have already grown so much by learning how to manage life without my family, but also on how to trust those around me when I need help, such as from my roommates. Community, while not perfect, is so much better here than I would have received if I had gone to another school near home, and I am very glad to not have to use a community bathroom! I am not in the correct dorm building, but that is more my fault than those that placed me here on my recommendation; even so the dorm and its community has already done much for me in my own personal growth physically, emotionally, and even spiritually."
Recent Alumnus,4,There are many options and a variety of choices in the great hall.  The price is not bad and they have many meal plans depending on ones budget .
Recent Alumnus,4,"The courses were rated quite accurately with the upper level classes requiring an increase in study hours and focus.  The professors were helpful, and yet there is an unspoken idea that one should know the difficulty of classes one is signed up for.  The class size varied depending on if it was a lab, lecture, and if computers was necessary."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There is not much on the mountain unless you are a runner, and/or enjoy the outdoors.  Down the mountain has quite the selection of bars, restaurants, and beautiful scenery.  There are bridges, many local stores and shops, as well as a park by the river."
College Sophomore,4,"All students that come to Covenant must first sign a contract agreeing to certain standards of conduct. These are well known before and are then enforced throughout the year and on the halls. The administration is very accessible and never wants to see you get into any sort of trouble, understanding that people do make mistakes; however, there are expectations of each student that are met in their behavior. The school policies are meant to keep Covenant truly as a Christian foundation. This includes having open hall hours for girls going into boys halls and vice versa. These policies also help to continue the hall tradition that may have been lost if the members of the halls were spending all of their time with the opposite gender."
College Sophomore,4,"There are many varsity and junior varsity sports that are available to be involved in. New tennis courts were just added, as well as a new gym floor, free weight room, and intramural field. There are 2 full regulation soccer fields that host over 1,000 fans sometimes, especially during Homecoming events. Soccer is the big sport here and the fans love to watch it as well. School spirit and morale is very high, with students wearing Covenant apparel each day, whether they are supporting soccer, basketball, or volleyball. Many students are involved in intercollegiate sports, nearly 1/3 of the student population. Many students become fans as they fill the gym or the stadium and watch their friends participate. Our soccer field is one of the best in the Southeast, with a stunning view of the sunset right behind it."
College Sophomore,4,"Covenant is a Christian school through and through. Students love to dress warmly for the cold weather, with flannel and boots, or tights and classic wing tip type shoes. Danskos are very popular here among the ladies. Many students are interested in sports, reading, hiking, climbing, watching the sunset, and fellowshipping with one another. Their social life often involves studying, either down the mountain or in the library on a week day and having lots of fun and relaxing from Friday night until Monday morning. There are many different activities that are available in Chattanooga, such as the Hunter art museum or the Aquarium. We have the longest walking bridge, and across the Tennessee river, there is a park and more fun and small shops. Relationships here are highly valued and respected, taken with care and most often with integrity. Students love to ask each other deep questions and also love to participate in intramural sports."
College Freshman,4,"Working with the financial aid office is a eye-opening experience, and I found it very helpful. The people are understanding and try their hardest to get you the financial package you need. All you have to do is be honest about your situation and they will meet you where you are."
College Freshman,4,Those who are found using drugs are either suspended or expelled.
College Freshman,4,"It's a small but beautiful campus with great activities, but I think it could use more academic buildings and student centers."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are so wonderful, they really take the time to care about students."
College Sophomore,4,"Honestly my school is so accepting and loving of everyone. We have a lot of racial diversity and a wide variety of economic backgrounds. I don't hear much about politics but I'm sure there are differing views. The main thing is that the majority of people are Christians, where that be Presbyterian, Catholic, Episcopalian, ect., we are mostly Christian. And as far as sexual orientation goes, we accept anyone but we don't allow for someone to perform the actions of what is not biblical, whether that be a straight person, or a gay person."
College Sophomore,4,There are surprisingly many majors for the size of the school. It's not the best because it doesn't have everything but it can get you on the right track to getting what you need.
College Sophomore,4,"We live up on a mountain so nothing is directly near but the scenery is stunning. And it only takes about 15 minutes to get down the mountain where you can do all sorts of things such as shopping, eating, going to museums, and going to the theaters."
College Sophomore,4,"You can't live off campus until senior year but that's one of the positive unique things about Covenant. Underclassmen can live in the on campus apartments but they aren't as nice as dorms, they're just cheaper. The seniors however can live anywhere really so they can go scout out really nice places to stay if they have that desire. The possibilities are wonderful."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics really are great. Varsity men's soccer is a big deal and is widely attended. Tennis, soccer, volleyball, cross-country, basketball, softball, baseball, they are all talked about and attended/supported very well. Our gym and workout room is really nice to and it's not just for the athletes, but anyone who attends or works at the school."
College Freshman,4,"Covenant has a strict policy against drug and alcohol use. Even adults over the age of 21 are not allowed to drink on or around campus during the school year. There is a party scene, but it's limited to certain groups of friends and is not widely acknowledged."
College Freshman,4,"Every residence hall and academic building, in addition to the library, has a computer lab and printer."
College Sophomore,4,"I've never felt nervous on campus.  The safety and security workers don't seem very strong or capable, but the location of this school is very safe and untouched by most crime."
College Sophomore,4,Covenant supplied me with several scholarships and was very helpful in making my education possible.
College Sophomore,4,"There are many athletes, and they're usually very talented.  Games are well attended and well loved."
College Sophomore,4,"Chattanooga has a lot of cool restaurants to try out, and you can find some good food that isn't too expensive."
College Sophomore,4,"Covenant College is located on the top of Lookout Mountain in Georgia. For students without cars it can sometimes be difficult getting up and down the mountain. However, the city of Chattanooga, Tennessee is only fifteen minutes from campus and has a lot of variety when it comes to off-campus dining."
College Sophomore,4,The Education department at my school is extensive. Students are challenged in many ways and have many opportunities to get field experience. Covenant College hopes to help students find out whether or not their choice in major is a good fit for them. 
College Freshman,4,I'm getting more than 13000 a year is scholarships
College Freshman,4,"As long as you're not a freshman guy, the parking is great."
College Freshman,4,Everything that is required has a purpose and professors are very considerate. 
College Freshman,4,Work is tough and professors push you to be your best.
College Freshman,4,"There's not any racism on campus, minorities are welcome!"
College Freshman,4,Covenant spends a lot of is athletic facilities and they are top notch.
College Freshman,4,"There's a lot of things to do every day. From walking trails around the mountain to athletic events, there are endless possibilities. "
College Freshman,4,Girls at Covenant are great and I have met many who I would consider datable. Most of the guys are great and there is a huge variety of interests among them.
College Freshman,4,The dorms very greatly.  I am in the newest and best dorm building that is very open and spacious.  Other dorm buildings aren't so nice but they are all decent.
Alum,2,"Very small christian college located on a mountain top. The doctrine & theology is very solid and strongly focused on. So it is a great school if you are looking to get into ministry. Besides that, they are outdated and behind the times. There wasn't a single career/job fair in the 4 years I attended. The school isn't very connected in the area (isolated on mountain). The career center will help you set up resume and LinkedIn account, other than that the connections are limited. Some of the concentrations, like marketing, were very outdated and waste of time. They didnt even have an online portal to check grades and assignments (this was 2012 - 2016). A lot of the professors and faculty don't support the athletic program. So if you are looking for a very small, unique community, at an expensive price, or if you were home schooled, it could be a great fit. If not, I wouldn't waste your time looking here."
College Freshman,2,"The core requirement includes religious classes, which in the real world provide no use."
College Freshman,2,"Availability of computers is pretty bad, and the WiFi sucks all over campus, and sometimes there isn't phone service on certain parts of campus. Printing almost never works in my resident hall, and there is a lack of copy machines. Every student definitely needs their own computer."
College Sophomore,2,"It's way too restrictive.  Guys and girls can't hang out in dorms except for certain hours on weekends.  There's some good community, but it's kind of depends on which hall you live on."
College Sophomore,2,"It's incredibly difficult.  The weight of classes, homework, chapel, and various expected activities is too heavy and it's hard to stay positive."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is great, but I'm just not happy with everything here.  It's hard to stay positive with the heavy workload, and it often feels like a lot of what I learn is irrelevant to what I need to succeed."
College Sophomore,2,Printers and the wifi are both unreliable.  The computers are slow and outdated.
College Sophomore,2,The gloomy weather causes some depression and anxiety.
College Freshman,2,No real transportation besides friends and family.
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is predominantly white.  The college does emphasize the importance of understanding other cultures in the core classes and in lecture series, however.  A fair number of missionary kids add diversity as well."
College Freshman,2,"Not much partying or drinking. It is a Christian school. If you want a night life, you have to go into the city of Chatanooga"
College Sophomore,2,There really is no public transport around Covenant. There is transportation once you get off the mountain though.
College Freshman,2,"I am only a freshman, but I am a physical therapy major. Covenant only offers a pre-physical therapy program. It is a good, hard school but if you are wanting to get your degree more efficiently then the physical therapy program here might not be for you. Especially if you are not interested in integrating Christ within all of your works."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Great Sometimes, Horrible Sometimes – It's up on a mountain, so there is consistent fog especially in the colder months. But the views are amazing, and it stays cooler in the summer which is nice."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is dependent on your grade level so of course the seniors are closest and the freshmen are the furthest away. The freshmen parking lot is unpaved but its doable. You can't park in the professors spots but on the weekend you can park wherever you want which is awesome!
College Freshman,2,"Rather Shabby – The computer labs are usually relatively empty. For practical purposes, it still makes far more sense to just have your own laptop-being able to do homework wherever you want on campus in invaluable! However, the internet connection is horrible. My roommate and I competed every night to get a measly connection."
College Junior,2,"It's possible to find decent, even good, food at meals in the only dining hall on campus. It's not great though; the food gets repetitive, and sometimes they put things together that have no business being in the same dish (i.e. almonds and chili powder on broccoli). Peanut butter and jelly are always a staple. The new fresh baked bread they've started this year is really good."
College Junior,2,"There are parking lots, but only upperclassmen who pay are allowed to park there. The rest have to park nearly half a mile from campus and walk. Ticketers are strict."
College Sophomore,2,"Super Strict – It is a fairly conservative christian college, so it is expected to have strict conduct. Boys and girls are allowed in each others dorms on the weekends for very specific hours and only with the door a foot open. No drinking on or off campus, or even over break is allowed, if they find out that you did, you are basically screwed. No sex, if you are caught you very well may be kicked out. No smoking anything at all. pranks are limited and must be told to your RD before-hand. Basically you have to be a good little christian and don't break any commandments at all."
College Senior,2,Great Hall – They are always using left over food. No variety whatsoever
Niche User,1,"If you are considering Covenant College, PROCEED WITH CAUTION!  Covenant College is not what it seems.  Covenant is a group of Pharisees.  If you are not part of their coterie, you will not fit in!  ""In All Things Christ Preeminent,” is Covenant’s motto; Christ leading everything.  Sadly, this motto isn’t followed by those in positions of leadership. Covenant is made up of pretentious people with a very closed mindset.  God’s word says, “He will delight in obeying the Lord.  He will not judge by appearance nor make a decision based on hearsay” Isaiah 11:3.  Obviously, Covenant doesn’t make God’s word a priority.  If they did, they could retort my claim honestly.  Considering Covenant, PLEASE BEWARE of what Covenant says versus what Covenant does.  Is this where you want your student to go and grow?"
Niche User,1,"Covenant College is a place that is losing its culture and devolving into a boring, bible thumping mountain top dwelling that kills souls and dreams"
College Freshman,1,"If you want to feel like you are going to college, don't come here. The large majority of kids were homeschooled/private-schooled kids who don't know how to interact with one another. The professors are supposedly the highest they can be (doctorate degrees) in their fields but many times are hard to understand."
College Freshman,1,"Nobody I have talked to know what Covenant College is. Covenant will try to persuade you to attend the college by saying that Chattanooga is just down the mountain, but in reality Chattanooga (which is awesome) is roughly 25 minutes away. Even in Chattanooga the people I have talked to view Covenant students as weird. I assume if you are looking for a job within the PCA a degree from Covenant would do you good."
College Freshman,1,I had to move dorms due to construction that was going on. Students in Carter are forced to leave their rooms @ 8:30 in the morning and cannot enter until they are allowed to do so. The school turns the air conditioning off at times and dorms become extremely hot.
College Freshman,1,"Being on top of a mountain, there is nothing within 20 minutes of the college. The food is disgusting, the core requirements are ridiculous, and the mandatory chapel is terrible. If you want to go to an actual college don't come here. The students are very weird, and they try to shove their religious views down your throat."
College Freshman,1,"There's not much partying going on for a college, and the local nightlife is almost nonexistent in Chattanooga. The Electric Cowboy club is terrible."
College Sophomore,1,There IS no night life.  There's absolutely nothing to but go to walmart or Taco Bell or something boring like that.
College Sophomore,1,"Covenant College students are not allowed to drink, smoke, chew, or have sexual intercourse while they are attending the school."
College Freshman,1,"There are no sororities or fraternities at Covenant College. I am grateful there is no pressure to be a member of a specific group. The focus on God, takes the place of Greek life at Covenant."
College Junior,1,There's a lot of restaurants in Chattanooga but that's down the mountain and we live on the mountain. There's only two restaurants and a starbucks on the mountain. So to get a good bite to eat you normally need to drive down the mountain.
College Junior,1,"There are plenty of spaces in the two off campus lots, but they're a long walk from main campus. This is especially true if it's windy, rainy, or cold, one or more of which is usually the case on the mountain. On campus parking is better, but the lots fill up quickly and are downhill (at a very steep incline) from the majority of campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Dull Life – Friday nights can be fun, but only if you plan days ahead to go somewhere far away with fun people. If you want to leave the mountain and go find something fun to do in downtown Chattanooga, there is no bus to take, you have to make friends with people who have cars. Chattanooga is a very cool and fun place, but because of the fact that you get basically kicked out if you so much as look at a drink of alcohol and administration finds out, the fun is short-lived and pretty much limited to buying food. I have not had very many fun weekends here at Covenant yet. The only thing that is fun thats not prohibited is going clubbing. There are a few clubs that are fun, not super fun, but better than sitting in your dorm room on a friday night like i am right now."
College Student,1,uh...see contract. not allowed to go
College Student,1,there is none – nonezkies
College Student,1,lack of weapons – No one has guns.
College Sophomore,1,"Long Drive and Inconvenient – The off-campus dining at Covenant is one of the downfalls of the college. The college is on a mountain and there are not really many restaurants there on the mountain. That means if we want to eat off-campus it is usually a 20 minute drive to the nearest restaurant area. The closest restaurants are right off the mountain or downtown Chattanooga. They do not really offer any form of discounts for the students. There are quite a few choices but not all of them are cheap enough for college students. Its tough also because the parking near the restaurants is costly and inconvenient.  I do not mind the restaurants that are available but it would be nice if there were a few closer to the college. I understand, though, that if they did have popular restaurants on the mountain they may not get enough business to be able to make a profit. So I know it would be tough to get off-campus dining any closer than what is off the mountain."
College Sophomore,1,"While the administration and admissions department works hard to encourage ethnic/racial diversity amoung students, the student body itself is not terribly diverse. Students are primarily white. However, there seems to be more significant economic and political diversity amoung students."

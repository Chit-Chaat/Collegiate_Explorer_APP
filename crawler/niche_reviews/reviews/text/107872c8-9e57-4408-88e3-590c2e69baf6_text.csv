Alum,5,Online learning is fast and effective. Professors care about the students and have done an amazing job adjusting to change.
Alum,5,Clarke is the best college to attend to grow both as a student and an individual. Clarke allows you to pursue your education while finding yourself. The city of Dubuque offers great opportunities and livelihood. Clarke is overall an amazing choice for attending college.
Junior,5,"Clarke University is a small school. Class sizes range from 4-30 people so professors have the ability to be attentive and are extremely helpful when it comes to setting up one on one instruction. Clarke is very academically oriented, but still boasts a school population with the vast majority being student-athletes. This perpetuates a competitive environment in both academics and athletics so that not only professors are supporting you, but teammates and coaches as well. Being a small school, you see a lot of the same people every day so its very easy to get comfortable and get to know people in the community."
Freshman,5,When i first got to Clarke i didn't know how i would feel about the place. After 4 short months (My first semester) i can say that i actually really enjoy Clarke. The people placed in faculty are very nice and understanding. What i like mostly about Clarke is the professors. If needed they will take time out of their day to sit one on one with you and discuss problems/questions that you have. Overall Clarke is a very enjoyable place.
Sophomore,5,"A small college with programs that prepare students for their careers, not only within their majors, but in a general sense as well. It has a very friendly community and professors who want to see their students succeed. The college has many resources for students, like help with writing and study sessions for specific classes or subjects. Internships are also available, allowing a student to gain relevant experience, make connections, and often help pay tuition."
Niche User,5,The thing I liked best about Clarke University was that they make it clear they will do anything to make sure you graduate in 4 years and will help you with anything
Sophomore,5,"Clarke University has small, intimate class sizes which allows for a better discussion. The teachers know you by name and are willing to help you be successful in any way."
Alum,5,"Clarke University was an excellent college for me. If I had to repeat my college experience, I would not change anything."
Niche User,5,Im planning to go there as we speak. I will be a freshman after this year. I am currently a high school student. I attend Thornridge High School and I am a senior.
Niche User,5,"It's not a huge school and that's what i like about it because you can get to know everybody there. Also, you aren't a number to a teacher because of the small school size you get very familiarized with the teachers."
Junior,5,"I have a great experience at this school. All the staff are welcoming and make Clarke feel at home. Depending on the program, The head is normally very attentive. Clarke is a challenging school, but they do not let you do it alone."
Senior,5,"The academics are a bit difficult but the professors take the load off of stress because they are willing to work one on one with you. The athletics is very competitive, starting in 2018, Clarke is getting a football team. The school advocates for equality."

Sophomore,5,I like the friendly atmosphere the staff has created. Since everyone is so kind and caring it feels like I have gained another family.
Sophomore,5,"Clarke University is without a doubt the place I'm glad to call home. I have finished my first year, and I cannot wait for the next. The Clarke community makes being away from home easy. I am very fortunate to be able to attend Clarke University to gain education at such an excellent level. Clarke allows me to feel safe and welcome. It is very easy and enjoyable to be involved in various activities around campus. I am a part of the Clarke softball team, and it makes the college experience so great. Dubuque is an all around involving town, and it provides many great opportunities. I love Clarke and recommend it to every high schooler I know."
Sophomore,5,My experience so far at Clarke University has been amazing. I've learned so much since attending Clarke. The staff and professors that are very helpful and they go out of their way to assist in your success. I've been telling my coworkers about Clarke and I give this school two thumbs up.
Freshman,5,"So far, everything here has been great. I was involved in a sexual assault in the beginning of the year and the school did a great job in handling the situation and making sure that I stayed safe after everything happened. Academics are awesome, the professors are always easy to get to when needed and they make their schedules available at all times. The campus is beautiful and well kept, rooms are gorgeous. All faculty and staff are easy to speak to and everyone goes by first name."
College Sophomore,5,"Athletes make up a good portion of the student body here at Clarke University. We are all very supportive of one another and try to attend each others games as often as we can.  I feel that in the next few years with football becoming a new addition to Clarke University we will be seeing some exciting changes in the facilities Clarke has to offer.  We have facilities both on campus and of that our sports teams utilize. Overall, being an athlete at Clarke University, you have support from all over including fellow students, local residence and the faculty of Clarke! Its great to be able to represent Clarke, coming from a Clarke athlete themselves! GO CRUSADERS!"
College Sophomore,5,"To some people Clarke University may seem too small and not as lively as some big Universities but I agree to disagree. I've seen many friends leave because this school was not as big of an all around party as they dreamt college would be. However, the ones that stay leave here gaining a whole lot more than one wild story to tell.  Students from Clarke University leave here with a million unforgettable stories to tell their children. Clarke teaches students about culture, diversity, service, leadership and many more essential life long attributions to a fulfilling and successful life. Clarke University offers dedicated professors and counselors to help students find their own path in life. Even if there were such a thing as ""do-over's"" or ""take-back's"" I would still chose to attend Clarke University because I know I am on the right path to a prosperous life."
College Sophomore,5,Getting a degree from this school can open up numerous opportunities for me as a student and I feel that I am able to get a decent job when coming out of college.

College Sophomore,5,All the food is fantastic and there are many options to choose from.

College Junior,5,I think Clarke is the best.  They care about the quality of education for the students

College Junior,5,"The weather rarely affects my campus experience. Everything on campus is connected, so if there is terrible snow, or rain, I do not have to worry about anything."
College Junior,5,"The safety and security on campus is really great. I can walk anywhere on campus at any time of day and feel completely safe. I also know that I could leave, for example, my laptop out anywhere on campus and know that no one would take it."
College Junior,5,The financial Aid office is all ways willing to help anyone that comes in with questions.
College Junior,5,Every one at the school is friendly and you can all ways find some one to talk to.
College Junior,5,"At Clarke there is computers every where, there is no trouble trying to find a computer with a printer during each semester they give you 500 free pages which i have not even come close of using them all."
College Sophomore,5,All other academics are just as good. The professors try to make class as a fulfilling time. The workloas differs for each class but generally a good workload. There are study sessions where we can study with a guide if we are confused and teachers always welcome us into their offices. 
College Sophomore,5,The teachers are wonderful and I constantly have amazing opportunities like research presented to me. They genuinely care about my education and keep me working hard and persevering to get better. I am often told about internship opportunities and different classes I can take that will help with my major. 
College Sophomore,5,There are many majors to major in at clarke. When you are in a major you most likely have the same people in the same classes. This is nice because then you have consistency and people to study with. The teachers always know you by name because the classes are small.
College Sophomore,5,The varsity sports are pretty big at Clarke. The basketball and baseball team are the best. The games are very exciting and it gives us clarke people something to do.
College Freshman,5,"The cost of parking permits are definitely reasonable, but I know that many people did not bring a car along with them when they moved on campus at the beginning of the school year. Living on campus without a car is in no way inconvenient. The Jule is available to ride ,even late into the evening, free by showing one's crusader card."
College Freshman,5,We have a brand new library that is extremely helpful to all of the students here at Clarke.  It has brand new computers and lap tops for all students.
College Freshman,5,I love Iowa weather.  It is warm during the spring and fall and during the winter it is cold so I personally just stay indoors.
College Freshman,5,big parking lot.  Enough space for the small student body.
College Freshman,5,I am not too sure I have not really looked for off campus housing. A lot of my friends have houses off campus thou and they seem pretty affordable
College Freshman,5,I never feel unsafe at Clarke. There is always someone to help. Everyone watches out for everybody. I have never had any problems
College Junior,5,"Very Diverse – Clarke is a small university, however the population has differnt races, and ethnicities. i belive 8 countries, and 10 states are represented. Not bad for a small town and small campus."
College Junior,5,"Personal Safety - Never Felt Safer! I have never felt unsafe at Clarke College! There is a staff of security guards that check the school 24/7 to make sure everything and everybody is safe. The security guards are also very friendly and personable, so you can tell them anything without feeling awkward. The campus crime is also very very low."
College Sophomore,5,"The diversity on campus is amazing.  We have students from many different countries including Venezuala, Mexico, South Africa, France, Italy, Spain, Germany, and Australia.  We also have a wide variety of religions represented on campus, and they are all well accepted even though Clarke is a Catholic school.  There are lots of students from all over the United States that have different ethnic or racial backgrounds.  Some of our RAs are from foreign countries or have backgrounds coming from asian countries or southern cities.  We have a Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual/Transgender group on campus and it is well know and accepted which studnets fit there, because they feel comfortable to tell everyone.  Clarke University is a leader in campus diversity."
College Sophomore,5,"Always Caring Professors – Professors at Clarke University are extremely caring and willing to help all the time.  It is always possible to find a professor to just sit down and talk to about anything.  Professors believe in contact with the students and are always willing to answer questions.  I have noticed that professors here also want us to do our absolute best, and they will help us with that.  I wouldn't be in the Honors Program or taking an independent study on qualitative research next semester if it wasn't for the professors at this school that always believe in me."
College Junior,5,Drunken Savior – There is so many great places to eat for a cheap college student only a few mins away from the college. Little Caesar's with the 5 dollar pizza has saved me and my friends alot of money that we would of spent else where.
Niche User,4,"Clarke University has a very diverse campus with lots of beautiful scenes and colors. The people there are all amazing and you can't ask for a better set of friends. The athletics are amazing and have a great program with many great coaches and players. The facilities are great and I would highly recommend joining the programs, as they allow much more diversity in the experience."
Sophomore,4,I transferred to Clarke because I felt at home and it made me feel like I can be successful. It is a small school and that helps me with more one on one teacher communication and the food is good and the teachers are super super nice
Niche User,4,Clarke University has an amazing medical program and was in my leading colleges to attend.  The only reason I choose a different school was the coaches at the other school made me feel like I will be contributing to their program more.   If you are looking for a smaller school with a great atmosphere this is this the place to go.
Niche User,4,"My only experience that I have had with Clarke is through tours and a nursing assimilation. I truly enjoyed it and all of the staff were very kind to me and the other groups of people. I love how open it was and how it is easy to get from place to place. What I learned was that since it is a smaller private college, that you are closer to your staff and are able to call them by their first names. Also, you aren't referred to as a number, but the staff actually knows your name. The college seems very friendly. I enjoyed the tours, and that is why that is the top option for colleges on my list."
Junior,4,"I like the community feel at Clarke. The smaller campus size helps you to know everyone, including professors and faculty. You get the one on one attention you need from professors and are provided great opportunities."
Sophomore,4,I loved my freshmen year at Clarke. I had quite a great experience with professors besides a couple which this is typically true at every university. I play sports and i made some of my best friends and my coach is excellent and cares about you as a human being not just an athlete. The classes are challenging but you really do learn something and get a great education. I would recommend Clarke to everyone
Freshman,4,"The dorms are a little out of date, and the campus is small, but the professors care about you a lot, the food is good, and everyone on campus is very friendly"
Freshman,4,"So far I love my experience at Clarke. It is small, but that is good for academics. My professors are all very helpful, and the advisors are great! The food is pretty decent for college food, they try to keep it mixed up.  The dorms are average, I would like to see more options for rooming. But overall, it's been great so far!"
Niche User,4,"As a parent of a freshman, it's still too early to share details but I can say that the times I have visited campus I have ALWAYS felt welcome.  The admissions process was great and the professors that I met were equally enthusiastic about their areas of study. I have consistently felt comfortable and safe on campus! If you are looking for a small campus this is the place!"
Freshman,4,I was matched with Clarke University because of my baseball ability as well as my interest in Nursing as a career.  The admissions advisor as well as the Head Baseball Coach treated me like a person and made my decision to go here a no brainer.
Junior,4,I love Clarke University. The professors here are very good at their job and are always willing to help students when they need it. It is such a small campus that it feels like we are all one big family and you can definitely tell that the professors truly care for us and they really do want us to do well.
Niche User,4,I have visited Clarke University 4 times now.   I have not attended any classes yet since I am a senior in high school.  I do like that all buildings are connected including the dorm rooms.   I also like that laundry is included with tuition.   Everyone is very friendly and helpful.  The one negative thing I can say is that the academic scholarships are not as good as other schools especially since the tuition is higher than other schools I have looked at.
Niche User,4,"I really loved the location of the college.  it is located in Dubuque near the bluffs and a river, and is also about 5 minutes away from downtown.  The campus itself is very old, but is newly renovated which gives it that antique feel.  It used to be an all women college, but has recently been opened up to men.  The architecture of the buildings is spectacular, and even more impressive, the school has underground tunnels!  I'm going for nursing, and the program guarantees you're out in four years with a degree which is extremely satisfying.  There are also a lot of hospitals near the campus which makes it super easy to complete my clinicals.  The only problem I have with the overall atmosphere is that it is still a blossoming campus, so it is quite small.  I'm from a small town so I'm familiar with the small-town feel, but it would be nice to be apart of a campus with more students at some point in the future."
College Junior,4,"The career center on campus is very helpful! I worked there in years past as a works study and experiences all the times they helped students fine internships, jobs, or even study abroad opportunities."
College Junior,4,"There is a good variety of classes and most of the professors are fair. Some really don't teach and just read off slides, but the majority of them are good."
College Junior,4,The security is always around and always willing to help anyone who needs the help. You constantly pass them in the halls walking to class or anywhere on campus. They are also very friendly when they are helping you.
College Junior,4,"The on campus apartments are great! You get to live close to some of your closest friends, but still have the opportunity to get some alone time in your own room."
College Junior,4,"For the most part, the professors are very open to helping their students and making sure they succeed. Some professors are just harder than others to understand and get on their good side."
College Sophomore,4,Clarke University makes it a priority to create a safe community for students.  Many precautions are taken in order to prevent any unfortunate incidents. We have security 24/7 with access to Resident Assistants on call 24/7 as well.  Both are very easily reachable. In addition security makes their rounds pretty often around campus checking on everything. I feel very safe while I'm at Clarke. I've never run into any problems or dangers while attending Clarke University.
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is easy and great, especially for freshman year! On top of having to get use to a whole new school moving out of your home can be a scary but exciting step in ones life.  My experience with the dorms has been great for the most part. Sometimes it gets a bit too hot for comfort but cracking a window and getting a fan or two usually does the trick! I lived in Mary Ben which is the girls dorm and everyone was very friendly and welcoming.  Move in day is a breeze with all the help you get.  Clarke staff and students are ready when you arrive to help you get all unpacked and settled in! I would really recommend dorm life."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel really safe on campus. They are guards in their office and at night they do checks to see  if everything is alright. If you need help or forgot your keys you can just call them and they will pick you up. I feel really safe in this school, sometimes at night it can pretty dangerous to cross the street though, from the SAC. There has not been any crime that was a huge deal. At one time, at non-Clarke person did come in the school and was going inside students' room but that was controlled, and have not heard of any more accidents occurring. That was the only time, where I did not feel safe knowing some stranger was walking around school other than that I feel really safe. Guys and girls have different chips to access the dorms, so at night guys are not allowed to enter the girls' dorm."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy all my professors. They can really make you feel important. The largest class size I have is about 20-30 students which is not bad. The smallest class I had was 6 students! You can always email your professors and they will surely reply in a timely manner, they are always there to help. When I don't understand something the professors go over it one more time and this is great. The courses are very good. Some of the courses that we are required to take I think that it is a waste. I think that the school should focus more on your major other than that the courses are great. You have a wide range of selection when selecting your courses."
College Sophomore,4,Some of my teachers are very understanding and were able to work with me while I traveled for baseball and they made it easy for me to catch up on material and not fall behind in class.
College Sophomore,4,"I like the school I am at. Although it is a little small, I like the idea that almost everyone knows each other and that the campus is not that big. I am able to get to know my teachers well and they are able to help me in whatever I need in order for me to be successful in the classroom"
College Freshman,4,hockey is huge part of the athletics here at Clarkson and the games are a great way to bring students together.  There are club sports for everyone and you'll always be able to find something in your interest fields.
College Sophomore,4,I think the school enforces this a lot with many policies. They are very strict when it comes to drugs. The school is very safe.
College Sophomore,4,Mostly secure and open community.
College Sophomore,4,Being as we are a very tight knit school there is also a lot of school spirit.
College Freshman,4,Most majors provide internships so students are able to get a better experience with the major they have chosen.
College Freshman,4,"the professors know what they are teaching, they care for the students, courses vary, and we have the option to pick the courses we are most interested in."
College Freshman,4,"Everything works fine. We have enough space for everything, it is always clean, and everything is easily accessible."
College Freshman,4,"It has been a great experience so far. Everyone is friendly, the teachers are always willing to help, and they are interested in seeing us succeed."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are great and know their stuff.
College Freshman,4,A wonderful school with lots of help. It's small enough to get attention you need but big enough to be known in Iowa.
College Freshman,4,"Lots of room 

Great room mates 

Understandable Residence assistants 

Durable furniture"
College Freshman,4,They provided you with everything needed to succeed you just need to put it together
College Freshman,4,It's a really great school you won't get home sick very often and you get the attention especially for your major right away.
College Sophomore,4,"The small campus allows everyone to know everybody. Some people may see this as a bad thing, but I really enjoyed it. At Clarke, it seems like everyone is a part of a big family."
College Freshman,4,Music department has advanced electronics that will help me with assignments that would be given to me in school. Lacrosse program is starting and I am going to be a part of Clarke's first women's lacrosse team.
College Freshman,4,I think that Health services are great on campus and the security is great because they are always around and willing to help you with whatever you may need
College Freshman,4,The food off campus sometimes makes me miss home because it is so good
College Freshman,4,I think that housing on campus is great I do not think that there is a worst option. I think that there is so much to do and everything i great because everyone is very open about about communication.
College Junior,4,I don't live in dorms because I have kids but my peers seem to love it.
College Junior,4,I think the environment here is safe. So actually I do not pay more attention on the issues above.
College Junior,4,The university often holds the parties to create the opportunity for students to meet each other.

College Junior,4,Actually I live out of campus so I do not know the details of the dorms.

My university holds a lot of parties to welcome the new students."
College Junior,4,The school will makes sure you have a job.
College Junior,4,"School fits my needs, provides safe environment."
College Junior,4,Professors are interested in students as individuals.
College Junior,4,Well rounded liberal arts program makes any B.A. Program useful.
College Junior,4,"Dubuque is a small Midwestern city.  There a lot of perks that larger cities have, shopping, culture, and food.  It is a lot safer than a big city though."
College Junior,4,The size of the city and campus keeps crime to minimum.  The campus is generally safe.
College Sophomore,4,I would do it again just to learn more. But finding a job in my field can be hard as most of it would be freelance work.
College Sophomore,4,I have not had an internship yet but there are many options to look into.
College Sophomore,4,There are many great opportunities on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Student life is great, we have the Lion's Den which there is pool and air hockey and even an xbox."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are great, everyone respects one another and I never seen any fights happen."
College Sophomore,4,Social work has a very small class size. It is good because the teachers get to know you on a very personal level.
College Sophomore,2,We do not have Greek like or fraternities at my school. It is a small Catholic college that does not partake in sororities or fraternities
College Junior,2,Many students transfer because of the cost and they can't keep up with program demands while working to pay for school.
College Junior,2,If I could transfer I would.
College Junior,2,Not very understanding when bad things happen. counseling center did not return calls to set up appointments. some teachers require online submission of homework and the systems is often down but teacher still doc your grade for late submission.
College Junior,2,There are very few choices for second degree students who return to get a teaching license.
College Junior,2,"The school is too small to have the number of athletic teams it has.  If it had less teams, more people would rally behind them."
College Sophomore,2,There aren't any off campus housing help that I am aware of.
College Sophomore,2,You will take about an hour to get to walmart when driving only takes 10 minutes.
College Sophomore,2,"There really isn't much for transportation to and from campus. A lot of student live on campus and if they want to take the JULE they can, but i don't know how often it goes by campus."
College Sophomore,2,It is all fast-food. It you want to go to a restaurant its pretty expensive.
College Junior,2,There really isn't much diversity on campus.
College Junior,2,"Peer Pressure – The problem with a small school in a small town is that most people have nothing better to do than drink alcohol. If you don't drink at Clarke, you might not feel like you fit in since that's what everybody spends their free time doing."
College Junior,2,At this school you will really need to get your own car. there is not much more options for transportation but since the school is so small that is all you really need
College Freshman,2,"Get Hear Early to Park – If you want to  get to class on time you better get here super early to get a spot. the spots are small and hard to squeez into so you have to be a good parker, and be fearful for people parking around you who arent good parkers."
College Freshman,2,"They do not have very many sports teams at clark just basketball and baseball really that i have heard of. some more options like a swim team, tennis team, dance team, and cheerleading would be nice"
Sophomore,1,"I would NEVER tell anyone to attend this college. 
The tuition inflates, professors don't think of students & do not deliver material in a beneficial manner, & Clarke preaches small class sizes but many of the classes in the medical field add up to more than 80. They tell you that your class sizes will not exceed 12, but in my last semester at Clarke I was in Anatomy and Physiology every MWF with 85+ students. The professor didn't know names, you were a number, & you didn't get the 1 on 1 attention you needed during an intense class.
When choosing Clarke I was under the impression that students had a large impact on campus, but once there I was mistaken.
The nursing department is ranked highly, but I do not see it being ANYTHING that the professors do. It is nearly impossible to get any nursing professor to help you understand material, prepare for an exam, or do well in their class.
Clarke was overall a waste of time & money."
College Junior,1,We do not have Greek life at our school so I cannot answer this question.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek life.
College Junior,1,Parking is expensive and limited!! The campus is bigger than wha people expect!
College Freshman,1,"There are very few parties. If you want a big party school, this is not the place."
College Junior,1,There is no Greek life at all at Clarke. The only thing like Greek life would be the sports teams are like families and there own Greek life.
College Junior,1,You can never find a good parking spot until about after 4:00 pm.
College Sophomore,1,"Not Enough Space – A lot of the times parking at Clarke reminds me of days at Six Flags... There is so many commuter students and not enough parking on campus, also, the city of Dubuque wont let students keep there cars on the streets over night because of snow fall, even in the spring/summer."
College Sophomore,1,"If there is any Greek life on campus, I am not aware of it. I live off campus, so I don't participate in many of the social happenings at Clarke"
College Junior,1,"Teacher's Strictness - Attendance Policy – Teachers are Clarke are very very strict. The attendance policy is insane. If you're going to attend Clarke, you must make sure that you go to every class, or your final grade will definitely be affected."

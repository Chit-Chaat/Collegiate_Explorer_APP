Junior,5,"I like the SACN open door policy for all the staff. Most importantly, I love how every professor is always available for you whenever you need help. Adviser's are great!"
Niche User,5,Good value for the money spent on tuition.   All my dealings whether in person or over the phone were very pleasant.  The faculty and advisors had a genuine connection with the community and the campus.
College Sophomore,5,"Caring, instills hard working caring values, best school ever, some of the most awesome nurses in the country."
College Sophomore,5,I will be attending in fall and I'm very excited
Junior,4,"SACN is a very small school, so the one-on-one time with instructors is invaluable. The program's curriculum is challenging, but it prepares you very well to pass the NCLEX by the time you make it to graduation. I would recommend SACN to anyone who is looking for quality education in nursing."
College Senior,4,"There's a lot to choose from, but the same crowds all the time."
College Senior,4,Tons of options to choose from surrounding campus.
College Senior,4,This is not a program for those looking to slack off. It is a hard focused program to give you the best opportunities possible for a career in nursing.
College Senior,4,Although it is a catholic institution they are very accommodating to all
College Senior,4,The campus is part of the hospital and under hospital security. I never feel unsafe.
College Senior,4,They have a great advisor that helps you through the process making less painful
College Senior,4,It's the hospital cafeteria or the java city coffee shop. They are both great and open all the time.
College Senior,4,Plenty of internships available and extra opportunities for experience.
College Senior,4,"Workload is brutal, but hospitals are jumping to hire the new grads so I think it's worth it."
College Sophomore,4,I've seen all races and have heard of several different religions. I'm not sure on sexual orientation as I don't know that many people that well
College Senior,2,Don't have athletics. Just access to the hospitals gym facility.
College Senior,2,I am currently living off campus and I think that they should offer more help  for single mothers with small children.
College Sophomore,2,"I feel like the only ones who seem to get any help are lower income. Other than federal loans, I never seem to qualify for any scholarships"
College Sophomore,2,"It is a nursing school,  there is no athletics here"
Niche User,1,"I thought it was strange that there were 5 books on 'how to handle stress' reccomened on the book list my fist semester...but it became evident very quickly. First semester was brutal. People were having nervous breakdowns all around me, quite literally. One man, sitting next to me, would scream, moan and thrash around in his seat during tests and several others would cry and run from the room. One student even had a cardiac episode and was taken away by ambulance. Tests were not over material covered, the program was extremely unorganized and the syllabus was incomplete regarding test days, times and material covered. Many of us relied on FB to hear about test days and times. By the end of the semester over 90% of the class was failing. Points, all of a sudden, were added to some students overall test scores so they passed. Many of us dropped out. Two semesters later I learned the president was let go. If anyone knows of a class action against the school..."
College Sophomore,1,once again a nursing college
College Sophomore,1,this is a nursing college.... do not have sports or sport teams

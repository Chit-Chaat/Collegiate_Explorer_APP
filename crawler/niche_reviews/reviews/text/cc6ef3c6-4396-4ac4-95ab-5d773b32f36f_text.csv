Sophomore,5,I personal don't take any classes online.  but starting November  after thanksgiving i will. Last spring before the COVID19 we were online it was kind of hard. the teacher were adjusting to work with computer and use zoom. and post assignment  it took longer to grade.
Sophomore,5,"great school.
I been at this school for two years , going for the Nursing program. the school may be big but the classes are very small. teachers are always there to help students pass and you can set up an office hour with them. 

the teachers are very hands on with the student. 

lots of one on one with student when it comes to advisers."
Senior,5,Such a great and supportive university! Thankful I chose this university to prepare me for my future career.
Sophomore,5,"It is a small school, but the potential is there. You have amazing teachers and you get to have that one on one connection."
Sophomore,5,They are well trained on being online. There are minor bumps in the road but the connection isn't always strong. But the educators know how to connect with the students if something goes wrong.
Niche User,5,Everyone is welcoming and ready to help when needed. The staff is friendly and typically replies fast.
Graduate Student,5,I am so happy with my school. The professors are knowledgeable and accessible; they know me when the see me in the hallway. The academics are challenging. I’m making some good friends and contacts for the future.
Freshman,5,Cardinal Stritch is a fantastic and welcoming place. The professors honestly care about you. The students already there enjoy inviting people in. There are many things to do while your there to relax and have fun. There is a lot of multi cultural programs that bring in different cultures to learn about them and experience them. I would recommend this college to anybody who wants a good start in adult life.
Freshman,5,Everyone here is helpful. Professors are extremely flexible with your schedule. Tutoring is amazing. Tutors really help you out with anything that concerns you. There's great opportunities for students to get involved in campus. This school is diverse and there's no segregation. We welcome all end every person.
Senior,5,I am a Senior at Stritch. I have throughly enjoyed my time in the Nursing Program. They really do help you succeed at Stritch!
Graduate Student,5,"The professors are interesting, fair, and brilliant.  I also love the Franciscan atmosphere.   There are Franciscan-oriented extracurricular programs and beautiful artwork of St. Francis of Assisi.  The Franciscan spirit is tangible on this campus, and I truly appreciate this.   The coursework is challenging and brings enlightenment and much growth.   The campus has a very diverse population and is a true representation of Milwaukee and our surrounding communities.  The campus is easy to navigate and parking is ample at any time of day or night.  It is a campus that feels safe; it's quiet, conducive to contemplation, conversation, and study."
Freshman,5,"I am a transfer student, so I already have some experience on a college campus. Compared to my previous school, this campus is a lot better. The classes do a much better job of combining information previously learned with new information. The teachers are also much more likable. The food is also incredible. The french toast in the morning is delicious."
Sophomore,5,My experience as an Elementary educator has been that I have already been experiencing teaching in a classroom as a freshman! I really enjoy it and I know it is what I desire to do. Stritch is a great school and I love their education program.
Freshman,5,"This university is an amazing place of learning. Not only do all the professors and staff try their best to make sure you’re getting all the education you need, but they make sure you’re comfortable in the learning environment. The professors learn their students names and learning styles and try their hardest to work with them so they can learn the way that they need to."
Sophomore,5,"cardinal Stritch university has taught me so many things. it is a diverse multicultural university or rather should i say a community because we all are like family. everyone is welcome and accepted. when it comes to academics, both students and staff are well prepared. socially, it is a great place to get involved and engaged. i would not want to see anything change. everyone is amazing as they are all willing to help and assist in anyway. we have free student tutoring where the tutors are our peers and it enables us to communicate freely with one another. we have peer advisers, admission counselors, advising counselors and so many others who are willing to help at any time. cardinal Stritch university is a home away from home."
Junior,5,"Cardinal Stritch University is a very diverse, liberal arts campus. Students learn through a variety of ways. While the extracurricular activities may not be common place, Cardinal Stritch University focuses on making the best of the academic programs."
Senior,5,I am an international and transfer student at Cardinal Stritch University so I had experiences in another school as well which is good because this way I have something to compare it to. I love that it is a small and private university with so much focus on students. It is hard to slack out in classes because the teacher can easily keep an eye on you which forces students to do good in classes. What I have changed is the food. My lifestyle and healthy food is important to me as a student-athlete but here healthy means expensive. The food that is easily accessible and cheap is really bad quality. I would definitely change that here at Cardinal Stritch.
Graduate Student,5,Cardinal Stritch cares about the students and are very personable. The student advisors are very attentive along with faculties.
Graduate Student,5,"This college was easy to attend while working full time. The BSRT-C degree is a two year degree that is designed for the full time working individual while attending school online. It is not easy, but if you put in the effort and time needed it is obtainable."
Sophomore,5,It’s my first semester and I everything went smooth for me. I really liked how there is so many available labs for computer use or space. Something I don’t like is how they don’t have a winter graduation commencement.
Junior,5,good  private school that really cares for your dream and will do almost everything to help you reach your dream
Senior,5,I have had the best experience from Stritch. My advisor is a true angel. She has been so helpful and welcoming during my transition back to school. The staff and administration truly care about the students and their success.
College Sophomore,5,Again this school is just so awesome because it is small and small schools are perfect for me. Also they different classes they have to chose from allow me to be able to see what it is I really am the most interested in. Combine all that with advisers that really want to see you do well in life. Its just a really welcoming environment and you will not want to leave.
College Sophomore,5,We are a private school and even though I hate how they have to check people in the way they do even though they go to the school. I feel all that they do is highly necessary to keeping our campus safe. It is always good to keep a count on who is all in our school at all times no matter how close they may be to someone.
College Sophomore,5,I personally enjoy being in an environment where I do not have to sit in a class with over 50 plus students. This is the main reason I chose Cardinal Stritch. The teachers here are actually able to respond and work with any student one on one when students need help. To me this is something that most public colleges are not able to offer students. Then when some students start falling behind they usually tend to give up and stop trying in school.
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely loved all of the classes I have taken so far. The professors are dedicated and care about their students. There are diverse classes and anyone can find something they love
College Sophomore,5,"I can't see myself anywhere besides Stritch. It has become my home and the people there are my family. I'm learning more than I ever thought possible, but not just about my majors and minors, but myself and the world as well. Stritch is the best place for me. My favorite part of Stritch is the community aspect of it. As I said, it's home and they have become a family to me."
Recent Alumnus,5,So far it's been great
College Freshman,5,"I am a Pd.D student.  The courses at this level are up-to-par for a doctorate.  A lot of work and research is necessary at this level.  If you are committed to this work, you will work through obstacles for success.  I am thankful for the courses I have.  I am also thankful for the professors as well as they are all doctorates and have first-hand experience regarding the level of commitment that is needed for this level."
College Freshman,5,I will be in a higher education roll as a direct result of my Ph.D. in Higher Education Leadership.
College Freshman,5,"I was initially impressed with the level of professionalism and customer service interacting with my graduate admissions counselor.  She was very knowledgeable, and when she was unsure of an answer, she remained composed and did not appear or sound incompetent.  She would find the answer then contact me with that information.  The Chair of the department was kind, engaging, and truly cares about students' success.  I am fully impressed with the level of professionalism with my school."
College Freshman,5,Professors are extremely helpful when it comes to homework. Great environment to be with many awesome people. Classes are small and not overcrowded.
College Junior,5,My school wants a safe and healthy community. I think that the level of strictness they have isn't overbearing. The level of strictness is just a measure of safety and equality for all.
College Junior,5,My best tip is to talk to your financial aid counselor early on in your college years. I did not really know about scholarships like the one I'm applying for until going into my senior year.
College Junior,5,"There is a good day to day variety. I like that they give out a frequency card to commuters who do not have a meal plan. Eventually, I get a free meal in the cafeteria. The staff is overwhelmingly nice and helpful every time I vist the Union or cafeteria."
College Sophomore,5,"Teachers are very invested in individual student's success. If a student looks upset, they will even talk about it with the student or offer counseling services available."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is located in a very nice part of town (Bayshore area).  In area there is a outdoor mall along with some other nice businesses such a banks, grocery stores, recreational parks and very nice homes.  The scenery is very nice and the area is beautiful at this with the change in season (fall).  I can certainly see me living in this area should I ever decide to move from my current resident."
College Sophomore,5,"Athletics are seemingly a very important part of the campus.  I notice a lot of students participate in the programs, and when they are having games, the campus is filled with so many people, and the atmosphere is very electric.  The parking lot are very full and on those days it's very difficult to find a park to close the building I go into."
College Senior,5,It is located in Milwaukee. The options could not be more vast.
Recent Alumnus,5,I appreciate our town and school
Recent Alumnus,5,A very positive & family oriented atmosphere
Recent Alumnus,5,Awesome variety for all ethnic groups of people
Recent Alumnus,5,Campus police are seriously involved in our environment
College Sophomore,5,The small class sizes allow for more personalized attention from the instructor.
College Sophomore,5,All of my teachers have been very helpful and very friendly. I have yet to have a teacher thats boring and makes you fall asleep. The teachers at stritch are one of a kind.
College Sophomore,5,Campus is very safe and theres nothing to worry about.
College Junior,5,I would suggest seeking more scholarships and grants
College Junior,5,"it is offered in a safe and vibrant environment conducive to learning, the students have access to everything"
College Junior,5,"I would have more money for education, it can be costly, I plan to continue my career as a teacher, concerns would be having enough money to finish"
College Junior,5,"A person can work and learn experience at the same time, some are paid"
College Junior,5,"Cardinal Stritch is a wonderful place to learn and grow, you will meet many people from all walks of life, and ethnic backgrounds the atmosphere is loving and the school has mentors and teachers that want to help students succeed and receive the highest quality education then graduate and use it to help enhance the community"
College Junior,5,"The campuses are near shopping centers, and students are encouraged to visit shops and businesses located in the community"
College Junior,5,"All are respected and welcomed, as well as valued"
College Junior,5,The campus is located in an area where there are many dining choices and are affordable.
College Junior,5,"Cardinal Stritch has an excellent curriculum, and qualified well educated instructors."
College Junior,5,"I love Cardinal Stritch the facilities are always clean and well maintained. The program and workload is challenging, but I feel as if I am learning all their is to learn. The advisor communicates with students about job offerings and internships."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone was friendly and counselors know you by name.
College Freshman,5,"The campus is on a bus line, there is not a lot of traffic going in or out of the area, there is a highway right next to the campus for ease to get there."
College Freshman,5,I feel very secure when I am on campus.
College Freshman,5,We have the best technology on campus.
Sophomore,4,"A great school if you work well in small classes with a small environment. However, student life isn’t the best unless you live on campus but even then, there’s not much to do."
Senior,4,I took a few online courses in the past. Professors are flexible and always willing to help. There are many resources to assist students.
Junior,4,"All of the teachers, tutors and advisors are overall incredibly helpful. They always listen whenever any students have any questions, and are always willing to set up meetings whenever we need more help. The campus layout is easy to remember, and there are plenty of quiet places for you to go to and study for upcoming exams.  Everyone will always keep you motivated to keep trying your best and will never give up on a student. All of the other students are respectful with one another, and there has never been any fights on campus during my time there. It is an overall very comfortable place to be and is very easy to adapt."
Junior,4,"The instructions are overall easy to follow, and teachers are always willing to answer questions online through email or phone calls. Any time I had a question about any of the online assignments, they would always give me a clear answer. My tutor would help me with many of my writing assignments by reviewing it and giving me some feedback on what I can add or change. It was an overall a decent experience. There were some problems I had with my online experience. These are mostly personal problems because I strongly prefer to be at school physically so I can listen to all the instructions and being able to ask questions easier. It is a lot harder to keep track of multiple classes and assignments online than it is to being able to be there physically and have a much better understanding on what you need to do for every assignment."
Freshman,4,I enjoy the small classes and personal communication with professors and the ability to work with other students in clubs and events for the school itself. It is a fun and well rounded community and everyone is generally pleasant to be around.
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed all of the courses and the curriculum.  I have attended the school my entire academic career and it has been very beneficial to my growth and preparation for my career goals.  When I attend classes or going to work in the labs, it is a great environment to be in at all times."
Senior,4,"Cardinal Stritch University has a small home-town type of vibe. The class sizes are small which makes it easy to get to know your classmates and professors. The campus is beautiful with lots of grounds to walk on a sunny day. The school is clean and safe and there are many great places to study. The only recommendation I would make is that some of the equipment could be improved. New white dry erase boards are needed as well as some updates to the electrical outlets and plugs. Overall I would recommend Cardinal Stritch University, I was very happy I chose this college to complete my BSN-RN."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy  seeing the diversity in the school and that makes me feel more comfortable since I come from a city of diversity. Having different people that come from different backgrounds makes me feel like I am not so different from them and we have more things in common. I also like that the school has many resources for nursing students to help them succeed in school. I went for a tour this week and they have a big library, free tutors and professors that care for you and want you to succeed."
Senior,4,"Cardinal Stritch is a very good college to get a degree at,the classes are small so you get the attention you need to succeed.Im so close to getting my degree but I ran out of financial aid and it's making it really hard for me to finish what I started."
Senior,4,I love the small class sizes and the hands on experiences. The professors actually care about academic growth. The campus is small so it is very easy to get around. I love my school.
Sophomore,4,"Cardinal Stritch University has given me the opportunity to continue with my studies. It provides resources that allow us to get the help we need such as tutoring. I am currently a nursing major at this university and this program has taught me a lot in order to be a successful nurse in the future. My overall experience has been amazing, I was able to meet new friends and professors that have guided me to success."
Alum,4,"Small liberal arts college located just north of Milwaukee, WI with a small campus that has a great sense of community. With nearly all of the buildings connected (including dorms- YES!), winters were bareable and rolling out of bed in shorts to class was very easy. Dining options are slim, and facilities could use major updates. Sporting events were often held off campus due to lack of facilities. Teachers and advisors truly wanted to see students succeed in studies, faith, and life beyond college. Small class sizes was great for a learning atmosphere; however, not many offerings per course (usually 1-2 options). Party scene included going downtown every weekend. The dorm options were either a single/double in the building connected to the rest of the school or a separate building on campus with multiple living arrangement options. Dorms could use some updating. Apartment complexes all around the school allowed for students to live off campus after first year."
Sophomore,4,"I love the diversity of students at Cardinal Stritch University, diversity brings life to campus. The Stritch community is extremely friendly and they always make me feel welcome, which is important to me because I am an international student. I love the environment and location of the school, I get both the taste of the natural and city side. The Cardinal Stritch University community promotes a great environment for learning and a place to help one achieve ones goal."
Freshman,4,"Very good school, gives a family feel. Very small classes which gives you a chance to connect with your teachers."
Freshman,4,"I'm a nursing student at Cardinal Stritch University and it's been a great ride so far! There is no petitioning for the nursing program which is great. The classes are small. The people and professors are friendly and helpful. Although the tuition is about $28,000 a year, it's pretty affordable after all the loans and scholarships given as well."
Sophomore,4,I do enjoy the school at cardinal stritch. I think most of their staff go above and beyond to ensure each student will be successful in their courses. I have nothing but good things to say about the nursing program there.
Junior,4,I like the family culture. I love that the class sizes are small and their are lots of resources that are and becoming available for students for success.
Senior,4,"I transferred into Cardinal Stritch as a second semester freshman. I was accepted into the four year nursing program.  Overall the program has met my expectations.  The professors are knowledgable, the clinical experiences were excellent, and the program has unique classes such as Healthcare Economics which will no doubt be helpful in the future.  The campus atmosphere fosters a sense of community, diversity, and spirituality, not to mention the newer additions are beautiful.  I feel supported in my beliefs and values on a daily basis by my classmates, faculty, and the overall student body.  The only changes I would like to see would be an expanded parking structure and a more state of the art nursing lab where students may practice their skills in a more safe and controlled environment.  In the future, when I am further in my career, I would love to make a generous contribution to the program in order to see the necessary updates Cardinal Stritch deserves."
Junior,4,"Great campus but the athletic trainers are terrible. The campus food is always good. Campus life is terrible, the dorms are tiny, the professors are rude. Athletics involves a lot of favoritism. i know this because i played soccer there."
Freshman,4,Cardinal Stritch is a small community of professors that want to see you grow. You go into the class and you can expect the professor to know your name. Everyone is so willing to help you out and make sure you are on the path to success.
Freshman,4,CAU has a very friendly environment.  It's easy to make friends here and the professors are always willing to help you.  CAU is relatively small but that's what makes the environment friendly.
College Sophomore,4,We have a lot of people working at the career services so I know I could go there if I ever need help.
College Sophomore,4,I like that classes are small so I have a relationship with my professor instead of just being another number.
College Sophomore,4,We have security on campus at all times and doors that lock and cannot be opened to the general public so that makes me feel safe.
College Sophomore,4,"As an RA I would like to think that Residence Life is going very well. Although our Residence Halls are over 100 years old, they are in good shape and definitely do the job. Everyone is very welcoming and it really does feel like a second home."
College Sophomore,4,It's not much crime on our campus because the help of security.
College Junior,4,Small campus and everyone knows everyone.
College Sophomore,4,"It's an extremely peaceful community. We have campus security, but it's really a safe location. Campus is well taken care of."
College Junior,4,"Most students are envolved with sports on campus. And when students in sports have to miss some classes, the professors are understanding and try to work something out with those students.  Fan support is great and so is our school spirit. Everyone for the most part likes to be envolved."
College Junior,4,"I chose Cardinal Stritch University because it was a smaller school. And because it is smaller, professors are able to focus more on students and help them more outside of class if needed. This university is also very welcoming and friendly. I feel very comfortable here. There is many clubs and organizations to join as well. For a semester, I was in a program called urban fellows, which was work study. I was placed at a day care center and that was a great experience for me because I want to be a teacher."
College Sophomore,4,Being able to graduate and say your degree is from cardinal stritch has so much weight behind it. It makes you want to push yourself just that much more because it is something that you really want.
College Sophomore,4,"The freshmen dorms are old. This means that there is no AC at all and at the start of the year it is always hot becuase it is the end of summer. Not only do we have to contest with the heat, but there is also some pretty ridicules rules such as even though you go to the school you must always give your id to check in. Then you have to be out by 11 pm on weekdays and 2 am on weekends."
College Sophomore,4,The involvement of the teams and others who are not on teams is great. The main problem though is when freshmen come in and they are not use to talking to a bunch of new people. These people on the sports teams are the ones you see only eating with their team and only talking to their team. Thankfully though this is why being in a small school is perfect. Since you are pretty much guaranteed to see the same people on the daily. It becomes very easy to break down the walls some people try and build around themselves.
College Senior,4,"I would choose a larger school if I had to do it all over again; however, I think the small class sizes are a large part of my success."
College Senior,4,Many recruters love having employees from CSU.
College Senior,4,I feel blessed to be at Cardinal Stritch. The support system is awesome gearing you towards success.
College Freshman,4,Teachers are so confident in their students and they help us out as much as they can.
College Sophomore,4,"There's counseling available and sexual assault isn't a problem on campus, or at least not as big of one as on other campuses."
College Sophomore,4,"The social aspect of living on campus is the most important part and the dorms are great for that. Also, residence life provides a lot of opportunities to get off of campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I love going to sporting events on campus. The men's volleyball games are my favorite. Students always go, however the student section is always composed of the same people. The coolest part about it is that we had a Stritch Service Day and all the athletes participated!"
College Freshman,4,"The school hosts job fairs at least twice a year.  There is a good internship program person to help students out if needed.  As always, the advising department is great and can point a student in the right direction for anything that they may need that is job related."
College Freshman,4,"The classes are about 20 students to one teacher.  The teachers are very knowledgeable in their fields.  Some teachers of course are more passionate than others, which has made some classes very interesting to attend."
College Freshman,4,It is a small school and everyone seems to know everyone.  I enjoy the teachers and the education I am receiving.
College Freshman,4,"It seems that athletics are an important part of this school, especially soccer and volleyball."
College Freshman,4,Feel safe inside and out
College Freshman,4,Half of my classes are athletes
College Freshman,4,"As a small college with in good quiet area, sometimes police comes to check if everything is alright."
College Freshman,4,"Deciding in your major and clubs, advisors and counselors helps you choose internships,and even jobs related in your major."
College Freshman,4,Cardinal Stritch University provides great environment to everyone! Professors care about the students to achieve and focus in class!
College Junior,4,"Personally am not involved in the sports, but from what I saw they had good turn outs."
College Sophomore,4,I think it is a good school to go to if you want to get a good education but also have fun with all the extra events the school puts on.  It has been a good experience for me so far.
College Junior,4,"Overall, I enjoy the college. I have some very good professors and some that are not. But the majority of people here are kind and helpful. They really instill the act of kindness and compassion into every person."
College Junior,4,"The campus is strict because it follows catholic practices. Therefore, it is pretty safe."
College Sophomore,4,"With Bayshore Mall, there are a lot of options in the food court, and it is only a five minute bus ride away. Jimmy Johns delivers, and there is a Pick 'N Save a ten minute walk away for fresh options."
College Sophomore,4,"Good financial aid, great sense of community because it's a small school, food is not good, good location in safe area"
College Sophomore,4,"The students I have observed on the campus are very athletic, attractive and vibrant people.  They seem very open and courteous in their interactions.   I have not had a moment where I've been offended or bothered by their actions.  I enjoy the campus environment I walk into on a weekly basis."
College Senior,4,"Milwaukee provides endless things to do: night life, day time activites, ect but campus relies on that and doesn't offer much there."
College Senior,4,"I am in the excelled online program.  Very fast. Very intense. Enjoy it, but very time consuming and would not be for everyone."
College Senior,4,Value to get a degree here.
College Senior,4,All very high ethical standards.
Freshman,2,"this is not what I expect when I hear the college experience, if you like a super small school then this is great for you but if not definitely don’t go. Also a super cliquey school, athletes and mom athletes do not really associate"
College Sophomore,2,"As a student athlete, I have experienced what Cardinal Stritch has to offer regarding athletics. Although the coaching is great and I love my teammates, we do not get any support from anyone on campus. People often do not even know when we have a race coming up. The school spirit is not encouraging on this college campus."
College Senior,2,"Our school has the talent, but lacks the money and resources for better facilities. Better facilities would help with increased fan support and school spirit."
College Sophomore,2,"We only have one fraternity on campus, Kappa Sigma, and they aren't a national chapter yet. They have only been on campus for about three years I believe and it's slow going since the school itself is so small. There is one sorority but it is a local sorority because the school is not recognized by Pan Ho yet but the girls are working on it."
College Freshman,2,No social ones only educational
College Senior,2,"I'm finishing my capstone, and we were only given 10 weeks to write it, with high weekly expectations.  It seems that the instructors do not have the freedom to be creative and actually teach, but more that the curriculum is assigned and they must comply.  The college of business does not seem to care about the students.  In general, the school itself is missing the respect other schools have for their students.  They do not provide the information online my previous school did.  It feels they just want us to pay tuition and increase school stats.  The school could care less about how much I actually learn, whether I am enjoying my courses, or if my teachers are actually teaching anything.  They are just trying to push us through the program as quickly as possible."
College Senior,2,Not great. Lower quality than where I received my undergraduate degree. I chose this school for the flexible classes.
College Senior,2,"Some are good, some are bad, and a couple are awful.  Not cruel or mean, but just disconnected.  I feel that they are not very involved, in general."
College Senior,2,"They just want you to sign on, and they hound you for it pretty bad."
College Sophomore,2,From what I know (I don't party) most people go off campus to party.
College Senior,2,"Campus housing is tight, overpriced, dirty, and has very few amenities, options, and utilities."
College Senior,2,I would not choose it.  Very expensive and very little help with classes.
College Sophomore,2,Very boring and located in a neighorhood full of old people. There is nothing fun or cool about where Cardinal Stritch is located.
College Sophomore,2,Not much nightlife around considering stritch is like in the middle of nowhere. UWM is pretty close by if you wanna drive to the nightlife over there.
College Sophomore,2,"The weightroom, gym, and locker rooms are very small. There is nothing modern about the athletic facilities, the equipment and style of everything is old. For a school that does alot of recruiting of athletes its a shame the facilities suck. The soccer team doesnt even have their own field for games which is a big drag for anyone looking to play soccer at Stritch. The library and computer labs are great though, great computers and quiet stations to do homework."
College Junior,2,Weather can be harsh in the winter months
College Junior,2,Too many car break-ins in just 6months
College Sophomore,2,There is no nightlife on campus but is it very helpful to concentrate on homework.
College Sophomore,2,"Hardly any house parties, just dorm parties at best. However, UWM is only a bus trip away. "
College Sophomore,2,I don't know of any greek life going on at all.
Senior,1,"Pros: The student activities department puts on lots of cool events and you can get free stuff at a lot of them. You'll never have an issue finding parking.
Cons: This school is not preparing students to be competitive job applicants. For example, nursing is the most popular degree here, but there is a very low rate of people passing the nursing exam you have to take to be certified. A lot of positions have been cut (making more work for others). The dorms are gross, with trash all over the halls and dated/broken items and shopping carts throughout. Most people leave during the weekends. Food is ok. We are known as a safe campus, but that's because most students are commuters and there are very few students to begin with.
Take your money elsewhere for a better experience and education."
Niche User,1,Staff was unhelpful in helping me become a transfer student at Stritch. Process took too long get going and forced me to sign up for classes late. Attended a few classes and decided to drop so I didn't have to deal with them anymore. I got yelled at a few times on the phone for not understanding how their processes work. They talk you in circles and push you off onto someone else. Honestly the worst experience I have had with a college. Going back to my public-technical college was the best decision I made. I suggest you take your money somewhere else.
Senior,1,"I attended CSU for 3 and a 1/2 years before transferring schools. With each year that passed my overall opinion of the school decreased. I absolutely loved their writing program while I was a writing major, but once I switched to nursing I knew for a fact that I had to switch schools to be most successful in my major and my career. The nursing program was very laxidasical and many of the students who were going to be going to clinicals didn't feel ready even after completing the necessary classes. The nursing teachers didn’t seem to care about whether or not you passed, more so they just seemed as if they wanted their paycheck and wanted to get out. I had to do what was best for me and my career, and so I transferred."
Recent Alumnus,1,No Greek life-would love to pledge
College Senior,1,"Not great.  It is online courses, and many of the teachers are slow to reply, don't answer your questions, or don't know the answer.  It is obvious that the coursework is established by the school rather than the professor.  There are some good professors, but you can barely tell because the school is so poorly managed.  Some weeks are overloaded, while others are okay.  The materials chosen could be better."
College Senior,1,"I regret going here.  The flexible classes for my graduate degree were too tempting..... But I wish I would have waited and gone to a better school.  I feel that I wasted my money, especially with the price of the graduate credits.  I do not feel I received a quality education."
College Senior,1,"I had an online class where the teacher was absent and did not reply for 5 weeks of a 6 week course.  I contacted the dean, along with my cohorts.  We were all denied a refund for our self-taught, overpriced class because we were able to pass.  When the students turn in homework and the teacher is gone with no sub for 90% of the class, I highly doubt she is going to give people poor grades (if she even looked at everyone's homework).  In addition, why should we pay full tuition for a professor that didn't show? Disgusting. It just proves administration cares more about $ than students."
College Senior,1,"Awful.  The school is extremely disorganized, and way behind in technology. My aid is more so than not delayed, and they do not provide students with updates or information.  You cannot see much online, and it takes them months to process anything.  you can talk to someone in the financial aid office, and they know nothing, they will tell you to contact the business office where no one ever answers the phone.  It won't matter, cause only one person has your information and no one can get ahold of them.  I am embarrassed to be getting an MBA from a school that cannot manage themselves or student finances.  The worst part? They recently got rid of direct deposit and have gone back to mailing all refunds as paper checks.  Yeah, talk about behind in technology."
College Sophomore,1,"There are no truly fresh options, leftovers are over-utilized, extremely over priced for the quality, we are only able to use our swipes during certain times of the day - if we don't use them during that time period we lose our swipe, the dining hall food is almost always unappealing, union food tastes decent, but is way too greasy"
College Junior,1,"There's really nothing ever going on on campus, if you want a party you have to turn to student's that know students from nearby schools."
College Sophomore,1,We have no fraternities or sororities.
College Sophomore,1,"Very small weightroom, gym, and locker rooms. Im an athlete and I have a membership at local gym because the one at stritch is way too small and awful. The guys locker room is tiny and gets very crowded with a few people. The soccer team does not have a field to practice and play on for home games, making them and supporters travel far to random fields in the city. Being an athlete at Cardinal Stritch is pretty bad. Everything seems to be low budget and work with what you got type school."
College Senior,1,It's kind of insane. The attendance policy is very strict- unless you're a student athlete.
College Sophomore,1,I could use some grants right about now!
College Sophomore,1,Our campus isn't part of the student life on main campus.
College Sophomore,1,No partying going we got families to attend to.
College Sophomore,1,Cold and dark night makes not motivated to come.
Recent Alumnus,1,There are 2 places to eat on campus. Both very mediocre and nothing special. Also they are only open at certain times so it can be hard in between classes.
Recent Alumnus,1,"It is barely present. A few fraternities, but they are mostly geared for minority students, and they don't have their own houses."
College Sophomore,1,The resident hall policy does not allow opposite gender overnight guests. Students should be allowed to check in who they want over night.

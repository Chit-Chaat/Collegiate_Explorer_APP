Freshman,5,"although its online this year, it been great and the people and professors i've met are all so nice and patient."
Freshman,5,its really amazing how understanding the professors at cpp are. they understand how tough it is especially at a time like this. the people in my class are also all so nice and are willing to help other students who don't understand something.
Alum,5,Before COVID-19 I had many online classes in previous semesters. All were very organized and positively impacted my academic experience at CalPoly. Many of my in-class professors were able to adjust well to virtual learning when we had to go remote.
Alum,5,"CalPoly was a excellent college to do my undergraduate studies! Campus culture is very positive and diverse. Since it is a commuter school less students live on campus than at a larger university, but campus life still thrives. ASI at CalPoly does a great job getting all students involved on campus and updated on news around campus."
Freshman,5,Amazing school! Very accepting of all walks of life. Extremely affordable compared to other schools.  The Health and Wellness Center is amazing. There's a lot of other resources available to students to help them get better grades and make college life easier for them.
Freshman,5,"At first, the online school was very difficult as many of the teachers had no idea what to expect. NOw that they do, it seems to be moving much easier."
Sophomore,5,Cal Poly Pomona has one of the best Hospitality programs here. The college is well funded and cares about your education.
Graduate Student,5,"During my undergraduate experience, I took a few online classes. These online classes were immersive, because the professors took multiple approaches to teaching. For example, there would be live video chats, challenging essays, and different forms of assessments to ensure that students were retaining and comprehending the material. I felt that my professors truly put in effort to make the online learning experience a positive one. This approaching school year (2020/2021), I will be taking all online classes, due to the circumstances with Covid-19. Therefore, I am confident that I will continue to have a positive learning experience with Cal Poly Pomona."
Graduate Student,5,"Cal Poly Pomona is a university that truly lives up to its motto: ""Learn By Doing"". During my undergraduate experience, I was able to learn through hands-on experiences and engage in critical thinking. Because of my undergraduate experience, I was well-equipped with the tools necessary to pursue graduate school directly after receiving my B.A. I would recommend an education at Cal Poly Pomona to anyone looking to gain a well-rounded approach to learning, or to grow professionally. As a first-generation college student, I felt immense guidance and support from my peers, as well as the staff at Cal Poly Pomona. However, one aspect of this university which could be improved slightly is the professors' teaching approaches. Fortunately, most of my professors chose to teach in an immersive, hands-on way. Still, there were a few professors which relied heavily on lectures and PowerPoint. Other than this, I have no other criticisms of Cal Poly Pomona."
Freshman,5,"First time I attended Cal Poly Pomona, it was great, lots of things to do during my free time, resources were helpful."
Freshman,5,"It was kind of hard for me because some classes are online due to the pandemic, but overall it was very good."
Junior,5,"Most of the professors at CPP are very professional and knowledgeable at their specialties. I have been having wonderful, talented, and kind professors at CPP."
Junior,5,"My experience at Cal Poly Pomona, CPP has be a wonderful experience. CPP is my second home. I've met so many great colleagues and faculties that have helped me along my college journey."
Senior,5,"I appreciate CPP's online transition during COVID-19; however, I would appreciate it if the professors would not add on the extra work load as if to assume we were at home all 24/7 and that school was our only focus. Still, a majority of my professors have accommodated this transition quite well, and I enjoy this online aspect of college. There has only been one professor that has created an overload, of homework, but (in the accompaniment of stress) I was able to manage to make it through the course."
Senior,5,Cal Polly Pomona is a beautiful campus that welcomes diversity and inclusion. Minor changes that need to be made include parking and admin communication. More class availability/flexibility/online options would also be nice.
Freshman,5,When it came to advising students about the pre-cautions that college life has to offer they provided me with things to look out for when on/off campus to make sure I make the best decision possible.
Freshman,5,"When it comes to assistance with enrolling in classes and getting help to answer questions, Cal Poly answers very well."
Junior,5,The professors at Cal Poly made online courses as similar as possible to the previous in-class environment. They were also very understanding of how each student had special needs with the new learning environment and accommodated then accordingly.
Junior,5,Throughout my time at Cal Poly I met incredible professor and students that have make huge impacts in my life. The professors at Cal Poly encourage students to challenge their usual way of thinking and discuss sensitive topics that aren't taught correctly in most high schools. Cal Poly provides a very friendly and encouraging environment for students to grow and learn.
Junior,5,I have taken a few online courses that are general education courses. The professors were extremely organized and on top of grading. The layout of the courses were very understandable and were not overwhelming or confusing.
Sophomore,5,I honestly love Cal Poly Pomona. I have learned so much just by living in the dorms and being able to attend events in school. I enjoyed going to the library to study with my friends and also loved grabbing a drink right after we finished since we have a Starbucks right outside the library building. I would definitely recommend living on campus to really enjoy the beauties of Cal Poly Pomona has to offer to their students.
Freshman,5,"Cal Poly Pomona is such a diverse place, and is a great school for you especially if you are commuting. There are a few bad professors, but the great professors I have had really outshine them by a large margin. The campus is also quite pretty, and can be a good home for you."
Niche User,5,"As a sales executive with a multinational organization, I am constantly looking at integrating new ways of learning to create an immediate and positive impact within my company. Through the CPP MBA program, I have found an opportunity to enhance my own skills to make better decisions now, as well as create better opportunities for myself, and my company, in the future."
Freshman,5,"When I had arrived everyone was very welcoming. The campus was beautiful. The weather was amazing I just could not believe the view. It was wonderful. The professors were great and welcoming as well. All of them seemed very invested in their students education. If I were to struggle all I had to do was sign up for an appointment for office hours. Some professors do not even require an appointment. You can just show up. The lectures are not boring. They make it very easy and fun to learn in class. The dorms are also very beautiful. Very safe environment. All the students were very nice as well. No one disrespected each other. The walks to class were never a problem because it is always a nice day. Everything is walking distance. You can also ride bikes. Its never a bad day to not ride bikes. The food is also very good. Many varieties of food to choose from. Whether you are vegetarian, pescatarian, vegan, or love meat. So many choices to choose from. First year of college was great."
Junior,5,"My overall experience at Cal Poly Pomona has been great! It has a highly ranked cybersecurity degree. The amount of time and effort that I see students put towards their professional and sport clubs is unprecedented from other universities that I visit. Whether it be placing top 10 in the world among universities for pen testing and CTF. 

The top programs here at Cal Poly Pomona are computer information systems, industrial engineering, landscapes architecture, hospitality and many more. There are unlimited internship opportunities being in the Greater Los Angeles area with many firms recruiting CPP students even within their freshman year. It really is what you make of it here, I highly recommend to get involved to make your college experience worth it. In the end when you graduate, it is all about who you know and that statement stands with the connections that I have made at Cal Poly among alumni and others."
Freshman,5,The professors and staff are very supportive and really want everyone to succeed! It is really easy to get in contact with someone when you're in need.
Freshman,5,California State Polytechnic University - Pomona is a great school. I would review it and give it a very high rating. This school is great
Freshman,5,I am applying here but from what i can tell it is an excellent school for sciences. I am really excited to apply there and start a new future by helping the world by working for the epa
Senior,5,"This school is amazing. All my professors are helpful, whenever I have questions they never hesitate. They want to see us succeed. I transitioned from a community college and it was challenging but I used resources that are provided by the school."
Alum,5,"I mostly miss the beauty and the hands on aspect of this campus. there were beautiful places you could go and hang out with your friends or just be by yourself and take in the sites. I liked how interconnected all of the different majors were on campus because of all of the sports teams and campus Greek Life. Everyone here was so friendly and it was a great place to meet new people because it was a commuter school. Just get there early for parking, the one BAD thing there, but you could at least kill time by walking around and seeing the livestock on campus or working out at their AMAZING gym."
Alum,5,"Cal Poly Pomona, in my opinion, is a great school. The campus is pretty and easy to navigate. There was never a day when I was on campus that I did not feel safe.  The students and staff were all very friendly and I am really lucky and proud to have graduated from Cal Poly."
Junior,5,California is turning into a beautiful campus with new buildings and dorm rooms being built. The campus has a ton of resources and the students are of diverse backgrounds.
Freshman,5,My first semester at Cal Poly Pomona was amazing. I made friends very easily and my first year has been a smooth and easy transition into college.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy that California Polytechnic State University at Pomona offers a hands on approach to learning. This is especially useful in technical majors such as mine, which is aerospace engineering. One improvement my school could make is that they could use resources more efficiently and ensure that the number of students accepted is appropriate given the number of sections of each class, so that students can take classes in a timely manner. This would increase the four year graduation rate."
Junior,5,"My experience with this campus was shocking at first, to believe that I got into a university, and the last thing you would won't is for it to be overwhelming, but I found that in Cal Poly Pomona, everyone around probably felt the same at first, so all the students can scene if someone is having problems so they would comfort you."
Freshman,5,"It's amazing, there's just so much to do. There is an never ending amount of events that you could do."
Freshman,5,"is a good school I love it, it full os cool things the food is goos the diversity is nice and also the profesor are good"
Sophomore,5,Applying to the CSU that I got accepted into for the major that I was interested in was very easy and all the steps were very straightforward.  The application took almost no time at all and I'm glad I applied.
Freshman,5,lots of resources available to students. Tutoring is free and available to everyone even during finals week. Professors are excellent at teaching and are willing to aid students with their understanding of class material. Library is a nice place to study with classmates and study rooms are available to students.
Junior,5,"Unlike most student who enters college when they are young, I enrolled in Cal Poly as a 46-year-old student. I thought that this was going to be a great disadvantage but I was wrong.  The fact was that not only was I welcomed by the staff and was embraced by my peers. During my first semester, I joined several groups including the Ridge Runners Ski and Snowboard club. I have gained many friends within the clubs.  And I have learned to enjoy the many organizations that Cal Poly has to offer on campus. As well as the staff."
Niche User,5,"Very friendly environment. The college always has booths and activities near the student center and it really helps the students when they are dealing with a stressful day. Other than the odd road structure and parking issue, this place is actually very lovely. And most of the professors are also very helpful and fun people to learn from."
Alum,5,"Cal Poly is a great school, it provides you with all the tools you need to succeed. I absolutely loved the friendly and very encouraging professors."
Niche User,5,It is great! My brother attends school there. He is currently a sophomore and says nothing but positive things about the school. He encourages me to go there because of how great the school is.
Freshman,5,"It is a wonderful campus with a wide spread of different cultures, however, they just have much more transportation for their students."
Junior,5,California State Polytechnic University Pomona is great. Their professors and academics help guide students towards their majors. It is a very diverse school and there is nothing I would change. The campus is great!
Junior,5,"This campus is friendly and beautiful, they have fantastic professors and very inclusive classrooms. There are many spots throughout the campus to find a quiet spot to do homework in between classes or fun spots to hang with friends you've made in class!"
Freshman,5,"Cal Poly Pomona's ""learn by doing"" approach in academics has been very helpful when trying to learn the material for a class. The faculty to student ratio is not that large which helps student get their questions addressed. Cal Poly Pomona is very welcoming via clubs, fraternities, sororities, and other communities."
Niche User,5,"During my experience visiting Cal Poly Pomona, the atmosphere felt so lively and energetic. When talking to the students and staff, their attitudes were so enjoyable and made you feel happy and welcomed. The campus is a great size and has a lot to offer its students."
Sophomore,5,"The environment is very nice. The students are all very kind & I have already made a lot of memories. A lot of the professors are helpful and kind, easy to communicate with."
Senior,5,"I love the environment that surrounds me at Cal Poly Pomona. The faculty, professors, and students are what make the campus a great learning environment. I am motivated to do well in my studies due to the pride involvement on campus. One thing I wish I could change or improve would be the parking. A downfall to my school is they allow more incoming students yet cannot accommodate all the physical parking spaces for students."
Niche User,5,"Well I feel like Cal Poly Pomona is a great place because it quiet and somewhat a big campus but easy to get us to. I have a sister that goes there and I am hopping to go there and study. I love the environment its nice and the people are welcoming, but the diversity is not so good."
Senior,5,"Pomona wasn't my first choice for college, but thankfully it turned out to be the best choice coming here because of all the great opportunities this school has to offer."
Freshman,5,I enjoy the campus and all the professors! The campus is lively and you should check out the animals.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Cal Poly Pomona! The amount of incredible resources and professors is astonishing. I am applying for this scholarship so I can fund my study abroad plans. I would love to open my horizons to different cultures and languages. And thankfully, Cal Poly has granted me the opportunity to do so. It has been a dream to be a part of such a wonderful campus. I cannot wait for what the next two years have in stores!"
Junior,5,A wonderful campus  with good staff. I just went to the transfer orientation and the topic on diversity was very powerful. It a large campus with diverse community and I cant wait to start my classes and be a full  student and be part of this positive community.
Niche User,5,"The environment at Cal Poly is very diverse. Everybody is super enthusiastic, friendly and ready to learn. The staff is wonderful, they are very supportive and they definitely want you to succeed. They offer a variety of clubs and give you the hands on experience you need to become successful in your career!"
Junior,5,"I’ve only been on campus a few times, but the staff is really nice and super helpful. Their online website is really easy to navigate. The campus itself is really clean and looks super nice"
Sophomore,5,"When I first saw it I knew it was the school for me, everyone was so friendly and was willy to get to know you and hear your story. Its so diverse and so many new people to talk to and get to know."
Sophomore,5,"I am very excited to start my second year at CPP and I loved my first year there! As an Asian-American coming from Boston, Massacusetts, CPP felt like a much more diverse and welcoming community. Around campus, you see diversity in everything from ethnicities to food, architecture, and activities. I lived in the Estrellas suites my first year, and I loved it. I had my own room, three great roommates, and was able to enjoy the luxury of living on-campus. The staff and faculty are very welcoming and nice. There are plenty of clubs and opportunities to meet people and find social groups. At this school, I feel motivated both professionally and creatively. I found my emphasis I want to pursue in my major, and I have access to great creative outlets such as dancing and cultural events. Highly recommend! Great place to learn about your future profession while building experience and learning about yourself!"
Junior,5,"The school is very diverse and promotes learning in a great way. Pomona is not the best location; however, it is a great campus. This is a ranked school at a great price."
Junior,4,"I do not have any issues with Cal Poly Pomona. The professors are knowledgeable of their respective subjects and helpful to their students. The campus is nice but a bit of a walk at times, which is not a problem if you feel the need to exercise. The school and the areas around it become crowded with traffic at times, but is not too bad for most of the day. Overall, a good experience being able to learn at Cal Poly Pomona."
Junior,4,"All my classes are online during the pandemic. Teachers are always staying on schedule and offering help during lectures and during office hours. Assignments have been adjusted for online and the experience while not preferable to many, is one that we can work in."
Senior,4,"Gorgeous campus! Plenty of nice, quiet spots to study. Most professors are very nice, helpful, and know their stuff. Overall, great school."
Sophomore,4,The online courses were good. I finished an entire semester of Biology in a week and the course was laid out perfectly.
Sophomore,4,"Cal Poly Pomona is a great school for those who want to branch out and meet other people from different places. It has its flaws, but overall great school."
Sophomore,4,"Cal Poly Pomona going online was very difficult. Some professors were very helpful in transitioning to online while others were not. For myself, I did not find it difficult to transition, my professors communicated well before we transitioned how they could help us in making the switch easy."
Sophomore,4,"Cal Poly Pomona is a great school when it comes to academics. Due to the sudden shift to online classes because of COVID-19, Cal Poly Pomona was not able to have a good and efficient online class experience. However, Cal Poly Pomona has been contacting students about the new shift for Fall 2020."
Sophomore,4,CPP is a good school in terms of education but I would like to see more from the student body to make it more interactive.
Sophomore,4,"The bright colors that represent Cal Poly Pomona also match the environment of the campus. The experience I had was memorable because the school is diverse and openminded. Although the campus is great, I will like to see some changes. For example, I would like for Deans to not racial profiling someone and kicking someone out of campus."
Sophomore,4,"In these couple of months, the school switched our in-person classes to online classes because of the pandemic and for our safety.  All my professors continued to teach. Even though it difficult to teach and learn through a computer we both tried our best to not give up. Overall, the professors did a perfect job of lecturing the students."
Senior,4,love the hands on approach Cal Poly takes. Learn by doing motto is great! Labs are interesting and fun pre-covid
Junior,4,Online classes are done very well at CPP. They can help students with crowded schedules or students who commute.
Junior,4,"There are some amazing professors who actually care about student success and well-being, which helps a lot."
Senior,4,"Overall, I like Cal Poly Pomona. It offers many social and academic opportunities and I really enjoy my major. Although registering for classes and getting in contact with faculty may be difficult at times, there are different ways to solve these issues."
Senior,4,"In the past, I have taken online classes with professors that are used to teaching online. Whether it is through powerpoints, recorded lectures, or assigned reading, they ensure that students learn just as much as if they were in a classroom. These professors encourage students to ask questions and make themselves readily available as quickly as possible to help students when needed."
Sophomore,4,"At first, I was concerned about taking all my classes online because I was used to interacting with my classmates and being engaged in the classroom. However, all my professors were able to incredibly manage the situation very well, and my classes went the same way but this time through a video camera. As far as of tests and quizzes, they were given to us through online pages that our books' authors have. My professors also uploaded all of their PowerPoint slides on their pages so I was able to go back to them whenever I needed to. All of my professors also provided their regular office hours through Zoom meetings and they were very helpful. Besides having their office hours, my professors stayed after each class for a while to help with questions or concerns from their students. Although it went not as bad as I thought, I miss going to my in-person classes, living in the dorms, and having the whole college experience. I would definitely choose in-person classes over online classes."
Freshman,4,"Online classes are not as good in my opinion due to the hands-on motto this school has, but they are manageable and easy. I do not learn as much from online classes for obvious reasons, but if you have to, then do not be shy to take some."
Senior,4,It's a great school with a California view. I loved living in the suites and the events offered are never ending. There are always opportunities to meet new people.
Senior,4,I had some professors that were very thorough and I was still able to learn. It was harder to learn but It all worked out.
Senior,4,I enjoyed being at cal poly because everyone is so helpful and kind. They help you to be guided into the right direction of the classes you need.
Senior,4,It was not a great experience to be honest because I felt like teachers were giving more homework because of the stay home order.
Junior,4,"California State Polytechnic University-Pomona is an astounding campus. This campus offers a diverse and inclusive learning environment for all students. As a Hispanic woman, there are boundless oppotunities and resources accessible to me. Preparing for a career in the medical feild, I am provided with all the necessary advisors, mentors, and professors who will ensure my future success.  A sense of community and support is felt among the students attending Cal Poly Pomona. Not to mention the abundance of clubs attainable for all, to which everyone is sure to find one that meets their needs."
Senior,4,All colleges and universities come with their day to day challenges. Overall my experience with CPP has been both socially and academically beneficial. Majoring as Hospitality management at CPP has already given me advantages for careers in the industry.
Freshman,4,The professors really care about the student's education. They will go out of their way to make sure students get the education that they deserve. Most of the professors want all their students to pass their class so they will offer to help as much as they can. There are a lot of resources for everyone. The students that attend are also friendly.
Senior,4,The thing I like about this university is the different clubs and resources students have in order to feel supported during their journey in obtaining their degree. I believe that the professors are very helpful when it comes to visiting them in their office hours. They help and give advise in different fields not just their own. The one thing that I would change is the help from advisors. They are not very welcoming or helpful. They almost make it seem like you are bothering them when asking questions.
Junior,4,I love the hands-on experience Cal Poly has to offer and the access to information students receive. The campus has a very hard-working faculty and amazing gym!
Alum,4,"Lovely campus.  Learn by doing is the motto and you do exactly that.  The help to get career opportunities wasn't great.  There are also not a lot of night classes offered, so if you're an adult going there, be prepared to either not work or have to work on the weekends when you need to do homework."
Freshman,4,It is a good school with lots of opportunities. Nothing comes for free and you have to do the work to find it. Some professors are fantastic while others are mediocre at best.
Junior,4,The hands on learning is an effective way to learn but the practice sometimes becomes challenging. They urge students to participate in trial and error more than a teaching method beforehand.
Junior,4,"The students at Cal Poly Pomona are very motivated and hard working. Although it is an older feeling campus, the university is in the middle of many modernization aspects. Classrooms at Cal Poly Pomona are much smaller than most universities, allowing for a more personal connection between students and professors."
Sophomore,4,"Great campus, especially if you're interested in agriculture. There's plenty of places to hang out, lots of gardens to explore and animals to see. The only thing that people can complain is parking is limited. My classes have been consistently challenging and professors accommodating but some classes are hard to get into."
Junior,4,"My experience at Cal Poly Pomona is one of  the best experiences I had at a university campus. The university provides everything that a student may need for housing, academics, spiritual health. Living on campus makes life way easier due to not worrying for a parking spot. Restaurants and the school cafeteria is within minutes from housing and your classes. I would like the university to spend more funds on school parking and an upgrade in cafeteria food."
Freshman,4,"Pomona overall is a good school; however, it may be harder to communicate or build relationships and people tend to keep to themselves, with effort this could be overcome. The academics at this school are fairly good, I have enjoyed multiple wonderful professors and some who just seem to come in lecture and get out, but there will always be some resource on campus to help a student who is struggling with anything."
Freshman,4,"I am very grateful to be attending this university. The academics are phenomenal, the social environments are very engaging, and there is always something to keep busy at."
Junior,4,"So far, my experience at Cal Poly has been pleasant. I have access to all the resources I could need in order to succeed in this stepping stone in my career path. I do wish that there was more parking, which interferes with a lot of students' academics."
Sophomore,4,"It's a great school if you get involved with different organizations on campus. As well as the professors are usually pretty good. But campus life, isn't that good, unless your involved. The majority of the school are commuters so that is why campus life is that strong."
Freshman,4,"I have only done my first semester at Cal Poly Pomona and my experience has been great so far. The thing that I loved the most about the college was the professors that I had. They were good at teaching the material while also making it interesting in order for students to have a less complicated learning process. Moreover, I have enjoyed living on campus, however, the college is really calm for my taste because I would like it to have more events. In addition, I think that the food has been good at The Centerpointe."
Sophomore,4,Cal Poly Pomona is a good school with a beautiful campus. Class sizes aren’t too big and the campus feels spacious and not too crowded. Professors are very helpful and care a lot about their subjects. Parking isn’t too bad as long as you get there early. It isn’t a big party school either as most of its students commute to campus. The food sold there is delicious although a bit pricey. There is always room to sit inside of the library and especially on the quiet floors.
Freshman,4,It was very easy to settle in as a student and have numerous amounts of resources that are available to students.
Senior,4,As Biotechnology major at CPP I really like that the school encourages you to get out and do research with a professor or to get an internship with a biotech company. There are a lot of resources offered on campus and you should take full advantage of them.
Graduate Student,4,"As an English Literature Graduate, I can say I love the attention and care that my professors gave to students. I thought the overall curriculum was of high quality, and that the professors take pride in their positions. I also really enjoy the diverse communities represented within the schools population. I think that some things that are annoying, or can be improved is the excessive costs. For example, parking permits cost 231 per semester, and 8$ per DAY if you opt for a daily pass. In addition, I would advise against becoming employed by the campus because of the extremely minimal hours. Overall, I think it’s a great and credible school to attend for the *overall* low cost of tuition."
Senior,4,"Campus is very safe, well maintained and easy to navigate. Parking is not difficult if you are not picky."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman at Cal Poly Pomona I find myself very busy with academics.  
I spend most of my free time studying.  
I hope to join in on some campus clubs in the spring semester."
Niche User,4,"I visited the college and have applied to attend there. The campus was quite large and had lots of wonderful and welcoming students there to answer any possible questions I had, and were also there to show me around in case I got lost. The campus has a lot of diversity and I like the fact that there are a lot of organizations and clubs on campus. I look forward to attending."
Senior,4,"School has some great technical programs.  The architecture program is one of the best in the country, which is a great thing to have.  The campus life is dull due to the fact that it is a commuter school, but it is very nice.  The amenities on campus are well worth it, and are open for a good time frame.  Overall I believe that it is a very good educationally driven school, it is just lacking in the extra curricular areas."
Senior,4,"I like CPP. There are a few impacted majors though, which makes getting classes very difficult. In some cases, students can have their time at CPP extended because they aren't able to get the classes that they want in time."
Freshman,4,So far the school is pretty good. I like my current professors. There are a bunch of resources that made the transition from high school to college easier. There isn't much of a party scene here at cpp.  So if you are looking for parties over the weekend you won't find them here. There is however a bunch of club events during the week with a lot of free food.
Senior,4,I liked the relationships you develop while attending Cal Poly Pomona. There are great people here that are always willing to help you that become life-long friends. I would like to see change is an increase in staff because with so many students attending here classes are not always available.
Junior,4,"It’s a great school, the professors care about their students and do go the extra mile to help them out. I think the cost is worth the experience. The students are all really nice too, I haven’t met anyone who’s brushed me off or was short. Administration is another story. They can’t seem to get it together. Timelines are constantly getting pushed out and they do not communicate. I even had a counselor bail on an appointment I had confirmed with him. It was very unprofessional. Parking is a disaster as well. Students tend to arrive 1-2 hours early just to find a spot. I never had this experience with my junior college"
Freshman,4,"Coming to College so far has been an experience that I didn't think would be a positive experience because I thought college would just bring me stress. Cal Poly Pomona has a great community that makes you feel like you are part of their family. All of the professors are kind and caring, they are there to motivate you and do your best. Theirs many activities at school that provide comfort and friendship. Overall my school has been a pleasure and I am grateful for my school."
Niche User,4,"Cal Poly Pomona may be a lesser known school, but I definitely would consider it to be a hidden gem of Southern California. With a great Engineering program for a very affordable price when compared to some of the bigger name colleges in California, Pomona is a great college that not enough people put on their list."
Junior,4,"This is my first year here, I love the campus and the professors so far are great, the parking situation is a little tough with how packed it is all the time."
Junior,4,"For starters, this school is clean, has constant renovations and is making changes for the better. Unfortunately, the parking situation here is quite unpleasant. I do enjoy the hands-on approach the school upholds, but some of the instructors make it difficult for students to succeed. In addition, there isn't an exciting campus life, as seen at other institutions. Overall, the quality of education is what is most important, everything else is simply not ideal."
Senior,4,It is a great school many of the professors care about the students. There also advisors and great resources for students that need help on any matter. Only negative factor is the parking and there is a lot of walking from the parking lot to the classrooms.
Senior,4,"My experience here has been very hands on with the opportunities to actually participate in undergrad research, the countless internship opportunities on campus and the many clubs tailored to almost every interest possible, I feel that I could not have chosen a better school. The only downsides really are parking and the difficulty getting classes which is not a unique problem."
Sophomore,4,"Cal poly pomona is one of the ""smaller"" campuses so parking is limited and very hard to find. Most people either skate or bike to get around since there is such a lack of close by parking. Food choices are limited as most of them are fast food. However the campus is pretty well-known for on hands teaching which it fulfills pretty well. If anything, I wouldn't go to Cal Poly Pomona if campus variety is what you are seeking, but is great in academics if you are willing to deal with the horrid parking competition with this years' largest incoming freshman class of all CPP history."
Freshman,4,The atmosphere of being such a close nit community through dorm life and clubs activities helps to ingratiate students to the campus lifestyle. Universal issue that arise for students is the increases in tuition and housing prices alongside constant need for more parking spaces and a surge in admitted students.
Junior,4,"Cal Poly Pomona is a great university for transfer students in specific. The faculty there go above and beyond to make transfer students feel welcome there, with there even being a 2 day event for transfers that allow them to make contacts at the school and generally become more familiar with the campus and its culture."
Junior,4,I like Cal Poly Pomona because their method of teaching is very hands-on. I find that this is the best way to learn and practice in your career field. The campus is great and there are many resources available to the students in order to have the best learning and fun experience.
Junior,4,"I've really enjoyed being at this school. I worked really hard to get here and it hasn't disappointed. The classes have been really challenging in a good way, and I've found the professors to be phenomenal."
Senior,2,"I've never taking an online class at cal poly until covid hit, most teachers adapted but a lot of the older professors were clueless and made it difficult."
Freshman,2,"my online experience was not that good. since covid-19 we had to switch to online, and it was difficult. It was not good because my internet was not good at home which caused my wifi to crash a couple times during tests and my professor would not let me retake it. other then that it was ok. I still learned from my classes."
Senior,2,"Academics- Despite a vast variety of classes I find the school lacking in opportunity to sign up for classes as they have switched recently from a quarter system to a semester system causing a whole mess for those who have to deal with the conversion. In addition to this Cal poly has accepted more students than ever before despite not increasing the number of classes available to the students leading to overcrowding, inability to register for classes that are much needed, and feelings of resent as you will now need to stay an extra semester to finish that one class that fills up at the start of registrations."
Junior,2,I would like to see their focus on the student change. They are too prioritized with money instead of student needs and wants. Just seems like they don't really care.
College Student,2,Overpriced and not clean. Rooms and bathrooms are disgusting
College Freshman,2,"Its super dirty, old and they need bigger and newer buildings I almost want to switch schools because of the cost and of how horrible the freshman dorms are."
College Sophomore,2,Our teams are not the best in the league. We are really we'll known for anything good.
College Sophomore,2,"The Suite Buildings are very nice and clean. The housing process is where the problems begin to arise. When applying students fill out a personality survey so that the school can match students accordingly. I was paired with the most opposite people. Their morals were complete opposite of mine and they showed very little respect towards the suite itself. Trash everywhere, destroyed furniture, drugs, alcohol, and late night visitors. Also since the suites has a closed door policy it is very difficult for residents to make friends with anyone other than their roommates."
College Sophomore,2,The one time I have been exposed to Greek life personally was when a friend in a fraternity implied that I needed to be part of the Greek life in order to feel connect with the students at my school. While I myself am uninterested in Greek life I do know a little bit about it. Not many people at my school are part of Greek life. The people who are range in personality from pompous to humble. According to my roommates from freshmen year housing is quite a ways away from campus and the houses themselves are not large enough for most of the members to reside in.
College Freshman,2,My school does not have a football team. I wish they did because I believe it would bring a lot of school spirit and a new way to make friends.
College Junior,2,Why would anyone want to live on campus.
College Sophomore,2,Being a commuter school I think plays a role in the support of our athletics. Most people just drive here to come to lecture/lab then leave after. Athletics isn't a big part of life here.
College Freshman,2,Freshmen dorms were built in the 1960's and the rooms themselves have not been updated since then. Very poor space area and structure.
College Junior,2,The gym facility is new and welcomed edition to the campus.
College Sophomore,2,I wish I had researched more into colleges before attending Cal Poly Pomona. If I had known what it would have been like I would not have attended this school. I am stressed beyond belief taking 18+ units every quarter with professors that don't understand that we have other things such as work and family on top of the work they demand. The quality of the lectures and classes is extremely poor.
College Sophomore,2,"As a theatre major, the majority of the classes I take are classes offered within the theatre department. And the theatre department at CPP is god awful. None of the technical and design professors seem very knowledgable in their field nor do they care much about the students getting quality education. I am about to start my 6th quarter at Cal Poly and I can say that everything I've learned within the theatre department can fix onto a single piece of paper. The dedicated staff members in the theatre are the only good part about the department. They're always there to answer questions and are very happy to teach the students when approached with questions."
College Junior,2,"I joined a sorority because of all the great things Greek life promised me. However, I realized that both sororities and fraternities use philanthropy as a cover up and actually only care about looks and partying."
College Freshman,2,The Alumni at Cal Poly constantly call and ask for donations like I'm not already a student trying to pay for MY OWN education.
College Freshman,2,"I don't even house on campus because the experience doesn't look enjoyable. Cal Poly is a commuter school so it lacks most of the perks that come with housing typically at other bigger universities. The dorms here are incredibly small and the people living with them are not social at all, unfortunately."
College Freshman,2,"As a Division 2 school, people rarely pay attention to our varsity sports. In fact, intramural sports get more attention on our campus."
College Senior,2,stayed one night in housing and did not like it. seemed too close in proximity to one another and was not enjoyable.
College Freshman,2,Not interested nor do I have any information on Greek Life.
College Freshman,2,We don't have a football team. Baseball and soccer are probably the most interesting sports we have.
College Student,2,"Lots of people here are just in it for an education not to make friends, not a good college experience"
College Student,2,"Only 2 or 3 major clubs, other than that its non-existent"
College Sophomore,2,I have heard that the sports teams are not so good.
College Junior,2,"The dormitory is in the original brick buildings. My allergy condition prohibits me from stepping foot in there due to the rashes that are caused by the allergens that lurk upon the walls and other structures. As a freshman outside of the district, one is forced to live in the dorms their first year, but if you do not want to live in the dorms, you have to pay for a contract to not live in the dorms. I signed that contract. There are options for living on CPP grounds; the dorms, the suites, and then the apartments so there are plenty of alternative options."
College Junior,2,"CPP focuses more on education and does not cater well to the athletic community. Minor chances to cater the athletic community was when they decided to build an additional fitness facility with ""the tallest rock climbing wall in the state"", however this put a major unnecessary financial toll on students. This new workout facility seems to be a reason for the lack of interest in sports because there aren't sports teams that go with the activities that we have available. We do not play American Football, but play football fantastically along with basketball being a favourite. Other sports are for clubs sports teams."
College Freshman,2,"From only being here a quarter I have already heard too many scary stories. I feel like especially with sexual assault and rape, it is extremely hard and not facilitated for a victim to come forward."
College Freshman,2,Not a fan of Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"The Greeks solicit the quad and other common areas. It's easy to tell who is Greek, they are usually obnoxious and annoying."
College Freshman,2,CPP is very strict with alcohol and drugs use on campus.
College Freshman,2,It is always dirty and no air conditioning
College Freshman,2,"There isn't a lot to do. If you want to do anything you have to drive off campus for at least 10 minutes. That said, there are a lot of malls and nice spots with in a 30min radius."
College Freshman,2,"They have a lot of rules, most of which most colleges don't even care about. I have more rules here than I did at home and I feel like I get treated like a child. But its really only your freshman year. After that you're on your own and the only thing you have to worry about is parking. Which they are pretty annoying about as well."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't a lot to do. There are some small malls and restaurants but none of them are very exciting. Its a mostly residential area, and it isn't very active. You also have to drive EVERYWHERE. You can drive into LA or other schools, but its pretty much a 20min minimum."
College Freshman,2,"There is one shopping center nearby that has Panera Bread, In-N-Out, Chipotle, etc. It's all the average costs and I am not aware of any student discounts. It's not very convenient to go to this shopping center unless you own a car. Even then, you have to choose a certain part of the day to go because you could lose your parking spot if you don't go at night and be stuck searching for an hour."
College Freshman,2,"I don't really like this area. I think that there is not much to do and it's not a very up-kept community. Every other college town I've seen has campus marketplaces so that students can grocery shop, eat food, and hangout within walking distance of the campus. We do not have anything like this. You must get in the car and drive to the nearest grocery store. To get somewhere with a lot of variety you must get on the freeway. I do not have a car on campus with me, so it's very difficult to get out unless someone with a car wants to get off campus as well. The nicer communities are at least a freeway exit or two away from here. What is directly around me is not very nice. The ground is dirty and the people don't seem very nice. There is a lot of poverty from what it seems. I wouldn't stay here after I graduate."
College Freshman,2,"Everything seems to be very expensive in the cafeteria's, and the trucks that carry food around for when it is lunch time has high prices. The dining for dorms and suites are  okay at times but the same food over and over again gets tiring."
College Junior,2,"Pomona is so ridiculous to have such a nice school in. Public transportation is horrible; now that I'm living off campus, my roommate has to take a 2 hour bus to her job that is 9 miles away. There are nice surrounding cities, but it costs a lot in gas to go there to spend time with friends. And there are no sidewalks or bike lanes whatsoever."
College Junior,2,"While I don't enjoy the party scene and have not really been to a party, I do hear that there is not much too offer for those who do like to party."
College Junior,2,Not much to do around.
College Junior,2,Athletics? hah! Don't even have a football team. Lame.
College Junior,2,Sucks. Very boring since its commuter school in the middle of nowhere. Boring places all around.
College Junior,2,"Way to competitive to even qualify, so I stopped."
College Sophomore,2,"I have heard from almost every student that Pomona city itself is danger but that on and near by the campus, the area is safe and quite beautiful."
College Freshman,2,Most people drop out due to financial issues. Freshman year they give you the California State University Grant but run out of funds for Sophomores and up...wish I had knew this before summer so i could have gotten a summer job.
College Freshman,2,I don't like physics.... I am currently trying to weasel my way into Mechanical Engineering but to be honest i am struggling to raise my gpa from my first quarter to a 3.0 required to switch.
College Freshman,2,I though I would love physics before jumping in... but its horrible... the physics club (less than a classroom of students) is all the people who graduate physics major.
College Freshman,2,It took months in my senior year in high school until the school dealt with the problem.
College Sophomore,2,you usually have to arrive at school 45 minutes before class starts to be able to find a parking spot unless you rideshare and then get to uses the special parking spots
College Freshman,2,There are just not enough parking spaces close to campus.
College Sophomore,2,Liberal Studies is too vague as a major.
College Sophomore,2,I couldn't complete my FAFSA awhile back.
College Sophomore,2,Not much fun activities in Pomona.
College Sophomore,2,Teachers take attendance more often.
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid office is always full and when you call, the wait time is up to forty minutes."
College Senior,2,I have been trying to look for a place recently.  It's going to take months at least.
College Freshman,2,"Barely any spots to get, but they are free"
College Student,2,"Nothing is happening. There are people to hangout with so it isn't horrible, but not much ever happens. It would be a better use of time to just go home on the weekends and go to sleep at night."
College Sophomore,1,"My roommates had alcohol, marijuana, mushrooms, and other drugs in their rooms and stored visibly in the common room area in our suites. People walk around campus with vapes."
College Sophomore,1,I don't feel like I am at all prepared to start a career with the degree I'm getting. I don't know where to start or even if I have enough skill sets with the poor quality of education I'm getting.
College Sophomore,1,Very crowded and overrated. Left housing after my first quarter at Cal Poly.
College Student,1,"No one parties on campus, all off campus activities"
College Freshman,1,No one really goes to the games
College Freshman,1,I never really hear about on-campus parties
College Senior,1,"Not much of a party scene. If youre involved in campus greek life, then you have a social environment to be in."
College Freshman,1,There really isn't much of anything.
College Freshman,1,The meal plan for freshmen is horrible because the meals do not roll over if they are not used and can only be used at specific times at a day and using the meal exchange options at the markets on campus is really expensive because everything in the markets are overpriced.
College Freshman,1,"There is little to no party scene. There are some small parties but you definitely have to lower your standards. If you really want to be a part of that then you have to be very social and get to know A LOT of people of joint Greek life. Greek life tends to have parties but they are pretty exclusive. Otherwise, people host small house parties and kick backs."
College Freshman,1,"The parties here are mediocre and they almost never happen. Don't come here for a social life. If you want academics this is it, otherwise, apply to Chico."
College Freshman,1,"I dislike that this is not a smoke free school. There are smoking areas, but other non student smokers have to walk through those areas as well."
College Junior,1,"Upon entry into this school they told me id get scholarships with no problem, well i have been applying for three years now and not a single dollar has come my way."
College Junior,1,Cal poly pomona is a commuter's school and it is NOT a party school. It's really anti-social.
College Senior,1,There are definitely more parking permits sold than parking spots itself.
College Sophomore,1,Impacted majors is the worst move by CSU.
College Sophomore,1,A lot of students are frustrated with parking.
College Senior,1,"I've seen the dorms of every college I was accepted to and this school was the worst.  The other types of housing do seem better though but still too expensive that I've never stayed in any of them.  It's absolutely ridiculous that you have to force a meal plan when you opt for housing.  I don't particularly like the food on-campus and it makes the expenses unbearable when the housing alone could have been doable.  I can live off of more nutritious and delicious meals for two weeks on like six bucks of groceries.  Of course, variety does change the price but not by much."
College Freshman,1,Campus housing is strict; they treat you like you're still in middle school
College Freshman,1,The wifi is terrible. 0.5Mb download speed is completely unacceptable
College Freshman,1,"Campus is dead by around 7PM, which means that it's pretty safe but very boring at night."
College Freshman,1,"Hardly any options, not to mention every dining option besides Denny's (which is absolutely dreadful) closes at 6:30PM."
College Freshman,1,CPP wastes tuition money on athletics that no one really cares about.
College Senior,1,Have to arrive at least 30 minutes early to find adequate parking.
College Junior,1,"This school is mostly a commuter type school, so not a lot happens unless you are a part of the Greek life."
College Junior,1,"Due to budget cuts, there are not many sports teams. Therefore not many fans on campus."
College Junior,1,"two words: Bronco Vision. Boys are ugly here, don't plan on having a relationship because the cute-ish ones will just screw you and every other decent looking girl around."
College Junior,1,"HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE. Do not go greek, the girls are worse than high schoolers. Don't bother wasting your time or money on fake power tripping bitches. If you do rush a sorority get into Zeta or Chi O."
College Senior,1,"The nightlife is kept off campus since there is nothing to do on campus in that aspect. You usually have to go to the city to find clubs, bars, etc. Only convenient to people with cars."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is practically nothing to eat close to campus. The closest thing is a Carl's Jr. about two miles south or more food places toward Mt. Sac. But even there it's limited to Jack in the Box, Yoshinoya, and a couple cafes. Definitely nothing spectacular."
College Sophomore,1,"Permit costs are pretty steep, over $100 per quarter. There aren't many parking lots that are close to classrooms, either; they are in remote locations or near the edge of the campus. The few good parking lots fill up too quickly. Any time after 10:00 AM and the average student will have a hard time finding any parking."
College Junior,1,"It's terrible! The permits are about $100. There are way more students who attend Cal Poly Pomona then there are parking spots. You should leave AT LEAST half an hour before your class starts (if you live off campus) to be semi hopeful that you will find a spot in time and still be five minutes late for class. Even though parking is abysmal, the professor's will hold you accountable for being late. ""You should have left earlier,"" is the standard response to, ""I'm sorry I'm late, I couldn't find a parking spot."" I suggest M lot, people seem to forget about it. It's not very close to many classes but if you take the road towards the school while walking to class instead of the walkway you are supposed to take, you end up in the center of the school, and that's not too bad. Oh, and they hand out parking tickets for fun. I swear! No permit? You're going to get a ticket."
College Freshman,1,"If you are a resident, getting parking on the weekends is the best because everyone leaves for the weekend. Besides that the parking is horrible. You need to get to campus 30-45 minutes before your class starts; that is the only way to get a spot and make it to class on time."
College Junior,1,"There's not enough to choose from.  Closest to campus in mostly fast food.  You have to drive a bit to get to some good restaurants in neighboring cities, usually by freeway."
College Junior,1,Sometimes it is impossible to find parking on campus. Can make you very late for class.
College Freshman,1,"You need a car to go anywhere off campus. Public buses are an option but they are slow, you need lots of change, and you usually need to take multiple buses to reach your destination. 
We have campus shuttles to quickly maneuver through the campus."
College Freshman,1,"Poor.!! Papers get lost, your money is not dispersed on the date scheduled. They don't answer your questions accurately and it takes years to receive it. I received mine a month into the school year. I literally dread going to their offices."
College Freshman,1,The womans of Cal Poly POmona is terrible. I wish i had more thumbs so i could give dem 4 thumbs down! You be lucky to see one pretty girl on ur way to class. 
Recent Alumnus,1,"Looking for parking is very tough, you will need to get to campus at least 30 minutes before your class starts in order to find a parking spot and walk to class. However, if you come to campus from 6am-8ish parking isn't such a headache to look for. Also, if you carpool with someone you get the opportunity to park in an area that's reserved for all students carpooling but try to make it before 10ish."
College Sophomore,1,Pretty Bad – There are always a lot of cars when I go and it can be hard walking to class because the schools on a hill. Also the parking cops gave me a ticket once for parking handicap even though i had the handicap placard clearly displayed.

Graduate Student,5,I have had great support in applying to their Clinical Laboratory Management program. The process was easy and well laid out.
Graduate Student,5,"Rush University has phenomenal teachers that truly care about their students best interest! It is a school full of endless possibilities. There are plenty of ways to be engaged, and teachers promote student interaction -- even belonging to an online program myself. I highly encourage anyone to visit an open house lead by a RUMC student leader to learn about RUMC for themself!"
Graduate Student,5,"Rush is a top-ranked medical / health sciences university.  The entire school is dedicated to health care.  Their nursing program is consistently ranked in the top 15 programs in the USA.  Some of their doctoral programs are ranked #1 in the country.  I have been proud to be a student at Rush. The school first-time pass rate for the NCLEX is 99%.  Everyone that I spoke with in my cohort passed with the minimum number of questions (75).   Therefore, you can be confident that you are getting the best education and training!"
Junior,5,"Rush is like a family! You feel welcomed as soon as you walk in the doors. Knowing that we all have the same purpose, providing excellent quality healthcare to patients in our future careers, brings us closer as individuals. Everyone offers to help one another when struggling on a subject or every day life problems."
Alum,5,"My mother went to Rush University for nurse Anesthesia and she is doing very well. At the time, Rush University was frequently rated as the number one nurse anesthetist program in the country."
Junior,5,"The professors, program advisors and every department at the University are readily available to assist the students anytime. They all go above and beyond to ensure you have a smooth transition into the school and into the workforce. They make sure you get a great understand of study materials and class work."
Alum,5,I enjoyed working with the diverse student population. I also had the amazing opportunity to have professors who were active physicians of the hospital. I learned a lot from being able to shadow multiple medical professionals in a variety of medical fields as well.
College Junior,5,"Teachers, classmates are great. The course work will be tough but if you study, you will be fine. The school is science/health based so those are the courses offered. The classes are small and personal so the teachers will know who you are."
College Junior,5,"The job and internship opportunities will lead you somewhere good coming from this school. The faculty will do what they can to help you, as long as you do for yourself too."
College Junior,5,There are support groups and help lines for these kind of things.
College Junior,5,"I have just started but my transition into the University has been great. The faculty really respect the students and want to help them succeed. They are very caring and loving, it is a community for different types of people. The classmates you meet, you will be with them during every course and you become one big family. They are willing to help on the first day of meeting because they want to help you succeed too. It's a great place, small classes, phenomenal teachers. There's a niche for everyone. Rush has a good feeling to it. It's a great place to be."
College Freshman,5,Rush was my number one choice and since being accepted I have experienced nothing but great interactions.
College Freshman,5,Rush has amazing graduate programs in the medical field. They take careful measures to ensure that they are at the top of the field.
College Junior,5,"Rush University is a great school for ambitious students. They take academia, and community service very seriously at this school. The College of Nursing is extraordinary, and supportive. I highly recommend Rush University for any graduate health care programs."
College Junior,5,This school is really great. I would recommend applying here.
College Junior,5,Rush University provides great diversity in the hospital and classroom setting. The admission of people of all ethnicities and religions gives a great understanding of how many have entered the field of health systems management.
College Junior,5,Campus is so close to downtown and Taylor St is only a few blocks away.  If you ever want to grab a drink or a bite to eat there are a ton of options nearby.
College Junior,5,The security guards are always present and if you need to be escorted to your car they will do so.
College Junior,5,Downtown Chicago has a large variety of nightlife.
College Junior,5,Chicago is a loud and vibrant city that has something for everyone.
College Freshman,4,Classes have not begun yet but my interaction will all staff members has been extremely pleasant and I love the school environment.
College Freshman,4,"Because of the well-run, nearby CTA, students have access to the diverse food & culture that the city of Chicago provides."
College Junior,4,"The school is in downtown Chicago, so the access of bars and nightclubs are no more than a train ride away."
College Junior,4,Getting into the program was relatively easy for me.  I received a phone call for an interview just a few days after I submitted my application.  Most importantly I think they look at GPA and your diversity. Get really good letters of recommendation.
College Junior,4,"The programs are very competitive, but this is what sets this university apart from others."
College Junior,4,We have a very diverse campus and everyone is very accepting of your background.
College Junior,4,People are very diverse and openly express their style.
College Junior,4,You can chose what neighborhood of Chicago you would like to live in and commute.
College Junior,4,Living in downtown Chicago offers a large variety of dining options.
College Junior,4,The university is very strict about necessary subjects such as cheating.
College Junior,4,With the school being in downtown Chicago there is a place and person for everyone.
College Junior,4,The small class size allows for great connections and an excellent learning environment.
College Junior,4,The computers are new and in great quality.  There are plenty of computer for students to use.
College Junior,4,The atmosphere is one of a kind.  With the location being in downtown Chicago you get a great experience.
College Sophomore,4,There are many places to live in the areas near the Illinois medical district. Many students live in Wicker park or Little Italy.
College Freshman,4,They do a good job of ensuring that you understand the levity of taking out such a large sum of money.
College Junior,4,"The professors that teach the courses for our degree are very knowlegable and good at explaining things.  Unfortunately, interdisciplinary education, or courses outside of our major, is not as good for courses such as ethics and healthcare in america.  They try to relate their content to our major, but they don't understand what we do very well.  Registration is usually pretty easy.  We have a set curriculum for the two years we are enrolled, so we just pick the classes they tell us to.  The system won't let you register for something you're not supposed to be in, even the wrong time slot if there's more than one section of the course you need, so it's hard to mess up.  Workload was very manageable for what i expected from a master's program, although second quarter was tiring and challenging and i pretty much didn't go out the entire time."
College Junior,4,"I love the program, I think it is just the right level of difficulty.  I put Cardiovascular Technician as my major because they didn't have my actual major listed, which is an M.S. in Perfusion Technology.  When I'm done I will be eligible to take the board exams to become a perfusionist, which is the person who runs the heart and lung machine during open heart surgery and is responsible for blood management and other cardiovascular assist devices.  Our professors are very knowledgable and most of our classes are very small.  There are 12 of us in the program so there is plenty of opportunity for one on one time with the faculty, although lab time can be a little crowded and we don't get as much practice on the pumps and simulators as we would like, although we will have plenty of hands on experience when we go on clinical rotations.  We are getting a very solid theoretical foundation in physiology, pharmacology, pathology, and research before moving on to clinicals. We have many opportunities to participate in professional conferences and meetings which are good for networking with future employers."
College Senior,4,"It's a private medical college, so most people are at least middle class.  Most of the people in my program (GEM) are white women, Christian and straight.  Considering the smallish size of my class (75), quite  a few out and proud gay men and lesbians.  This is Chicago, so everyone is completely accepting of everyone, and Rush is a fairly liberal/progressive organization."
College Senior,4,"Strong academics and a small welcoming atmosphere.  Everyone is very supportive and willing to help you.  There is definitely some disorganization, but probably because the GEM program is still new.  Living on campus is not that great because the neighborhood is kind of boring and can be shady sometimes.  It's much better to get an apartment in a livelier neighborhood and commute.  Very accessible by the Pink line and quite a few different buses."
College Sophomore,2,It's pretty terrible January and February ...but Chicago is worth it!
College Senior,2,"There is no night life since most people don't live on campus.  There are some pricey bars nearby and we sometimes go for a drink, but most people go out in other Chicago neighborhoods like Wicker park and Wrigleyville."
College Senior,2,Very cold in the winter and summers can be very hot and humid.
College Senior,2,Not really a party environment more of a study environment
Recent Alumnus,1,"When I attended it appeared that all the students who received ""free tuition"" and actually lived within a short driving distance lived on campus in the city of Chicago.  Others, like myself commuted an hour or more to attend college because we lived in the suburbs.  Not a very fair policy, in my opinion."

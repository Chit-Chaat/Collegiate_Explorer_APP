Freshman,5,"I love NU, the professors are empathetic and kind. The students are all passionate about their dreams and goals."
Freshman,5,I loved my online classes. My professors were very clear with that tasks needed to be complete. Although they weren’t there physically they were always a phone call or email away.
Senior,5,"Northeastern cultivates an environment of pre-professionals. By surrounding yourself with career oriented individuals, it further helps you prepare for the workplace. The co-op system is extremely useful, whether you know what you want to do for a job or not. It can be explorative or help you narrow down your search."
Senior,5,"I've taken many classes online during my time at Northeastern. Some pre-COVID, others not. In both cases, I felt like I was getting a good education. I enjoy the ability to pace yourself as you please with online classes."
Senior,5,"Northeastern is a really unique school in the opportunities that they offer. Beyond academics, Northeastern offers an amazing array of global opportunities, as well as the co-op program, where you get a chance to work full time in your industry prior to graduating, and I don't think you can get that anywhere else."

Sophomore,5,Northeastern has been an engaging and supportive environment. I'm very pleased to be earning my BS degree from their institution.
Sophomore,5,"I have loved learning online, as it gives me a high quality education while still having freedom to travel and move about."
Niche User,5,"Northeastern's approach with online learning was great, requiring all students to have their cameras on in order to create a realistic learning experience."
Sophomore,5,"IMO it is among the top 10 schools for business in America. Your typical college rankings don't consider the co-op program at NEU which greatly boosts NEU students over many other colleges. If you graduate from NEU with close to 2 years of experience, you are definitely more likely to be hired thn someone from a ""higher ranked"" school with a summer internship. Northeastern has an amazing community and academic environment that is very underrated but all the rankings."
Sophomore,5,Northeastern really tried to make remote learning as easy as possible and as fluid as possible. The NUFLEX model of hybrid learning seems to really be one of the best programs to handle online learning in the country.
Sophomore,5,"The professors are cooperative and understanding during online lectures, and most of them are flexible."
Senior,5,"Northeastern has been a pretty good school. The co-op program was the biggest pull and remains the biggest pull for most freshman. The  teachers know the subjects they are talking about, for the most part, since some are heavily based on research and don't have a background on teaching. The campus is somewhat diverse but still has a majority of White students attending. Northeastern boasts about their reasearch, of which they are very connected to the current world developments and technologies. The best part about Northeastern is the board game club which hosts weekly game nights for those looking for an analog face-to-face experience with friends."
Sophomore,5,"Excellent academics, beautiful campus, and the diverse student body make Northeastern a great university. Plus, the unique Co-Op programs offers student a great experience that's very attractive to employers."
Junior,5,I love the co-op experience that's fully supported by and highly encouraged at Neu. The professional vibe on campus really helps me to focus on advancing in my career.
Sophomore,5,"It’s been challenging for the professors but they do the best and it’s been great.  They offer extra office hours to make sure that they are available to all their students to compensate for anything that might be lacking due to the online learning. My school has a lot of international students to professors made sure to record all of their lectures and post them which made it much easier  for them. My professors also made sure that we still had the experience of working in groups so we got to be split up into break up groups over Zoom. If there was ever an issue with a professor then there was also a place where all students could go to complain if there was an issue which was very helpful and they were very receptive. The professors made sure to adjust the exams and the homework so that it was a little bit easier given the change in learning platform. Overall, it was a really great experience for me eventhough I learn best when I’m physically in the same classroom with people."
Sophomore,5,I love my school and the city it’s in. They really make sure to build a community within the students and faculty.
Sophomore,5,Classes are amazing. Clubs are interesting and always find a way to integrate service to the community. Living in the city is amazing and taking walks everywhere is serene. Quite a homey feeling for a place that's in the heart of Boston.
Freshman,5,"Even though it is not the same to physically on campus, Professors put time, effort and dedication in creating the best online courses for their students."
Freshman,5,"Amazing school. Great location, lots of options to Major and minor in. Real life experiences such as study abroad, global co-op, research, and volunteering locally. The best school ever and very diverse."
Senior,5,"I loved the school from the first time I visited. I like Boston as a walkable city, and I like the fact that Northeastern has its own campus but is also inside the city. It's definitely more STEM based than arts-focused, which suits what I wanted. A lot of global opportunities, and I didn't choose the school because of co-op but I'm grateful I went because doing my first co-op was exactly what I needed at the right time."
Sophomore,5,"There is so much to do at Northeastern as long as you branch out. Academics are fantastic and the school is rising to new heights. Sports are there and worth going to but do not dominate campus. Same for Greek life. Most people here really like it. Co-op propels students ahead of students from other top universities, and most students really enjoy their co-ops. Despite what might seem like a transient social scene from the outside, I have found that to be an irrational and inaccurate concern. NUin is also fantastic. Don't sleep on this school."
Freshman,5,Went for a campus visit Went for a campus visit Went for a campus visit Went for a campus visit Went for a campus visit
Freshman,5,I have not studied at Northeastern yet. I have not studied at Northeastern yet. I have not studied at Northeastern yet.
Junior,5,"Northeastern University has changed me permanently for the better. Upon coming into school I quickly realized how hard and demanding life at university is, and I eventually adjusted and have become much more devoted, hardworking, and invested in learning, which has made me very excited to eventually enter the working world with the knowledge I've obtained here.

 Additionally, the friends I've made along the way and the experiences I've had while here are ones I will carry with me for the rest of my life, undoubtedly. 

For that, I am forever grateful."
Junior,5,"I did take classes online during the COVID-19 closing of universities, and while I definitely prefer in person lectures, the experience wasn't bad. My professors made every effort to assist me in every way they could and to accommodate the change in learning style and stress of the situation."
Freshman,5,I was still able to learn alot when classes were shifted online. I'm surprised how well most of my professors adapted to the change.
Freshman,5,"Northeastern has great professors. I learned so much this year and I almost never felt rushed. The campus is beautiful, and there are plenty of activities."
Sophomore,5,"There are a lot of resources to help me learn online efficiently. For the class I am for Summer 1, I am able to call a ta almost whenever to ask questions."
Sophomore,5,Awesome school but super expensive :( Northeastern University has a beautiful campus and is right in the heart of the city. ... They have put a lot of effort into making the campus a rapidly beautiful and exciting place for students to be. Classes are always taught by professors who are experts in their field and genuinely care about their students.
Junior,5,I really like studying at Northeastern University. In my opinion it is one of the best University in Boston.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman finishing up his first year at Northeastern, I have to say I am extremely pleased with my first year. The school, professors, staff, and students have all made a really big transition a lot easier. Coming from a latin background, it has been really easy to make friends that share the same background, musical taste, and culture as mine, as the school is extremely diverse, something that I really notice and appreciate. My courses so far have been more challenging than I thought they would be, but I like that, as it keeps me challenged and on my toes. The dorms and dining halls are very good (when compared to other universities', at least). The co-op program helps you earn money, network, and find out what you do and don't want to do when you graduate, and truly one of the biggest reasons I went to Northeastern. I'm honestly really happy to be studying at such a great school and would recommend it to anyone."
Freshman,5,"I love Northeastern University, the co-op program is by far my favorite aspect to the school. Leaving college with up to a year and a half of work experience is so beneficial when searching for a job."
Niche User,5,"I loved the campus and the students, I wish it was less expensive because 70k is a lot to pay for undergrad."
Alum,5,"Loved my time at NEU. Boston is am amazing city for students, so much to do and big nightlife. The academics were top notch, professors were always available and dedicated. The programs are rigorous. The campus is absolutely beautiful and the dorms were well designed as well. The co-op program helped me gain excellent work experience, interview practice, and perfect my resume. If I had to make my choice again I'd choose NEU!"
Niche User,5,Northeastern has an awesome co-op program that gives students the opportunities to actually work (and get paid) in their field. It allows students to figure out what they like as well as what they don't like to do while still in college before actually committing to a job after college.
Senior,5,Northeastern University is a prestigous research university in Boston. The school is constantly growing while modernizing its facilities and resources. The faculty are often some of the best in their fields with publications and impressive experience.
Freshman,5,The best thing about Northeastern is the Co-op program as it gives you a realistic perspective on how what you learn applies to the real world.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus, people, clubs and how hardworking everyone is! I love the rowing team and the bonds I have built there. My favorite thing to do is go to the hockey games and socialize. I wish we could get a little bit better quality of food though."
Niche User,5,"Northeastern University has a beautiful campus and is right in the heart of the city. Its co-op opportunity creates an opportunistic work environment. Everybody who attends the school is diverse, yet like-minded in their drive for success! They have put a lot of effort into making the campus a rapidly beautiful and exciting place for students to be. Classes are always taught by professors who are experts in their field and genuinely care about their students. There is always something to do at Northeastern and it is worth while for anybody who is interested in investing long-term in a great school."
Alum,5,"Everything is amazing. From the classes and professors to clubs and activities available on campus to the student life and buildings. The food and coffee shops are amazing (2 Dunkin Donurs, a Starbucks, and Argo) in addition to other vendors (KFC and Subway) on campus, great dining halls and other vendors within the campus but not affiliated. Being on Boston there is endless things to do with Orange and Green MBTA lines running right through the campus and a location 3 minutes walk to Copley Plaza versus other schools located outside of the city hub. Amazing security and Boston police next door. Great proximity to check off campus housing options and constant updates to dormitory and apartment houses through the school. New renovations and buildings each semester and great upkeep from lawn mowing to snow plowing to maintaining toilet paper stock  in bathrooms. Would have attended for graduate school too we’re I not going to a specialized field. Loved my time."
Alum,5,"Northeastern is full of the kind of people who are ambitious but low key about it, to the point where so one bats an eye if you say you aren’t taking any of the summer off. Northeastern students are driven, but everyone is unique. There’s no one kind of student here. I loved coop. It completely changed the direction I went with my education in the best way possible. It’s fine if you don’t totally grasp it before you get here. I didn’t, but I got the hang of balancing it between semesters of classes quite easily."
Sophomore,5,"I have been very impressed by Northeastern. Their DOC’s are amazing and the Co-op program has exceeded my expectations. I like the diversity of the students and the setting in a really relaxed part of Boston. It’s a great school if you are self motivated and willing to put yourself out there. You can do Northeastern a thousand different ways, which is pretty cool. Professors have been great. You can’t be lazy here though."
Alum,5,"I went on a campus tour. Excellent curriculum, campus, and coop program. Lots of studies abroad opportunities. Beautiful campus"
Alum,5,"After talking to all my friends/associates I have concluded that the Northeastern NUin program is the best college experience available.  Having gone to London my first semester of college and three other countries thereafter has made my university experience better than all other colleagues.  With Northeastern's co-op program which places students in paid ( very fairly) positions with major employers in the US and overseas is second to none.  Starting salary immediately upon graduation $84,000"
Freshman,5,Northeastern University is great! The professors always have time for you and re willing to help you with anything.
Alum,5,"NEU's selling point is their co-op program, where you get to work in the real world for 6 months without taking classes at that time. I thought, how great could it be? Turns out, it changed my life plan. Without doing a co-op experience at a physical therapy clinic, I never would have known that that was the dream career for me. NEU's classes and experiences prepared me for the real world and graduate school like no other college could have done. Not to mention the myriad of amazing memories I have gotten from the clubs, organizations, and people I got to meet on campus. Boston is the best place to go to college, no doubt!"
Freshman,5,All of my professors were very hands on and willing to create an atmosphere that everyone was engaged and learning.
Junior,5,"I love NEU, it is my dream university and I am lucky to be a student of NEU.  It is a wonderful college to be in, great professors who are ready to help you, tutor are available to aid you. I would suggest do your research first, and see what your financial expenses are."
Sophomore,5,"Northeastern has a plethora of opportunities in academics, jobs (with co-op) and in abroad experiences. The systems may not be perfect but the provide you with unbelievable experiences that you cannot get at many other colleges."
Freshman,5,school that is known for its coops and internships. there are student run support groups for low income and first-generation college students. the campus is very nice and friendly
Freshman,5,"The student life is very welcoming. The campus is centered in Boston, and it's everything you need is within reach. The public transportation system cuts right through campus, allowing efficient ways to get around."
Freshman,5,"I especially enjoyed the co-op opportunities that offered by NEU . Furthermore, the school has the gorgeous campus, responsible professors, and good diversities."
Freshman,5,"Northeastern is an incredibly unorthodox college experience. Primarily due to the emphasis on co-op and international travel, each individual is treated like an adult from Day 1. That's not to say they ditch you--you have so many advisors you actually lose track of them. However, they do ensure you're not bogged down taking gen-eds freshman year, you're taking classes you like (philosophy satisfies the ""math"" requirement), and you're well taken care of. There's a very strong music scene (including the number one a cappella group in the country), the number one job internship opportunities in the country, really nice dorms (even as freshmen), and an incredible location with everything nearby. The day after I moved in I went to a nice and reasonably priced Italian dinner on Newberry Street--that won't happen other places. While the party scene is a bit lackluster, you can make up for it by knowing people or going to one of the other hundred schools in Boston."
Niche User,5,Northeastern University is the solution to everything that is wrong with the modern day common core curriculum.
Sophomore,5,"I have absolutely loved my years at Northeastern, beginning with the summer bridge program I was able to build a friend group that I remain close with. The academics are great though I have had a few teachers that I feel should have better training in how to teach certain materials. Otherwise my experience here at NU is one I would never change."
Junior,5,"Its a great school, the campus is beautiful and in a great location, *most* professors are great, the co-op program has been awesome so far and is good for gaining industry connections and getting real world experience on a resume. My favorite thing still has to be the great campus location, in central boston but just doesn't feel like it, still has a great campus feel and lots of greenspace."
Sophomore,5,"I really like the academics, the professors and my fellow students. I’ve learned so much from my professors and have had wonderful classes, and have made some amazing friends. The dorms could definitely be updated and the food could be a little better too"
Sophomore,5,What drew me to Northeastern is their co-op programme in which you can take two-three six month periods out of your undergrad time to get work experience and pursue potential career paths. This would make you a serious candidate for post-graduate jobs and post-grad programmes. This was a huge draw for me as I believe I will be receiving quality education and I will have work experience by the time I graduate.
Sophomore,5,Great school for work experience.          Opportunity for coop experience as an intern. Boston is a good city for college students. Access to a wide variety of experiences.
Senior,4,Northeastern has made efforts to smoothly transition its students to remote learning. They have been flexible and responsive to our concerns.
Freshman,4,"Its a bit difficult completely judging the school b/c of covid-restrictions, but for the most part I am enjoying my time."
Freshman,4,The online education is perfectly ok. Compared to my HS its excellent and compared to some of the experiences my friends have told me about its great compared to others.
Sophomore,4,My professors have overwhelmingly been committed to creating a great online learning experience despite the limitations. It's not ideal but the dedication of the faculty has made learning during the pandemic bearable.
Sophomore,4,"I love my school and have had a great experience so far. It has its issues like any school-- some big ones are housing shortages and difficulty communicating with advisors and administration. But overall the community is wonderful, the classes are high quality, the campus is beautiful, and student life is rich."
Sophomore,4,I really love it here so far- I have great professors and friends. I just wish it wasn't so expensive!
Niche User,4,"Northeastern's large campus located in Boston provides an isolated oasis for students. The campus is large and diversity is amazing, and there are tons of opportunities for all students."
Junior,4,A school that prides itself on experiential learning and global opportunities. A very professional environment in general. Too much emphasis on engineering and CS programs and not enough resources put in for natural science and humanities.
Sophomore,4,"Generally has been an enjoyable experience. Academics are decently rigorous though not absolutely insane with the exception of the engineering majors. As a black guy there's not that much black representation on campus and I haven't seen too many non-white appearing persons of Latin descent but for a school of it's cohort in New England it's relatively diverse. Party scene is meh, generally most go to BU or MIT for parties. Political climate is pretty left, though given people come from across the world to come her you'll get every ideological flavor under the sun. Overall glad I chose to attend this school."
Sophomore,4,"So far, every single one of my professors have been amazing. I'm very excited to experience to coop aspect of Northeastern."
Junior,4,"Overall Northeastern has good teachers and good facilities, however the administration is not very transparent and doesn't always seem to make decisions in the best interest of the students. The school needs to work harder on fostering diversity and supporting students at all levels with different kinds of need."
Sophomore,4,"Online learning is interesting. It took a while for professors to get used to it, but Canvas is really good at having a usable UI and making things easy. The only trouble is that outlook sometimes blocks an attatchment, so don't rely on outlook if you are trying to download an exam pdf that you have to return for a timed exam."
Sophomore,4,"I really like northeastern and it's environment. It cares about students, has a great location in the city but still feels like a campus and has great classes and activities. My only thing I find trouble with is they emphasize every little thing, even if it isn't super relevant. It can get overwhelming and it would probably help to consolidate some of these aspects of the school."
Sophomore,4,The connections and placement is great and the co-op programs seem like a great opportunity to gain experience in the outside world.
Alum,4,"A school with many diverse opportunities if you look for them. Getting involved in school activities is a must. 24/7 library access has saved many students and also is a great place to bond with study groups. Classes can be hit or miss depending on the professors. The physical therapy professors are fantastic. Co-op can also be a hit or miss depending on how well-established the program is at the university and whether you apply to the good coops where students always go. Overcrowding has become an issue lately with student centers, the gym, the library, and sometimes dining hall. Dorms vary hugely in quality unless you decide to pay a premium for the newer housing units. Also, tuition continues to rise. The campus itself is a gorgeous green space with great access to the city of Boston due to both the green line and orange line MBTA on campus."
Senior,4,Taking classes online when the pandemic first hit was a shock and a good and bad thing. The classes were significantly easier since the professors felt bad and the students were extra stressed having to move in 3 days and also keep up with classes. Some teachers decided to pre-record lectures while other's stayed live. The online learning experience was highly dependent on the professor.
Junior,4,"Northeastern has fully embraced the new online learning environment. Aside from their quick and relatively successful transition from in-person learning, they also offer constant discussions, town halls, workshops, and free seminars online to keep students engaged during the summer (something I do not recall to the same extent pre-covid). This fall is shaping up to be more of the same experience. It's not optimal, but Northeastern is coping."
Junior,4,"Northeastern delivers on what it promises, but for those looking for the fullest-possible college experience it may leave some to be desired.

Firstly, the positive: Northeastern's co-op program, counseling, professors, and food are amazing and leave little to be desired. Important to note is that this school does not give a liberal arts education--many of the classes taken are very ""skills-based,"" especially in STEM majors, so you can squeak by without very much critical thinking. This is not necessarily Northeastern's fault, as they make clear going in you are being set up for a job, but it is still what I considered a valuable part of the college experience that was lacking.

The biggest downside is the aforementioned ""skills-based"" approach that makes attending this school sometimes not feel like real college. It all seems to be preparation for working. Obviously, this is an important takeaway from college but I feel it could be more balanced."
Sophomore,4,"Online learning simply doesn't suit my learning style. However, given the unexpected and rapid change in situation, I think the majority of the professor adapted pretty well. The only problems were group projects and engagement with the courses overall."
Senior,4,I've had a great experience here so far! I'm sad to be graduating so soon- the opportunities here have really set me up for the real world though.
Senior,4,I've had a great experience here so far! I'm sad to be graduating so soon- the opportunities here have really set me up for the real world though.
Alum,4,"The co-op program at NEU is by far the biggest benefit of the school. Co-ops are so much better than internships: working at a company for 6 months gives you more time to gain experience and exposure, to make a good impression on employees, and to learn more on the job. 3-4 month summer internships have nothing on the co-op program."
Alum,4,"I took some classes online while I was on co-op in order to complete my minor. It worked relatively well, I think that in the five years since they have greatly improved."
Sophomore,4,I like NEU's global opportunities and co-op program. Studying abroad is easy and encouraged. The co-ops prep us for the real world and students often land full-time jobs there.
Freshman,4,"Northeastern University is a very accomodating school with many resources. The students at NU are not only very well-prepared for the real world, but they are also ready to change the real world. The admin and professors are extremely helpful and gracious. The environment is perfect for both social and intellectual growth."
Freshman,4,"Northeastern University prides themself on being reachable and flexible online. Their interactive websites and platforms allow for easy communication, and their self-explanatory interface is easy-to-use."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the Boston campus and all the opportunities that are provided by the coop program. The professors can be hit or miss but overall the curriculum is great.
Alum,4,"Being at Northeastern showed me how important work experience was during my undergraduate years, and the co-op program allowed me to see which types of industries were best for me before I even graduated. 

There were so many class options available and I was able to get most things I needed through the online portal system.
 
In regards to social life, Northeastern is one of the best. It's a big school but since it's in Boston, the entire city (including Cambridge, MA) feels like one big university. However, unlike BU or Berklee, Northeastern has a full campus in the middle of the city, so you get the best of both worlds.

The cons of NU are similar to those of other private universities: they hire more adjuncts to avoid tenuring and increasing pay for professors; the President makes way more than his position warrants; tuition money is spent on the wrong things (read: the Curry Student Center doesn't need touch screen maps/guides)."
Alum,4,I went to Northeastern and I have found that I enjoyed the city.  Was a great place to have a college experience.
Junior,4,"Northeastern University is a great school with a very diverse student population and experienced professors. Academically the school is solid, it is rigorous without being overwhelmingly stressful, depending on your major. The co-op program is highly beneficial as its gives students the opportunity to have real life work experience as assists in getting students matched with jobs within their field of study. The academic and co-op advisors are as involved as the students want them to be. The architectural structure of the school is a bit old and outdated resulting in the campus itself not being very visually stimulating and aesthetic. There is a large student population and greek life is on the rise. Without joining clubs / greek life the social scene is a bit dead. Overall a great school and a great environment to be in for college."
Sophomore,4,The students and the professors worked really hard to make online learning work. The professors extended their availability and were lenient and understanding given the current situation. The material was covered to the best of their abilities and I'm grateful that they were passionate in their way of communicating it to the students and helping those who needed a better understanding.
Senior,4,"Online classes really depend on the effort the professor puts in. My experiences have varied but overall most of the professors will listen if you ask for more discussion or something, so it turns out alright."
Sophomore,4,"Better than expected as it was forced on us due to ClownVid-19.

-------------------------------------"
Alum,4,"To really fully enjoy Northeastern you must find your niche (ha, see what I did there?) but with all seriousness, take advantage of the 400+ clubs, recreational sports, and community atmosphere that you can create for yourself.  Don't be afraid to try new things and change your mind about it later. Like all things in life, your college experience is what you make it."
Junior,4,"I have felt more at home here at Northeastern than I have anywhere else most of my life. I have made life long friends here, and I believe that the education given is not only satisfactory but also challenging enough to where I can grow and learn."
Sophomore,4,"So far, I have enjoyed my experience at Northeastern University. I began in the NU.in program in Ireland which was an unforgettable experience I will always carry with me. Due to coronavirus, I only got to spend two months on the Boston campus. The workload definitely picked up in my transition; however, everything else went very smoothly. As an engineering major, the first year engineering tutoring center was a savior and second home to me. I found that the professors assigned a lot of homework on top of the hours of studying. However, if I managed my time well, there was still time and ways to have fun! Being in Boston, there's plenty of fun things to do all around. There is also the perk of being around a ton of other schools with endless new people to meet and parties to go to.  Overall, I love Northeastern! Really, my only complaint would have to be the cost."
Freshman,4,"Northeastern University prides itself on pre-professional development, which it delivers on by providing so many different opportunities. However, the student life scene is majorly lacking."
Freshman,4,"The only problem with Northeastern is that the dining halls are not that good and it is pretty expensive. However, the people are all friendly, the location is great, and the professors are qualified and and interesting. I have really enjoyed my time at Northeastern."
Sophomore,4,"I love Northeastern for the most part! I love that it is in a city and still has a campus, for starters. All of the students are hardworking and devoted in class but also know how to have fun - it's not an overtly competitive environment and everyone seems to really want to help each other out! It is really expensive, but you get so much more out of it than you would a typical undergraduate education because of co-op and all of the other experiential learning options. There is so much opportunity in so many different ways!"
Freshman,4,"Northeastern has a lot of great opportunities for learning inside and outside the classroom.  Its urban location enriches your college experience and gives you chances to interact with other college students and workplaces.  Overall, there is a strong career-focuses undertone.  However, I think the academics could approve.  Sometimes, the teaching feels very inactive and not as effective as it could be."
Freshman,4,"I had many great teachers and experiences with volunteering and student organizations on campus. However, there have been some bad experiences with the quality of food and dorming here."
Junior,4,"I enjoy having the opportunity to do service-learning or volunteering in the Boston community. This allows me to connect my coursework to what I am doing in real life, and it helps me understand the real community around me."
Sophomore,4,"Exploring is fun around the area and it makes it even better that there are two train stops right at the campus. It has a very homely feel to it, but definitely better than most city campuses. Other schools are very close by so you will never be alone. There is Fenway and Target which is always a plus. Very nice library and not confusing map of the campus."
Alum,4,"Great professors and resources, and a fun place to be in Boston. The school has grown a lot in the past several years, new buildings, more travel opportunities, etc."
Sophomore,4,The course selection is good and there have been some great professors my first year. The financial aid advisor that is assigned to me must be overworked because the response time leaves much to be desired.
Junior,4,"Love the campus, professors, clubs, and opportunities available to students. Only dislike how it’s been hard for me as a transfer student."
Junior,4,"I am a current Northeastern undergrad. Love the area (Boston), close proximity to a lot of different things. Love the coop program as well, definitely a major selling point."
Freshman,4,"Northeastern has strong academics and intelligent students and professors. As a freshman, I have only taken lower level courses and as a result professors haven't been very personally helpful, although this is probably due mostly to large lecture sizes. Dining halls are good but even better is accessibility to local dining which do take money from university IDs. Accessibility to Boston as a whole is easy with two T stations on campus."
Sophomore,4,Northeastern provides a good academic curriculum with a pre-professional set-up allowing students to be prepared even before they graduate. Most students as they receive their diploma already have one if not two job offers from their previous employers.
Freshman,4,"Exciting and unique opportunities provided for career development (via co-ops) and studying abroad (via Dialogues of Civilization). Beautiful campus, high quality dining halls, comfortable dorms. Everything is conveniently located and organized and classes are rigorous with generally good professors."
Sophomore,4,"I went abroad first semester. The co op program is very unique. Northeastern prepares you for the ""real world"" unlike other schools."
Junior,4,Generally very good with academic and co-op opportunities. Would like to see more access to makerspaces for engineering student groups on campus.
Junior,4,"Overall a good experience. Mostly good professors, school spirit, and of course co-op. It really needs better and cheaper housing options for its students to live on campus though."
Sophomore,4,"There’s always something to do since we’re in the city. The academic rigor is challenging, usually in a good way. However, some professors care more about their own professional goals than actually teaching which can make digesting material rather difficult. So, take advantage of the multitude of resources and opportunities on campus! Have study sessions with friends and discuss topics and go to tutoring! Don't reduce your character or your college life to a single number. You will waste the printing dollars. Save your past notes. They love their engineering students more than CAMD so you may feel under-appreciated. Be wary of fake friends who just want to network. Balance between schoolwork and partying. Join clubs - find people who enjoy the same things as you do! Those are friends who will help you continue to cultivate your passions into something productive.  Also, everyone will always seem so much busier, smarter, etc. than you. They're not. They're just different."
Freshman,4,Participating in the NUin Ireland Program at the UCD in Dublin. The support from the Northeastern staff while studying abroad has been amazing. From traveling to the US to Dublin was made especially easy and the transition was great. I've made many Northeastern friends and have also had the opportunity to make friends from all over the world. I am looking forward to going back to Boston and sharing my experiences.
Junior,4,Great school for learning experience. Their co-op program is key in guiding students through their careers. Take advantage of the resources they provide.
Senior,4,"Originally I wanted to study at Boston University but was heartbroken when they offered an insignificant amount of financial aid while Northeastern provided grants and scholarships. I decided to hold the University accountable to its promise of studying and working abroad. I am about to complete my third semester, and I spent one semester on the main campus, another studying in London, spent the summer conducting ethnographies in Rome, and am currently wrapping up a semester working at a major law firm in DC. I am now prepping to study abroad at the prestigious Science Po in Paris, so I would say that the University delivered on its promise. I also do not come from a financially comfortable background. Still, the University and its various offices offer near sufficient scholarships and grants. I can honestly say that I am happy that I could not afford BU because I know I would not have the same global experiences with a more conventional undergraduate degree."
Graduate Student,4,"Aside from some confusing emails about payments, everything else has been clear and easy to understand. All of the professors are helpful and seem to want to help the students, which is a plus."
Senior,4,"Northeastern is generally excellent. The co-op program is incredibly advantageous, and will allow me to graduate with two extensive internships already under my belt. Boston is an awesome college town, and Northeastern is at the heart of it."
Sophomore,4,"Northeastern University has been a great college for me as it fit the criteria I was looking for. It is in an urban setting, but the college is not hard to navigate. The professors truly want to help you and are great at giving you extra time if you need with office hours. Campus life is also amazing as there are so many clubs and activities always occurring."
Junior,2,"Online experience was very basic as of summer 2020. Professors work out their own method, some are better than the others. Overall, online learning experience is nothing close to what the tuition worth."
Alum,2,"I luckily transferred out of Northeastern before they transitioned online due to COVID-19. I have heard only negative feedback about their online courses - again, favouring American students where they have been very inflexible regarding time zones and forcing overseas students to commit to Eastern standard time. Furthermore, although not a student anymore I received an email saying that on-campus tuition was highly recommended and therefore I would have to quarantine for 14 days in a neutral country, and 14 days in the US before being allowed on campus. They didn't take any regards to how it would be mentally to quarantine for a month and just want as many students as possible on campus."
Alum,2,"As an international student I unfortunately had a very poor experience here. They do not seem to value international students at all, and just want as much money as possible from them, providing little support. For example, when requesting a scholarship there were none available to me due to my international status. 

Regarding academics, I had two good teachers here, however the others were all below average. I'm not sure whether coming from an IB background has over-prepped me for American college, however all the classes I took were very easy and dumbed down. 

I transferred out of Northeastern as soon as I could which was one of the best decisions of my life. Please don't waste money, time and energy going here if international, the high price tag and elitist snobbery doesn't make for a positive experience."
Senior,2,"Northeastern boasts its easily marketable traits and basically for being a top tier school. However, Northeastern is a diamond that if you decide to fog it up, the condensation will stick. I can have fun here but I am not happy here. At least 50% of professors don't care, advisors even less. Northeastern feels more like a CORPORATION than a university. This is not an exaggeration. By any means, money comes before your mental health. Speaking of, no student has kind words for the campus health clinic.

Student life can be lonely. People only pay attention to themselves. This is to say that the sense of family is hard to come by. If you have a strong foundation of family/friends back home, it's easy to notice the indifference or ingenuity of others. Very few are lucky enough to find ""their people."" I've asked many students and most feel out of place or wish they had chosen a different school to attend.

If you are choosing Northeastern simply for co-op, you're making the wrong decision."
Niche User,2,"Be aware of the housing crisis, especially if you live far away!!!! Housing is very limited, which is unfair to underclassmen"
College Freshman,2,"Everything in Boston closes extremely early, by 8 or 9pm all the stores are closed and there is no one on the streets even on Friday nights. There is only one nightclub that I know of that you can get into if you're underage, because they have 18+ nights on Fridays, and from what I've heard it's not great."
College Freshman,2,"I have a hard time with academics due to anxiety and difficulty focusing so I find it extremely hard to get good grades. I find the workload overbearing and too much and the classes too hard. I'm constantly stressed and anxious and I never seem to get the grades I want no matter how hard I try. However, most of my friends have mostly As and seem to find the workload normal so it might just be me."
College Freshman,2,"There are no parties on campus, people go over to Cambridge for MIT or Harvard parties all the time. There is only one club you can get into if you're underage because they have 18+ nights on Fridays, and I've heard it's not even that great. Everything in Boston closes extremely early, by 8 or 9pm most stores are closed and there is no one on the streets."
College Freshman,2,"I struggle with school quite a bit due to anxiety and problems focusing so I find classes extremely hard and the workload overbearing and too much. I'm always incredibly stressed and anxious and it seems no matter how hard I try I can't get the grades I want. However, most of my friends have mostly As and find the workload normal so it might just be me."
College Sophomore,2,"Northeastern's co-op program is the best and it heavily influenced my decision to go there. While it's academics are overall rather challenging, I have found in my experience that the professors are either very involved in teaching their courses or they are pretty disinterested and don't even bother to learn who their students are. Regardless of their teaching styles or general interest or disinterest in their classes, it often feels as though they to believe that their class is the only one that matters."
College Freshman,2,"The racial diversity is a joke- this school is literally a sea of whiteness. Economically, almost everyone is upper middle class or VERY rich and its easy to feel alienated as a working class student. Politically, the student body is very split- most people seem kind of apathetic bordering on conservative, but there is also a strong and wonderful activist community for leftist and social justice-oriented students. As a member of the LGBTQ community, I have been met with nothing but acceptance from all of my peers, but there are a few rare instances of intolerance."
College Student,2,City school = drug abundance.
College Freshman,2,"Northeastern is division one, but most nights you wouldn't know it. Varsity sports are not very well attended and I haven't known anyone to watch club sports. Men's hockey and basketball can occasionally pull a few hundred students and for big events, Beanpot or NCAA tournament the community suddenly falls in love with the team. Most games though even for these two sports have 50-100 fans at most. 

Intramurals are big on campus and are a lot of fun. There are a lot of choices and everyone can play. The rules are fairly strict though so you have to play nice. Have you ever wanted to play hockey but weren't athletic enough and can't skate? We have you covered with broomball. (Its exactly what you think it is)."
College Senior,2,I hate all the rich people and elitist attitude that has come with the schools rise in ranking. So many rat racers.
College Senior,2,the health clinic is over populated
College Sophomore,2,I don't do Greek life. Nobody cares about it here
College Freshman,2,I personally do not see a point in Greek life.
College Sophomore,2,"Academically, this school is up to par. Higher level professors are competent anf good teachers. NU Core teachers/1st level teachers are often foreign and hard to understand. There are always tons of things to do on campus, and Boston is an exciting/overwhelming place. The main reason that I have found a distaste for Northeastern is because their academic advisors are not competent. The 'NU Shuffle' is absolutely real, and unless you get in their faces during every free second of your day, nothing gets done. It's hard to balance schoolwork with ensuring that every single thing that you haven't thought of yet is being done by your advisors. Said advisors lack education on disabilities and mental health, and tney are not able to make any autonomous decisions for students with these disabilities. You will be referred to university health and counseling even if you don't need counseling. It saddens me and has soured my experience."
College Junior,2,"Greek life is almost non-existent and when it is, it's just another booth to avoid in the quad."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is not a big part of campus life.
College Student,2,"Northeastern is not really a party school. The few times I tried to find a party they were often busted by the cops. You need to know people to know where the parties are and trying to party in a freshman res hall is just stupid because the rooms are tiny and the doors are not soundproof, an RA will find you. Nightlife is hard if you're under 21. Boston businesses are really good at catching fakes. I now just go to a friends apartment and chill, fairly low-key stuff but it's nice"
College Student,2,After months of struggling with the Financial Aid office and going through the NU Shuffle (every department tells you you need to speak with someone else first and you end up going in circles never getting answers) I was finally able to get the financial aid I needed. This was however after I put a deposit down on another school and after the deadline to put a deposit down at Northeastern. In the five months before the deadline when I tried to get more money they were immovable however after I had given up hope and the deadline passed I finally got what I needed. It was a nightmare.
College Freshman,2,"While students have been fighting to get a sexual health resource center on campus for the longest time (every other Boston-area college has one), it hasn't happened yet. Administration seems apathetic towards the issue of sexual assault and the school is facing a Title IX investigation. Additionally, the health center's same day appointment only policy makes it difficult to book a time. Mental health resources are lacking."
College Freshman,2,"The only people that care about Greek life here are Greeks. Lame parties, lame frat boys, no housing."
College Student,2,"Most the places you can go to that are close to campus are expensive...it's Boston. And the places that are cheaper, kinda shade."
College Freshman,2,"The only sport anyone cares about is hockey. When we're good it's fun. When we're bad, it's terrible."
College Freshman,2,It's super expensive. And most of it is on the hill which means either a twenty minute walk to campus or spending five dollars a day and using the notoriously unreliable green line train.
College Freshman,2,"Off campus food is awful. Everything around is not only a chain usually, but also very expensive and honestly pretty sub par. Not to mention the fact that there are no student discounts to soften the high costs. It is nice late at night ocassionally"
College Freshman,2,The administration run the school like jerks. There's a lot of clear money grubbing that occurs as well as very strict policies on drugs and alcohol.
College Freshman,2,"The dining halls are terrible in my opinion. Even if you find something you like, you'll end up eating it so much until you hate it. The only tolerable option is Rebeccas and they close by 5 and is usually so crowded that it can take you 30 minutes or more to get food."
College Freshman,2,"If you're a freshman, you're options aren't great. Space is tight in Boston so the rooms are usually smaller. If you end up in IV you do get the advantage of living above a dining hall, but you also live very far from campus. It does get better when you get older, but it's also super expensive."
College Freshman,2,"NU claims that plenty of students receive their full required aid, but I would like to beg to differ. Most of the people here who receive aid receive under $10,000, which, when you're paying for NU tuition, isn't a dent. The financial aid office is also not a fun place to deal with, but they can answer your questions and ultimately help you understand why you're not getting any aid (lol)"
College Senior,2,"Off-campus housing in the area around campus is pretty much one of two things: extremely small and very expensive, or for slightly less but still way too much money, you can be in a more dangerous area with careless landlords."
College Freshman,2,"There's some support for the men's hockey and basketball teams. With high attendance at the Beanpot (annual tourny with Harvard, BC, and BU). Other than that, there's not much excitement around the varsity sports and varsity athletes."
College Senior,2,"Unless you are 21, there isn't really a party scene."
College Senior,2,"This is not at fault of the college.  There is not much assistance for Graduate students unless you have already gone to school and are eligible for the ""double husky"" scholarship.  Financing has been a struggle for me and I needed to work two jobs in order to be able to afford a decent home and be able to pay for the bills that weren't covered by my loans."
College Sophomore,2,I've heard bad stories about our counseling center. Going for shots and general physical health in my experience hasn't been so bad.
College Sophomore,2,"Northeastern is not a huge party school. I end up at apartment parties more often than not. Make friends who like to throw parties in their apartment or dorm. Frat parties are at other schools and annoying to get to, but available if that's what you want."
College Sophomore,2,Landlords suck. Housing is sketchy and expensive.
Recent Alumnus,2,"We don't have a lot of varsity sports and they are not widely attended by students. With the exception of men's hockey and basketball, no one goes to sporting events and even those sports don't draw huge crowds. Our teams are not very good."
College Sophomore,2,Very bad and expensive to boot.
College Junior,2,Off campus housing is very expensive if you want to live in a safe and proximate area to the school.
College Senior,2,My paperwork was always lost or not received. Eventually I lost out on a grant that would have saved me nearly a thousand dollars a semester. Enough said.
College Sophomore,2,"I can only speak for the Marino Center, the gym where all students have access and the weight room is way too cramped. 3 floors of cardio equipment, a 100-squre foot weight room. 

Though, it looks cool from the outside."
College Sophomore,2,Too expensive and nothing near by.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a month and a half-long period of time from September when going to class is great, because the weather is great. As soon as it gets cold, however, it's difficult to motivate oneself to get out of bed and deal with the dreary weather."
College Sophomore,2,"I've had very little luck with any type of relationship at Northeastern because people are always coming and going (co-ops, studying abroad, etc)."
College Freshman,2,"It's a private university, so expect it to be quite expensive. I've gotten a decent financial aid package, but half of it is loans. The problem is that this school spends more of its budget on making unnecessary renovations (such as the entire first floor of the library, or spending millions of dollars on making a new research building) than financially helping the students."
College Student,2,Greek life is not a major part of life here on campus. I honestly don't know much about them.
College Sophomore,2,Very very cold winters but really nice in the spring and summer.
College Student,2,"Greek life is pretty non-existant on campus, but we still go out and have a good time here! We are in a city with a bunch of other schools, after all! It's nice to not have that kid of pressure."
College Freshman,2,"Poor orientation for NU in students who start in January 

No halls and rooms that are open to encourage socialization

Need way better perks and some events for us"
College Freshman,2,"The state of Massachusetts does not permit the existence of greek housing, and this has resulted in a lack of greek life presence on campus."
College Freshman,2,August is muggy and from then on it's freezing.
College Freshman,2,"Once you turn 21 it's good, but fakes don't work in Boston and parties get broken up or capped out pretty often."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is definitely growing here, but it's nothing special and we don't really do much. Sororities don't have houses because of some ancient brothel rule, but a lot of sisters end up living together in apartments anyways."
College Sophomore,2,Cost of off campus housing is very high for the quality
College Freshman,2,"Every week in the school newspaper, you see incidents of where the police had to send someone to OSCCR because they were caught doing marijuana in their dorms or in the alleys."
College Student,2,"I'm from South Florida... It is way too cold here. I can't feel my hands and face on my way to class, I want to cry."
College Student,2,"Parking permits are too expensive, and there is barely any parking ever."
Graduate Student,1,The Bouve College of Health is not worth the price tag.  The administration expreriences constant turnover of staff and the whole college is poorly run.  Its frustrating when people who manage programs leave. The co-op program is super overrated. You can get co-ops on your own. If you are studying physical therapy or nursing it is not worth paying top dollar. Save your money and go to a public school!!
Freshman,1,"This school is a waste of my time, energy, and MONEY. They only help kids who know exactly the pre-professional track that they want to be on. They hire teachers that do not care about their students and find ways to see them fail. They hire advisors that will only do the bare minimum for their students. They throw you into courses and experiences that you are not prepared for and give you little to no guidance. Every person I have met here in the STEM field feels the same way. No matter how much time and energy I put into my work, it is never enough. Save your money and mental health and do not go to this school."
Graduate Student,1,"I highly request for all international students not to consider this university at any cost. Only come if you don't have any other offer from any other university. 
Highly unprofessional behavior towards international students, as they hardly care. All they want is money and that's it! 

They have great marketing strategy to brag about Co-ops but guess what they won't even allow international students to utilize their full CPT of 12 months period unlike other universities. 

They will charge extra for everything even for I-20 OPT like $200 and take triple the time(45 days) to process it for such a crucial documentation like EAD application, while other universities take 2-3 days. 
I can go on and on about the THEIR SPECIAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS. 
Bottom line: Take advice from the graduate students who are currently in this university. We don't even call this a university, it is a well established business corporation."
Niche User,1,"Most prejudice school I’ve ever been to. A waste of time, people, and “opportunity.” Never go here, please. Save your time and money."
Sophomore,1,"Elitist and exclusive community. Never did I think a campus experience in the middle of Boston would be so unenjoyable. Professors and advisors outside of Northeastern's niches (business and engineering) were often not able to answer questions that I was looking for. The Northeastern Portal, NEU, is a flawed system that makes it close to impossible to take care of any financial holds or services without spending hours on the phone. Overall, I hope no one has a college experience like I did during my time here."
Niche User,1,This school dumped me when I needed them the most in 2014. My program was eliminated online and now I had to find another school that had my major online. Very disappointed.
College Freshman,1,"There are no parties on campus, people go to MIT or Harvard for parties instead. There might be some frat parties in the nearby Mission Hill neighborhood but you must personally know someone in the frat to be able to get in."
College Freshman,1,"There are no parties on campus. Everyone goes to other schools for parties instead. There are a few frat parties in the nearby Mission Hill neighborhood but you have to personally know people in the frat to get in. They don't look like great parties anyway, no music, just a bunch of drunk frat boys."
College Sophomore,1,"Safety is fine. The campus is well-lit and people generally get home safe from wherever they end up at night. Health, however, is a catastrophe. I have had friends with ailments ranging from a deep, infected gash on the leg to mono to acute depression and campus health services has screwed them all over. My friend with a leg wound was seen at University Health services, and a few weeks later the wound went septic and she had to be hospitalized. My friend who had mono was told by UHCS that it was just a virus that would pass after a few days. She was sick for months. My friend with acute depression was essentially pawned off on a low-rate counselor who told her that her sexuality was invalid and that she should just ""be happy"". Northeastern has no reliable service for any kind of mental health problem or suicide prevention. It's disgusting."
College Student,1,I got no aid from the school. If I am not able to get financial aid for the next few years I may very well have to transfer schools. Even though our income is lower than it used to be my financial aid advisor said that since neither of my parents have lost their jobs that there will be no change to how much aid I am given. The only thing I can do is send an appeal and see if that does anything.
College Senior,1,"Due to the program I'm in, I don't qualify for financial aid."
College Freshman,1,The lottery system is the absolute worst. Everything else is fine but last year when I was applying for housing for this year by the time me and my friends highest lottery came around there were very few rooms left and many of my friends had lottery numbers so high that by the time it was their turn there weren't any girl housing left.
College Student,1,"There's really no decent greek housing at NEU, and the fraternity brothers tend to be douchebags."
College Student,1,"If you're a freshman guy, good luck."
College Junior,1,"Grad students don't get financial aid, but either way, the communication in the financial aid office is poor and they little to nothing to help in assisting students to find alternative methods of finding financial resources."
College Junior,1,The housing is absurdly expensive and poor quality for the price. I could afford my own studio apartment for what it would cost to live in a shared room in the nicer dorms. I would not move back to campus.
College Sophomore,1,NEU is extremely stingy for its aid and less understandbly so since it's such an expensive university to attend.
College Junior,1,There are none for my program.
College Freshman,1,"The weather in Boston is mercurial.  The snow sucks, and it's usually overcast."
College Freshman,1,Horrible winter has affected social and school severely
College Freshman,1,"No one cares about the varsity sports here. There are almost twice as many club athletes and unless you play, no one cares about club sports. Intramurals are pretty popular, but as for school spirit I see barely any. If you want big sports, go to a state school."
College Freshman,1,"For students who rely solely on financial aid to go to school in Boston, finding an apartment within your budget is almost impossible. Expect to pay $1000 per month to live in a mediocre apartment."
College Junior,1,Do not like driving in Boston
College Freshman,1,"This school is absurdly strict. However, it goes beyond that. No, you can't find parties, at least starting out, and yes, you will get busted for doing anything even remotely illegal. But at least these things are standard.

5 of my friends were just written up for noise complaints. They were asked to quite down once, and then, almost an hour later, an RA came down the stairs and said that, even though he couldn't actually hear them from the stairwell and they weren't being that loud, he had to write them up because there had been so many warnings. He then said ""Oh wait, no there haven't, I'm getting you confused with foruth floor."" But then said he need to write them up anyway, giving no reason why. One girl was on her way to the bathroom in a robe when he came down and was clearly not even part of the group, and he said that she was clearly in the wrong place at the wrong time, but that he was going to write her up anyway. They all now have to attend hearings to decide their punishments. Things like this just happen here.

Also recently, an RA smelled weed and thought it was coming from one students room, so he called the police. The police searched his room and, got angry that he found nothing, and pointed to a fleck of dirt on his floor, saying it was clearly ash and wrote him up for smoking cigarettes in his room. They didn't even follow proper procedure in investigating it. He has never smoked in his room and many people examined it. It was clearly just dirt. If he gets convicted at his hearing, which he very well based on two police officers saying there was dirt there because they were mad, he will get expelled.

These are just 2 examples.

This campus is beyond strict; it's irrational and corrupt. There are no adults or administration looking out for you. They are not there for you. There is no support system for you. There is only punishment, regardless of the situation or your guilt. Have fun."
College Sophomore,1,"The lack of parking is more of a reflection on having a campus in the city. It's a nightmare to park anywhere in Boston, and the same is true of Northeastern. Be careful where you park because many students don't look at the signs (2 hour parking, resident parking only) and end up with tickets. If you want to park in a university garage, it'll be pretty expensive."
College Freshman,1,"When you have freshman orientation and ask mentors about the party scene, they just say ""oh, well, it will get better when you turn 21"". But you don't believe it, because you've seen all of these crazy house party movies like Project X, so you're just like never mind, I'll find the way. But in fact, if you don't know the right people from MIT, Harvard, BU or BC - you will stay home all night long because party scene in this particular university actually sucks. You can go to Mission Hills and frat parties in other colleges but Northeastern never throws the right ones and that's sad guys. Nice college with great academics and awful parties. You fail, come again later"
College Sophomore,1,The early weeks of the semester are a beautiful transition from summer to fall but fall quickly turns into an unbearably cold winter which does not end by the end of the spring semester.
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek life at Northeastern is lame. No one participates.
College Junior,1,"Parking pass for a semester $800, pro-rated if you have a job that requires a car $400. Parking outside of NU = impossible. Best bet find a friend up in mission hill that has a house with parking spots and give them $50 a month. 

Only up side, parking at NU is within 5-10 of every academic building"
College Junior,1,It costs quite a lot for parking. I tend to opt for taking the train.
College Senior,1,There are very few scholarships accessible to transfer students. Most scholarships are given to students that come straight from high school.
College Student,1,The police force can be pretty strict about underage drinking and drug use. The police are also far too large of a presence everywhere on campus and even threaten that they have undercover student in Freshmen dorms. Almost every cop here reminds me of a bully from high school who just cant wait for a chance to mess with anyone who got past their GED
College Freshman,1,"I don't have a car on campus because parking is expensive. The transit system here is awesome with two lines right here on campus. It is by far the best way to get around Boston, and you never have to worry about finding a parking space!"
College Freshman,1,Parking is available for student but at a very high price. There is no need for a car or parking services in Boston because you can take the T everywhere.
College Student,1,"It's better to just walk, have a bicycle, or take the subway to get to places. Having a car to finding parking(which is almost impossible, and very expensive) is not worth it in Boston."
College Freshman,1,Greek life is not dominate here. You might see some and you might attend some party but other than that its okay. It not like what you see in the movies or what greek life is like in the south.
College Junior,1,Oncampus parking is unbelievably expensive. Most people who go to this school make enough cash so that if they have a car they can probably get their parents to front the cash for a space. I can't imagine why you'd need a car in a city like this unless you want to head up north to ski or board.
College Senior,1,"there is no transportation provided by the school, nor is there any way for an off campus injured student to get to school besides walking.  public transportation is great but dont use the green line"
College Junior,1,"It's really inconvenient that Northeastern only guarantees 3 out of 5 years of housing. Northeastern does host a website where students can post if they need a room or have a room available. It's not the greatest system, especially if you are at home for the summer (away from Massachusetts) and need to look for a place to stay for the upcoming semester. Also, Boston is crazy expensive."
Recent Alumnus,1,I did have a professor lie about when I submitted an exam even when I provided email backup no one budged. Also same professor and major refused to let me substitute a course to graduate which ended up in me waiting a whole year for the course to come around again so I could graduate.
College Freshman,1,"There are a few chapters of Greek life at Northeastern, but there is hardly a presence. They don't have houses, so there is no Greek row. There's less than 10% participation. If you're looking for a school whose social life does not revolve around Greek life, this is a great place for you. If you want to feel like a part of that kind of group, they're around and they host events on campus, but the time constraints aren't as prevalent as they would be at a school with bigger Greek life."
College Junior,1,"No Fun Until You're 21 – They are some house parties for those under 21 but some can be far away. Boston has a city-wide policy against 18+ clubs so there are some clubs that have a 18+ night but usually people don't like it as much as the house parties. Once you're 21 though, the city becomes an amazing place to be."
College Freshman,1,No Real Sports Scene – You can definitely find sports if you seek them out but it doesn't present a huge part of the average students daily life.
College Junior,1,UNCONCERED COUNSELOR – My undergrad financial aid counselor was unreceptive and took days to respond to emails/calls. She was also  not forthcoming with alot of information as I have heard some others are. She did not  help me with the process instead she only emailed when I went to her supervisor.
College Senior,1,"You Don't Come for Sports  - Except Hockey – Northeastern isn't known for sports. Football was recently cut, and most other teams are pretty mediocre. There aren't any wild crowd gatherings at games for the most part, because being located in the middle of a bustling city takes away the ability for a sprawling building and huge fields that non-city schools enjoy. Such is the trade-off of city living. NU does have Matthews Arena, a historic site in Boston, where the decent basketball team and pretty good - occasionally awesome hockey teams play. Hockey is the biggest sport at NU, and there have been a number of recent players drafted to the NHL (i.e. Thiessen, goalie - Penguins ). The crowd gets pretty intense at hockey games, and that's where you see a great display of Husky pride. While you don't get crazy football games at NU, you get great restaurants, bars, culture, and a constancy of things to do!"
College Freshman,1,"Social Life – I find that there are a very specific type of person that attends this university, that I do not fit in with at all. A lot of the students come from wealthy backgrounds and the school is extremely international. I have had a extremely difficult time meeting people that I get along with. The social aspect of this school is horrific."
College Freshman,1,"NUPD, while a necessary force on campus (Northeastern is close to some sketchy areas) usually has nothing better to do than bust kids for drinking and smoking. Punishments at Northeastern are very severe, for instance even through marijuana is decriminalized in MA and Boston cops don't care about it, if NUPD catches you, you're automatically on academic probation, and will be suspended next time you get in trouble for anything. Be smart, don't smoke in a freshman dorm room, you will be caught, and be smart about drinking as well"
College Sophomore,1,"Don't Bring a Car – You can pay for parking in lots around campus, but its expensive. Street parking is hard to come by during the day too. Not worth it to have a car, but its not needed anyway."
College Freshman,1,I do not drive but I know my friends always have no luck finding parking
College Sophomore,1,"Unbelievably Hard for Lower-Class Students to Attend – Looking at the other reviews, I don't know if this is much of a secret but here it is... Northeastern's financial aid is terrible!

In just one short year I have had three count that THREE different counselors two of whom either had no interest in responding to my emails or phone calls. I have visited the financial aid office on many occasions (mainly due to the counselor's refusal to respond to my emails) only to find that the counselor wasn't available to speak with me for a various reasons.

The financial aid package I received was severely lacking and asked me to pay more than $10,000 beyond my EFC. Coupled with the high costs of living in a city like Boston and you've got a recipe for a terrifyingly stressful school life. Good luck to those of you who are applying for financial aid at Northeastern. Luck and patience are the only things that'll get you through this labyrinthine bureaucracy, because the counselors sure as hell wont."
College Sophomore,1,"Good Luck – like with on campus housing- you can pay a bunch of money and live in a decent place nearby, or you can live on mission hill, which is about 13948625983 miles away from campus. landlords tend to screw students who don't know any better"
College Sophomore,1,"the price of tuition is JACKED, so if it seems like you're getting a fat scholarship, remember to look at your overall cost of tuition. i learned soon after getting there that pretty much every single student gets the same 15K scholarship, so don't think youre special. any other aid is pretty much out of the question."
College Sophomore,1,"no. dont even try it. if you've ever been to a party before, prepare to be disappointed. if you've never been to a real party, then i guess you can't get hurt by this experience."
College Sophomore,1,jokes. they don't even have houses. 110% pointless.
College Sophomore,1,"Not Very – there are mostly spoiled while new-englanders, a bunch of indians from new jersey, and various international students, but they NEVER intermix. international students keep with others from their respective country or region, and although there are no ""challenges"" or ""acceptance"" issues, the school seems very segregated."
College Sophomore,1,"dear god. i'm from the southwest and i knew to expect ""cold cold cold"", but NO ONE told me how UGLY UGLY UGLY this place is eleven months out of the year. if you aren't used to god-awful weather, don't go here"
College Sophomore,1,"The ""Honors Program&quot – feels like a scam. i was told the honors program was difficult to get into, and that i would be in more challenging courses, as well as extra advising for honors students. the honors program turned out to be a complete joke- not only is it extremely easy to get into, (for rich kids), our so-called ""honors classes"" were completely pointless- honors sections did the exact same work as the other sections. only real difference is, you pay MORE for housing."
College Student,1,"Ugh, FML – First of all, the trains stop running at 1 AM, so save a lot of cab money or prepare to never party at all. The green line, the one that runs through campus, is always crowded and doesn't run that often. The drivers love to stop short so that everyone on the ""train"" (if you can even call it that) ends up falling all over each other."
College Student,1,"If You Can, AVOID! Too expensive. Once you go out, you might never go back to on-campus housing."
College Student,1,"Welcome to the North Pole – If you're not used to cold weather, then you're basically going to be in a very long hibernation period from November until mid-April."

Graduate Student,5,"I went through the Culinary Arts Program and loved every bit of it! Chef Tony Parker is a very valuable person to get to know and have on your side. He has so many connections around the country which could get you a great job opportunity. The lunches for the whole school are made by the culinary program and there's also a fine dining room which has a new menu every 2 weeks. Talk to Chef Parker and get to know when the capstones are, the capstones are the culinary graduates doing their final project (so they're usually pretty yummy!) and it's usually only around $15 for a five course meal!"
Niche User,5,"I love this college because the teachers are very supporting and they love to teach and help the students. They are very kind and helpful even when i go to the office to ask a question that i need answered.I think that the overall experience is great, i have finished my first certificate here and the instructor has helped me a lot."
Freshman,5,"The first day I walked into the Student Center to inquire about starting my college education, I was greeted with a smile, directed to the person(s) who would help me start my college career.  Very knowledgeable, professional and willing to help whomever comes through the door.  I am thankful to be part of a college that is inclusive and appreciates students of all kinds of diversity."
Freshman,5,The staff and students are extremely friendly. The school really wants you to succeed and they do anything possible to help you.
Niche User,5,I like how friendly the counselors are and how welcome they make you feel the moment you begin looking into this college. They are great people willing to help you get a degree fast and get you into the real world pretty fast.
Graduate Student,5,Staffs are so friendly willing to help students and direct them to the right departments to get help.
Freshman,5,I like the environment of RTC. My peers are all amazing people and i wish them the best to succeed!!!
Alum,5,"I am an alumni from Renton Technical College, and I have achieved so much since then. I hope nothing changes and the people who helped me will keep helping other students like me ."
Niche User,5,This is my first quarter at RTC! I have really enjoyed all of my classes. My instructors are very informative and helpful with everything as well as other staff and student tutors. I love the atmosphere and am currently studying Entrepreneurship & small business management.
Sophomore,5,This college has helped me grow as a person and inspired me to push myself to be the best me. The instructors have been and continue to be genuinely caring of their students and I am proud to call myself a Renton Technical College student.
Freshman,5,"Renton Technical College is a great location, very friendly people, and lot of programs available to study. The only issue is that sometimes there is no parking"
Freshman,5,"Renton Technical College is a very pleasant place to go to school.  It seems to have a staff that encourage success.  The atmosphere is very diverse and seems that all are welcome.  They have a variety of programs & even culinary.  I personally enjoy the wonderful scent of the bakery every morning.  And my classmates seem to love the fresh made donuts.  But besides the bakery & the pleasant friendly staff, we also enjoy a wide variety of programs in the medical field & even automotive.  Overall, I believe the atmosphere is build for all students to be successful, whether young or old."
Freshman,5,I am in my first quarter at Renton Technical College and it has been a blast so far. RTC is up-to-date on all the latest technology and resources. There are tutors for every sort of class you could need. The faculty has been extremely helpful and my classmates are supportive. I feel safe on campus. The student leadership is always planning fun events for students to do!
Freshman,5,"I can't say much, since I've just recently signed up. Although enjoyed the staff helping me with it."
Freshman,5,"I wouldn’t change the campus to much, I’d maybe like to see more interaction between the different department by maybe hosting a holiday dinner party and also a change in the menu. The food is the same in a weekly basis and doesn’t offer much choices other then that, I absolutely love campus and the welcoming arms of the students and teachers . It’s only my first year but I feel like I’ve learn so much already. Can’t wait to see the many changes I will go through here at RTC."
Junior,5,I have a had a very positive experience here while taking pre requisite courses for the nursing program.  Everyone from administration to teaching faculty has been helpful and friendly.
Junior,5,"I have been attending RTC for about 4 years now and couldn't be happier with my choice in schools. My goal when I began attending RTC was to finish my course pre-requisites to get into an accredited ADN program, and I did just that, with the help of the professors and advisors at this school. I finished my AAS degree prior to gaining admission into the ADN program, or RN program, and couldn't be happier to attend this school! The professors are helpful and knowledgeable with many years of clinical experience."
College Senior,5,"Due to the online classes I take at RTC, I only have to go to school at least 3 days a week. When I do go to school, it's only for 3 hours long, so I have plenty of time to study and volunteer. RTC also offers hybrid classes which is mostly online, but you have to come to the campus at least once a week for lectures. RTC offer early morning classes starting around 8am and even evening classes as late at 5pm."
College Senior,5,"I'm in the running start program and if anyone thought that running start student get any special treatment.. We do not. It's nice is be around a more mature environment where staffs and other classmates look at you like a college student. The amount of workload in my opinion is a lot, but that's because I was the top grades. You have to  work for what you want right? Doing this program allows me to take on more challenging classes and discover what I'd like to be one day. Overall, RTC's running start program has been growing and I'm glad to see other highschoolers challenge themselves. The running start advisor, Debbie Rundle, has helped me a lot throughout my first year in college."
College Senior,5,"Depending on the course, you can work with the instructor and work something out if you have a job or children that cannot be moved around. The instructors are very understanding and very flexible when you just ask them. Transferring credits depends on what the class is/was, in my experience i had to classes from another community college and Renton Tech found the class description they best matched and transferred them for me right away. One of which is a degree requirement and one is an elective."
College Senior,5,Very career oriented and everyone is pushing you to do your best to get into the work force. Classrooms become very good friends and you have a sense of comfort while you attend your stay.
College Senior,5,"Very many courses are offered and the class sizes are very ideal, 15-20 max in a classroom. You have the availability to speak with your instructor in private without making an appointment, and the instructors are very open to questions and giving advice. The courses are at a medium level, and the instructors are willing to work with you to achieve your ultimate goal of a certificate/degree. The courses are very on topic and based on what you want and need to learn for that career."
College Senior,5,"Learning Business at Renton Technical College so far has been very beneficial and will in return give me the things I need to pursue my career in Business. Upon beginning Renton Technical College, I had been interviewed for a Business Marketing Internship and since then have been working with Helac Corporation. The career center and service on campus has also made me realize I would like to pursue more education with Accounting."
College Senior,5,"The goal at Renton Technical is to find everyone a job, or give them the skills to enter the work force. There is a book of current jobs and internships everyone can apply for that are categorized by job/career. In most courses, the fourth or fifth quarter is designed to be a work study or internship, so you get college credits while learning your profession in the work force."
College Senior,5,"They have a wide variation from nurse, business, cook, etc Carter's at Renton Technical College. I have been in touch with the professors and they have been very kind."
College Student,5,I like how I am getting the basic down.
College Student,5,"Online courses is amazing. Also, Canvas is too"
College Senior,5,They inform you through phone or email to tell you what you need to do this or that. They are very informative and they take care of the students that are associated with them.
College Senior,5,"My program of study at Renton Technical College is face-to-face, but most of our assignments and study materials are posted on Canvas, which is an online platform that this college is currently using. We have to turn in most of our assignments online which was somewhat challenging at the beginning, but now I am used to it. Overall, I think everything is nice because it helps me as a student to enrich my knowledge and be prepared for the real world challenges."
College Senior,5,"I am in still in school but when i had trouble with things I didn't understand, they helped me no matter what. Whether it was financially or class related."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Honestly, Renton Tech is amazing because you are almost guaranteed to get into the classes you want and need. They offer unique classes that are super helpful, and they don't fill up like the other schools in the area."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Both online and on campus classes are great. Because my online class is a science class I had to be on campus for 3 labs and then on campus for the final. It's very organized and super easy to follow. The classes are still challenging because you have to put in the time to make sure you are learning everything, but they are worth it. Especially if you have a full time job or other conflict. It's also super easy to get in touch with the professor for any questions. Registration is just as easy as on campus registration."
Recent Alumnus,5,"My school maintains a huge student body diversity. There are a lot of working class people looking to advance in their careers, switch careers, and/or get the education they need in order to continue moving forward. Many students have families and full time jobs. Most of the students are very, very nice and are friendly- especially to those that are in their class."
College Junior,5,This is a great school for everyone. Their classes are flexible for everyone and if your lucky maybe the classes you need are available in the afternoon. Other than that all stuff are very friendly and are happy to help you.
College Senior,5,"With the changes in healthcare under President Obama, the healthcare industry is ever-changing and morphing and current healthcare employees are having to be flexible in their learning and understanding of the new regulations and changes that will be taking affect over the next few years. Those in the industry that do not deal well with change are going to find that they will have to find another profession to go into. The college is training us to be flexible and giving us the knowledge we will need to deal with the changes and be successful in an ever-changing industry as we are currently studying the implementation of ICD-10-CM, the updated version of medical coding from ICD-9-CM."
College Senior,5,The flexibility of Renton Techs classes are amazing. I was able to switch arund my classes do to babysitting my younger siblings. They very much understood how many responsibilities i had with my younger siblings and i got all the classes i need and the times that i needed them at.
College Senior,5,"It's amazing, there are never any problems since i havebeen here. Everything is perfect, and everything s always up and ready to go on!"
College Senior,5,School provides tuition and scholarship to student every year.
College Senior,5,Full Time Student – All the program at RTC are full time and that great because everyone there is mostly unemployed are has a part-time job.
College Senior,5,Culinary Arts – The professors are passionate and teach from a lifetime of experience.  My college is one of few that offer American Chef Federation certification upon graduation.  I chose this program because of how well the community receives the students and reacts to our college.  This has been a great experience for the next step in my culinary journey.
Sophomore,4,It's a good affordable school. That's in a decent size city. It's close enough to bigger cities like Tacoma or Seattle. But yet far enough away to make housing more affordable than in one of those cities. The school offers help for lower income students. With a food pantry and free hygiene items. The classes are well taught and the teachers are extremely helpful and insightful. And willing to go the extra mile to help their students.
Freshman,4,"Renton Technical College is great for it's small campus and class sizes. The staff make it easy to receive all the help you may need to thrive in whatever your plans may be. There are more than enough resources for everyone- the library is never packed, they offer space like the Learning Resource Center, Scholarship and other funding staff, peer-to-peer help, advisers and more. The staff is super friendly and knowledgeable.

What I enjoy the most is that each program is designed for you to learn about the field of study. There is very little run around in their courses. What you enroll in is what you will focus on and there is space for you to do more learning in out-of-class clubs. The two things that I would change is the parking; the parking lot is usually full and street parking is hard to come by at certain hours of the morning.

Overall, Renton Technical is great for anyone who has an interest in any of the programs offered and for those who may not be sure."
Sophomore,4,"Most of the classes were well taught, and I learned a lot from them. It's also a very cheap college, managed to actually get paid via grants for going. However, it isn't easy to transfer out, and the computer science course isn't what it used to be, as a significant number of professors retired and/or quit."
Niche User,4,"I haven't been there yet, however i plan on going there with my internship group called the Youth Aerospace program that has partnered with this college"
Sophomore,4,"Renton Technical College has a variety of two-year programs and a very diverse population of students. Instructors are very experienced and educated in their field and offer full support and encouragement. The campus is safe, I have been attending Renton Technical College for two years and have never experienced an unsafe situation. Drills are performed regularly to ensure that students and staff know what to do in the event of a real situation. The campus was recently renovated and look nice and neat, but if you arrive around 10 AM in the morning, it is difficult to find a parking space. The food in the cafeteria is prepared by the culinary students, it’s inexpensive and tastes great!"
Freshman,4,"Free parking, many free student services.  Free Office suite for students.  Campus is kept in good shape.  Staff and teachers are friendly.  A lot of online and Hybrid classes."
Freshman,4,"In the events so far, the president Kevin McCarthy has sent out multiple reassuring emails to ensure all students feel safe and comfortable. There are many group events that are informative and inclusive. School is located close to many stores and food places which is convenient, but the cafe the school has is quite delicious and affordable. The professors I've encountered are helpful and want to see you succeed. When I have questions and feel unsure of what classes I should be taking for my degree the advisors were readily available to assist me."
Junior,4,"If you want to get your associate nursing degree at an affordable price this is the place. However, you will have a lot of self studying to do. The program is in the midst of new nursing leadership and though I have full confidence in the new staff; be prepared to be frustrated from time to time due to the implementation of a new academic structure."
College Senior,4,"I love online classes! RTC has this online instruction website were you have classes and view grades call ""Canvus."" It's very easy to use and a great way to contact your professors. The workload is fair, and you have do the assignment anytime you want, just make sure it's before the due date. Online classes is great for me because I like to get my work done a few days ahead and save time. The professors and students are all very engaging and it's fun having class discussions every week."
College Senior,4,"I've already completed my first year of college as a junior in high school. Next year, I will have graduating with a diploma and associates degree. RTC has allowed me to save money and get a head start on my career. I've been taking courses that fulfill my highschool and major credits. I want to soon enough attend school of public health and RTC is preparing me really well for my future plans."
College Senior,4,"The professors that I had were all really great. I like how they all provide students study guide for every upcoming tests and are always available after and before class to help. I find it really comfortable to talk and ask my professor questions because of the class size. The class size is fairly small, so everyone knows each other's name and we all get along very well. My biology class was on of my favorite because we've done a lot of group projects which also allowed me to bond with my classmates."
College Senior,4,RTC is the cheapest community college and I think it's a great school that offer classes at a reasonable price.
College Senior,4,"I'm currently a running start student, so being in a college level class is new to me. Although I was very nervous on my first day, most staffs and classmates were very nice. RTC offers a lot of online classes which I was skeptical about taking because I thought it would be hard without having a professor teaching you in person, yet the experience was quite easy! The professors made everything easy to understand and they always reply to my messages within 24 hours. The classroom size is small, so I was able to have a more one-on-one relationship with my professor. Overall, I wouldn't choose this school again only because they don't offer a lot of science classes."
College Senior,4,"So far, my experience has been good. RTC has a nice clinic to work in."
College Sophomore,4,I had no problems transferring credits.
College Sophomore,4,Nursing is one of the most in need jobs out there.
College Sophomore,4,I'm taking online classes so the availability of resources is great.
College Senior,4,There are many different cultures and ethnic groups at Renton Technical and the curriculum is based on discussions a lot of the time which is very interesting with the different cultures in every program! Many different political and religious views are expressed all over campus.
College Senior,4,"The courses aren't too expensive for what you get out of them, if you were to go to another community college or a university it would cost 2 or 3 times what I am paying for tuition right now. Financial Aid in general is very hard to achieve based on your state of attendance. In Washington State, it is very hard to get grants and scholarship based on income, because they require very low income to receive these awards."
College Senior,4,"The program is very business focused, on topic and you get to learn about what you came to school for. Business Operations at Renton Technical College has a medium workload and the professor is interested in teaching you what you need to know about business to succeed."
College Senior,4,"Renton Technical College has a lot of programs, but in each program they teach you what you need to know to enter the real work force, while also teaching you the specific skill you are needing. The work load is a medium level and they have tutors available all the time, online and in the library. Registration is also very easy and most times the instructor sets aside class time, so you don't have to go on your own time to the office."
College Senior,4,There are many events to attend and people to ask questions.
College Sophomore,4,there are all type of ethnicity and religious people in this school .
College Sophomore,4,"I mostly get to check and ask questions using canvas, and more of the responds are quick!"
College Sophomore,4,"getting into the program is quick and easy, the payment is manageable, and no pressure."
College Sophomore,4,"school building are categorizes by letters, each building has it specialty. you just have to remember it."
College Senior,4,"I have only recentl enrolled, school begins 22nd out September. I have a positive outlook."
College Senior,4,So far only been in contact with administration. They have been very helpful and flexible.
College Senior,4,So far from what I have seen it is friendly and hardworking. A detailed description will follow the more time I spen  in school. Currently starting classes.
College Student,4,running start at Renton tech has help me a lot in my education.
College Student,4,the experience at my school has been amazing. Great Staff and class room size
College Senior,4,"I had one online class and I experience having a very innovative teacher to associate student-student interaction, not I think most online's classes do. Not even in classrooms, maybe just a little."
College Senior,4,Class registration is very easy to do and the workload is good depending on what class your taking. They have a special classroom for tutoring and computer use which is pretty great.
College Senior,4,There are many activities going on every week every time I walk around the campus during my break/lunch. Such as a Gamer fest where people get together to play a game with the rest of the school. The library staff are nice and the building is pretty nice. Several computers and rooms for private conferences.
College Junior,4,I have no issues with the my school
College Junior,4,The outdoor labs are similar to real world situations.
College Junior,4,Specific ourses are properly outlined and structured.
College Junior,4,Students from different backgrounds attend classes.
College Junior,4,"Students tend to be mature, security patrols often, and parking is free."
College Junior,4,A wide range of computers and core programs are readily available in most buildings.
College Junior,4,The library is not huge but includes a wealth of resources and sections specific to each of the degrees offered.
College Senior,4,"it was pretty straight foward. i knew how much i had to spend and it is alot therefore im trying to apply to scholarships to help my parents out.
"
College Senior,4,i enjoy my classes. i can keep up with the pace and love my teachers and if i need help they are willing to help.
College Senior,4,"At Renton Technical College there are students of a variety of circumstances.Students in here, as well as teachers seem to be impartial which is a good thing. Everyone is treated equally."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The library is very nice, and so are the laboratories. The campus aesthetics are pleasing and every building is decently maintained. It is slightly annoying because it is all outdoors so it gets pretty chilly in the winter when you are going between classes, but otherwise it's a great school. Campus activities are well advertised around campus, as well as on their web page. It is easy to find out about activities if you are interested in participating."
College Senior,4,Mostly my school consists of hard working people who who have jobs and full time families. The are not just students they also take on on roles apart form being a student and some are full time students
College Senior,4,"I was enrolled in the Early Childhood Careers Hybrid program, Ardene and Barb (both leaders of this department) are amazing motivated individuals who work very hard to keep everything organized and easy to understand for students. They are sensitive to workload and special situations, and the curriculum is stimulating."
College Senior,4,"Eliza in the financial aid office is literally the only reason I am going to school, she has made an amazing effort to contact me and reach out to me rather than the opposite."
College Junior,4,the nursing program is very intense at renton.  you have 32hrs a week of class time and then have homework afterwards.  this combined with a 20-26credit load makes it a full time job
College Senior,4,"Honestly i love the teachers here, they're so friendly and helpful. They actually talk to you and help you out. There are many schools out there that don't even really communicate after class with students."
College Junior,4,"Good Overall – The facilities are nice, they have effectively blended the older buildings with the newer and managed to keep them all working seamlessly."
College Junior,4,"The Culinary Center Is AMAZING! The culinary center has some truly wonderful food, and it's very affordable. I like being able to get breakfast on campus for less than it would cost at a fast food place."
College Junior,4,Small Class Sizes – I loved how almost all of my classes were small. I was able to make friends easily and my teachers knew me by my name which was nice. The Business progam was very good and gave you a great insite to what a major may be like in business. Plus you got see the same students the next quarter.
College Senior,4,"The moment i entered the admissons office, i was approached and asked if i had any questions or needed help. I told them what program i was interested in and they gave the information and paperwork i needed and assign me to a counsular right away and given me suggestions in participating oreintations to know a little bit more about the programs that they offer or the program that i am interested in and all my questions were answered. The staff at Renton Tech are very helpful people, and once i get accepted into my phlebotomy program i was given a FREE parking permit. It just gets no better."
College Junior,4,"Nursing Program – This is the first year RTC made a RN program. So, far its great. Instructors are great at teaching and explaining. A lot of work, but if there are question, you can get help. Its close by my home. So hopefully everything will work out great."
College Senior,4,"I Wish It Were More Challenging – I love the classes related to medical coding. The math class and the English class that were required were a little too high school for me, but I have had some college courses in the past and many of my fellow students have not."
College Junior,4,Overall I have been having a great time at school and am very excited for the next quarter to start.
College Junior,4,Printing anything costs money in the library. 5 cents for black and white and I think its 15 Cents for color. A way around that is to print anything you need in your classroom (if possible)outside of the library.
College Junior,4,So Far So Good – The classroom part was the hardest part for me. I have six years professional culinary experience and it had been just as long since I had been to school. The homework and projects at first were overwhelming; giving up my weekends to finish them was a new thing for me. But after a while everything clicked and I ended up with a good grade.
College Senior,4,"Diverse School – Most students at my school are older people seeking a better education to better themselves. Most work and have kids, but there are students just right out of high school that also attend. All background and ethnicity are present at my school."
College Sophomore,2,I am unable to get financial aid.
College Senior,2,i spend most of my time in the library that is my favorite spot. i wish there was a sports club because i am athletic and love to play sports
College Senior,2,"I find because this is a technical college it really doesnt offer all the classes that are needed to get an Associates of Transfer, even if they provide a program for it. I recently had to take my intro to Music class through Spokane Community College Online."
College Senior,2,Admission Center – They were helpful at first but then I had problems with them later on because I got signed up for a class that I never registered for. They took money from my scholarship fund and when I tried to fix the problem. They believed that I as signed up on accident but never returned my money or gave me a straight answer as to why this happened.
College Senior,2,"I hate the financial aid process period, the tuition for the programs at Renton Technical College i feel that they are fair. But i personally have a hard time getting any type of funds for school because of how much my father makes and they ask for sooooooo much paperwork its ridiculous, they give me hope thinking that i would get help but i dont and in my household we are barely making it. my dad is the only bread winner supporting 6 people his wife my brother and sisters including myself."
College Senior,1,Although the school was rated as the top ten College. I strongly think it has changed and should be re evaluated.
College Senior,1,"Honestly, I probably wouldn't choose this school if I had another option for sure."
College Senior,1,Some of our class time was cancelled and a waste of time to be honest.
College Senior,1,The Instructors weren't very supportive in the overall on line classes.
College Senior,1,Once again I really don't want to sound negative but so far I haven't seen or experience the support .
College Senior,1,I don't want to sound negative but someone needs to take a look at that school as a whole. I have seen a lot of students fail and drop out due to lack of support from the Instructors. The cost of books and to hardly crack the book open or barely cover a chapter or two is disappointing. I have come too far to give up besides I refuse in spite of others negative actions. I worked too hard to turn back now. I will be successful no matter what.
College Senior,1,The attendance rate was terrible and most of the students in my program was not supported as expected. The Instructors are very much set in their ways and need to really see the need of other students to lead them in success. They seem to think about the number of admittance and forget about the student and why they are there.
College Senior,1,So far I haven't had the experience or support to do internship/job opportunities. Although I am not a quitter so I will do my very best to succeed.
College Junior,1,"i would not recommend it, the system is still buggy"
College Sophomore,1,"Not Esay – Staff in office is a bit rude. When dealing with money and fund you dont have but need in order to get into classes, they should be more empathic. I know its hard because of the goverment but they should offer more scholarship opportunities. Also, certain private loans will not worl with renton tech. This is bad because I applied and was denied for this reason."
College Freshman,1,No financial aid available for pre-req classes.  Must be in a program before you can get aid.
College Freshman,1,There is no financial aid available for pre-requisite classes and some classes required for the RN program aren't available at the community colleges where aid is available
Niche User,1,Disability services at the school – If you are  a  learning disable student and  have a hard time  picking up on things. It would not be a school I would Reccomend. In  comparisions to other  schools i have gone  to this  was by far the  rudest person I had ever dealt with that handled  the disability  stuff. Suggestions to improve this  would be  to: 1. not  threaten students  in presence of  teacher 2. allow for  differences.

Sophomore,5,Great community. There are always people available to help you with anything that may come up. It really feels like home at UM
Junior,5,"I have yet to begin classes, but I have yet to run into an issue with any of the faculty. They have all been extremely helpful and very receptive to any concerns I may have had."
Sophomore,5,I love the University of Montevallo because it truly is a place where I feel loved and motivated to pursue many goals and achieve accomplishments. Montevallo has given me an opportunity as a first generation college student with immigrant parents who can't help aid me by paying college tuition. They have reached many hands out to aid me and I will always be thankful for this. Everyone is friendly and I don't feel less than anyone because of my race or because of my status. The campus is absolutely beautiful and the professors are helpful.
Sophomore,5,"Due to COVID 19, my classes were switched online and the University provided a smooth transition they had prepared for an event like this to occur. Exams and assignments were unlocked early in the day therefore I could keep a sane routine of waking up early and making most out of my assignments. The professors not only cared about our emotional well being but motivated us to keep pushing. I love UM!"
Sophomore,5,I like the area that the school is in our campus is absolutely beautiful. I also enjoy how outgoing people are on campus. People are so nice and loving which makes things really easy especially when you're transitioning from high school or a new college
Sophomore,5,So far my experience has been great. I've learned so many things that i never would have learned if I decided to not go to college and the fact that I chose Montevallo made the transition so much easier.
Sophomore,5,The learning experience is beyond great. The small class sizes really help you get to know your professor as well as them getting to know you which helps them teach you better.
Niche User,5,"Montevallo has a really good sense of home around campus. The people are nice, the coaches are great, and the professors are really helpful. I committed to Montevallo on a soccer scholarship in December, and my teammates have been nothing but supportive for me on this journey. I wait to be a true Falcon in the fall!"
Sophomore,5,"Montevallo was honestly the best decision I ever made. When I stepped onto the bricks, there was just energy throughout that I couldn't really put a finger on. Only when I became a student, did I really get to experience the whole of Montevallo where every opportunity I could think of was achievable."
Freshman,5,"The University of Montevallo is an amazing college with a beautiful campus and friendly students and professors. The people are kind and very helpful. Different event happen on and off campus. College Night is really amazing. The classrooms are small so that the teachers can have more of a one-on-one with the students. I would like there to see the teachers have more office hours or be in their office more, but I do understand that they have classes."
Sophomore,5,"I have had a very good experience at Montevallo. The people are fun and accepting, there is always something today, all though it does get a little boring on the weekends."
Senior,5,"From the moment I stepped on the campus bricks, I knew Montevallo would be home. The University provides excellent teaching and an amazing community without making students feel like they are lost in a crowd. Thanks to the small size of the student body, everyone can pretty much know everyone on campus. The homecoming events and history of the school provide students with an enriching experience during their time at the University of Montevallo."
Freshman,5,The University of Montevallo is a diverse campus and has a friendly atmosphere. The campus is beautiful and take good care of incoming students as they will walk you through admissions and financing step by step.
Freshman,5,"Montevallo is a great school because of its ability to personalize the student experience. It is a small school, so each student gets the help they need. They offer lots of opportunities for connecting with others."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed my time at the University of Montevallo. It has certainly prepared me for the future. I like the small town feel, it really adds a sense of connection throughout the student body."
Junior,5,"The town is beautiful and there’s so many interesting people to meet and things to do! They offer a variety of sports, sororities, and clubs!"
Freshman,5,"This small, yet large campus and its gorgeous scenery is truly a safe and comfortable place for all types of personalities. Whether you're introverted or extroverted, an art major or a pre med, there is a sense of community on campus that makes it that much easier to breathe despite the normal stresses of college life. The staff, including the campus police, are mostly friendly. The food on campus can be great, but there are very bland days. Usually the best food is served around preview days."
Senior,5,"I have really enjoyed the small nice setting of the University. At the  university of montevallo  I have been able to make one on one personal connection with all of my professors.I wasn't just a number my professors knew me by name, and that alone was what I was looking for."
Junior,5,I LOVE the school. The professors are so helpful with any and all questions about academics or just questions in general that I may have.
Freshman,5,I LOVE the University of Montevallo. The campus is beautiful. The streets are brick paved and the statues are so inspiring. The people are very nice and I know I will have a great experience and receive a quality education there.
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus, dedicated professors, top-notch athletic facilities, friendly and diverse small school. Highly recommend."
Sophomore,5,"The past year and a half of my life have been the most wonderful years because of  my fellow students at the University of Montevallo. There are a few problems that do seem to persist, the main one would be campus food. There are many problems with it from food being undercooked nearly everyday to a horrible fly infestation and cafeteria workers who yell at students all the time. I would not be nearly as happy as I am if it were not for the constant support of my parents, brothers, and of course my lovely girlfriend Elizabeth Lassy."
Freshman,5,"it is a very good school full of nice and kind people  I have very happy with the programs here. it is a kind and welcoming place, the campus is very clean and looked after."
Alum,5,"The campus is beautiful, the classes are interesting and engaging, and the professors and students are great!"
Junior,5,"The school is great! Small classes, so lots of individual attention. The professors seem to actually care."
Alum,5,I loved it here. The teachers are great and the classes are small which makes it easy to get help.  The campus is beautiful.
Sophomore,5,The university of Montevallo is a wonderful place to go to school. All of the professors are so understanding and really want to see you thrive as a person. We also are getting several new state of the art buildings.
Niche User,5,When i did the campus tour it was very helpful. They are friendly and help you in whatever your needs to be required. I had a fun experience at college night. They had two plays one purple and the other gold. The gold teams wins!
Sophomore,5,I love the campus of Montevallo. It’s beautiful. I am a softball player here and have so much fun with all of the athletes
Niche User,5,"I am so excited to attend the University of Montevallo, I have stayed a weekend there with a senior that is graduating and attended her classes. I play on being a music and was overwhelmed with the joy I felt being there and being taught by the teacher. The food is great as well! The campus and the dorms are beautiful. Definitely the college for me!!!"
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the environment that the place creates. I'm very proud to call this my school of choice and I want to make them and I look proud
Junior,5,The University of Montevallo is amazing! They made my transition from community college a relatively easy and painless process. I'm glad that I made the decision to come here.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Montevallo was a wonderful one. Everyone there is so nice and it's all smiles. I feel like I'm at home, when I'm on the campus of Montevallo."
Niche User,5,"UM has maintained a friendly, nurturing atmosphere among faculty with students. UM can brag about having the best Theatre department in the state!! The Speech pathology department has grown into a world class level of training. The English department has boasted of talented, prize winning writers and educators for more than half a century. The Music department stands superior, far above much larger universities on the state. And athletics is thriving with winning seasons in baseball, basketball, & volleyball. Montevallo is in a class by itself, retaining Southern gentility and an innate appreciation for culture, manners, and acceptance."
Sophomore,5,"Montevallo is beautiful and the sense of community with students and staff on campus is overwhelming. The internet service could stand to be a bit more dependable, but everything else is great! Even the caf food!"
Sophomore,5,I love Montevallo and what they have to offer! My Freshman I learned about Student Life and how they are involved with the school. I enjoy living on campus. I also enjoy not having a football team because its shows the importance of liberal arts.
Alum,5,"My experience at Montevallo was great. I was a commuter student, but I had friends who lived on campus. I graduated from the education department. All of the professors were incredible. They were very knowledgeable about the topics they taught. I am currently a special education teacher in a wonderful school system because I was recommended for the job by one of my professors. I can't say enough wonderful things about the University of Montevallo."
Junior,5,I transferred to the University of Montevallo from a junior college and my experience has been nothing but great so far! The campus is small but with all of the features a large university would have! I'm going to be double majoring starting next semester and plan on getting my master's degree as soon as possible after graduating! I love the environment at this school and wouldn't want to go to school anywhere else!
Freshman,5,The amazing thing about the university of montevallo is that they make you feel like your at home. They are also helpful.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love this school! This is my home away from home as they like to say. the classes are small and I get to do what I love on a daily basis! I have never been more happy and passionate about my education ever, the faculty here know you by name and treat you so well. Karen is the photography teacher here and might I say she is my favourite person on campus! she is so nice and welcoming and is also so so passionate about her job as most of the professors working here are! I cannot wait to continue my career path here!"
Junior,5,"This is the best college I've ever visited and the best choice I ever made! All of the professors are so helpful, accessible, friendly, caring, and very intelligent. I have never felt out of place here or like a burden to any of the staff. The size of the classes is perfect  and the campus is beautiful!"
College Sophomore,5,"The Greek life at Montevallo directly mirrors the social environment of the campus- there are some really weird people that fit into really weird frats or sororities but that's just how it goes! Most people that are involved on campus in some way are Greek, but that says nothing about how ""required"" being Greek is to have fun and get to know people."
College Sophomore,5,"The homecoming tradition, College Night, makes it an easy pick as far as liberal arts schools in the Southeast go. Since the classes are small, the teachers are much more readily available than say Auburn University or University of Alabama. I would choose this college again just for the experience of Montevallo! Ask anyone who is attending or has attended and they will tell you it is a completely unique experience."
College Senior,5,Security is enforced and they tell us to put the police number in our phones and they can escort us across campus when it is dark. We had to finish a four hour long computer class on drugs & sexual assault before we arrived here.
College Junior,5,The University of Montevallo is such a unique and diverse campus. The professors encourage the best that a student can offer as well as providing them the learning techniques and tactics they need. I've had such an amazing 2 years so far and I cannot wait to intertwine myself within the small culture that the students and professors have at the University of Montevallo.
College Sophomore,5,Safety is not an issue on campus.
College Freshman,5,I LOVE MONTEVALLO! It is the best campus. I always feel safe no matter the time
College Freshman,5,I LOVE MONTEVALLO!! I AM so excited to start over the summer!
College Freshman,5,Being that not much happens here and its a pretty interesting bunch of students that attend here sporting events are AMAZING! The student section is by far the best I've ever been apart of basically Montevallo is one huge family and we use these sporting events to come together and cheer on our fellow falcons.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus
College Freshman,5,There are so many courses to choose from and all of the professors are great!
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love living on campus!
College Freshman,5,Greek Life is so great at UM everyone is so nice!
College Freshman,5,I love Montevallo and I wouldn't trade it for any other university.
College Sophomore,5,"Out of all the classes I have taken so far in a year and a half, I have only disliked one or two of them. My professors have almost all been wonderful, the workload is not usually awful, and I feel like I'm getting the education I'm paying for."
College Sophomore,5,"Because of this school's reputation, employers know that graduates have gotten a quality education, and so many graduates go on to be very successful."
College Sophomore,5,"Montevallo was basically my first and only choice, and I absolutely love it here! It's the perfect sized school for my level of comfort with people, but the professors are still incredibly knowledgeable and helpful, and the campus is gorgeous."
College Freshman,5,The professors are my favorite thing about this school. They are very engaging and make sure that everyone understands the topic and won't hesitate to help you after class if you need it. The classes are also generally small giving you a more personal relationship with your instructor.
College Freshman,5,"If you're out with friends and someone sexually assaults you, and you are obviously showing some form of ""no,"" your friends will protect you from feeling uncomfortable and separates the offender from you before things get out of hand."
College Freshman,5,"I'm not sure about other residence halls, but Hanson Hall (female dormitory) is where I stay and it has been amazing! The only issue  I have with it is the mold in the basement TV room and that we have four washers ans dryers for the entire, three story, building."
Sophomore,4,"Because COVID-19, the last few weeks of school were moved online. Each professor did a wonderful jobs transferring their classes to an online modality."
Graduate Student,4,"The online classes are just as engaging and beneficial as a physical classroom setting, but online classes are hard to adjust to if you have not previously taken any online classes."
Sophomore,4,The online experience has been very different but I do enjoy being online because I have time to complete my work and its basically whenever I want to do the work. The only tough part about being online is not being able to see my friends or communicate with professors to ask questions for trying to understand.
Junior,4,I like there are people from all over the world and the teachers care about me. I'm not just a number and my professors know me by name. It's not a large crowd and I like it that way.
Niche User,4,"I love how Montevallo is close to home, and how the staff is very helpful and nice. They keep me updated on important information."
Alum,4,"Had an overall good college experience at Montevallo. I was in the school of Mass communications, on scholarship. I also had work study where I work on Sports production. The Mass Comm department had really great instructors ."
Alum,4,"My overall experience at Montevallo was great. Met great people from all over the state and even the world. I was a student-athlete at the University and enjoyed the diverse group of students among the athletes. Outside of the athlete population you had talented theater students, very involved greek students, and your occasional Alabama student. More diversity, better food options, and more activities would benefit this campus."
Freshman,4,"The campus is small and has a lot of safety precautions.  It is also clean and has a nice scenery.  There are stores and restaurants near the campus, which makes it convenient for walking."
Alum,4,"I was a student athlete at the University of Montevallo. Over my four years, I had such a great time. The only thing I wish would have been different was more student involvement in ALL sports. Or have a program where you match an athlete with a fine arts student, so they could bring support to each others events."
Freshman,4,Beautiful campus...almost like being on a movie set. Beautiful people and peaceful sounds in such a small little place
Sophomore,4,Montevallo is great school. All of the students are very nice. It is very rare that you meet someone who is unfriendly. The school is very diverse and the school accepts and loves it very much. The campus is beautiful but the cobblestone walkways are uneven and dangerous.
Freshman,4,I'm an up-and-coming freshman and being that I have visited the campusu before. I am highly excited.
Senior,4,"My time at Montevallo so far has been amazing!  The people and diversity throughout campus is wide but great.  There are so many different walks of life on campus and I have learned so much from the tremendous professors on campus along with the students on campus.  I would definitely recommend others to attend this university.  The only down fall is there's not enough activities off campus around, you have to sometimes drive 20-40 mins to do fun things, but other than that its a great atmosphere."
Niche User,4,"The campus is very beautiful and fairly safe. The classroom-teacher ratio is a great size. The faculty and staff are friendly and will do anything they can to help you and keep you on track. The students are pretty diverse and friendly. On top of that, Montevallo is a very reputable school."
Niche User,4,"As a dual-enrollment student at the University of Montevallo, I enjoyed the professors and campus. I live in Montevallo, and I am proud of our small college town. However, students often complain about the lack of things to do in the evenings and/or on the weekends."
Niche User,4,The faculty and staff are very kind and offer exceptional guidance to interested students. University of Montevallo has a small campus for students who may want a cozier feel and do not necessarily want to experience a large university. The performing arts is also really strong at the school.
Sophomore,4,It’s a great outlet for the creative mind that wish to pursue an arts degree. There is much to learn and there are phenomenal professors that really help direct your life by simple observation.
Alum,4,"It's a nice, small Liberal Arts School. It could use a few more options, especially in terms of graduate degrees."
Niche User,4,I have done any summer programs at Montevallo as well as attending the school for a time. The campus is beautiful and the professors are very reachable. The other students tend to be open and helpful in most areas. The campus life is fantastic. College night is a must!
Senior,4,University of Montevallo is not far from where i lived so that is why i chose it. It is not a big campus and has a good home feeling to it. I joined a sorority (Phi Mu) and would say that Greek life is very good here and is not like other schools. Because it is so small it allows you to not only get close and know just your sorority but others as well. Being small also allows you and your professors to have a better relationship. I feel like I am able to be  able to sit down with my professors and really talk to them and come to them with my concerns and get their help with something and feel like they truly care about me achieving then I would at a bigger college
Junior,4,"I love it here. The teachers are happy to help with issues you may have or answer your questions, the campus is beautiful and clean, the dorms are fairly clean. However, I wish the Housing and Residence Life Staff had a better system for students to tell them about what meal plans they want and which dorms they'll be wanting to stay at."
Sophomore,4,Montevallo is a very open and welcoming school. It’s a place where you can throw all of your insecurities away because you aren’t judged. Everyone is super sweet and you’ll most definitely meet a ton of long life friends.
Junior,4,I love being at the University of Montevallo. This university has one of the most beautiful campus sites in the state of Alabama. I am currently studying Finance. I have had some wonderful experiences since I transferred here. I know that I made the right decision to come here and focus on my education so that I can get my degree and have a successful career in the future.
Alum,4,"Montevallo is a diverse, dynamic university that maintains a close-knit, small town community. It is an wonderful school for liberal arts, education, theater, and art."
Alum,4,"Great professors, great class size, beautiful campus, and fantastic scholarships. However, I think that administration needs to allocate resources more responsibly than they currently are and focus on promoting academic responsibility to and retaining their  student body."
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful! The students are very diverse so it is not hard to find someone that you would get along with. Greek life is not like anywhere else! There are not too many students so there are plenty of opportunities to get involved. Homecoming aka College Night is the longest running homecoming tradition any school has in the country. The town is small but it is not far for the city of Birmingham so there’s always something to do! The only things that I would fix are some of the dorms and the food in the cafeteria but you would probably want to fix those things at most schools!
Senior,4,My experience at Montevallo has been wonderful. My professors are very helpful and make it their first priority to make sure everyone fully understands what is being taught. Everyone on campus is so nice and it's pretty easy to make friends here.
Freshman,4,"The University of Montevallo is a small school with a beautiful campus and a close-knit community, though it can be difficult to make friends here if you hold more conservative social/political views. Also, there is not much to do off-campus unless you are willing to drive to Birmingham, which is about forty five minutes away. However, overall my experience has been a very positive one, and I would definitely recommend the school to prospective students."
Freshman,4,"The classes are very small, which is nice because professors know their students' names. The campus is small, so getting from class to class is very fast and easy. The cafeteria is pretty good for a school cafeteria, and there are many places to eat off campus. There are many clubs and opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities. The only thing that I don't like is that many classes are based on Canvas, so you have to get assignments offline, even though you physically go to your classes. 
Montevallo is also a very diverse school with people from all different backgrounds. There is a medium sized foreign student population. 
It's a safe campus, because there are always campus police around and there are light poles with emergency intercoms so if you're worried about someone following you, you can hit the emergency button and the police will come help you. 
The party scene isn't very big, but there is one HUGE party every year, along with some normal college parties."
Freshman,4,It is easy to apply to the scholarships that they offer. Niche offers different type of scholarships for the different majors. I like how the scholarships that they provide includes no essay scholarships or no requirements needed.
Junior,4,"My experience so far at the University of Montevallo has been great. I have made some life long friends and everyone is friendly. I like how small this school is because we are able to form a relationship with the teachers. Also, you can walk to class by seeing at least one familiar face. What I would like to see change is having more major options. This school is known for their fine arts program and education program. Therefore, there is a good amount of options for those majors, but not for the others. For example, they lack in social work majors, business, and much more."
Freshman,4,"Montevallo is everything you want from a small-town college. Professors are friendly an genuinely interested in students' success. Classes are very small, even in lower-level classes. It's easy to walk everywhere. It's also very easy to get involved in campus life as a freshman through traditions such as College Night."
Niche User,4,"I am a current high school junior at Montevallo High. For the most part, the the University of Montevallo interacts with the high school to the best of their ability. All high school grades take trips through the year to the college to grasp an idea on college life, and everything I have personal witnessed has made a positive impact on me or other student."
Niche User,4,"The University Of Montevallo has a great campus, and the school is very appealing. I am planning to view the whole campus in December of 2016. Montevallo will be a great school for me to attend, I am looking forward of being apart of class 2021 at The University Of Montevallo. "
College Sophomore,4,"So far, my professors have been nothing short of excellent, and there is diversity in enough of the faculty to keep class interesting. The variety of courses could be better but with a small college like Montevallo, it is difficult to have enough people to make certain classes available so it's understandable. Class sizes are almost the size they are in a typical public high school."
College Sophomore,4,"I think a lot of people initially come to Montevallo looking for a degree in theatre arts or music performance, but end up switching their major to something more realistic. While people who switch will have a greater chance of finding a career, those in the performing arts are going to have a lot tougher time finding a career."
College Sophomore,4,"I think safety wise, Montevallo is very progressive in ensuring that its residents feel secure with the campus police constantly monitoring the length of the campus and being so small, it feels that they can be anywhere in seconds (probably could). Health is up to par but some amenities could be a little more modernized internally."
College Senior,4,"I don't really play or watch sports, but from what I have seen everything is adequate."
College Freshman,4,Good athletics program and sprit
College Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus, great classes, and relaxing atmosphere."
College Sophomore,4,The courses and professors are very well rounded and helpful in order to obtain required degrees.
College Sophomore,4,Advisers are very resourceful in finding intern opportunities and sharing with students across campus.
College Sophomore,4,This school is known for its baseball/softball teams and they do quite well for being considered a small school. The athletic facilities are professional and available to all students. The entire school supports our teams and provide excellent school spirit which enhances team performance.
College Sophomore,4,The University of Montevallo has the most beautiful campus I have ever seen. The beauty of nature is very well preserved and up kept by the variety of students on campus who care. The fact that this is a fine arts school provides the opportunity to meet and interact with several types of personalities. The professors and academic advisers are passionate about the job that they do and are willing to sacrifice their time to fulfill student needs. All in all a truly great university.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe on campus. I walk at night to places and I have no problem whatsoever. The police are always circling and I feel comfortable. The only thing I will say is that I think we should have more emergency buttons on campus. I do not think there are enough. If something were to happen the distance to get there is a little far.
College Sophomore,4,I am only a sophomore going into my junior year so I haven't really had to use those resources yet but I have been to the career center to determine if my major was what I should be going into. The results came back great and they were very very helpful. They gave me choices to other career paths that my personalities could do well in.
College Sophomore,4,I love my classes thus far. The sizes have been manageable and the professors are great. There has only been two professors that I have not been a big fan of and I am going into my junior year here at the University. I love that the teachers are so easily accessible if you need them are more than willing to help when there is a problem or you have questions. My teachers know me by name and I absolutely love that.
College Sophomore,4,"I really love that it is close to all my classes. This is a small campus but every building is within walking distance. The room spaces and community bathes are good. My only critique is that I wish there was a little bit more room space and the showers were updated, the space in it is really tight but it gets the job done so I am satisfied."
College Sophomore,4,I have only been to a few basketball and baseball games but the involvement was good. They cheered on their team and really encouraged everyone.
College Sophomore,4,What I love the most about my school is that I am not just a number but rather a student with a face. It is a small campus and everyone is a real person not just another student.
College Freshman,4,They are very helpful! Always friendly and great advice
College Freshman,4,I can not wait to move in to the dorm at Montevallo.
College Freshman,4,I am an athlete walk on for soccer. They are very involved. The athletes are great
College Senior,4,"Personal safety is very important and at my school I feel particularly safe. There's always a law enforcement officer nearby, no matter what edge of campus you're on, and there's always administrators around. The officers take their jobs seriously and I appreciate that a lot."
College Senior,4,"As an Elementary Education major, I am very pleased to say that I know several teachers with degrees from Montevallo, it has an excellent Education school and I am looking forward to the opportunities that may present themselves in my future. The course buildings are full of excellent resources for each major and minor. The career center is a great place to get advice and any extra help students may have regarding their future plans."
College Senior,4,"I love my school. My experience has been so wonderful from every aspect. Class sizes are great, I feel like I can really pay attention in class and still have a conversation with my professor afterwards about the class discussion. Professors are always available at their office hours and that is really convenient. The courses are well taught from the curriculum all the way to the individuality of each course."
College Senior,4,Greek life at Montevallo is so welcoming. You aren't looked at differently if you don't join versus if you do. The Greek community does wonderful things for the school and i think that it's a great addition to the university.
College Senior,4,"I've been to a few sporting events this year, and so far i've been impressed. For a liberal arts school, my University has a wide range of school spirit and a great fan base. Facilities are nice, and are always being improved in some way."
College Senior,4,"My experience at my school, The University of Montevallo is incredible so far. The campus is beautiful and well taken care of, the staff and administration is so friendly and always helpful. Class sizes are very ideal for those who like a one on one experience with their professor. I would absolutely choose my school if I had the chance to do so again."
College Freshman,4,"I have not had a problem about feeling safe on this campus. If you are scared to walk back to your dorm at night, there are safety buttons around campus for the police to come and take you back to your dorm. I have walked around campus at night and have not been anywhere close to being sexual assaulted."
Graduate Student,2,"Greek life is not very welcoming or inclusive and the housing facilities are disgusting. However, the faculty is extremely helpful with academics."
College Senior,2,For social wrecks it's impossible because people have their own cliques and being far from home is lonely. The dorms are nice though some people have trouble getting in due to their key cards not working.
College Sophomore,2,"Its better to visit campus for classes than to actually reside on campus. The newer residence halls that have been built are up to par but the older buildings however, they contain several cases of black mold and mildew which has been found on the window sill and mold in the closets that have ruined many residence clothes and belongings. Hanson Hall is known to have the worst cases with mold. However, the campus is very beautiful but not safe due to such living conditions."
College Freshman,2,The community bathrooms are out of date and disgusting. The shower gets wayy too hot and can burn your skin. It doesnt stay at a constant tempand will change when the toilet flushes. Also there are little black bugs every where i hate it.
College Freshman,2,"The school advertises a great career development center, but all it really offers is a test to find out if you are a introvert or an extrovert."
College Freshman,2,Softball and baseball are about that only sports you can count on. Volleyball is moderate. Football doesn't exist.
College Freshman,2,The school does not have much going on. There are few events to attend. The teachers are not typically helpful. The plus side is that the coursework is easy.
College Sophomore,2,Unless you have financial aid it is very hard to find an on campus job. The people at the career center are helpful but they can't just give you a job or set you up with an interview. I'm still an underclassmen so I am not even at the point where I can get an internship so I don't know how the school functions in that area.
College Freshman,2,Montevallo isn't sport-centeralized at all.
College Sophomore,2,"No social scene, not very good food, small campus. Looking to transfer."
College Freshman,2,9 times out of 10 the food has no taste or tastes horrible. The workers are nice and friendly though so at least they've got a great staff.
College Sophomore,2,I don't apply for financial aid so finding scholarships is hard!
College Senior,2,"The only reason I am majoring into Biology is because I am going to get my Masters degree in Pharmacy. Everyone is encouraging, but they feel bad for me when I tell them about majoring in Biology. It's remorse and pride mixed in one, but it doesn't exclude me as a person."
College Senior,2,"Montevallo is a mixture of many different people, both guys and girls. The people that go to Montevallo are very unique but I believe that it becomes a chance to learn how to accept people from all different backgrounds. But for a single girl looking for a guy, I will admit it has been difficult"
College Sophomore,2,There's not enough healthy options
College Sophomore,2,There is very little school spirit when it comes to sports not many students attend the games but we have great teams and athletes.
College Sophomore,2,The only thing to look forward to when coming to Montevallo is college night and other than that prepare to not be challenged academically and let the boring begin.
College Sophomore,2,"Near campus, we have a total of five restaurants, McDonalds, Jacks, KFC, Pizza Hut, and Subway. We cannot use our campus dollars in either of these places. None of the places stay open late and safe for Subway they are pretty unhealthy."
College Freshman,2,A couple fast food places and a restaurant or two is all there is. You're better off driving the 15-20 minutes to Calera or Alabastor if you're going to eat out.
College Freshman,2,"There are a few labs open to students depending on your major, however, the internet in plain terms sucks. It's very difficult to do assignments or even browse the web because the connection is so weak."
College Freshman,2,"A new company has taken over the dining facilities and, though some say it is better than the previous company, I find that very hard to believe. There are no vegetarian or vegan options besides a sub-par salad bar. A majority of the workers are rude or creepy, and it is much to expensive for the quality. (about $9-10 for dinner)"
College Junior,2,"I would say it's average. There are no scanners or printers available in my building on campus which I found bizarre. In order to print on campus I have to go to the library, purchase a card or bring your print card, put money on your card, print from your computer, put your ID number in at the printer select the job and swipe your card. Its a huge process when it doesn't need to be that difficult. At other universities they track printing by having you log in to the computer you use, no cards, no codes at the printer, you are allotted a certain amount of printing before they begin charging your account. That was nice."
College Junior,2,"There is limited parking by the dorms and if you don't get to one early enough, you'll end up having to park across campus and walk all the way back to your dorm."
College Sophomore,2,"It rains, A LOT. Bring some rainboots. Other than that, especially in the fall and spring, our campus is BEAUTIFUL."
College Sophomore,2,"They do give financial aid, and I have a the biggest amount they give out. But still it is very expensive and i'm having trouble paying for it."
College Sophomore,2,The internet connectivity is not reliable at all. The wifi often times goes out and we are required to buy print cards when we want to print something and if you do not have a card you will not b e printing. Arount mid terms and finals the computer labs fill up quick and there are only two printers available so can you say mayhem!!
College Freshman,2,"On campus, the dining options consist of the cafeteria and a World of Wings restaurant. Both facilities offer poor quality and limited varieties for meals."
College Freshman,2,The only transportation available is the shuttle to Alabaster once a month and any friends you might have earned and can bribe to drive you into town.
College Student,2,"There isn't that many dinning places around campus, you will have to go to Alabaster for good food."
College Freshman,2,"the dating pool here is not great, very few attractive men, and most of the better looking ones are gay. The ones who aren't gay are massive douches, but that can be said of the non-attractive men as well. The douche factor at Montevallo is inordinately high."
College Senior,2,There's a long list of things to do and it's slow.
College Junior,2,I stay in Tutwiler hall and it's difficult to park because you have to walk up a large hill. They have spots close but they are limited. If you go home on the weekend come back early so you can get one of these spaces. Commutter parking I hear is very difficult as well.
College Junior,2,When you do want to go shopping you can go to the Galleria Mall which is about 45 mins away. In Montevallo they have Orr Park which is a recreational park. Montevallo also has The Tavern which is a club/bar. It is very popular on Thursday's.
Recent Alumnus,2,I feel as though this is an error for improvement.
College Senior,2,"Expensive and Not Worth It – the apartments/houses are expensive and most of the time not worth the money. Something is always wrong if it be noisy neighbors, no A/C or heat, or bug problems!"
College Senior,2,"Small, but Enjoyable – There's not a whole lot to do in Montevallo, but you can make it fun! while there isn't a large ""city"" atmosphere, there are some cool local venues and bars that always have things going on, from shows to trivia night to beer and wine tastings. It's more of a country feel and it stripped down of a lot of the city perks"
College Sophomore,2,"The food is ok, I just wish they had more options."
College Freshman,2,"No Variation, Not Ever – The food at montevallo might be great if there was any variety at all. There are only two on-campus food services. The first is the cafe' which has long lines and mediocre food. The prices are not outrageous, but given the sub-par quality of the food it is absolutely ridiculous. The other is WOW, or world of wings, which is even smaller but does have better food. This however, comes at a high price and the meals are not affordable to eat consistently."
College Freshman,2,"Not Always Pressure, but Certainly Oppurtunity – The campus is not so drug riddled that one cannot socially exist without being pressured, but at the same time drugs are often consumed and caught in all dorms and parts of campus. These are primarily alcohol and marijuana but pills, Ecstasy Hallucinogens, uppers and downers all exist."
College Sophomore,2,"Tight Spaces – Most of the parking spaces at our school are parallel parking and squished together. Depending on what dorm you get depends on what is the best parking. Overall it is terrible, especially for freshman."
Niche User,1,"Ok yall. Buckle your seatbelts. Bc this school is awful. I should’ve ran when I HAD TO TRANSCRIBE MY OWN TRANSCRIPT from my community college. I was literally my own admissions counselor. I was told that over half of my credits wouldn’t be accepted and that I would have to retake a years worth of classes. Think ur gonna get a scholarship? Think again bc my 3.97 gpa and impressive list of rewards/ community service got me nothing.Thankfully I got substantial scholarship $ from everywhere else I’ve applied. Have a disability and need extra help? Haha well that’s too bad cuz they could literally care less. Also- no parking. I ain’t complaining about exorcise, I’m a marathon runner. But slipping on the bricks in a thunderstorm isn’t fun. Um doesn’t care about you, just your money. That’s why they UM are one of the most expensive public colleges in AL. So go somewhere that actually cares about your finances, success, future, health and well-being. Cuz UM ain’t it."
College Sophomore,1,Honestly the kids at Montevallo high school are eating better than we are. We can only use our flex dollars at moes and their prices are way to high for the amount of flex dollars that we get.
College Sophomore,1,We pay like 35 dollars for crappy parking spaces that most of the time is already filled up and you will be ticketed all the time should you not have a parking decal.
College Sophomore,1,There is a reason why Montevallo becomes a ghost campus on the weekends because the is nothing to do in this crappy town. Montevallo is a liberal college in a conservative town so mingling with the townies is rare.
College Sophomore,1,OMG we have the least reliable internet of all schools. Expect to have the internet go out on you all the time and when it is on it will be slow. Their are not enough computers in the library especially during finals week it gets pretty crowded.
College Sophomore,1,There is no shading or walk ways to shade you from rain on campus so when you have to walk from you dorm to your class prepare to be drenched. Also be cause of the stupid bricked roads expects many falls and trips and the their are plenty of hills that will assist you in tumbling down.
College Sophomore,1,All of the dorm except for new Res are pretty crappy. With the amount of money you pay for housing would think that we would have better facilities. The washers and dryers are always broken and at least one of the showers are always out of order.
College Junior,1,"I was horrified when I did walk throughs here, there was garbage in the parking lots and up the walkways. It was like no one cared about anything. Then when we got inside some of the occupied units I couldn't believe they would show me these apartments in that state, I was horrified and I am sure they saw it on my face. One unit had a pile of garbage inside which made me think they would definitely have a bug problem. These units were 1 bedrooms for over $500, in a small town? Really? It was terrible, and the whole time I was not nearly close enough to campus to ever bike or walk, the closer we got the worse the conditions got. I would recommend living the next town over and commuting."
College Junior,1,"It is a small town, possibly the definition of such with the exception that they have a University there. Everyone is really nice, possibly overly friendly but thats the small town charm. Personally I feel like I could never live in a town this small and be this far away from everything else. I thought  I came from a small town, which was a village of 10,000, and I lived 10 minutes from a city and 15 minutes from a bigger city. That's what I would look for in terms of living."
College Junior,1,"Not many options because it is a small town, but for the size there is a decent amount. "
College Sophomore,1,"Montevallo is absolutly the worst place for anyone who wants to eat off campus as there is no where to eat. We have a masdonalds, a KFC, and a pizza hut all in walking distance but after a while it gets old so we have no choice but to eat the average tasting cafeteria food."
College Sophomore,1,"I honestly am disappointed with my school's dining options. Not only are they very limited, but the few options we do have are either unhealthy or disgusting most of the time. The cafe has no variety and the food place at the student center is completely unhealthy, with even the salads containing fried chicken. Gross. Talk about a freshman 15."
College Freshman,1,"Montevallo is a very small town and offers little aside from the actual campus itself. It is a great place to focus on arts, however not a great school for making connections in other fields and majors."
College Freshman,1,The nightlife is practically non-existent for student of any age on campus. Most parties or gatherings occur off campus at apartments.
College Freshman,1,"I don't like Greeks, so my opinion is very biased."
College Freshman,1,"If you're a resident you're all set, but commuters have to fight for spots. The only way to get a spot that is still anywhere near classes is to get there before 8am."
College Sophomore,1,"The parking is outrageous, there are hardly any when I get to school."
College Freshman,1,Its Alabama – Its Alabama... IT can be 70 one day and 30 the next so just be prepared.
College Sophomore,1,"I've noticed that the enforcement of rules on campus for under-age drinking is nearly non-existent.  All ages are seen openly ""partying"".  However, non of the ones in violation of rules seem to get anything said to them, and if they do, it's usually a slap on the wrist."
College Junior,1,"Montevallo is small that there is not tranportation. Once a month shuttle busses will take you to Alabaster (the nearest ""city"") for free.
Also, there is not a lot of parking and Alfred (a police officer) is known to be over zealous with tickets."

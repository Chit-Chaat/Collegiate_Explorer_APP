One thing that I learned about Claflin since enrolling was how motivated the administrators and faculty is about student success.

All these resources at the tips of my fingers."

They treat us like family and I couldn’t have asked for a better place to be. It’s brought be close to people that can help me reach my goals in life. I personally wanna be a performer. One of my professors has traveled and still travels while performing and another one tries to help me advance my music. They bring guest speakers and people from the music industry to help so it’s really just a great experience to have. I don’t k law if other colleges do it and if they so I don’t think it’s to the degree that claflin does it.

My experience with faculty and staff have been tremendously great. Upon transferring, the students have always been very friendly and makes everyone feel like family.

Claflin, the oldest HBCU in South Carolina, is a university I would recommend to all students, especially African American students."

Overall my experience at the University has been great."
Freshman,5,"I wasn't quite sure about attending college/university at all. Part of the reason I decided to take a gap year was so I would have more time to think about it.

Freshman,5,Claflin is a wonderful school to be in because I never thought that I would learn so much about this school and also have more experience. This school teaches me a lot to be prepared for the real world and also because more of yourself. Claflin taught me how to be more open and speak up as well because I was very shy at the beginning. I would recommend high school seniors to come to this university and so they can become a visionary leader.
Freshman,5,Claflin is a really great university to attend . The class sizes are small so the teacher help you more . It’s a lot of opportunities to get help around the campus.
Freshman,5,"I love Claflin University! Claflin was the best decision I ever made to go here.

Alum,5,"Claflin is the oldest HBCU in South Carolina. A true jewel in a small town it boasts small class sizes and a President that maintains an open door policy and knows students by name. That trickles down to professors and staff.

While some complain that in Orangeburg there is nothing to do, it reslly ensures you bond with your classmates. Besides, Columbia and Charleston are both less than an hour away if you have to get out of town."
Junior,5,My overall experience at Claflin University has been a great and challenging time. It has its ups and downs. But over all the professors and students here are very nice and very helpful to everyone.

The faculty, staff and upper class students made it very easy to want to be a part of the campus.

Sophomore,4,Claflin is definitely a one of a kind type of school. To most of the students on campus they can tell you that Claflin is like a home away from home kind of school. With smaller classroom sizes it is easier for you as students to get the one on one attention from your teachers. Also it allows for teachers to be on first name bases with you because the classroom sizes are not that big. Campus is not as big as other schools but you wont feel like you are in Orangeburg once you're their on the 'hilltop high'.
Freshman,4,"The experience has been experience has been superb. Lecturers seemed to have taken advantage of the online learning and have exploited it to the fullest. The teachers are excellent and fluent in speaking. They also ensure interactions in the classroom  and prevent it from being boring. A few lecturers could work on their voices though to ensure they can be heard but overall, it's been great"

Junior,4,"I did not have this experience. I did not have this experience. Again, I did not have this experience."
Junior,4,"It was great being able to attend an HBCU, I really enjoyed that. However, it is a small campus and that means, your business is shared faster than light. Not something I appreciated."
Junior,4,"Genuinely, the campus is extremely diverse. You will meet tons of people from all over. Parties are lit!!! And I have made a great number of friends along the way. Because this school is in Orangeburg, there is not a lot to do. But It's good for keeping you away from a lot of distractions. The faculty is very diverse also."
Junior,4,Online is not really my cup of tea but it is impactful and gets the job done. The professors are patient and diligent and will guide you through whatever struggles you may have.
Junior,4,"Claflin university has so far been a very interesting as well as an informative experience. I have learned a lot about myself and a lot about being mature and responsible and level headed. The professors as well as the staff work together to make your experience a comfortable yet helpful one. The dorms are clean and comfortable for the most part and my peace is rarely ever disturbed. The classes are engaging , yet impactful in terms of increasing your knowledge. You will most definitely leave this university with enough experience and knowledge to do anything that you want to do in life. It will be an experience that you will never forget."

Claflin University makes a solid commitment to ensure the well being of its students and they adhere to almost their every need.

They also make sure that every student is given an opportunity to achieve and succeed and become the best person they can possibly become and those are just a few of the reasons why I enjoy Claflin University."

These key factors enhancing students with impacting global perspectives that can bring change throughout communities."
Freshman,4,My experience at Claflin University was in between good and complicated. It good for me meet new people and it was complicated for me to adjust to living on campus. The academics at Claflin University is overall good . The dorms at Claflin University is not good to live in because the dorm are not clean.
Freshman,4,"You feel part of a family like everyone saying hi to u even when they do not know whether employees, staff or students. Efforts are made by faculty to know students from open sessions even with the president to one-on-one talk time. Very nice school to be in if you like the close-knit feeling."
Sophomore,4,"As I've experienced in this top-ranked HBCU, you learn independence, sociable skills, and overall you learn about yourself. I've taken a plethora and multitudinous amount of knowledge- not just book wise. The professors are willing to pass on wisdom and insight. I've honestly found my purpose on this planet during my time at Claflin."
Junior,4,I am majoring in  Mass Communication and I really like my classes. However i wished they offer more hands on classes to help our portfolio a bit more. Campus life is okay. Claflin is really stricted but I know its for the best. The dorms are okay depending on where you stay. There's not many dorms for males so that's were they can improve. I really like the classes size because they are small and you are able to create relationships with your professors. They don't see you as just another number.
Senior,4,"Claflin University is a good school if you like a small, close learning environment. I thrive in it as an art major. The on campus housing is great but, once you are a junior they will try to put you in off campus housing. It a walk but there are shuttles that come at certain times. The campus is usually active with events. I can't speak for any other department but, the art department while very small cranks out good work and has great teachers. Overall, I'm happy that I chose Claflin University as my school."
Freshman,4,What I like about Claflin University is that they provide the students more than enough help with their classes.
Junior,4,I love the school it brought me out of my shy shell. what made me choose claflin its a family school and i thought i could be great at a small school such as claflin.
Sophomore,4,Claflin has been like a home away from home. Everyone has been so helpful and accommodating. There is a lot of diversity on such a beautiful campus. I get to interact with people of different backgrounds and origins.  Claflin's main mission is motivating and helping their students become visionary leaders that the world needs.
Sophomore,4,its very family oriented and welcoming campus. I've been attending this school for a year and its defiantly more than I expected. I've made what I hope to be lifetime friends and I've even become a tour guide at the university. I love my HBCU.
Junior,4,"There are many different elements that make Claflin great, but the main one is class sizes and the atmosphere is family-like. Once you step on to the campus, everyone is happy to help, direct you, or to just greet you. It's a wonderful experience being on the ground of the oldest HBCU! One thing, I would change is the AC/HEAT within some of the campus buildings. Some days inside the buildings would be hotter than outside."
Freshman,4,"I personally like the art programs they have at claflin, and they also teaches me alot to sustain an official role as an artist."
Junior,4,"Claflin is perfect for those who want a school environment where school comes first. Though we're not a party school, where close to enough schools to be a part of any function. Claflin is also a small enough school where you'll easily make friends quick."
Sophomore,4,"Claflin University has a beautiful campus. However, there are sometimes problems in dorms concerning plumbing and other minor issues. I would say that there is equal diversity among students and professors, although it is an HBCU. The cafeteria food is not always appetizing, which could be expected. Overall, it is a great university and I would recommend it to others."
Alum,4,"Claflin University is a great school to go to particularly for the science, criminal justice, education and business majors. If you are going for other majors, I would proceed with caution because they only have MA programs for business, biotechnology, criminal justice, and education. Besides that it is a really great school to go to learn about the African American history there and to get a better understanding of what it's like to go to an HBCU especially if you are African American. The dorm life is okay but not great and the campus as a whole is a nice and productive place to be, but there are not a lot of activities or job opportunities outside of the campus. It can get really easy to get into things that you shouldn't out of boredom at times, but if your main purpose is to get a great education experience then Claflin is definitely the school to invest in."
Freshman,4,Claflin is a great school. Classroom size is small and allows more personal time with instructors. Sorority life is great and the school has activities that fit everyone’s needs. The environment is very diverse and allows for the learning of others cultures.
Junior,4,Claflin is a great school and uniquely different from all other HBCUs while the school has its challenges and problems I find that the opportunities provided are far greater than those offered at any other school.
Junior,4,Claflin is a good college. It is rated Top 10 amongst HBCUs and I am proud. They could improve on their housing because some times they do not clean running water. The professors are nice and the faculty and staff move quick to get things done. I have one more year left and I am glad to spend it at the illustrious Claflin University.
Sophomore,4,"what I love about Clalfin University is everything is family oriented , there is exactly no one left behind Claflin is my home away from home if I didn't chose Claflin University I don't now where i would be."
Freshman,4,"Overall experience with Claflin university has been remarkable. Needless to say,
all staff has been very helpful and supportive to making this change of life more 
easier for me. However, this thing called college life is way different then I remember high school being; but I feel Claflin university was the best fit for me.

It look like the academic department cares about the students and their education. Claflin University has a nice campus it's very clean and beautiful.
Freshman,4,I was very pleased with my overall experience with Claflin University. The staff and atmosphere is very pleasant.
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience at Claflin has been good. At first it was a huge adjustment for me since I'm a first year student, but now going into my second year at Claflin it is safe to say that I won't be going anyway soon. Claflin has really grown on me. I've had so many good experiences at Claflin and have made so many good memories and friends there and they really show that they care. So if your considering going to an HBCU Claflin would definitely be a good choice."
Sophomore,4,Claflin is an very great school. The teachers are amazing they take time out to help you have an understanding of your work. They push forward and try their best in leading you in the right direction.
Freshman,4,"I love the family, and small campus feel, but do feel like a lot of things could be updated. Also, a lot of things that bigger schools have we need. Also, food in the cafe, and the price of this school."
Freshman,4,"Claflin University is a true HBCU, however I would recommend students of any ethnicity to attend. The campus makes you feel like you are surrounded by family. The student teacher ratio is no more than 30. They have activities and other events that encourage you throughout the school year."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Claflin University has been wonderful. I never actually expected going to an HBCU. I felt as though there would not be as much diversity as I would like, Claflin is actually very diverse. This is the start of my second semester of my freshman year and I have learned so much attending Claflin. Their athletics department from what I have researched and seen are amazing at what they do. This is a religious school so there is not much partying but when their is an event here at Claflin, the students are all for it. I am enjoying my time at Claflin."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I've had a good experience here.  The class sizes are small, it's easy to get to your classes/ other buildings and facilities, and the college has a very caring environment with people who actually look out for you.  Some things I wish would change include: better WiFi, more school spirit, better dining options, more housing options, and leniency on some of the rules here (like assembly attendance)."
Sophomore,4,"Claflin University is a place where visionaries connect. As I am matriculating through Claflin, I am learning about myself, others, handleing obstacles, and growing up. I would not trade this University for any other university. Although there are minor bumps in the road, all universities need improvement in some shape or form."
Freshman,4,"My experience here at claflin thus far as been truly amazing, the uiversity is met all of my assumptions of what I envisioned college life to be. Its faculty staff members are the best of all the HBCUs and the professors are fully equipt to ensure that their students get good grades. "
Sophomore,4,"Claflin university is beautiful. I love going to this university it was the best decision I made. Being a college athlete it offers everything I need, exceeding all expectations I had about college. The professors are really great and genuine, I've gained so much knowledge my freshman year. I would recommend this university to everyone. The only thing I would want to see change with claflin is the importance of sports."
Niche User,4,"Claflin seems like a wonderful school to attend. I love how it's an HBCU but there is other minorities. When I visited, everyone was friendly and seem to communicate well. I love a place where everyone can get along and work well together. Claflin is a beautiful black university where i feel like home. I do not think anything should change about Claflin campus life wise but I do not know academics wise."
College Sophomore,4,For the area the housing is adequate
College Sophomore,4,The professor are nice and cool. My only difficult experience I had was probably with my chemistry teacher. The class was so hard and I barely understand what she was saying. I had a tutor and I even ask for her help and she still failed me. The class size was pretty sure everybody knew everybody name which was a good thing
College Sophomore,4,Public safety is pretty big on our campus. They walk around all night watching the campus. They even ask if we need a ride to go to the cafe or even the gym. I feel safe and secure at my school. Safety services are great they ask for you ID now at the gate.
College Sophomore,4,Living on campus is very convenient for any students. Just because the classes are right there. The dorms are nice alittle upgrade would not be bad. Probably one of the worst experience I had while staying in Claflin dorms. Was probably the girls not everybody is clean as you and that's something you have to remember as a student. The best option for staying on campus would probably be to stay in a suit. Then you will have your own space and share one bathroom with just one other person.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is probably one of the best part of our campus. They have meltdowns for the students. Which encourage the students to be more socially and interact with the other students. Sometimes they come into the class room and make sure that we as students are staying on top of our game. Some Greeks can even be the students tutor helping them where it matters the most.
College Sophomore,4,You can definitely hear the Claflin confidence when you step foot into our gymnasium. Our fan support is one of the best in the nation. Our coaches are like no other coaches you will ever see. We all come together to show out athletes that we are here for you. When we travel we are louder than other side of the court. Just because we have that Claflin confidence. Can I get C say what say what. Can I get a L say what say what. AFLIN what's that spell CLAFLIN !!. Claflin confidence. We rock.
College Sophomore,4,Claflin is always finding a new way to make their students marketable in every way possible. Our President works very hard to make the best connections possible.
College Sophomore,4,"Claflin goes above and beyond to ensure that students are safe 24/7, 365"
College Sophomore,4,Very high standards are set in order to join
College Freshman,4,claflin vs benedict game is a breathe taker and homecoming week is phenomenal
Sophomore,2,Claflin University is nice school the school needs to open more programs and departments for all the students. But overall nice school the teachers don't care well most don't and the students are very not open and cliquey
Sophomore,2,"It is just not what it is made out to be, and I wish that I would have began some where else so that I could have the experience that college life has to offer."
Freshman,2,"If your a loner don’t except to make a lot of friends or any for that matter. People already have their cliques together. Academics are good, but social scene is not the best."
College Sophomore,2,I lived in Asbury my freshman year at Claflin and I'd have to say that it was one of the worst experiences of my life. Girls are definitely nasty and I would not recommend living in Asbury to anyone.
College Sophomore,2,"I play baseball, we play on a city field and not a university field which causes our attendance to not be as high as other sports."
College Freshman,2,The Housing is bad because the people in that dorm share that one particular bathroom .
College Sophomore,2,We don't have much parties. Everyone goes over to SCSU for parties.
College Sophomore,2,"As you walk past the boys dorm, you will see people sitting down and smoking marijuana."
College Freshman,2,I have a friend that was assaulted and nothing happened to the guy who assaulted her.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms I stay in now are horrible, but most freshman dorms are."
College Sophomore,2,The gates are left open at night. Easy access to campus.
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are too small and crowded.
College Sophomore,2,This is the worst HBCU.
Recent Alumnus,2,Just the basic three restaurants to go to every single time
Recent Alumnus,2,There to really look forward to in a meal all year on campus
College Freshman,2,The food is horrible. It's the same thing over and over. Fry chicken Wed and fish Fridays. There is limited suggestions and the food does not fulfill you.
College Junior,2,The fact that you can only have coed visitation after 6 pm is terrible in my opinion. We are adults.
College Junior,2,"In comparison to other schools, the dining experience is bad. There are basically not any options besides pizza hut and the cafe. The worst thing is the fact the cafe closes at 7."
College Freshman,2,The bathrooms are NEVER clean and it is really cold right now and we don't have any heat going through our building.
College Freshman,2,I'm from Chicago and I stay in my room after Dinner to make sure nothing happens.
College Freshman,2,They're more worried about formality than creating and maintaining a healthy relationship that both the students and administrators understand together.
College Sophomore,2,Not enough parties plus the school does not allow parties on campus.
College Junior,2,They need more assistance! The ladies work hard there but they need help for a faster process.
College Junior,2,For a small town if some money was seriously invested this could be a very vibrant college town but the colleges (Claflin and SCSU)  in it is what holds this city together.
College Junior,2,"Most of the restaurants are chains such as McDonald's, Cookout, and Taco Bell so the prices are the usual amounts. The restaurants I just listed, plus a Dominos and Chinese restaurant are located about 2 blocks from campus so those are convenient. If you want fancier cuisine like Applebee's, iHop, or Cracker Barrel you'll have to drive about 5 minutes from campus. To my knowledge, none of the restaurants in town offer student discounts. The variety sucks but the most delicious restaurant is Mr. Hibachi, a Japanese restaurant."
College Junior,2,Recieving finacial aid is a hassel. I go to a very expensive school so tutition goes up every year making hard to recieve the finacial aid leaving others without any resources for school.
College Junior,2,"With the addition on a new dorm, on campus parking is even more limited than before."
College Junior,2,The wifi sucks!! I use a lot of GB on my cell phone plan.
College Sophomore,2,There isn't much to do off campus.
College Junior,2,the computers are slow the wifi is off and on and the library be packed because of it.
College Sophomore,2,"Getting back and forth is very stressful without a car. However, you can take the Greyhound or a plane (but the closest airport is 45min away)."
College Sophomore,2,"Coming from a big city where I could travel, I feel trapped here. Without a car, there's nothing to do."
College Junior,2,The dorm I stay in is old and nasty
College Junior,2,Haven't heard of any transportation on campus
College Sophomore,2,Parking on campus really ticks me off! You can't park on campus before five p.m. even if your an enrolled student with a parking pass. Mostly all campus parking is for the faculty and staff. Even if the students park in a visitors spot they still get a ticket and possibly get towed. It's ridiculous! 
College Sophomore,2,"The cafe at our school is poor in my opinion. Sodexo is responsible for our meals and in my opinion they are there just for the money. The options available are little to none and sort of a redundant choice selection every day. The student we have, has a pizza hut and a Jazzman's Cafe but they are often over crowded and getting food from there takes a very long time."
College Sophomore,2,"Drug safety is a joke on campus. If you want alcohol, you got it! If you want, marijuana you got it! Its the public scene where you have to watch yourself. But at school drug and alcohol safely is a complete joke."
College Sophomore,2,"The computer labs in my school are not that great. They have basic computers with basic software and limited space. The network reliability is very unstable because there have been times when the network is down and students aren't even able to check there campus emails, blackboard or there grades. The speed of the wireless connection is a joke. It's really slow and unstable. The need of a personal computer and printer is very beneficial because of the few labs available to go to."
College Sophomore,2,Transportation in my opinion is very poor if you do not own your own car. We have a campus shuttle but other than that you're really out of luck if you don't own a car or have a friend that drives. I've never seen a taxi in town and I don't think that zip cars are existent there. 
College Junior,2,Sometimes the school is strict in areas where it doesn't need to be strict. I feel like they treat us like children and that isn't fun for us.
College Junior,2,"Printers are always broken, the wifi is extremely slow and if there is something working, most likely, you will have to pay for it."
College Junior,2,"There is nothing to do in Orangeburg. It's almost sad
"
College Junior,2,Campus is rather dry. Not much to do around Orangeburg.
College Sophomore,2,Every party you go to a lot of people are drunk or have a cup in their hands. There is always groups of people who smoke a blunt before going into the party
College Sophomore,2,With Orangeburg there is no telling what the weather is going to be like because it is not consistent. 
College Sophomore,2,"I attend a private school, I just belive it should be more safer than what it actually is "
College Sophomore,2,"Claflin University have excellent classes and some what teachers. I enjoy making new friends and meeting new people. Claflin is located in orangeburg, South Carolina. At Claflin University is where my car had got recently stolen and two of my teachers has mess up my midterm grade. Overrall i still enjoy learning n the small classroom. "
College Senior,2,its ok at times but the hot water keep going out
College Senior,2,We have crazy weather. one day its hot then cold...and so on
College Junior,2,You really need to have a car if you come to Claflin
College Junior,2,"I gave it a C- because although there isn't really a whole lot to do here. Orangeburg does have some good places to eat. There,s cookout,McDonald's,Two grocery stores dollar general and piggy wiggly that're practically 2 minutes away from each other,and a bank of america. All of these facilities are conveniently within at the most 10 minutes away from the campus. Although the employees at these businesses aren't necessarily the most polite of people you would meet the food is still all in all great. As for the town itself, It could use some remodeling it probably looks almost the same as it did 50 years ago."
College Sophomore,2,"usually there's a problem with transportation, or the guys are usually in a rush or have an attitude about picking you up."
College Senior,2,"While security is always present on campus, however there is a slow reaction time when calling public safety. They react quicker to breaking up peaceful student gatherings than disturbances on campus. Campus crime is fairly low and the campus for the most part is a relatively safe environment. Claflin always has Panther Alerts which alerts students of any disturbances in or around the campus and severe weather. This has proven to be very beneficial to the students."
College Senior,2,"While the campus is small and picturesque, some of the buildings are in major need of renovation. The student center is a decent student hangout, however the hours that it is open should be longer. Often times there is no where for students to hangout or study after 11pm-12am because everything is closed."
College Senior,2,"There are many different looks at Claflin University. A good amount of student are always dressed appropriately and look the part of a successful college student. A lot of guys though, tend to walk around campus with their pants down low and don't even seem as if they have any concerns. The more students come in, th more it seems dress codes become a problem. That is why I gave the grade ""C-""."
College Sophomore,2,"It isn't much for college students to do in Orangeburg. We have to create our own fun. Orangebug doesn't have a movie theater, bowling alley or skating rink. The bowling alley is located on South Carolina States campus, but it's not really big. I, along with my friends and other students wish there was a lot more you could do. It doesn't even have cool or interesting historical landmarks. One thing is nice and that's Edisto Gardens. Although you can't hang there at night, it's a cool date spot."
College Sophomore,2,"Even though our campus is small, I think we should make more room with parking, not only with student parking but for visitors as well."
College Freshman,2,"I'm going to be really honest, at claflin you really have to be careful with the guys and girls here. The majority of the guys at claflin are undercover and these girls sometimes dress like they going to the club everyday. You really do have to be careful, now don't get me wrong there is  a lot of nice looking people also. You just have to remember why your here not for the boys or parties all that can come later but your here for an education"
College Freshman,2,"The only off campus dining around claflin is a bunch of fast food restaurants. They have a pop eyes,McDonald,cookout,Chinese,dominoes and taco bell. They are all walking distance and in expensive for college students however we don't receive any discounts. To go to some really good restaurants however a lot of students who drive go to Columbia over the week end which is 30 miles from claflin"
College Freshman,2,"The night life at Claflin is on and off during the homecoming and other celebrations and weekends they have a lot of melt downs on campus and also a lot of house parties. But during the midterm and final exam week the partying ends, they even cut out your visitation, and to be honest Claflin is not a party school but there is a lot of house parties and clubs in walking distance that we go to"
College Sophomore,1,I've visited other campuses they live drastically better than we do at Claflin University.
College Freshman,1,"I hate living in these rooms, dirty and small."
College Junior,1,Sends you the run around instead of dealing with the problem head on!
College Freshman,1,This is literally a ghost town. The only thing promised to see/hear is the train that passes by 30 times a day.
College Junior,1,it is very boring not a lot of things to do in the city
College Sophomore,1,Its not done in the open
College Sophomore,1,"There are so many ""lagoons"" everywhere and there are no covered sections on campus other than inside a building. No umbrella, no chance at staying dry and warm."
College Junior,1,Visitation is very strict and makes it almost impossible to associate with someone of the opposite sex
College Senior,1,The weather is so flippy floppy and its the hardest thing to tell how the weather will be because its hot part of the week then cold then raining then back to being hot.
College Junior,1,Campus dining is the absolute worst! I have no more to say.......>:(
College Junior,1,Parking is outrageous. There is only one parking lot for all of the students. Finding a space is near impossible. Plus the lot is about a 10 minute walk from the actual campus.
College Sophomore,1,Now that we are getting a new dorm people have to park all the way down the street. I don't see the reason in buying a parking permit if we cant even park on campus. I am so sired of getting tickets.
College Sophomore,1,Car had got stolen on campus
College Senior,1,We have the worst parking space.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is terrible. There aren't many parking lots available to students on the main campus. Most have to park at the gym then walk from there to the main campus too classes. As a freshman you aren't allowed to drive but there is a need a car on campus.Though there are a few stores and eateries within walking distance. Permit, ticket, and fine prices are pretty average so that's not bad."
College Junior,1,Claflin University's parking is horrible. There aren't even enough parking spaces for the staff. I always hear a lot of complaints from students. I really think the school should try to do something about this problem.
College Sophomore,1,"the weather is so bipolar at times! one minute its sunny, the next its a storm, then it only goes back to sunshine..."
College Senior,1,"Parking at Claflin for students is absolutely terrible. The main problem being that there is not enough parking space. The parking decals are approximately $30 and the chances of finding a parking space close to your actual dorm or class is low. In some cases students pay for the decals just to have to park off campus because there is not enough spaces. The gravel parking lots are also terrible, especially when it rains."
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek unity that is the biggest issue.
College Freshman,1,"NO one really pays attention to the athletics at Claflin, partially because they are not too good."
College Freshman,1,"There is no nightlife here at Claflin. There are some parties off campus, but if you do not have a car then you can't get to them. Most people go home on the weekends so the campus is dead."
College Sophomore,1,Its easy to get into any program at Claflin University.
College Sophomore,1,Rules are everything at Claflin. There are plenty of them and they are always strictly enforced.
College Junior,1,Parking here at Claflin is bad. There is not enough parking space and parking in the graval is very risky.
College Sophomore,1,2 Vans – the transportation system sucks! there are 2 vans for the entire school.
College Freshman,1,Nothing to Do – orangeburg is not a college town at all. the schools are great but the location sucks! there are a few fast food places within walking distance but otherwise everything else is a drive away and the mall is horrible its more like a shopping center. no attractions except the edisto gardens but you have to get there by car as well.
College Student,1,"Parking on campus is a nightmare for the students. The faculty are fine. Every day, a student is fined for ""illegal parking""."
College Student,1,"Nothing Healthy – The majority of off-campus dining is consist of fast food places. As of anything of a major restaurant with healthy option, individuals would have to go on the other side of town for that."
College Freshman,1,School Sucks in Sports – The School Sucks in Sports. Oh yeah and they dont have a football team. Enough Said
College Student,1,"Nothing of Interest – The parties on campus are not that great and repetitive, regardless of which fraternity or sorority is hosting them. Most of the parties are a waste of $5 and they have the lights on, last I checked. Clubs are just as pathetic and cost more. These places always have fights there."
College Student,1,"Limited Internships – As a Criminal Justice major and Psychology minor, there are virtually no internships for the Social Sciences Department on campus. There is none that I know of. The majority of internships are in the Science, Business, and Mass Communications Departments."
College Sophomore,1,"Relationships: Why you'll probably be single til you graduate – Girls if you see a brother with eyeliner on, has more hair products on his head than you can afford, has his eyebrows shaped up too nice, has a bedazzled phone, and/or hangs out with only girls, 9/10 he's gay. And that's what you have at Claflin University...mostly gay males. 

If I had to make a ratio of how many are dogs, unavailable, gay, or just too shy to function dudes on campus it would go like this: 50% are gay, 30% are unavailable, 10% are dogs, and the last 10% are too scared to actually talk to you. 

So its damned near impossible to find a relationship at Claflin at least one that aren't based on sex, trying to stay the undercover brother, or being a player. And State is even worse, so don't think you will find him there either ladies. That's like scouting for men at the State penitentiary. 


Guys (talking to the genuine and straight but shy guys) if you're trying to find a good girl by day but a freak at night, you aint going to find her by just staring at her. If you want a decent girl, you're going to have to grow some balls and talk to her. 9/10 we're just waiting on you to make the first move. 

Now I'm not saying you should go for the girls you know are going to dog you out or are just downright rude or girls you know that are way out of your league (AKAs) but go for the girls that are cute and attainable. If we laugh at your jokes, smile at you, and give you the eye, then that's an opening for you to enter. If you don't take it then some jerk is going to come along and take your chance and then we become victims of their assery.   So do us all a favor and man up! 

"
College Student,1,"Panther Town Is Not Great to Me – Claflin is decent but not great. At first, it was cool. Now, after one year and beyond, I don't like the college here nor the people here but this was the only college I could attend. Making friends is difficult because in ways, you have to be a certain way before being someone's friend on this campus and I barely have friends on this campus.  Academics is the heart of the school, which I have no problem with. Books are way too high. It's better to use textbooks from the library. Greeks are not that great on campus and their parties are usually repetitive, nothing of interest. The value of financial aid is low, since most students have high loans. The staff is slack, in perspective....usually late with essential notices such as financial or residential notices. Usually, they are in their offices, talking to people and eating. Lately, in perspective, there is nothing fun and exciting on campus. Mostly if people want to have fun, they go to SC State or other places. Overall, of my three years being at Claflin, the rating for my Claflin experience: 2.0/10"
College Sophomore,1,I have kinda felt unsafe at Claflin. I mean dont get me wrong the campus is very small and beautiful but i truly think securties are not doing their jobs by watching the campus and its students.
College Freshman,1,I wasnt able to recieve that much help because my mother messed up my fasfa. They dont do much to help on the other hand I feel they could and should do more.
College Junior,1,Non Existent – The freshmen have a midnight curfew on weekdays and and 1pm curfew on weekends. There are no coed dorms or coed visitation for that matter. That makes it difficult for students to socialize on campus. There are a few nightclubs around and there are gym parties occasionally. The are also event at neighboring institutions. But OUR campus is typically dead. You will really see a group of students hanging out outside of their dorms at night.
College Student,1,"Basically, in perspective, there is NO selection to choose from at Claflin. The girls are either bisexual, highly full of themselves, have no respect for people, use profanity as a second language, and/or are licentious (lustful) in any way. Most girls at Claflin wear clothes that are slightly revealing (see through), showing off their body parts. They do it in a way that is excessively distracting, especially for guys who study constantly, don't have time for girls, and desire to graduate on time and leave Claflin forever to attend graduate school, like myself. If they value that method as attractive to a noble young man, they are highly mistaken. With that, they will still only attract the ""dogs"" of Claflin. The Greek girls are highly recognized and they are used to having young dudes ""worship"" their feet and/or butts, mostly. So, by realistic sense, you can count most of these girls, if not all, as being manipulative and sex driven to get what they desire, the ones who sleeps with every major popular dude and let the young males look like a broken mess at the end, if he is not already one. In reality, the majority of Claflin girls are sex driven, profanity based, not willing for commitment (even though they ""say"" they are, NOT; and use dudes for materialistic gain, nonetheless. Thankfully and ironically, I have not attracted a Claflin girl during my time at Claflin and I want it to stay that way. So, young men, if you are looking for long-term commitment with a lady (honorable relationship, marriage) then look for young women at Univ. of South Carolina or South Carolina State Univ. or any large college. If you're at Claflin, looking for commitment, you will never find that. Seriously, true romantic relationships are considered far-fetched and virtually impossible on campus. Even if a relationship were to blossom at Claflin, that relationship would possibly fail since everyone there would know your personal life."
College Student,1,"They are...for the win? Not Really – The Greeks on campus are nothing special, nothing to worship about them. They believe that they are higher than the non-greeks and get away with actions very easily. The women Greeks: Some are cool, others are snobby, raunchy(wearing revealing clothes on a school day) and some are ""open for business"" Yeah, it's a shame. The fraternal men are...whatever, most of them are just players, always getting into women's ....exclusive aura, especially with the women Greeks. Once again...I see nor sense nothing special about them."
College Student,1,"The Same People – There are only, if not mostly, African American students on campus. With a few Africans, white, and Caribbean individuals, there's no diversity. I would love to see most more Africans and Asian individuals to attend Claflin or SC State to learn more about their history. To be real, I'm tired of seeing the same black students everyday."
College Student,1,"Not a Good Sight to See – I relieved that Claflin even have dorms. There are numerous choice for the girls, but it's limited for the dudes (barely four dorms for us) Besides the SRC dorms on campus, there's really no study environment at all. I have to go to SC State, just to get studying half done."

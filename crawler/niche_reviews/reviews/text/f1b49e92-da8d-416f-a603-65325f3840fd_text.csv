Freshman,5,"I love Kenyon! It feels like home after just one semester. Academics are so great! The best part of it is the relationships with the professors. Because it is such a small school, they have the time to meet with you at anytime and talk about everything you want from social to academic life. It is also a really great D3 school!!"
Senior,5,"The students are all great. Some of the professors really care about their material and students. The facilities all around campus are really nice, and there's a ton of different clubs to join."
Senior,5,"I hope to see the housing situation improve, but the community is amazing. The professor are extremely thoughtful and always helpful. The small student body might feel suffocating at times, but offers great support at other times."
Freshman,5,I love everything about Kenyon College. The professors are incredible and my classes are super engaging and informative. The campus is gorgeous and the people here are supportive and caring and are all driven people.
Alum,5,"I fondly look back at my time at Kenyon College. Even though it was hard work and I ended up pulling many all-nighters, I appreciate how my courses challenged me and how my professors always were eager to encourage me to think more critically and delve deeper into whatever topic interested me. The research resources the school offered were excellent and the school organizations were numerous and fulfilling."
Sophomore,5,"First-rate college. Kenyon is among the best undergraduate programs in the world. The uniqueness of intellectual students, excellent professors, and the beautiful campus is unbeatable. This is a rigorous school that will test you at every level, but comparable to other famously rigorous schools. The undergraduate education that you get here is highly multidisciplinary and truly prepares you to think about any subject deeply. The rich history of this school and the culture of critical thinker/intellectual students makes this a unique and valuable place - and one of the best educations around.  A classmate transferred to Kenyon from Middlebury and another from Princeton.  Both said that Kenyon’s approach to education is more personal, educationally rich, and there is a college culture at Kenyon where we all help each other to succeed.  Kenyon is difficult but manageable and the alumni connections are worldwide.  Hands-down best choice!"
Junior,5,"While certain aspects of Kenyon might be a little rough around the edges, I wouldn't trade in my experience here for anything. The students and faculty here are simply unlike everywhere else: intelligent, dedicated, and kind to a fault. While Kenyon's lack of diversity and location in rural Ohio can at times make it difficult to be a student of color, the college has demonstrated repeatedly that it is dedicated to making every student feel comfortable and appreciated, and the community here is unlike anything else I've encountered at other PWIs. If you're a student looking to challenge yourself academically and personally, while making connections that will last you a lifetime, then Kenyon is the place for you."
Freshman,5,"Kenyon is quite a unique place. It offers one the opportunity to broaden your perspectives and learn from very prepared faculty. 

The diversity of classes and professors (as well as the liberal arts flexibility) allow you to take classes that are not specifically related to your field but change your vision of the world. Last semester I took a seminar on African Diaspora Studies to try something different, and it was my favorite class by far. 

Small class sizes make the learning process more engaging since most courses are discussion-based. Your class contributions are seen as important and having a heavy lecture-based subject is atypical."
Sophomore,5,"I love Kenyon. Great atmosphere and a tight-knit community. The food is okay, mount Vernon is okay, but the rest is great"
Junior,5,"Kenyon College, though it isn't perfect, is as close to the ideal rural/small liberal arts college as you're going to get. Nestled on a beautiful hill in the heart of rural Ohio, it yields a private, quiet space to meditate on what you're learning and grow not only intellectually but personally as well. This is also helped by its fantastic, caring staff of professors and administrators alike, as well as its kind, friendly, and inclusive students. Kenyon is a community; we care for eachother and help eachother, during our time there and long after. It has an expansive alumni reach, too, so you're sure to have friendly connections post-graduation, helping pay off any loans you may take out to go there as it is rather expensive, though financial aid is fantastic for those who need it -- Kenyon is a 100% need met school."
Niche User,5,"Superb academics in a gorgeous setting, Kenyon embodies the best qualities of an All American college.  The students are openminded, smart and with a sense of purpose, creative, competent, genuinely involved in their education, and not as distracted by the party scene as you find in other colleges."
Freshman,5,"Kenyon is a special place. It is one of the best places in the world to to explore/find the things which interest you most. I seem to have had a very different experience than the previous reviewer, who said that Kenyon is ""sports and greek life oriented"" and socially ""kind of High School"". There certainly are groups of people who are very big into that aspect of Kenyon's culture. Greek life, however, is dwindling at Kenyon, as it is at other colleges, and the sports culture is innocuous and fun. The vast majority of students are your typical liberal arts student - bookish, quirky, interesting, friendly. At other schools, sports players and greek life members have a bad rep. At Kenyon, since it attracts such quality students, the greek life members and sports players are generally just as quirky, bookish, interesting and friendly as the rest of us. Those who are not are socially ostracized. You will be amazed by the friends you make and things you learn here."
Alum,5,The academics are second to none. The campus is gorgeous and there are lots of opportunities for growth and involvement. The dorms are horrible and the administration attempts to police the students into oblivion.
Junior,5,"Truly an exceptional college in multiple ways. The school distincts itself by its high quality professors with a lot of time outside of class to help, great campus atmosphere and a close-knit community. Many of the classes have considerably high standards with no grade inflation and an in-depth look into various academic areas. Additionally, the athletic facilities are not matched across the country, really great facilities."
Niche User,5,"‪Kenyon is incredible. It's unlike any other college. I went into Kenyon skeptical. It's tiny and in the middle of nowhere. What could there be to do? I was worried that the party scene would be lame and that I wouldn't find other people like me on such a small campus. I was so wrong. Everyone has a place at Kenyon. I found an amazing group of friends and I get to be my authentic self on this campus. I can be a total nerd in Olin (that's our library) throughout the week and have lots of fun with my best friends on the weekend. I feel like at any other school I'd have to pick a role like party girl or nerdy girl or art girl, but at Kenyon you can be everything you are and people will think it's totally cool that you're all those things. I know ""lax bro's"" who love art. I know fraternity brothers who geek out for history. Everyone is three-dimensional at Kenyon. We don't fit in the boxes we'd be placed in at other schools. Come to the 'Bier (that's Gambier) and check it out! ‬"
Senior,5,"Like most schools, it is how you make it. Best experience of my life, as an athlete joining in made things 20 x easier. The best years of my life."
Sophomore,5,Excellent place to learn and find your self. I would definitely reccomend it to anyone open to a small school experience.
Junior,5,I am a proud student of this outstanding institution. The school features dedicated professors combined with tremendous intellect from the student body.
Sophomore,5,"I love the small classes and access to the professors.  The KAC (Kenyon Athletic Center) is amazing.  The freshman dorms are pretty average, but housing options are much better for upper classes."
College Senior,5,"Professors at Kenyon are amazing and worth getting to know. Most will genuinely care about your success and wellbeing, though they will make you work hard. It's usually not too hard to get into classes you want, unless you want to get involved with the Creative Writing program--entry to those classes are based entirely on favoritism. The workload is intense, and how much you can get away with not doing the reading will vary by professor."
College Senior,5,"The academics alone make it worth it. Kenyon has some of the best professors in the country, and I can count the bad classes I've taken here on one hand. You have no ""gen ed"" requirements, but you do need to take a certain number of classes in each discipline (Natural Science, Social Science, Humanities, and Fine Arts). This is a lot easier to do than it sounds. Students of all majors/concentrations/interests hang out with each other, and for the most part, students aren't super competitive when it comes to academics. Everyone just wants to do their best rather than be THE best."
College Senior,5,"You will learn a lot, both in and out of the classroom, and you will make some pretty amazing friends. Everyone at Kenyon is passionate (some would even say ""nerdy"") about something, and Kenyon encourages those passions to the surface. You have to be comfortable with working hard. There are no easy As here."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The alumni network is well connected and updated, and can be found throughout the world. Many Kenyon graduates move on to graduate school or are immediately employed, or move through alumni connections to find and/or join organizations or companies. Frequent talks and lectures are organized on campus (at least 2-3 a week) regarding career opportunities or information sessions of schools, programs, or global organizations. The professors have many many contacts up their sleeve as well. Much of the student body is works on campus or volunteers for the local community or school."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I was a member of the Kenyon College swim team, one of the best among DIII schools with a fantastic legacy. Many of our friends were members of the basketball team, soccer team, tennis team, volleyball team, track and field team, you name it, and they were all equally driven, inspired and inspiring athletes. Our athletic facility is easily one of the best equipped and most beautiful college athletic facilities in the country and is frequently mentioned in Princeton reviews. With a wonderful program, coaches, teammates, and facility, Kenyon College provided a quality environment for us athletes. Faculty were very respectful of athletics and values these qualities in their students."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Kenyon College was honestly the best thing to ever happen to me. I met the most amazing, caring, driven professors who changed my world perspective and helped me to realize my full potential, I came into the college believing I will be pre-med, to the core - I knew at the very least I would never become a history or political science major. Low and behold, I graduated a political science major and biology minor. I found my true home in the PSCI department. And while I am still pursuing a career in medicine, this liberal arts college made me realize my strengths in areas I would have never considered otherwise. My advising professors and coaches became my college parents away from home, and I found a community of driven, honest, and fiercely loyal friends. I know these relationships will last a lifetime. I have never once regretted my decision or even imagined what college life might have been like elsewhere."
College Sophomore,5,"Our athletic facility is new, large, and absolutely gorgeous."
College Sophomore,5,Whether or not someone enjoys their college is heavily dependent on whether or not the college is a good fit. Kenyon is a great fit for me and I love it.
College Junior,5,"The academics have been my favorite part of Kenyon. Almost all of the professors I've had have been so kind, intelligent, and passionate about teaching. It has been a pleasure taking such interesting classes with such engaged individuals."
College Freshman,5,Constant work on security by Campus Safety. I feel very safe here.
College Freshman,5,A lot of connections with alumni for jobs and internships through the CDO. Professors are also helpful in that regard.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone lives on campus, as a student on financial it i think its great and makes everything easier."
College Freshman,5,Extremely safe. Lots of resources to provide this.
College Freshman,5,Most everyone gets a great job after graduation.
College Freshman,5,"Small classes, great professors its wonderful."
College Freshman,5,I love everything about school.
College Freshman,5,"Granted, I've only been at Kenyon for one semester.  However, it has been an incredible experience.  The professors are extremely accommodating and kind.  They are very eager to help if you have questions.  The class sizes are pretty good. The biggest class I have ever been in is a 40-person class.  The class size is very welcoming.  There are so many courses to choose from.  Course selections are my favorite time of year, although registering not so much."
College Freshman,5,Kenyon College is an incredible college because it allows you to explore a variety of topics as well as pursue the ones that you already are interested in.  The professors are very supportive and are glad when you come by for office hours.
College Freshman,5,Kenyon is incredibly safe. I know a lot of people who will leave their things at the library while they go to dinner.
College Freshman,5,"I have found my second home at Kenyon with a group of individuals that has become my second family. Kenyon has given me the opportunity to explore my interests in an engaging way, and it has stretched my thinking on many topics. I love it here."
College Senior,5,Kenyon has been an amazing experience overall. Despite majoring in international studies I am all set with a job in finance when I graduate. Have been able to study abroad and see the world fully supported by financial aid. Campus is beautiful although winter in Ohio is not the best.
College Sophomore,5,"I, as many freshmen do, had a bit of trouble adjusting initially. Then, in early November, I had to return home for health reasons. I probably only missed about a week of school, but upon my return I went to our dining hall for dinner and dozens of people came up to hug me and welcome me back, people I had hardly talked to. At a school as small as Kenyon, I assumed gossip would spread like wildfire. Instead, the size seems to create this insanely supportive and loving community. People want to know about you and your life because they care, not so they can whisper about it to others."
College Senior,5,"This campus would not run without Greeks. Besides providing parties that are open to anyone--and free--they do a lot for the campus. Kenyon Greek Life is different, and the groups are friendly and welcoming, even if you make it clear that you have no intentions of rushing/pledging. Each group has a different personality and presence on campus, but I think that most people appreciate the more visible groups for what they do."
College Freshman,5,"I'm only a first year, but so far I've only had pleasant experiences with the administration and campus safety. They honestly make me feel like they're there to help, not to get us into trouble."
College Freshman,5,"I would advise calling ahead to make an appointment if possible, but besides some occasional overcrowding, the health center is great."
College Sophomore,5,"I am on the swim team, which is the most developed and competitive team on campus. It's a great experience and we have a lot of alumni support. The professors respect what we do for the most part and help us to balance the workload. We are well-funded and our facilities are new and beautiful. We also compete against very high-level teams because we often travel to meets against division one schools."
College Sophomore,5,"The physics classes are challenging and the professors offer lots of one-on-one independent study options. Also, because it's a liberal arts school, Kenyon requires us to take a diverse range of classes outside our major. There is also a  department-wide emphasis on writing and communication skills, which is lacking at a lot of other schools, especially in the sciences."
College Sophomore,5,"I go to arguably the prettiest school in the country. The campus and its facilitates are beautiful. My only complaint in that area is that handicap accessibility to some buildings is limited. The food is about as good and easily accessible as college dining can get, although sometimes I would appreciate a little more variety, especially during the winter months. The athletic facility is top notch. While the lab facilities may not be quite as advanced as those of a large school, students have an amazing amount of access to the equipment, probably much more than most undergraduates."
College Junior,5,Kenyon is a beautiful place with wonderful people who care about and support each other both socially and intellectually.
College Junior,5,"Any student (any year) can apply for a parking spot on campus. Campus is pretty small, so parking spots are never too far away."
College Junior,5,All you need to do is find an advisor and declare.
College Junior,5,My professors are wonderful and I have gotten to know them well. There are lots of courses to take. Our department has fun ice cream socials and holiday parties etc.
College Junior,5,"It's super small so the community is really small and tight-knit. Professors are exceptionally accessible and get to know students really well. Kenyon has a lot of history and traditions that make it feel like a really special place. Students are very intelligent without being overly competitive and cut-throat. Also, it's beautiful and it looks like Hogwarts."
College Junior,5,Our school is absolutely beautiful. The architecture is awesome. Kenyon has a bunch of traditions that bring the student body together. There are lots of campus activities to participate in.
College Junior,5,"There is lots of variety, an awesome local foods program, and our head chef takes and responds to requests/suggestions/complaints via Facebook. There's only one dining hall, but that means it's a good place to find anyone you might be looking for!"
College Junior,5,Professors are super accessible and dedicated. Academics are challenging but the workload is manageable. There is lots of support for the registration process.
College Junior,5,The political science department is absolutely wonderful!!
College Junior,5,"Free printing, very accessible technical support, lots of computer labs!"
College Freshman,5,"Between great food, challenging classes and a beutiful campus (one of the top five in the world) I wouldn't trade this experience for anything!"
College Sophomore,5,"Financial aid at Kenyon is great. Of course the process of filling out the FAFSA and CSS Profile is a hassle, but it's worth it because Kenyon is dedicated to giving students their demonstrated financial need. Financial aid was a major factor when choosing schools and I couldn't have really picked a better school."
College Junior,5,"Athletics are typical of division III- you work hard and compete well, but it's not as all-consuming as d I or II. Our school is generally pretty competitive within our conference. The swim/diving team is famous, and they have more of a D I lifestyle- they've gone to/won the national championship for almost 35 years. Athletes also throw the most parties, after Greeks."
Junior,4,Kenyon is an intellectually stimulating school with lots of organizations that can cater to whatever your interests are. The professors are incredibly smart and because of the school size they can form a real connection with students. I feel like I'm learning more than ever.
Alum,4,I loved the campus and the relationships that I made there. I loved the professors and how much they helped the students. I loved the dining hall. I loved old kenyon. I loved my friends.
Alum,4,"I am sure Kenyon is doing a great job with online learning. The professors care so much.  From what I have heard from undergrads, it is not the same as going to class. Too much is missing. But the professors are trying hard."
Freshman,4,Kenyon Is a small-town school with a spectacular education and home to a certain kind of students that always make you feel welcomed
Freshman,4,"Kenyon is a great place to get to know yourself, but it has its issues. There are only 6 counselors for the entire campus, the EMTs are largely student volunteers (which is fine, but I know I'd prefer somebody who's had more training), Peirce is bad about dietary restrictions, and things can get cliquey because of the size of the school. But, it's very easy to make friends inside and outside of your major, and to connect with the faculty. I couldn't see myself anywhere else, or in any other department."
Freshman,4,"It is a lot more sports/Greek oriented than I imagined, but I still enjoy it. For a small school, after a semester I am still meeting people I've never seen before (maybe I'm just unobservant),  and it seems students still find themselves making new friends even senior year. It's very high school socially, perhaps because of size, but the cliques aren't as intimidating. 
I have enjoyed classes immensely, not that I've had so much experience with them yet. I would recommend contacting professors early and often– twice I have contacted professors with interest in a particular course and they have just enrolled me! This doesn't seem like a super frequent practice, but do all you can  to get on waitlists as soon as possible because enrolling in courses is surprisingly difficult. Introducing yourself in person to prospective professors goes a long way. Not that particularly pertains to Kenyon..."
Alum,4,"Kenyon's best and worst quality is that it's a small and isolated ecosystem, which allowed me to seek quiet, reflect inwardly, and learn about myself. Of course, it's also a place with its own brand of comfortable homogeneity, where change is frustratingly slow. I had unforgettable conversations about how to improve the world with students and faculty, but action was often less forthcoming. Because of that I now know it's a place I need to move on from, but I'm thankful for the significant amount I learned at Kenyon and the tight community it made me a part of."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy being at Kenyon. I love its environment. The school doesn't feel closed off to me. There are a lot of things to do with only a 15 minute drive away. It's not separated from things. It's a college campus but just not within a city. I like how people are quirky but also don't fit that as a label. The students are people. It's that simple sometimes.
Freshman,4,"Kenyon College is a great place to learn and grow. Due to the small size of the school, it truly is a tight knit community. People are connected to each other in many intricate and unexpected ways, which gives Kenyon students a sense of commonality, despite the wide variety of interests and views that the students of this school hold. From the beginning, classes are small and personal. Professors will get to know you and they will help you in any way that they can in an academic environment that is both challenging and fulfilling. Ultimately, I am very happy with my choice of Kenyon college."
Freshman,4,"I was looking at a wide variety of schools when applying to college (OSU, Miami(OH), University of Dayton) and Kenyon (surprisingly) gave me the most financial aid out of any of the schools. I would have cost me twice as much to go to Ohio State. I didn't have a stellar GPA or ACT but I was recruited to play a sport which definitely helped me get in. The campus is amazing but secluded. It's about a 10 minute drive to town where all the chain restaurants are chipotle, mcdonalds, wendys etc... The only down side to the campus is walking 3/4 a mile to your car where all freshman have to park but if you don't have a car it's not an issue. In terms of parties something is going on every weekend usually, especially during the first weeks of school. Academics are definitely hard but manageable, the only thing that I didn't like is the requirements you have to have before you graduate but as a freshman I don't really have to worry about that yet. "
Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my experience here. The people are top notch. There's something for everybody, even though the school is so small. Some narrow-minded academic departments, mediocre food, and problematic administrators have limited my experience, but it's been really very good so far."
College Senior,4,"All-campus parties can be a lot of fun if you're in the mood. Apartment parties are more my style, and there's a bit more freedom with those anyway. Girls especially need to be defensive on nights out. Turn out the lights in Old K and some dudes think they can get away with anything."
College Senior,4,"There are a lot of opportunities for internships/resume boosters on campus, which helps, especially if you live in an area where there are not a lot of summer internship opportunities. Many of the recruiters who come to campus are a little too corporate for what I want to pursue after graduation. The CDO itself is great and they will help with any aspect of job/internship applications you need."
College Senior,4,"I made some of my closest friends through my sorority, and it's been an important part of my life on campus. 

Your life will not revolve around your Greek organization 24/7 the way it would at a larger school. Though there are frats and sororities, frats still tend to dominate the social scene (there are more of them and they throw more parties), and while individual members can be fine, hive-mind tends to take over in that large a group of men."
College Senior,4,"The KAC is fantastic and worth the walk down the hill. If you're not an athlete, it can be kind of intimidating if you're there at a time when entire sports teams are working out together."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I personally have never had an issue regarding campus crime, personal safety, or sexual assault, but I know a few students on campus have in my 4 years there. But I am sure there is a baseline to every college campus (as terrible as that sounds) and I do not believe Kenyon is any worse than anywhere else - much better than other college campuses, in my opinion."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I honestly loved my campus housing, although there is no off-campus housing options. Gambier is a small college town, so everything is clustered around the college itself. From the farthest dorm it might take 10-15 minutes to walk to your class. But it can also be a 10 second walk. Junior and senior year I had very spacious rooms in very convenient locations. The cons include relatively old buildings (although they renovate frequently) because the college itself is old, and that there are few options offering air conditioning - but that is only really an issue for the first few weeks of moving into campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I was not part of one, but many of my friends were and they were always involved in community events and services and organized fantastic campus-inclusive events and parties. I have never had a negative experience with a member of Greek society or with a Greek organization itself."
College Freshman,4,"Most professors are amazing and are enthusiastic about what they teach. Very few professors are somewhat confusing, but all professors take time out of class to explain things to students."
College Freshman,4,I've learned a lot and have had tons of fun doing so
College Freshman,4,A large variety of nice options.
College Freshman,4,Especially around parties campus safety is always present to ensure everyone's health.
College Freshman,4,"I haven't really started looking for on campus employment, but I know the CDO works hard to ensure students find jobs if they need them."
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are pretty good.  I feel like the dorms for the freshmen are lower quality, but that's ok."
College Freshman,4,The athletic facilities are really good.  There is a lot of care put into its maintenance and the equipment.
College Freshman,4,"Alcohol is by far the most prevalent drug, but weed is also very popular on campus. I've also seen people doing cocaine and adderall, but they are less common. Although there is a lot of drinking and drug usage that occurs at Kenyon, I wouldn't consider it to be excessive, especially compared to other college campuses. Furthermore, Kenyon does a good job of promoting healthy drinking practices."
College Freshman,4,"Personally, I love going to Old K for parties, but they also happen at other locations around campus as well. If nothing else, there is always something going on in the bullseye."
College Freshman,4,"I love Kenyon nightlife because there are a lot of options. Personally, I enjoy going out to parties and casual drinking, so I can always find something to do with friends. There are also weekly concerts on the weekends, and a lot of people have small private parties or chill in their rooms too."
College Freshman,4,"Kenyon is known as an English school, but we also have a lot of science majors (Bio, Chem, Psych, Enviro) and political science majors. Also, a lot of people here double major or will minor in other areas as well. Each major is challenging in its own way."
College Freshman,4,Most pre-med students are able to get into their top choices
College Freshman,4,So far I've loved all of my classes and the professors.
College Freshman,4,The mens soccer team is phenomenal as is boys frisbee.
College Junior,4,I am very happy I chose Kenyon mainly because it is where I met the most important people in my life
College Senior,4,"It's really what you make of it. Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday nights will almost always have something going on if you want. The parties are definitely controlled by the Greek community--just about all of the all-campus parties are thrown by fraternities. Still, you can almost always find something smaller going on in an apartment or at a bar. I've never found myself with nothing to do."
College Senior,4,"There's a reason they're called campus safety and not campus police. They really do look out for the students' best interests, and they're nice people to make friends with! Parking enforcement can be a little annoying."
College Freshman,4,"Because all of the restaurants in Gambier are technically ""on-campus,"" the main and closest ""off-campus"" dining options are in Mount Vernon. While you have to take the shuttle or find someone with a car to get to Mount Vernon, there are a number of chain restaurants, like Chipotle and Panera, and also great independent restaurants. While the food is delicious, it'd be nice if it were closer to Kenyon."
College Freshman,4,"While we love to hate on Peirce, truth is that Kenyon's dining hall exceeds that of most college campuses. Sure, the food is bad sometimes, mediocre at others, and then on-point. Like life, [Peirce] ""it's like a box of chocolates -- you never know what you're gonna get."""
College Freshman,4,"I'm not big on party scenes, but I love small parties with a lot of my friends and I have lots of opportunity for that here so I'm more than happy."
College Freshman,4,"It's better than most college food, and the dining staff is really accommodating and they're always willing to listen to us and our recommendations which is really nice!"
College Freshman,4,"President Decatur is a very visible figure on campus, and genuinely seems to be doing his best to better the school. Admissions officers are highly intelligent and friendly, as are most other members of administration."
College Freshman,4,"The school puts a lot of funding toward athletic facilities, and it shows. It is a very active campus, even among those who are not athletes."
College Sophomore,4,"My major is one of the less popular ones so it's easier and less stressful to sign up for classes since I know I will get into the classes I want that are in my major. The professors are excellent and there is a close-knit community between professors and students. Also, my major department has a lot of resources and gives every major a laptop for their time as an undergraduate."
College Sophomore,4,"I think overall, the housing is pretty good. However, the housing lottery is a bloodbath and I got the last available room on campus for this coming year, so I'm much farther away from a lot of my teammates and my classes than I would have liked. However, juniors and seniors do better in the housing lottery and I think there are quite a few great, spacious options for them that are also very close to the dining hall and classes. The size and cleanliness of dorms is probably average. Bathrooms aren't great but I usually shower at the athletic center so that's a nonissue. Only a small number of buildings have air conditioning. I just wish there were a few more housing options (the student body is growing and overcrowding the dorms) and I wish athletes had some sort of priority. I'm nowhere near the athletic center this coming year."
College Sophomore,4,"The dining hall itself is stellar. While variety is sometimes limited, compared to other college dining halls it is about as good as they come. The food is usually good and the chefs try their best to make new things and give us options. The meal plan is easy: unlimited food at the one dining hall. Off-campus dining is limited but the market is open pretty late and the Night-Bites cafe is open until early hours of the morning."
College Sophomore,4,"Parties take place on campus, since the school is in the middle of nowhere. But parties are usually fun and the small campus makes it so that students are usually pretty safe compared with students at many other schools."
College Sophomore,4,"The facilities here are a huge bonus.  All the main campus buildings (not the dorms. definitely not the dorms.) are really amazing.  My favorites are probably Peirce dining hall, Gund Gallery, and the Athletic Center.  The library is not as pretty from the outside but its cozy and full of secret places on the inside.  It's super easy to find a study space on campus too.  Kenyon has a lot of weird and really nice traditions, which they talk about on their website."
College Sophomore,4,"Tiny college, a really friendly group of kids (though many are introverts--hard to make friends at first) huge focus on writing, but especially analytical writing.  (People come here to do creative writing but most of the english classes are analytical.) Campus facilities are state of the art, I think."
College Sophomore,4,"Kenyon does a good job of teaching students about sexual assault and where to get help if they need it.  There's a 24 hour hotline you can call for problems, and you can always calls security at any time if you would rather do that.  The health center people are pretty nice and they treat you like you're going to a professional doctor.  Nowadays you can't just walk in, you have to schedule an appointment.  And they should pay for your drugs (they don't. you have to pay.)"
College Sophomore,4,"The Athletic Center at Kenyon is pretty amazing.  They have a great facility for non-athletes, who use it every day, as well as for athletes.  The pool is huge, they've got indoor basketball courts and dance rooms, it really is pretty state of the art."
College Junior,4,"Many students do choose to drink, but I have not encountered any peer pressure at Kenyon. There are definitely students who choose not to drink, and they still seem to have fun/feel comfortable socializing without drinking."
College Junior,4,The financial aid office is super accessible and helpful!
College Junior,4,"The athletic center is state of the art and absolutely beautiful. Varsity athletics aren't a huge deal on campus, but people definitely turn up to support their friends, and everyone is proud of the champion swimmers!"
College Junior,4,"On the surface, it might look like a very homogenous campus. But once you get to know people, there are students from very different backgrounds with a lot of different beliefs. We could definitely stand to increase out racial diversity, though."
College Freshman,4,"Physics has a lot of work, but the knowledge is worth it."
College Freshman,4,The professors are awesome. But there isn't a very diverse field of majors to choose from.
College Freshman,4,"The Kenyon Athletic Center is big and nice, but people don't care that much about sports"
College Freshman,4,A rural atmosphere -- removed from the distractions of city life - has lent itself to a great academic learning environment since 1824.  I wouldn't chance anything!
College Freshman,4,"My rankings put it at excellent -- hard to comment on that any further!  But, I will say that the rooms are indeed spacious well heated/ cooled, comfortable, and my roommates aren't too bad either!"
College Sophomore,4,"Kenyon's food is great compared to my high school's food. There are plenty of options, although if you're on a strict diet you may have some trouble. The chefs love interacting with students, so that is always a plus.

I love both dining halls. In one hall you can easily feel like you're in one of the Harry Potter movies and the other dining hall is just newer. Lot's of people simply refer to the two main halls as ""new side"" and ""old side.""

Overall, our dining hall, Peirce, is great. It's hard to find a person who says they don't like it."
College Sophomore,4,"It's Hogwarts minus magic, but lots of quirkiness."
College Senior,2,"Kenyon, unfortunately, is pretty homogenous in certain areas. The student body is gradually becoming more diverse, but very slowly. Overall, most students are white, upper middle class, and from the East or West coast (not a huge amount of Midwesterners.) Some students can be kind of snobby towards locals. The campus is mostly liberal, with pockets of trust-fund Republicans who mostly seem to emerge during discussions about diversity, so take that for what you will. In terms of sexual orientation, no one will care. Many students identify as something other than straight. There are lots of diversity-related groups on campus, which provide nice support systems for minority students."
College Junior,2,"As open-minded as Kenyon likes to think it is, diversity is a big issue here."
College Junior,2,"The buildings I've lived in have been pretty gross, though I know of places to live on campus that are really nice. The problem is that living places are really limited because you have to live on campus all four years and the student body is growing each year."
College Junior,2,"I am thinking about transferring because of the lack of diversity on campus: racial, religious, socioeconomic, etc. There's a heavy Greek scene on campus and if you are not Greek it is sometimes hard to really fit in. The campus itself is rather isolated. I think I would have been happier at a larger school with more diversity or a school closer to a city."
College Freshman,2,"Kenyon offers very little financial aid, and many things (like student jobs on-campus) can conflict with how the money is channeled. It's not impossible, however."
College Sophomore,2,"There's not much going on in the local town when it comes to food. There are just a handful of places. I don't eat off campus very often. However, the few options that exist usually suffice since our dining hall is great. Also, a Panera is set to open in a few months so that will help quite a bit."
College Sophomore,2,"Housing here is expensive, in my opinion.  For the most part rooms are small.  Even the rooms that people here consider as ""good"" rooms are small.  Dorms that are actually nice are ridiculously hard to get into.  Campus apartments are pretty nice.  NCAs (north campus apartments) are very nice.  But all apartments are a lot of money."
College Junior,2,"It's Ohio so the weather is usually not very nice or changes quickly. This has very little effect on my classes though. When it is nice we have class outside, which I like."
College Junior,2,The housing lottery is a complete mess and they don't know what they are doing. The dorms are on the whole pretty nice and so are most of the apartments.
College Sophomore,2,"We only have one dining hall on campus. It gets really tiring, and there is not really any way to opt out of the dining plan. The only other food options on campus are the deli, the coffee shop, the VI, and the Kenyon Inn (which most students don't go to often because it's the nicest and most expensive)."
College Sophomore,2,The campus is pretty strict about alcohol policies but if you are careful you will be fine
Recent Alumnus,2,"No Alternative – Kenyon does not allow for students to choose their meal plan, but obliges them to pay for the on campus plan with tuition. Due to the poor quality of the food, by sophomore years I was paying for the dining services (as obligated) and cooking my own food at home.  The school doesn't keep track of the consumption of different food via an id card and therefore a lot of food, and therefore money and resources, are wasted."
College Junior,2,"Not Many Options – Few options, high cost, not convenient, no student discounts, low variety."
College Junior,2,"Binge Drinking Is a Weekend Routine – I'm not really into it so in hindsight I wish I hadn't come here.  Also, if you don't like light beer you're out of luck because that's all frats serve, it's cheaper than diet coke."
College Junior,2,"Everyone Comes from NY and LA – We have like 5-10 black kids on campus and most of them are hipsters/gays which says a lot about Kenyon, I think, because the majority of the student body is either in frat or a total striped-pants hipster.  It's hard."
College Freshman,2,"Waste of time and money. Alcohol/Drugs are priority #1.  Only stick to themselves. Resent the rest of the student population, many of whom are just trying to mind their own business. Sure they throw sweaty parties that blast terrible music, but what's so great about that.

Yeah this is an over-generalization and there are many genuinely good people in the greek system but I think greek life in general is self-indulgent. This school costs 50 grand a year and most of these kids spend their time getting wasted and talking about hot chicks.

Only in America"
College Freshman,2,"Completely centered on drinking alcohol.  If someone doesn't drink alcohol, they are left out and have nothing to do. Getting drunk is the main source of entertainment."
College Sophomore,2,"Deceptively Beautiful – Kenyon weather is the best in the country for the first three weeks and last three weeks of the school year.  For everything in between, we barely see the sun.  Students get seasonal affective (sp?) disorder all the time...and know that it's coming."
College Sophomore,2,"Hit or Miss – Some sports at Kenyon are jokes.  Other sports at Kenyon are extremely serious and feature highly talented teams.  Either way, the students don't really go to the home games in large numbers."
College Sophomore,2,"The Sheriff in town is known to be strict about underage drinking, but only when that drinking is done on the streets or you end up in the hospital for it. I've known kids who wake up in the hospital with a ticket from the sheriff left on their side table. I've known lots of kids who have gotten a 'talking to' about getting caught with alcohol in their rooms, but no one usually gets in too much trouble for that since it is a wet campus."
Niche User,1,"ALERT: ***DO NOT*** go to this school!!!  This overrated school is in the middle of nowhere, has NO diversity, mediocre academics, and an administration that puts the financial needs of the college above the needs of the students.  No medical on campus, overworked social services, terrible student support, toxic social & academic environment, and way too much drinking & drugging (as there is literally nothing else to do).  You couldn't pick a school that is smaller or that care LESS about you or your kid.   If you do make the unfortunate choice to send you kid here (like we did - we believed the hype), then desperately find your kid needs to transfer, forget getting the credits you paid your hard earned cash for!  Kenyon's system doesn't match with other school, so you might as well be flushing your money and your kid's future down the drain.  This is a school for spoiled rich kids who couldn't get into a real college.  STAY AWAY!"
Alum,1,"Kenyon is a SCAM. The ""college"" is not an institution of learning, it is a radical socialist re-education camp. Dissenters are severely punished, while hateful ideologues are elevated. Kenyon sanctimoniously claims to be ""progressive"" and ""liberal"" while being the exact opposite. Instead, it is regressive and authoritarian. Kenyon has a terrible ROI - students leave with no skills that will lead to career success. It was recently ranked 983rd as the best-value college by PayScale, which tracks the average ROI of an education. If you love your child, do not put them in harms way to be a target of bigotry. The post-modern, hateful ideologies that Kenyon indoctrinates their ""students"" with will only cripple them in the real world. On the other-hand, if you want your child to be a radical social activist that will continue to leach off others and live in your basement, then this is definitely the college for them. Attending Kenyon is the equivalent of burning 300k cash in your fireplace."
Senior,1,I really hate this school. Not worth the work to go here. The girls suck and the boys are aggressive. Nothing within 3 hours of the place. No parties. No girls. No fun.
Senior,1,"Not safe for women students on campus in my opinion.  Current administration contributes to rape culture. One of the latest cases of the administration failing to protect victims is detailed on Wordpress with the comments showing a long history of rape on campus and examples of the broader community victimizing victims. Google Michael Hayes Wordpress.Also unless you drink or smoke, campus life is isolating. "
College Sophomore,1,Everyone is brainwashed--its the absolute worst.
College Sophomore,1,"Initially, I was very excited to be at Kenyon. Now that I am interested in getting internships and preparing for ""life after college"" I am having some second thoughts. Kenyon is a good school with a pretty campus and culture, but it is just too far away from Columbus or any other major city, making it hard to participate in internships and network. I've moved on from the Greek life and party scene."
College Senior,1,"The campus forces you to pay for a dorm room. There is an option or two for living off campus, but you will wind up paying both for a dorm room and for your off-campus housing. Despite ResLife being a huge pain, living off campus is not worth it to most people."
College Senior,1,"ResLife is easily the worst part of this college. There is no off-campus housing, so you have to deal with them. The dorms are not maintained well, and it is a terrible value. The office itself likes to overcharge for end of the year charges, but they are incompetent and will not work with you. I have been overcharged each year that I have lived at Kenyon, and the office is miserable and rude in dealing with them. I have clearly pointed out their mistakes, and they refuse to back down. After being charged for repairs, I have gone back to my old rooms and seen that they did not repair a single thing they charged me for. Now, as a recent graduate, I am still fighting with them for them to be reasonable, but it is definitely an uphill battle. It's a shame that such a great school can be tarnished by an incompetent group of people who really have no influence on the school besides blindly charging students."
College Sophomore,1,"Most dorms don't have AC, it's nearly impossible to get a single until junior year, there is NO off campus housing, the rooms are small and expensive for what you get, the insides aren't very attractive (most are cinder block walls)"
College Sophomore,1,"The weather is not great, I was expecting a lot of snow and we've gotten maybe 5 real snows in 2 years. It rains a lot and is cloudy most of the time. It is only warm during the first 3 weeks and last 3 weeks of school. It also sucks when you don't have AC in your room..."
College Junior,1,We Live in a Mile Long Village What Is There to Say...? the closest town is mt. vernon with nothing except for wal-mart and a couple of fast food joints.  there is not transport to columbus.  bring a car.
College Junior,1,Frat Parties and One Bar (Club Cove) – Most people come with a fake idea and if you don't like light beer that's cheaper then diet coke you'll either learn to like it or spend the weekends in your room.  it's sad but there's not an awful lot to do on the weekends in terms of night life.  most people just get wasted and sometimes make out with a stranger in the dark in the basement of old kenyon at a frat party but if you aren't in to that and you aren't part of a sports team you're out of luck.
College Sophomore,1,You can count the number of off-campus housing options on one hand.  Pretty much everyone lives on-campus.
College Sophomore,1,"There are drunkenfests, if you want them. You are considered an ""indoor kid,"" if you don't. We party on Wednesdays but it isn't required as long as you are out most Fridays and Saturdays. To be blunt, the way that this school is set up, it is cool to drink, dance, and hook up because there is nothing else to do in rural Ohio. We don't actually tip cows."
College Junior,1,"Parties All Greek – South is where all of the parties are held and most of them are hosted by Greek organization. While not technically exclusive, a lot of the parties on campus can make a non-greek feel like an outsider."
College Sophomore,1,"It's the Middle of Nowhere! There aren't very many off-campus options because of the location of the school. There are a few apartments available to rent but the college is slowly buying them and converting them into student housing. 

To be honest, Gambier is pretty much the college so there's really nowhere to go off campus!"

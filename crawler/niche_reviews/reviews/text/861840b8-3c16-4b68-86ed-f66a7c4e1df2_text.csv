Graduate Student,5,"All of my classes are online and use Blackboard, which is user friendly. In today's world, having classes 100% online and asynchronous is a major reason I chose Lamar for my master's program as a full time working adult."
Graduate Student,5,"Great! I loved the admissions process...lots of info was given and they were very supportive, calling me weekly to see if I had any questions or needed any help along the way."
Sophomore,5,I did not take any online classes. I took a break from school and I haven't had the chance to take any.
Sophomore,5,"Lamar made a really big improvement with the environment. When I was a freshman, I didn't feel like I was in a university it felt like I was in a community college. But then they remodel and made it felt like I was actually in a university."
Sophomore,5,"It has been a great experience because it is a small campus, so you definitely feel at home! I have met great people wether if It’s staff or class mates."

Junior,5,"I have loved going to this college! They have an amazing staff that really cares about the well being of their students. For example, before each semester starts your counselor contacts you to make sure you are all set for the semester. Their online system is very easy to work and updated with no problems I have experienced in my years attending. Not to mention the cost of attending Lamar University is unbeatable!"
Junior,5,They always get back to you in a timely manner and they are always extremely nice and get things done when you call them.

Sophomore,5,"I've had a great time as a previous Lamar Cardinal, going back online this time because life happens"
Sophomore,5,"Everything this far has been great! We'll see how this goes in the future. Only time will tell. Everything that I've been told has been true. All of my appointments have been prompt, professional, and overall made me feel as if the staff is there for an individual. When I email or call the response has been efficient and done in a timely manner. My work schedule is the same as my Advisory's. She did make sure that she made me feel like everything in life can be done if you put forth effort. She woke up earlier and called me at 7:30 AM as promised the day before to ensure that I was enrolled in my classes. That made me view change in a different manner because I did not change my schedule at all. Every morning at that time I'm driving to work talking on my blue tooth. This situation motivated me even more to know that all things can be done, one just have to let another be aware of their situation. The thing that got to me most is the time of appointment wasn't my idea and the honesty."
Sophomore,5,I live the diversity that Lamar University has to offer. You will always see someone like you and it makes you feel comfortable and welcome. The campus itself is beautiful and very calming.
Sophomore,5,I take two classes online during each semester to give me time with my friends and family. Teachers are always willing to help out to make sure we understand the material like a traditional face-to-face setting.
Freshman,5,"I feel like online learning classes needs to be available for every major in college. I personally have not done online classes, but I feel like it would be much more fun, and much more easier."
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere is extremely friendly and welcoming. The community aspect it doesn't feel like a school. Everyone is much more relaxed outside of lessons, and inside lessons, are ready to work. The freedom and responsibility given to us students to get on with their own work  it is a college, not a school. It is an amazing place to be."
Graduate Student,5,I am in the online graduate program at Lamar University. I love the flexibility and the professors are very helpful.

Sophomore,5,"Lamar University has been a great place for me. It is not too big, but it is also not to small. It is big enough to avoid people you want to avoid, but small enough to where you can meet up with your friends when you want. The professors have all been respectful and more than willing to help."
Sophomore,5,"When I first stepped on campus it immediately felt like home. I knew that i wanted to go to a big school, but not to big that you couldn't get from place to place by walking. I also didn't want a tiny school where, everyone knew everyone and everyone's business. Lamar is a perfect place to grow and become an individual. Overall the application process was so easy, everyone that works here is so hands on and very helpful. If I have a question I can ask a professor and they will know exactly who to direct me to, so that I can get all the help that I need."

During my tenure at Lamar I hope that I can be part of starting those 2 teams for this college.

Niche User,5,Lamar University is an very organized caring school who wants more students to choose there path and what they have for other students to succeed.

I grantee that you will find a friend the first week of school."
Freshman,5,Lamar University is a phenomenal college. It is very diverse college. There are a lot of opportunities on campus. The professors are always willing to help you when you need help. Lamar University is a really good school for nursing.  The campus is kind of small but it is good because you know where everything is and it helps you get to places easier. I would highly recommend Lamar University to anyone but I would highly recommend it to nursing majors.

Senior,5,"I like the courses offered, the size of the school and the very helpful staff. The professors that I have had for classes have been very understanding when Hurricane Harvey hit. Many students were without power or for that matter housing during this period and the staff at Lamar was very accommodating. Homework and tests were allowed to be taken within the students allowances and abilities of needed assistance. I would advise any college bound student to go to Lamar. It has the small town/school feel but with a big town education."

Graduate Student,5,"Great support!! Love that the Master Education Technology Leadership program is completely online. I have just completed week four of my first class. I loved that I would receive calls to make sure everything was going well. Professor response to emails were often very quickly respond. I went to go visit the campus and it is awesome,  for me it was just so much better to to the online course. Blackboard is very user friendly and the classes are only an 1hour, lectures are short and easy to follow. I love the fact that I only have class Monday night and that most assignments are due Thursdays or Sunday evening."
Junior,5,"I transferred to Lamar University my sophomore year. I came from a very small private university and at Lamar, I get to truly experience the ""real"" college life. There is always something going on at the university and I have met some really great people. I love the diversity and the campus life. I'm glad I made the right decision, not just because my parent's went to Lamar and my mom is an alumni, but I am having the time of my life at this moment!"
Senior,5,Lamar is an university that provides a great educational opportunity.  It allows students to stay close to home but still be able to experience the college experience
Sophomore,5,My experience at Lamar is excellent. The school is not too big or small it just perfect for me. The dorms does not have community restrooms and for the most part they give you the apartment fill.
Niche User,5,"I've loved Lamar every time I've gotten the chance to visit or attend for whatever reason. The diversity around the campus is really empowering, and their housing is so nice. I've toured many other campuses and at times I cannot find more reasons to attend another college than why to attend Lamar. It is definitely one of the best!!"

The Professors, advisors, and assistants want the students to succeed and are encouraging and helpful in guiding students to meet their goals."
Junior,5,I love Lamar University because the students are so engaging. There's always booths in the quad waiting to tell other students what's going on with Greek life or events with different sports. The involvement is through the roof.
Graduate Student,5,"I've visited Lamar University, on a tour from my high school. It's way bigger than I thought it was, they have a lot of space and different areas on campus. Including the cafeteria, it has a lot of varieties to eat from. People greeted us and showed us rooms and different areas at the University. I spoke with one professor and she was so nice and about her business, I could tell I would genuinely learn in her class, if I was to have her as a professor."
Graduate Student,5,Lamar is a great school!! Professors truely care and are very helpful. The student center and food options have recently been upgraded and are great and super convenient!
Niche User,5,"I liked the atmosphere, and the people i was surrounded by at the university. Lamar students were very nice and helpful."
Niche User,5,Lamar University sits in the middle of Texas and Louisiana and is close to home. Lamar isn't a huge campus and it also have the home feel as well. when I visited the campus the students and the tour guides was very welcoming.
Senior,5,Easy and convenient in an on-line atmosphere.  Advising counselors are very attentive to students and accessible when needed.  Tuition is a bit more doable than most universities.  Professors are more available and helpful when needed.
Sophomore,4,"I love what the Lamar University campus has to offer! They have a good selection of restaurants and many places to relax and do school work. One thing that would make commuting to class easier would be adding more parking options though, as there are limited spots for students."
Freshman,4,Online experience was very pleasant. Professors made sure to keep students updated on lecture times and due dates. Assignments were also scheduled to be due at reasonable times. Work load was not overwhelming or too chaotic.
Freshman,4,Lamar University is a beautiful campus. Buildings are a good distance apart easy to find classes. If you are into nature Lamar would be a good fit.
Alum,4,"Lamar has friendly professors who are dedicated to their students! It is an affordable, quality education that will prepare you for today’s job market."
Freshman,4,"I haven't been able to do my learning online yet but the upcoming semester I will be able to.  From my mentor that attends the school, she says that the online experience isn't that bad."
Freshman,4,"All around good school! The campus is very diverse considering it's location where unlike houston and Dallas Beaumont isn't a ""big"" city but a more lowkey area."
Graduate Student,4,I took all my classes online and the teachers were very helpful.  They replied back to all my questions in a timely matter. I will continue to take online classes for graduate school.
Senior,4,"I took some online, some face-to-face classes. Some classes were complete bores while other were somewhat interesting."
Junior,4,"I am used to taking online classes, I prefer it. Unfortuntely some of the teachers don't seem to care or feel like piling on the work for an entry level class. It is also really expensive."
Senior,4,"Wonderful professors, great campus. It resides in a not-so-good area, though. Some of the online courses are a bit ""teach yourself"" oriented."
Junior,4,"I am enjoying my online classes at Lamar University! When I have to go to the campus, everyone is friendly and knowledgeable. My professors are creative and have a great attitude."
Junior,4,"Lamar University is a great college. It allows both commuters and residents, the suite style dorms are awesome. Lamar is on top of several degrees among the nation. The campus is also very encompassing and has a welcoming atmosphere. The only downside is since it is the Texas coast, it can get extremely hot and there are mosquitoes."
Alum,4,"I transferred as a junior into Lamar's online degree completion program and attended fully online. The condensed 8-week classes were informative and moderatelychallenging. Tuition rates were competitive and I feel like the education was of good value. My professors treated me well and showed they wanted me to succeed by providing extra help and encouragement. With the guidance of my incredible academic advisor, I managed to graduate 2 semesters earlier than anticipated, even while working full-time. 2 days after graduation, I started my new job that required a bachelor's degree. Highly recommend for anyone with outside responsibilities!"
Niche User,4,"I am excited to attend Lamar because of the small family-like communities within the school, and the numerous organizations provided to help students succeed."
Freshman,4,I really like going to this school . There is a lot of diversity here . But when I first arrived I feel that I wasn’t welcomed. The other kids that were here weren’t very friendly and there was a lot of drama
Sophomore,4,I love how energetic this school is! the faculty and staff make sure that there is something to participate in every day and there is always something for everyone.
Senior,4,I have enjoyed the diversity and the atmosphere with puther students. I enjoy the small classes and having teachers know me as a student personally. I would recommend that they work on school spirit which is something that is coming along now.
Sophomore,4,I think that my school is doing a great job at being a great college experience. I am learning so many new things all the time and I love my group of friends and all of the people I have met so far.
Freshman,4,"Lamar University is a very involved, energetic, and safe university. It offers many positive opportunities and experiences for any college student, and is a great place for college freshman to begin. It provides a safe and healthy atmosphere from conversations to the overall environment. The only downside to this university is that the advisors don’t feel as engaged and encouraging as they could be, and I hope to see that change!"
Sophomore,4,The campus is big and small at the same time. It's the perfect size for someone who's anti-social like myself.
Senior,4,I'm an online student. The experience has been great. The student advisor assigned to me is always in constant contact and checking to see how things are going. I would recommend this school.
Senior,4,"I would give Lamar University 4 stars because they have many great events on campus that help students network with others. I have gained many friends, and learned from many wonderful professors. The professors are really engaged in wanting to see their students succeed, and achieve any goals they set forth."
Niche User,4,I grew up in the Beaumont area. It is a small town with a lot to do. Lamar is a good college with good professors. I have 2 family members that graduated from Lamar.
Senior,4,That it was very convenient for me which allowed me to take classes on campus or online it is also very diversified
Freshman,4,"Good freshman financial aid ; nice , quiet, safe environment. Its a commuter school, usually there isn't big crowd of people and if your not a very social person its very easy to end up alone. The university does try to do a lot of events, but being a commuter student with limited transportation I don't end up going to many."
Junior,4,I am attending this institution this upcoming summer semester in which the people I have encountered so far have been so wonderful. I have had a very simple enrollment process which always makes things run smoother. The university is one of the top prestigious in Texas. I would only change how far it is away from me.
Junior,4,Overall Lamar University is a wonderful place filled with people who care. Being a transfer student it was easy for me to feel welcomed and accepted. This was a great choice of schools for me to transfer to.
Freshman,4,There is a lot to do. There is always an event going on in my residence hall. I like that the dorm rooms are separated so we have our own room.
Freshman,4,Something that I enjoy the most about Lamar is the sense of community among the multitude of organizations there. One thing that I would like to see change is the amount safety precautions being upgraded.
Senior,4,When I went to the university of Lamar I noticed the diversity of the university and how the campus was so diverse. I also like the food very much and since I will be going to the campus I have to know what the food that I will be eating everyday or so will be good.
Junior,4,Professors at Lamar are amazing and give you there undivided attention when you need it. Lamar has great leadership opportunities whether it be in greek life or any organization on campus. It has great opportunities.
Graduate Student,4,"I am a first time graduate student at Lamar University and so far my experience has been great. There is a diverse population of students, faculty and staff on campus. The cardinals activities board and other campus organizations hosts educational, fun and FREE events all the time."
Sophomore,4,"Although Lamar is in a small town, the school itself is great. I love the community and how diverse it is. I love that the school is very active and allows you to communicate and have fun with others!"
Niche User,4,"The campus was very nice, I liked how every race nationality was there and accounted for. How immense the diversity of the students were there was incredible, I couldn't believe it. I've never personally tried the campus food but I've heard others remark that the food was good and it also made the distance to travel to the cafe and back to their dorms much better than traveling to go find food. I've visited the campus a few times and the classrooms and other facilities, such as the library, are nice and well put up with and from experience everyone is very welcoming. I can't wait to attend their campus and see how much more they have to offer."
Sophomore,4,Great teachers who were always available and very helpful. Class size was which made it easier to concentrate and make a connection with the teacher. MY only issue is the parking its incredibly hard to find a spot close to most of your classes but I feel like thats the same complaint for all coleges
Junior,4,Lamar is a place to be. they have good lecturers and the schedule is way flexible than other schools around. the tuition is also affordable compared to other schools with higher tuition cost. Also the Lamar community encourages student activities amongst others.
Junior,4,"Most of the professors will take to the time to respond to questions if you ask them, or will let you come by their office to talk. However, some classes can get too large and overwhelming with people, making it difficult to ask questions while the class is going on."
Sophomore,4,"I like Lamar because of the small atmosphere, and the home feeling of the campus. The Professors are nice as well, I have taken many cmmunication calsses and all my professors are very down to earth and extremely understanding. The accessibility of the campus is also very convienent, everything is close together and easy access for most of the campus. Some things that i would like to see change, are how late they keep the food stores open, and the dining hall. College kids are up very late and are alwasy busy, I know there were times when I was up late studying and there would be nothing to eat because all the stores on campus are closed and none of the dining places would be open either. I also think it would be a great idea if the library was kept open later, instead of closing at 11:40, students need time to be able to get things done in a tinmley manner and making them leave a place where their work is suppose to be getting done is not a very productive plan."
Niche User,4,"What I liked was that there is plenty of things to do in campus. For example you can play pool, basketball, run, work out, and activities like that. Overall it is a good experience."
Freshman,4,Well my experience here is good so far. I took this year off to focus on my academics other than doing orgs and work study etc. This campus physically is really nice after all the construction.
Freshman,4,"The programs at Lamar really are great, and the professors are alway very willing to help and meet with you in order to better understand the material!"
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Lamar is that it’s close to home, a real simple university. Something I wish would change would be the diversity on campus. To include more hispanic related programs, or clubs, or organizations that unite different types of diversities."
Freshman,4,"The experience has been a good one as far as online classes go. They have a really good Academic Partnership program, however, there is only one adviser.  Admission can be a little hairy, but if you stick with one liaison per dept you should be ok."
Sophomore,4,"Lamar University is mostly a commuter school.  There are lots of ways to get involved on campus, since it is a small school."
Freshman,4,"The teachers took time to explain and help students out, they were very understanding towards students especially when Harvey struck. The food places are pretty good and I enjoy that the library has study rooms."
Graduate Student,4,"Lamar was convenient. It offered on-line courses that were accessible across the US. It was also affordable, and I wasn't paying for services that were not provided."
Junior,4,Lamar University makes it easy to register for online classes. Teachers are very helpful. It’s a do at your own pace schedule which is nice. I would recommend Lamar University to anyone needing to either start off in college or returning to college. My experience so far has been great. Financial aid is fairly easy to get through Lamar. I will be continuing my education there until I graduate with my Bachelor Degree in nursing. It has been very convenient and works well with my job and family life. The advisors and registars are super nice and available when you need them.
Sophomore,4,I have been at Lamar University for a year and a half and so far I have had a very good experience overall. I have had my bad experiences with a professor or two but you can not avoid that no matter where you go. I love the residence halls! You have your own bedroom share a living room and bathroom with one other person and they heavily work with you if you want a particular roommate. Dining hall has its flaws for sure but they are taking steps in the right direction making their food fresher and tastier. Overall I have been happy with the classes and living conditions.
Junior,4,"What I like about Lamar is the location. The town is very small with little to nothing to do so you have no choice but to study. Sure people have parties but they're not really worth wasting a study session over. Everyone for the most part is friendly and everyone knows each other. The classes are small and the teachers know every students names. Most of the vicinities are open pretty late, such as the library or Papa John's so whether you want to study or eat late at night you can. What can be improved is the school itself. Because it is so old, the neighborhood across the campus is not ideal, and the buildings are pretty old. Although they have recently been renovated and look pretty nice, some dorms could use a little help. Overall it is very livable just like any old university."
Freshman,4,"After going on on an official visit to Lamar University, my overall experience was amazing. I loved the women's soccer coach as well as team. The campus was great as well as the students.  I loved the computer science building. The dorms were great, in addition to the food."
Graduate Student,4,I am a graduate student in the Educational Administration program. I like that it is completely online and provides a good degree for what I am needing
Freshman,4,I am a rising freshman at Lamar and I love it here. The atmosphere on campus is very friendly and home-like. They offer many different organizations in religious backgrounds and extra curricular activities. This beautiful campus is always clean and catering to the greater community outside of our campus walls.
Junior,4,"This is my first time going to Lamar University. I currently transferred from Lamar Port Arthur, so this sure is a step up from a small campus. I have heard great things from friends that have attended the campus and it makes me feel welcome. I have visited it a couple of times and the people there look friendly, when I had a question they were never hesitant or rude answering. The campus looks lively and clean, and I can't wait to start attending."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the environment and quality education. There is a good ratio of students per instructor. The probabilities of graduating are high. You will get a job when you graduate.
Junior,4,"Lamar is a relatively small university. This is great because you can get a more personal relationship with your professors. The student benefits are nice as well. These include access to the rec, free tutoring at the library, and free admission to EVERY sporting event held on campus football, volleyball, soccer, baseball, softball, basketball, and tennis. The dorms are incredibly comfy and private as well. There are multiple food options that are located all over campus. There is a lot of construction on campus, but when it is completed there will be a new and improved student center and a science and technology building. Along with those the new honors college building has just been completed. The array of clubs, societies, and Greek life is wide and plentiful. With the hindsight I have of Lamar, I would still chose to attend college here if I were a senior in high school again."
Graduate Student,4,I am an online graduate student but I have been to campus a few times. Nice place and good instructors.
Freshman,4,As an incoming freshman I am moderately impressed with the accessibility of their administrative services to students who have not moved to campus yet.  I am however impressed overall with the campus community and can not wait to move in on August 20th.
Sophomore,4,I am a current student at Lamar University and I have had a wonderful experience so far. Their are so many resources out there for students that do not require additional fees. The only thing I would change is the parking. With a quickly growing campus and everyone driving  students must park very far to get to class.
Graduate Student,4,I like the ability to learn online and I like that the admissions counselors call and guide you through the Admissions Process.
Senior,4,"Really enjoyed the opportunity for the online classes, I was able to take classes and work an 8 to 5 job."
Freshman,2,It was very difficult to adjust to online classes and very few teachers helped. I hope in the upcoming years they find a better way to help students adjust to online courses.
Junior,2,the school is peaceful and in the middle of no where so go here if you are the person that gets distracted easily by influence around you and get away from it to focus on school.
College Sophomore,2,"I do not know much about the Greek life, I do know that it is hard to get into one of the clubs."
College Senior,2,Greek life is small and not a huge part of the school. They do put together events that can be fun or appeal but for the most part Greeks do not stand out.
College Sophomore,2,I haven't learned a thing
College Junior,2,"You really have to work really hard to get an opportunity to get at least an internship or any sort of employment. The job center is helpful, but that is not enough. You will never get hired if you won't put in your extra effort. However the university does a good accommodating the need of it"
College Freshman,2,There is not good safety on campus. I've gotten many different emails from Lamar involving robberies.
College Freshman,2,"I do not live on campus, the bedrooms in the dorms are so tiny. I only saw the most expensive housing option and I could never live in that."
College Student,2,i honestly am scared to go outside at night. i have been informed of alot of beating up and stealing of phones and personal items from a student. i have been informed of robberies with guns around the campus area. so in all i do not feel to safe here. i know security can only do so much and be in so many place but this is a open big wide campus that anyone could access anytime they want to and cause  a threat.
College Freshman,2,I didn't actually get to experience this part of the experience so I really don't have much to say for this subject.
College Freshman,2,"I would have to say it was okay because move in day did not go as planned at all . I had a huge hole in my window the size of someone's face, the bathroom was extremely dirty the toilet was stained, the bathtub was black from it not being cleaned. The refrigerator that was given to us had mold growing on the inside. We have annual room checks and I do not like how they pop up at anytime because they tell you there coming during a certain amount of days but, do not say what day or time. they usually just walking in even if your sleeping."
College Freshman,2,"There is always drugs and alcohol around, sadly"
College Sophomore,2,"There have been several assualts and robberies, I believe this is due to the university's placement in a high-crime neighborhood."
College Freshman,2,"From what I've heard a degree from Lamar is equivalent to that of a middle school diploma, so graduate school is required at a larger institution. My future career field is in need of young black men, so I should be in good hands come 2020."
College Freshman,2,Small school = small greek life
College Student,2,This campus is open to anyone and any attack at this momnet
College Junior,2,I'm stressed because I might have to take out loans and I need books.
College Sophomore,2,Not that much around campus
Recent Alumnus,2,Directly surrounding campus is a poor district with some crime. If you have a car. 10 min and beyond has better neighborhoods with decent prices.
College Freshman,2,"Students are allowed to do bad things, but we can not let our family spend a night without putting in a week notice as if we suppose to know when the family member will spend the night."
College Sophomore,2,Absolutely no school spirit. The football team has only been back for 5 years. We're going to be in a a rebuilding phase for a while.
College Sophomore,2,"No extremely limiting policies that I am aware of, but it's the complete opposite of progressive. Tough to change, and trying to get anything accomplished can be a long process. I get the safety for dorm ID, but not being able to have guests overnight without a 10 days notice is a bit childish. And some teachers keep class attendance, marking students off if they miss more than a few classes a semester - worse than high school."
College Sophomore,2,"Although I am in my second year, I have taken some upper-level courses in my major (senior and even graduate level). I have found the Nutrition-Dietetics program is limiting and completely centralized around the hospital setting. The degree plan for Nutrition is heavily science-based aside from the standard core requirements. Being someone who likes freedom to choose my courses and desire to gain a variety of perspectives, I find this program inflexible and limited in course options. Few professors (I believe there are only 4) in my department. Have yet to see any internship/job opportunities other than the required dietetic clinical rotation. Unless you are entering an engineering program, nursing school, or speech and language pathology (or just here to ""get a degree"" and get out), I doubt you'll get much out of education here at Lamar."
College Freshman,2,"Barely any money given out, mostly only loans are given out."
College Senior,2,Younger crowd than myself makes it non interesting.
College Senior,2,"I was really put in a program because it was online and a BAAS, not the program I chose."
College Senior,2,Southeast Texas weather is unpredictable.  One day its hot; the next day its freezing.
College Freshman,2,The health care center does not really know what they are talking about. I have been there twice and they charged me but didn't give me enough information
College Freshman,2,Lamar is located in the country and there is really honestly nothing to do out here. Unless you know people that stays off campus and you have a car.
College Freshman,2,There has become a lot of people that are gay or homogenous. There have become international students also.
College Freshman,2,The whole process with financial aid was an absolute drag and I am so glad I got that over with.
College Sophomore,2,everyone warns of staying at apartments and rentals because of crime rate
College Sophomore,2,I've never seen anyone accept drugs but I've smelt marijuana multiple times in the college dorms. Alcohol is just a given… some of the stores don't ID and/or people buy for underage drinkers. 
College Sophomore,2,There is nothing to do close to campus. There is a bar but they don't have real bartenders and the food is overpriced. The bars are 5-10 mi down the road.. not safe for college students who probably drink. The mall and major places to shop or have a good time is at least 10 minutes away. Worst part of Lamar.
College Sophomore,2,Don't agree with strictness in the dorms or off-campus apartments
College Freshman,2,"I hate that visitors have to leave at 2 a.m. If i have a visitor, I would like for them to be able to stay overnight."
College Junior,2,Unlike animal house Lamar only has one fraternity that has a fraternity house and that is the Sigma Phi Epsilons. There are parties all through out the fall that are pretty fun. Other than that the greek community is crippled and is not seen as much as one  would like throughout the campus. 
College Junior,2,I would advise one to own a car here. Most of your more urban areas are 5-10 miles away and other modes of transportation are inconvenient.
College Freshman,2,The school has a lot of strict rules and regulations that students have to follow.
College Freshman,2,My financial aid took a long time to come through. i did not have enough money that i needed for college and had to wait for my financial aid to process
College Sophomore,2,"Unless it's completely necessary, most students are better off staying on campus."
College Freshman,2,Anybody from Southeast Texas will tell you that our weather is about as predictable as the lottery. That's pretty much all I have to say about that. 
College Freshman,2,"I've applied for a ton of scholarships only to receive one. And the one that I received, basically if you applied for it, you got it. I'm not complaining about $1000 a semester, but it would be nice to receive some other scholarships that I actually put effort into applying for. I've qualified for loans, but those are a ripoff with the high interest. You end up paying way more for college than you actually to need to."
College Sophomore,2,"Nightlife is not tat great in Beaumont, TX"
College Sophomore,2,Small city so restaurants are not that great.
College Junior,2,Could be better but not bad!
College Sophomore,2,The off campus housing is a bit expensive. I do not personally live there but I have friends that do. Some of the residents that live there are loud and obnoxious. They seem to not care about the apartments. Every time I went there the gate was broken because people were impatient and did not want to key in the code.
College Junior,2,Lamar doesn't really show a lot to bring athletics to its full potential.
College Junior,2,"There's not a whole lot to my knowledge. If so, difficult to use."
College Junior,2,I never hear about nightlife at Lamar. Not much happens in Beaumont.
College Freshman,2,"The off-campus dining options include Subway, McDonald's, Sonic and Jack in the Box. These options aren't by far healthy choices but fairly cheap in cost. I chose C- because the places do not offer student discounts although they are located closely to the campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"My intern experience was not a good one. I was left with the secretary in charge and instead of putting me to shadow some actual social workers the secretary made me do her job. I, on many occasions, tried to follow one of the social workers and the secretary reported to the ""boss"" that I was not a team player and would not help her out. I was barely able to get the information I needed for my assignments and what I did get I made up quite a bit of."
College Sophomore,2,Most of the places near campus to eat are fast food places! It kind of gets old but the really good places are kind of far. It's easy if you have a car though.
College Sophomore,2,"I honestly haven't encountered many Greek frats or sororities on campus. I haven't seen any parties or anything of the sort. I know that they're there, but I haven't much clue about them at Lamar."
College Freshman,2,"There aren't many different races that meet the eye when you come to Lamar. It's mainly black, there are a few white/mexicans/asians/etc, but sometimes theyre hard to find"
College Freshman,2,There aren't to many spots on campus to actually park. Most of the spots are reserved for upperclassman and staff so it makes it hard to park even if you are not in a rush. And each ticket is 40 dollars up until your third then your car is towed
College Junior,2,Sometimes it is difficult to find a parking spot if you do not have early classes. Most of the time it is necessary to get there early to find a spot.
College Junior,2,"As with other diversity issues, this campus is average in comparison."
College Junior,2,"Hard to find a parking spot, the parking lots are not big enough, only close parking to classes are for seniors."
College Junior,2,"Too many rules, not enough privacy, too many broken washers and dryers, trash bin is too far away and should be picked up outside our room door on specific days. 

Living room is spacious and bathroom is also yet no stove."
Sophomore,1,"Having been a student for many years in online programs, they are absolutely horrendous. I am actually transferring to an out of state school to alleviate the issues. Blackboard, the program used, is constantly glitching. The professors are allowed to add any and all programs they deem necessary. Regardless of price/cost to the student. You will be surprised by how much you have to spend that you were unaware of initially. Not to mention, they make it seem like your fault whenever you can't afford the ridiculous additional programs not provided by the school. Professors don't seem to know much about blackboard in general. They also are allowed to create their own schedules, which is daunting when you have more than one class you're attending and there are 8 different due dates a week. This is not helpful for anyone that has to work for a living and care for a family. This school is not friendly to anyone that is not straight out of high school."
Sophomore,1,"This school is not friendly to anyone older than straight out of high school. Their administrative staff tends to always be on vacation. Financial aid department will keep you in debt due to lack of concern for their jobs. The professors in their online programs are allowed to create their own schedules with whatever tools they deem necessary at any given time. Meaning, there will be fees that you did not forsee. There are so many different due dates due to the lack of overall scheduling for online courses. If you want a great online experience DO NOT use this school. Blackboard is constantly glitching, half of the content never loads, professors do not care even when contacted with concerns. The professors are also allowed to develop programs strictly based on their own opinions, not the actual facts of the courses. There are also SO MANY classes that are not necessary for the degree you're working towards. They only want your money, don't bother with this terrible school."
Graduate Student,1,"Be prepared to work all of your weekend, sunrise to sunset.  Trying to get half time financial aid is a real pain.  You get the run around.  They just give you email addresses, not a real person to visit with.  So customer service is horrible.  For my program, principal certification, complete your practicum before you apply along with those three videos.  The video requirement is hard to fit into your schedule.  Start in August, not the summer, so you meet the financial aid requirements.  By the way, the program does a poor job preparing you for 268.  I have made all As during my time at Lamar.  I felt that I was unprepared for the time crunched exam.   I literally ran out of time on the examination for the case studies.   I would pick another program from a different university."
Graduate Student,1,"This campus and college is a total joke. I am a scholarship student that is about to graduate and I could write my masters thesis over how pathetic this “university” is. Their police department sweeps stuff under the rug, doesn’t answer emergency calls, the professors are narcissistic, and the student life is horrific. They complain about lack of student involvement, but they arrested sober people at tailgates, shut down any Greek event, and have dorm hours and rules that are set for middle schoolers. I would love to see improvement in this university and it’s multiple shortcomings, or find a way for this university to start from scratch. I spent my 4 years here regretting not going to a college that cares about its students and has pride, rather than see us as cash cows."
Freshman,1,Good educational system but i am  in a situation where i am being threatened multiple times by the same students over and over again and the universities students affairs office still would like them to stay on campus not only after my incident but 2 prior to mine so I’m guessing that they would have to follow through with their threats in order for something to be done about the situation which is absolutely ridiculous when they shouldve been gone
Senior,1,I wish I would of never transfer to that college. It's run by a bunch of hill billies and red necks. Don't waste your time or money on this crap college.
College Sophomore,1,"Athletics are nothing special. Very little school spirit shown, and teams arent very good"
College Sophomore,1,"Beaumont, TX has been ranked on the most depressed, most obese, most polluted, most crime, and least educated cities lists. What's next? It could be due to our many refineries as it is a prime place for oil.

On the bright side, campus police/security is up to par, despite the ""sketchy"" surrounding area. Not much to do nearby if you're looking for something unique or hip. Other than businesses and Crockett Street (hello, Dixie's), the downtown side of Beaumont gives off a sort of dead, eerie vibe if you go at the wrong time. The northern side of Beaumont is a growing though, where you'll find a mall, movie theaters, plenty of restaurants, and bowling within driving distance. Nothing is within walking distance. I repeat, NOTHING. Not even a decent grocery store or coffee shop open on weekends. Without a car, you are really limited."
College Junior,1,"I did not apply for financial aid because it is such a headache and hassle.  From personal experience and friends, it is not worth the time."
College Sophomore,1,Above average amount of students partake in recreational drugs.
College Sophomore,1,Off campus housing is poor the better apartments are on the other side of town and very expensive.
College Junior,1,"Flip floppy! It can rain, snow, be cold then sunny all in one day!"
College Junior,1,"Small town, so its quiet!"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Dorm areas are usually dirty, and people have a tendency to leave trash lying around. the dorms themselves are cramped and noisy, with people blasting music, fighting, yelling, etc. And the students that hang around the lobby generally have bad attitudes."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Lamar is located in southeast Texas, so we're not far from the ocean. That means the air is virtually always oppressively humid. During the summer months, the heat is awful. You can break a sweat going between two neighboring buildings. And, unless Beaumont is experiencing a drought, there's a fair amount of rain."
College Sophomore,1,This is only because the dorms are not up to par compared to the other dorms on campus. Maybe 3 out of the 5 are run down and continue to be a hassle to me and the other students that reside here. They also are horrible with the maintenance and it usually takes up to a month for them to even fix something as simple as the shower rod. The food is fairly decent and the academic programs here are awesome.
College Junior,1,"The rules have gotten more strict over the years I have been here.
Everyone is ID'd walking into their hall at all times of the day. Guests are not welcome to spend the night. There is no privacy. The parking sucks because only seniors have more spaces to park yet we all pay the same amount. If you forget your ID or lock yourself out your room there is a fee depending on the time of day the higher priced the fee may be."
College Sophomore,1,"There isnt much diversity as far as campus life goes. You may have diverse classes, but then the commuters go home and there isnt much diversity left.  On wednesdays theres a rap party outside the dining hall."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Only one or two options. Not located in ""student areas"" as this is a commuter school. Located in a dangerous part of Beaumont - it would not be a good idea to actually be walking or biking to or from campus (or anywhere) at night."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Although there is technically diversity at Lamar, I still give Diversity an 'F.' Ethnically, all the different ethniticities are each dominated too much by an extreme subculture, so there is little room for someone that is more ""normal"" and does not fit in with the specific extreme stereotype / subculture that dominates their particular ethniticity at Lamar. There is little diversity in the variety of subcultures in each ethniticity at Lamar. As for religion/politics, except where divided by racial lines, the campus is dominantly conservative / republican, of the hardcore type. Religiously the campus is almost entirely traditional christian except for some international students. Economically, except for extreme slackers, there are very little students from middle class city or suburban familities, of any race/ethniticity. Most everyone comes from rural families or poor inner city families."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Drugs, alcohol, and smoking are very popular at Lamar. I do not know if the majority is into two or three of those. But almost everyone is very into at least one of them anytime they are involved in any off-campus social activity at all (and almost all social activity is off-campus since Lamar is a commuter school). However, the on-campus policy of no alcohol, drugs, or tobacco is strictly enforced. If you are not interested in any of the three, you will be hard pressed to find any semi-decent social life here."
Recent Alumnus,1,"A terrible university, college, and department (Lamar, Business, MIS) with no worthwhile reputation, network, or employer relations in Texas outside of the Beaumont area, and certainly not any national reputation or connections. This is a commuter school that is essentially a degree mill like Devry, Phoenix, or other such for-profit scams, except this one is a taxpayer funded public school. The curriculum, coursework, internship, and postgraduate opportunities are all extremely poor. Liberal arts and core classes do not focus on what they should: developing and expanding one's mind. Instead they use a memorize-regurgitate textbook/lecture format. Business and MIS classes do not focus on what they should: developing and preparing the in-demand skills that are useful in getting a job and succeeding in your field. Instead they use a memorize-regurgitate textbook/lecture format for useless academic theory (and some random data-entry and other poor technical assignments in the case of MIS classes)."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Lamar has very limited scholarship funding altogether. The vast majority of those scholarships are focused on incoming students. Continuing students get even less funding because Lamar assumes if they are already there, they don't need to give them a ""discount"" to keep supplying Lamar with more money. Lamar also spreads out the scholarships among continuing students as much as possible, regardless of huge differences in the quality/effort of students receiving them. So in the end, even if you are doing ten times as much quality work (as well as ten times as much community/extracurricular participation) as another student, he/she might get $500 whereas you still only get $1,000. I would see huge groups of scholarship winners that always did the bare minimum to get by in everything they did in and outside of class. By all means, give the slacker $500, but don't take it out of the already limited funds your highest performing students are working so hard for, and who have just as bad financial circumstances as the slackers."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Commuter campus: there is hardly any ""student life"" at all. The recreation facility offers an assortment of exercise options - but that is pretty much the only high quality service offered at Lamar University. There is a Homecoming King and Queen election if you want to continue your highschool traditions."
Recent Alumnus,1,"They offer single-bedrooms (shared living rooms and bathrooms), which is nice. However, the dorms were built very cheaply and as a result are already becoming run-down even though the oldest were built within the last decade. Even after ""remodeling,"" they continue to get worse every semester. The remodeling helps some, but not for the long-term issues that are getting worse (trash/uncleanliness, bugs, amenities/features wearing out/breaking down in both your apartment/room and the community facilities). The dorms are also located on the side of campus that is across the street from a dangerous part of Beaumont. Also, as this is a commuter school, there is practically no social life or significant extracurricular activity available on-campus. The on-campus student population is dominated by the same atmosphere that most of the on-campus students originate: decaying urban areas."
Recent Alumnus,1,"A commuter school with very poor social life, very poor extracurricular activity, very poor academics, and very poor internship and postgraduate employment opportunities."
Recent Alumnus,1,"MIS: A terrible program that taught little to no real-world skills. I absolutely would not have attended Lamar University if i had known what I do now. Even if I was forced to attend Lamar, I certainly would not have chosen MIS which is one of their particularly weak departments (though the entire College of Business and the University as a whole are very weak themselves). I have been unemployed for months, trying to get any kind of job at all, and I cannot with my Lamar degree."
Recent Alumnus,1,"No public transportation in Beaumont or at Lamar, except for a weekly shuttle to the local Wal-Mart. The only parties that happen at Lamar are small frat/sorority alcohol-based parties at the run-down frat shacks at the edge of the dangerous part of town. Other than that, as Lamar is a commuter-oriented school located in a town where there is almost nothing interesting to do (and what extremely little there is, it is across town), there is almost no nightlife at all, for either drinkers or non-drinkers. Except for students who live on-campus, everyone leaves after class. And the vast majority of on-campus students leave to go back to their hometowns in other areas of Texas and Lousiana on the weekends. The few events that do occur at a few run-down ""clubs"" in Beaumont (across town) are just heavily alcohol / smoking focused and pretty much only play rap music."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Always closed during first couple of days of student move-in (so bring food with you). Limited hours, poor selection, poor quality for everyone, and even worse for those health-minded (which I was not - I feel extra bad for those that were/are)."
Recent Alumnus,1,Lamar has little to no relations with employers outside local small businesses in the Beaumont area. The university is largely considered a joke in the state of Texas. It is difficult to get a quality internship from Lamar.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Outside of a weekly shuttle to the local Wal-Mart, Lamar and/or the City of Beaumont does not provide any public transportation to or from Lamar University. The local airport has very limited times of availability and flights to/from a limited number of other airports. There is no bus station within the city limits of Beaumont, nor is there passenger train access. As there is nothing located near this dangerous part of town, you need access to car transportation to get to anything of value off-campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,Horrible Texas Heat. Lamar and/or Beaumont does not have adequate drainage infrastructure to prevent campus flooding during heavy rains. Covered walkways do not extend out to dorms or other facilities outside the most central area of the campus - raincoat/umbrella required.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Lamar's administration has taken some decent precautions to make students safe on-campus. However, there is only so much one can do (and I feel they could still do more) when one of the most dangerous parts of the city is literally right across the street. There has been multiple recent incidents of criminals from that area of town crossing the street into the dorm parking lots and committing crimes, of both the property and violent types."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Nothing student-focused. Except for a couple of places down the street (Subway and Kampus Korner Restaurant), nothing else unless you go across town via car to somewhere else. Since this is a dangerous part of town in a poor city, those other two options are not exactly safe at night."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The core curriculum and liberal arts classes heavily focus on memorize-regurgitate format for homework and tests. Little to no opportunity for class discussion, independent thinking, critical thinking, etc... Professors are willing to help you with understanding the content in order to accurately memorize/regurgitate, but they are mostly uninterested in constructive class discussion or non-linear thinking. Even in classes that are specifically supposed to prepare you for the real-world (such as business subjects), they largely avoid developing real-world skills that employers constantly say they seek from new college graduates. Instead of actually learning practical skills and practicing them through application, Lamar's ""career-focused"" courses focus all on memorization of academic theory and regurgitation of said facts and theories through tests and homework. Even the most technical of its courses are often out-of-date, do not focus on developing adequate proficiency of a skill, and/or focus on repetitive-task training that you will find in a 2-year vocational program (and still doesn't prepare you for a job typical of even a 2-year degree, much less a 4-year degree). Avoid Lamar's Honors Program - it is just a lot more of the same work, instead of increasing the diversity/scope of the work. Despite the memorization/regurgitation, Lamar can still dump a lot of it on you, interfering with your social life at times (especially since the work is so dull and useless, making it harder to gather the enthusiasm to do it)."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Despite technically being a city, the atmosphere is overall very rural and like a dead small town (the area is economically run-down and has fallen far from its prime years ago). The populace has no drive to accomplish anything and no diversity of interests - you can see/hear it anytime you are out.
No public transportation. Located in a dangerous part of Beaumont (criminals have on multiple occasions crossed the street onto the dorm parking lot and committed crimes). Right next to polluting (and sometimes smelly) industrial facilities. Zero college-town amneties - other than the textbook store, there is only a single business in the entire city that is oriented towards Lamar students. Very little to do in Beaumont for someone with a job there, much less a college student with more limited funds. A generally ugly-looking city. Many large national businesses that provide consumer products/services do not have locations in Beaumont. For example, you might often wish you could go to a store, restaurant, or something else, that is having a national promotion/sale, except the nearest location is three hours away. Good restaurants are very few in the Beaumont area. There is no particular goodwill towards college students - they are treated like everyone else, for better or for worse."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are very few students with any ambition or intellectual interests whatsoever, even within their own majors / career goals, much less outside of their academics/careers. Many of Lamar's students, and especially most of the on-campus / dorm students, come from ""run down"" urban areas of Texas. As a result, many of the girls dress and act very trashy, and I have that opinion as a straight male who does not consider sexy/revealing to be trashy. The vast majority of the rest of the students come from poor rural areas surrounding Beaumont, and unfortunately match the stereotypical looks and behavior of such a population.

If you are a male looking for just fun or casual dating, avoid Lamar (even if you are interested in only ""one thing"") unless you have no standards and are interested in just anyone and willing to pretend to be whatever the girl wants you to be. With the exception of the trashy type, there are only the airhead sorority type (whether in sororities or not) which are not even numerous themselves due to Lamar being a commuter-oriented school, and the last and most dominant type, very uptight rural girls who are only seeking their imminent husband and father-of-their-children ASAP.

If you are a female looking for a decent guy, I wouldn't recommend Lamar for you either. The guys were just as extremely immature, narrow-minded, and unambitious as the girls."
College Senior,1,The transit bus is the only from of alternative transportation available. Nothing else is advertised.
College Junior,1,Security Is Fairly Strict – The strictness has definitely increased in the past semester. It's kind of annoying when you forget your resident card. Be discreet about things you shouldn't be doing and you'll be fine.
College Sophomore,1,"Feels Like Prison – The dorm life is dominated by guards who at intrusive and invade space. Although I understand why, I cannot fathom the extent of security. Some bad apples at the school ruin leniency for everyone else. Drug use and drinking are frowned upon greatly on campus and eventually make the campus terrible. I do not influence either of those aforementioned illegal actions."

Freshman,5,I took a class online and have learned so much! The professor was very kind and helpful and stayed in contact with all the students.
Freshman,5,The professors provide a great learning environment. The professors want you to succeed and are very helpful. There are lots of resources to help you be successful!
Freshman,5,I love it here! Everyone is so nice. the professors are super nice and supportive. they all want to keep us safe and make sure we stay successful!
Freshman,5,"Most of my classes are in person this semester. However, I do have some hybrid classes. the ones that are hybrid are great. once again, the professors are super helpful and understanding. they have a really good sight called canvas that i really enjoy using for academics."
Senior,5,"Mount Aloysius was the best decision I never made! It certainly wasn’t my first choice, when I decided to return as an adult. However, I could not be happier with the amount of care and attention students are able to receive, due to the size; and the level of understanding and respect given to adult students surely aided in my success as well. The mount is a progressive college, steeped in long standing traditions. The forward thinking staff  there has created a place where ideals such as a broad education, social adaptability, and real world success are the primary focus. All walks of life are honored and accepted, adopting ideas of mercy, which are directly from this colleges conception as a Catholic institution. The teachings which make Catholicism great are imbedded into this place; thankfully none Of the hardline guilt, sin, and corporal punishment have."
Senior,5,"Many of the professors are highly respected academics who bring a wide variety of real world experiences to the classroom. The administration respects, honors, and really provides for the professors, and it shows! So many teachers are underpaid, overlooked or conversely are seen as untouchable on their campus, all of which come at great costs to the students. But here, there is excitement and passion; the information and technology is current, the thinking is forward."
Freshman,5,"It’s been an amazing experience here. MAC is small, yet it has so many characters and the people here are so welcoming."
Freshman,5,Professors are incredibly helpful. They are always there to help and they respond so quickly regardless of when I asked them questions. All of them are so highly educated and so professional.
Freshman,5,"Mount Aloysius College is a small and simple campus for students who want to get to the places they need to be. Also, they seem to care for their students and staff than other schools I have been looking at. I feel this college is a good match for me, it has a positive environment, military friendly, courageous staff, and nice students."
Niche User,5,I toured the college and will be attending in fall of 2020. I love the small campus. Short and simple.
Niche User,5,"tMpiending  Mount Aloysius in the fall of 2020 majoring in Nursing.  My visit there this past November was great!  I think the smaller class sizes offering more individual attention is great.  The campus is wonderful!  Located in Cresson, a small town, it's quiet and the scenery is beautiful!  The road going past the campus reminds you of a ""back road"".  It doesn't seem to have a lot of tr   are very nice and the campus is beautiful!  I'm looking forward to attending in the fall!"
Freshman,5,"Amazing experience! The professors are always lending a helping hand and trying to do everything to help. The programs are hands on and help during the learning process. Also, the job placement rate is phenomenal. The college also provides countless hours of clinical practice in the health majors. The small class sizes help for 1 on 1 interactions. Overall an amazing college to be a part of!"
Freshman,5,"I like Mount Aloysius college because it is such a beautiful campus. It has old, historical buildings and it is a private, catholic college. The professors are amazing and they had my specific major that most of the nearby colleges don't have."
Sophomore,5,"The Mount is an amazing school to be at. Everyone, staff and students are extremely helpful and friendly. One of the best things about the school is that they have free, on campus, professional and peer tutors to help you with the classes you may struggle in."
Sophomore,5,"I could not have chose a better school to attend than Mount Aloysius College. The classes are very small so that gives you the one on one attention that some people need. Also, since the classes are so small, I personally feel it is so much easier to learn the content that the professor is teaching. The professors are all super kind and are always willing to help out with anything."
Freshman,5,Mount Aloysius is a beautiful and well-rounded environment to get an amazing education! The staff truly try and make college a very memorable experience for all the students.
Senior,5,"Mount Aloysius College has been an absolutely phenomenal school, one that I would chose over and over again if I had to make the decision again. The professors here treat you as not just as another student but as someone who they want to see succeed, and go on to do great things in their lives. Without all of them I wouldn't be where I am today, and I am so thankful for that opportunity."
Niche User,5,"I love the people because you get 1 on 1 with professors and students. Also, the class sizes are small which I LOVE!! It is a beautiful campus with good security and amazing up to date facilities for commuters and on campus students."
Freshman,5,"I have just recently tranferred to MAC. I fell in love with how pretty the campus was, and the fact that it is a smaller campus. The professors are always more than willing to answer questions you may have, or take the one on one time needed to help you understand the material. I would definitely reccommend the school to anyone!"
Junior,5,The fact that it is a smaller college is wonderful. The professors really get a chance to get to know their students and there is more opportunity for one on one help.
Junior,5,This is a gorgeous college that is constantly updating. The medical programs are top in the state and the other programs are becoming better known as well.
Sophomore,5,"I like being able to get know everyone on campus because of the small size. You make many friends and are able to properly know your professors, allowing you to succeed in your classes."
Niche User,5,"The admissions team, teachers, administration etc. Were so helpful, kind and more than willing to text, email, call and send letters in order to keep me on top of the process and informed."
Junior,5,The college has great academics but lacks in activities it’s a very boring campus. The food could definitely use an upgrade. The dorms are not as nice as other schools but get better as you progress. Overall it’s a great school and I recommend it to seriously scholars.
Freshman,5,I love it at the Mount. The teachers are extremely helpful and do anything the can to see you succeed.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy Mount Aloysius because it seems to me as if we were all just one big family. I'm so glad I chose Mount Aloysius over any other college because it a friendly environment.
Freshman,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful, the staff, administration and professors are all so friendly.  It seems like it is going to be a family-like atmosphere.  On my tour, it's like everybody knows everybody. I'm 26 years old, so going back to school was a little intimidating, but I feel welcome, and it feels like home."
College Junior,5,"The school has allowed me to work towards my career but grow as a person. I still have time to spend with my family and work. They have classes from early in the morning to late at night, all around. The only bad thing is scheduling for classes because the server will get backed up and sometimes you'll miss the certain class you wanted or needed."
College Junior,5,"Nursing at Mount Aloysius is by far the best. It's so intense, and hands on. Not only do we have nursing lecture classes, but we have off and on clinical sites. This allows for a more of a real world experience."
College Senior,5,the professor really knew what he was doing and helped me out a lot whenever I had questions and trust me I had a lot of them.
College Senior,5,I am starting an internship and the people that work with you are just great because they really do help you to succeed.
College Senior,5,My capstone (senior class) that I have just taken was not as bad as I thought it would be because the professor helped us through the tough times.
College Senior,5,there is a lot or hard work to be put into this program of study but it is all worth it in the end because I know a lot more about what my life will be like after attending classes.
College Senior,5,the professors really care about the students because they will take the time to get to know your lifestyles and how well you work on your school work.
College Sophomore,5,The course was set up as easy as possible to access the assignments to have them due on the dates needed.
College Sophomore,5,"In talking to graduates of the program in Medical Imaging, they have been satisfied with placement help and efficenticy in helping with job searches."
College Sophomore,5,It is really nice having the small class sizes being a name and not a number.
College Sophomore,5,One of the reasons I choose the Mount is because their graduates have no problem finding jobs in the area. Employers find their students well prepaired for the work force.
College Sophomore,5,The professors care and will go the extra distance to help you understand the material. They will allow you to come in for extra help if you are having trouble with a subject.
College Sophomore,5,"There was one on one help if it was needed. Assignments were very reasonable, and made to help improve your knowledge about the course. There is alot of community envolement."
College Freshman,5,I had 6 credits from high school transfer to Mount Aloysius College and they transferred over perfectly fine and counted for an elective and a degree requirement. When scheduling your classes you have a lot of flexibility. You see when each class is available and get to completely create your schedule for what works best for you and to your own convenience.
College Freshman,5,We have a job fair every year where employees come in and you can talk with multiple companies to see where you would like to work after and start getting connections with these companies. Our career services center is very helpful and will set up mock interviews to help prepare for any upcoming interviews and they are very helpful with creating resumes for students. They really help you find any jobs or internships that will fit you best and help you the most with your career goals.
College Freshman,5,"The classes are small which makes learning easier. It gives the professor more time to be able to fully get to know you and help you learn better. The courses can be challenging depending on your program and the professor, but there is free professional tutoring, peer tutoring, and Supplemental Instructor sessions available. The professors and faculty at this school make you feel important and not like you are just a number."
College Freshman,5,"It's a 3+2 Physician Assistant program so it's very fast paced and a lot of work throughout the semester. It can be tough at times but it's all worth it in the end. The professors are great in the sciences and help tremendously whether it be with class work, finding internships, or creating a resume."
College Freshman,5,The professors really want you to succeed & I love it here. I would definitely pick going to this school in another life. They have awesome programs for the medical and science fields.
College Freshman,5,"I personally, have not taken any online courses from Mount Aloysius, but my friends have and say that they've gotten a lot out of their courses and that the professors are always easy to reach."
College Freshman,5,"The professors and the courses they teach are the perfect balance of easy and hard. Class sizes only get up to thirty students, so it's definitely easy to reach out to your professors as well as fellow students. Class styles and variety vary depending on each major, but there are plenty of options."
College Freshman,5,"Students have many opportunities to apply for jobs on and off campus. Depending on their financial aid need, students may also be awarded federal work study. If given this option, students can contact professors or faculty on campus from any sort of job. Choosing a work study program that will further your career is beneficial. The career center and services are open almost all day and night and are filled with adult and student faculty."
College Freshman,5,"Scheduling classes is always overwhelming for first-time students, but the faculty at Mount Aloysius makes it so simple. They let each student pick the times they want for their classes, as long as they're available. Thus far, I have had no hassles with anything at the Mount."
College Freshman,5,"The director of the physician assistant program at Mount Aloysius is very personable. You can meet with her at almost every hour- one on one, or with other students. Also, it is a 3:2 program, so students will attend Mount Aloysius for three years, then transfer to either Chatham University or Mercy University in New York, for the last two years. I love this about Mount Aloysius' program because it gives students a chance to see other universities and get other experiences from them. The professors will also help you apply for those last two years of the program, as well as finding job-shadowing experiences. Work study programs are available on and off campus, which is something that really helps students majoring as a PA."
College Freshman,5,"Due to medical reasons, I deferred my first year of college. However, I am attending Mount Aloysius this year, and majoring as a Physician Assistant. Mount Aloysius is a very old school with a beautiful chapel on campus, and a lot of history. Almost every professor works that history into their lesson plans. The faculty and students are very accepting and accommodating. During my visits to the school, my counselors and professors really seemed to want me to attend Mount Aloysius. But, they wanted me there for my personal strengths and attributes, not just to gain more money. Mount Aloysius is just an all-around friendly, quaint, peaceful college."
College Junior,5,The value of the nursing degree i am getting ready to get is extremely high. A lot of the hospitals close by really only take nursing students from our school.
College Freshman,5,"I have been able to shuffle my classes about, some haven't fitted in with my timetable but I can take them at later dates, the timetables are quite flexible and I keep ion track with my credits to complete the major and the advisors are always on hand to help and advise which is great"
College Freshman,5,"I have rated it the best, but I am not doing any online courses,"
College Freshman,5,"Again as a Freshman this hasn't presented to me yet but the doctorates are available at the Mount or there are links to other colleges, the Professors and advisors are always on hand to help direct you to the right path, career opportunities and there is an alumni network to check out. MAC supports you from the start and the career will follow."
College Freshman,5,"I haven't experienced this aspect yet, but my friends on campus who are graduating  or who have have gone on to excellent career pathways and doctorates. MAC and the Professors keep us informed of our choices and make sure we are on track to achieve our majors and career choices."
College Freshman,5,"At The mount, class sizes are small and varied timetables which is great for fitting in around my soccer schedules. The Professors are friendly and helpful and I can interact freely by email with them for concerns or absences."
College Freshman,5,"I have changed my majors from Physical Therapy to business management, the process has been easy to do with the help from all the staff which is why MAC is so great, as the staff really go out on a limb to make sure I am on track and achieving all I need to. The lecturers treat me like an adult and are always there for problems. concerns or changes. The courses fit in around my soccer schedule which is my main purpose, and the facilities are excellent."
College Freshman,5,"I am an international student from the UK, the Mount (MAC) has been like family since I arrived, very welcoming, friendly, helpful and the staff really care and help with your majors and academics, I went to be a part of the Soccer team and we am achieving greatness, a fantastic team that is going to go far as we care and are passionate. Everyone looks out for each other, which is what your parents need to know as being far from home but now at home. MAC is family, it is a small College in a beautiful environment and I am very happy there."
College Junior,5,"Overall, this is the best option in the region for nursing and other majors. It's in a small community which is sometimes a downfall with students getting bored; however, it's an intimate setting where the staff and professors truly care about you as an individual and how you are doing. They want you to succeed and they will help anyway they can to get you there."
Freshman,4,"Very educational, professional environment to learn and make friends. Small college but serves as an advantage to students and professors."
Senior,4,"My professors have been super supportive and patient with the transition from in person to virtual learning. The work was overwhelming, however I had no issues with receiving help from professors."
Senior,4,My experience with Mount Aloysius is very positive and I have great recourses that allow me to achieve good grades and get the college experience.
Senior,4,I really liked the school. It was small and I met a lot of great people. The teachers were very helpful and liked when you went to them for extra help.
Freshman,4,"Very student oriented focusing on the achievements of every student there. The campus is small but allows for deep concentration of studies, Athletics, and college life. I enjoy going to class with about 25-30 people in class , which broadens my horizon for learning and to connect with other students."
Niche User,4,"The campus was small, which makes getting to classes easy. The campus is also very clean. The staff is super nice and helpful."
Sophomore,4,Very small area around the school but is homey and you get to know almost everyone that is enrolled. It feels like the traditional college image.
Sophomore,4,I love the small classroom sizes and the one on one experiences with my teachers. Everyone is like family here. It is a beautiful campus with a lot of activities to always keep students busy. The professors are all wonderful and caring towards their students. I'm glad they know me by name and I am not just a number at my school. I have achieved great things attending this school and I am forever thankful that I have chosen Mount Aloysius to further my education.
Freshman,4,I've only been attending the Mount for a year now but my experience has been great. It's a small school so classes are very interactive and the professors are very easy to work with and talk to.
Freshman,4,The Mount needs more things to do on the weekend.  Many students leave because there isn't much to do around campus.  Being at least 10 miles from the closest place with things to do is a pain.  it gets expensive trying to find new things to do because there is a lack of things on campus.
Alum,4,The campus is very quiet and provides a great study atmosphere. The classrooms are smaller than average therefor giving more time for one on one interaction with professors. They have a great reputation for being safe and secure.
Sophomore,4,"I love the sense of community the college has. It is a smaller campus, so you get to know your professors and fellow students very well. I have only been on campus one year and I have already developed friendships with several of the college administrators. They try to get to know the students by name and the president is someone who  you see walking around campus frequently."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, being a student at Mount Aloysius college helped me adjust into life as an emerging adult, and also helped me grow as a person. The Mount offered a safe and lively campus to live on and a community that I became proud to be a part of. The school gives each student a chance to be involved with clubs, sports, and campus gatherings."
Junior,4,My experience at Mount Aloysius has made me grow as an individual. There are so many diverse programs offered as well as organizations you can participate in. What I like the most about the Mount is the people and all the different cultures. If I would have the opportunity to change something it would be how expensive the tuition and housing is.
Senior,4,"I love how much the professors care about the students. For me, it was nice to go to a school that wasn't centered around partying. I think they definitely need to have more food options, since you really only have the choice to eat in the dining hall or go off campus. The campus is in a very rural area in the mountains so it's secluded from City areas. Take that how you will. I think there could definitely be a lot more racial diversity but it can be difficult because of the surrounding demographic."
Senior,4,"Mount Aloysius College was my home and not only was I taught there, but I was mentored there into the thoughtful and aware person I am today. Growth is a must at the Mount."
Freshman,4,"So far, I have had wonderful experiences during my time here at MAC. The professors are wonderful, and they are very willing to help you one-on-one and in class. The dorms, especially St. Joe's could be better; however, for Freshman Living, they serve their purpose. The food is iffy and only seems to have quality taste when there is a major event on campus. The Campus Ministry and MAC's strong adherence to the Catholic faith and the Mercy Values are my favorite part of living and studying here. Overall, the campus is beautiful and the academics are superb. I really do love it here."
Sophomore,4,I love the small class sizes and personable aspect.  A few logistics with scholarships and the track for coursework could be improved.  The food could also be improved.
Junior,4,The small class sizes and proximity to home was the best part. In my major there was diffidently some favoritism and judgement depending if you played a sport.
Sophomore,4,Great Experience. Friendly faculty and staff that are always willing to help. Wish others of different backgrounds and races would learn about the school to make it more diverse.
Niche User,4,I am not sure how many people it takes to make a decision on admissions but I am an alum & it still took weeks to get my letter. I thought that was too long of a process.
Freshman,4,You can tell which professors want to be there and which want to be there even less than the students. The curriculum is decent and they have a great nursing program.
Recent Alumnus,4,They are as flexible as they can be. They offer online classes and plenty of night classes. They also offer some classes in different towns around so it is easier for people that way as well.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Online classes are good. They have a big work load for the week, but in my opinion I have always did well in them and the professors still are available to help you out most of the time."
Recent Alumnus,4,"They offer tons of different classes! Anytime I had a question about anything someone knew the answer to it, even if it wasn't your adviser."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I love my school for a few different reasons. The classes are not very big so most of the teachers are always there for the students when need be. I also have been apart of Campus Ministry for a few years. I have went on a couple of trips with them. We went to New Orleans December 2013 and Guyana, South America in March 2015. I also have went on a retreat with this group and this year I am now a leader for the retreat. This school has brought many memories for me and my friends and I loved every minute of it."
College Junior,4,"The workload is a lot, depending on what major you're in. That is why if it's possible, to take a traditional class and not an online class so you can actually speak with the professor."
College Junior,4,Job prospects from this school are good. The placement ratings are high in almost all of the majors. Many people do come back to complete their degree here.
College Junior,4,Our class sizes are small which allows for a more one on one experience with your professor. The quality of courses is outstanding. The variety of courses offered allows for a expansion of knowledge even with elective classes.
College Junior,4,The value of degree from this school is outstanding. It is so much more than just a piece of paper. The services on campus allow for us to expand our knowledge.
College Junior,4,"Our campus is small but widely diverse, and each day you're learning something new. The class sizes are small which allows for more one on one time with the professors. They actually care about you and your education."
College Senior,4,the career services really helped me out when building my resume for job interviews.
College Student,4,I will say its been pretty great so far like I said I'm receiving a lot of help from my advisor so far.
College Student,4,I think its going to be great cause I was put in this special course to help me understand college and what its going to be like. its called MAAPP I really excited to go. I cant wait to start this new chapter in my life.
College Student,4,"Has of right now I find it to be the best college out their for me because they have already done so much for me! by first they accepted me in to their college, second I received a merit grant award and they have given me so much information on grants and the school and to help me pick my classes. so I will say Thank you"
College Freshman,4,You can schedule classes for your time
College Freshman,4,They work with all the students through the process.
College Freshman,4,I have not had a career on campus this question does not apply
College Freshman,4,The professors that I have had so far are awesome.
College Freshman,4,The American Sign Language program here is great.
College Freshman,4,The application process and getting help for financial aid was easy. So many helpful employees
College Freshman,4,"I only had one online class and it was a very good and informative class. The workload was;t over bearing, there were two assignments a week. Once we finished them the professor graded them fairly fast and had our grades posted online. Our peers were very friendly as well."
College Freshman,4,"I  haven't graduated yet, but I know our career center really helps students find a job after they graduate. They don't want students to graduate and be on their own with no help. We also have alumni that come to campus often and for special events on campus throughout the year."
College Freshman,4,"There is a lost of post-graduate students and degrees on campus, as well as alumni. All of these make the experience at Mount Aloysius better. I have met a lot of alumni and have heard many great things about their experiences at the Mount."
College Freshman,4,"I am a biology major and the classes have definitely pushed me to succeed. There is a lot of work, but it really helps you in the long run."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, Mount Aloysius College has been a great help in preparing me for graduate school. I learned a lot and the teachers are to thank for that. Most of them are really understanding and willing to work with you to help you out."
College Junior,4,"Here at Mount Aloysius, I love it!  The professors are great and are always very understanding."
College Junior,4,"Other than the food, I love the Mount.  Mount Aloysius College makes you feel like you are no longer a number but an actual person and they are concerned about you and your education"
College Freshman,4,"There has been some times where I would have to skip class for the day, but the professors understand my situations and where able to catch me up in a quick understandable fashion."
College Freshman,4,There are tons of clubs to get involved in and the staff at the Mount will aid you in any way to help you succeed.
College Freshman,4,Overall the courses offer a wide variety of academic possibilities. If you want to be a nurse or learn about Digital Forensics then this is the college to go to.
College Freshman,4,The college aids you with finding internships of interest and if your an IT major there are tons of possibilities looking towards the future.
College Junior,4,The classes time periods are pretty flexible. They give us many options for classes through out the day in most classes.
College Junior,4,They got a good post- grad services at the school. They have a new career center that seems to be going pretty strong.
College Junior,4,I know for medical imaging the professors were fantastic. They took the time out of the their busy day to make sure they answered our questions.
College Junior,4,It has a lot of disadvantaged but the school makes you feel right at home.
College Senior,4,Staff is there to help you. Very good school!!
College Student,4,"My school is relatively small and I really enjoy the small class sizes. On average, my classes were about 20 students. I also enjoy the variety of courses available. Furthermore, my chemistry course in particular was awesome!"
College Student,4,"So far, my academic experience has been great. My academic advisor keeps us on track and helps guide which courses to take. I never felt alone or confused in the academic process."
College Freshman,4,Definitely an aid in the expansion of my future.
Sophomore,2,Does not offer tutoring and help for all majors. If your not there for nursing you take the back burner.
College Freshman,2,They do not help very much with being affordable
College Sophomore,2,"I am currently taking out a $12,000 loan (and that is with A LOT of help from financial aid), and I don't think that this experience should cost me this much money. Living on campus has its perks, but it has more cons than anything. The wi fi doesn't work in the dorms and the library closes at 11 every night. I don't understand how they are expecting college kids with online classes to get everything done in addition to all their other classes. I feel that paying $12,000 should give me SO many more opportunities and better programs. I don't ask financial aid questions in fear of being talked down to and given attitude from people that act like I should know everything about the financial aspect of the school."
College Sophomore,2,"The nursing program needs work. They say they don't ""weed"" out students, but they do. When leaving the nursing program before the end of the semester, they barely offer any classes and they require $800 for an extra credit even though you've already had to pay for the nursing credits. There is NO communications between the professors of the nursing program and every single one of them teach a different thing. When test time comes around, nobody knows the correct information because everyone was taught something different. The amount of work that the students have to do does NOT reflect their grade at all. The only graded piece is the NCLEX based tests they start on the 3rd week of school. This program is not the program for me."
College Sophomore,2,Very little convenience or flexibility is offered for classes/curriculum.
College Freshman,2,"I'm paying $31,000. The food sucks here. The wi-fi is also bad. Financial aid is somewhat helpful and easy to work with."
College Junior,2,When I told them that I would have my payment the next day they didn't want to hear it. Sometimes it seems like all they want is money.
College Senior,2,Financial aid wasn't helpful in offering me anyting beyond the very basic aid.  They did not offer to help me seek out any scholarships.
College Junior,2,"The library needs more computers and faster internet connections, printers are always shutting down and aren't available. When having to do homework online it is so slow to continue to the next question because of the lack of speed. When so many are on the internet we can not get things done."
College Freshman,2,"My school's tuition is pretty high, but the education I am recieving is well worth the money. I got a little bit of financial aid, which helps, but I am on my own with getting loans for my college education therefore, I need as much help as I can get."
College Sophomore,2,Not to Bad. there are many professors in my program that are horrible they do not answer questions or anything there are a few that are very good but most don't care and are very bad.
College Freshman,2,There Is Not a Great Deal of Flexibility of Classes. Transferring credits worked out well for me as a transfer student into the college. Some students who have looked into transferring to another school have found most of their credits won't transfer. There is little flexibility with classes.
College Sophomore,2,i do feel i am getting a good education but the group of teachers in the program are very easily persuaded and i dont think somethings are right. i would not choose this school again.
College Junior,2,"It's a Hassle – Mount aloysius may have an average tuition cost compared to other nearby schools but their whole system is disorganized. I lost my financial aid and they never even took the time to notify me of the situation, which is making it near impossible to get back in this semester coming in January. Our school is a very small size which makes it hard to understand why they didn't notify me. I want to learn, I love to be educated, but the financial aid process has been nothing but a hassle with this school!"
College Sophomore,2,"A Little Disappointing – The computer labs and printing on campus are a constant struggle for me. Most of the time, all the computers are filled up (usually with students doing things OTHER than schoolwork, aka. Facebook). When I am able to get to a computer, it never works properly (i.e., it freezes or doesn't load properly). And when I finally get a computer that works, the printer doesn't - it always seems to be out of ink/paper. If it does work, either the file I sent to print doesn't print out at all, or it takes forever to print because there aren't many printers around to accommodate everyone. The wireless network for personal computers is a perk, though. I haven't had any trouble with it."
College Freshman,2,There Is a Little to Know About Post-Grad Services – I would have to say that there are post-grad services at Mount Aloysius College because even I hear about them.  There are even a few post-grad ciriculums at the college but not many.  The college does have a center to help one apply for other post-grad schools.  There are also many events for alumni to come and reunite.
College Senior,2,"Not worth the effort – For my family the Mount was not worth the effort. If you are planning on attending the mount, I suggest you do your research. Visit the school, talk to the students, do comparisons with other schools, and make sure the Mount is right for you."
College Senior,2,Poor Experience – My family's experience with the mount has not been positive.
College Freshman,2,The tuition is expensive considering what we are getting while at the school.
College Freshman,2,"The program is intensive, but unorganized. Many students drop out because they were not aware of the financial load that Mount Aloysius radiography requires. Most of the professors, but not all, are unapproachable and expect performance far beyond students' experiences. The workload is excessive, and required clinical expectations are unfair compared to other health science programs."
Niche User,1,"Some of the staff at Mount Aloysius College are very UNPROFESSIONAL, especially certain security guards (the head). They are extremely rude and inconsiderate. They feel it is okay to invade your room and personal belongings to assert themselves if you attempt to argue your case."
College Sophomore,1,"Their is no post-grad services, alumni networking and job prospects are out of the question."
College Sophomore,1,"The majority of professors do not care about the students, they are only a number."
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid office at Mount Aloysius is terrible.  The quality of the education that I have received is not worth the tuition that I paid.
College Sophomore,1,"Most people on campus are older adults who come to further education while juggling work and kids, while others are still stuck in a high school state of mind. Rumors soar just because a person looks at another person wrong, vandalism often happens, and cleaning up after yourself doesn't exist. While most of these people should be acting like adults (because we all are adults) they choose not to, and it ruins it for people who do come to the college to learn."
Recent Alumnus,1,Horrible Instructors Who Gossip – Parking pass 25 bucks and no spots available!!! Teachers gossip to me in nursing program about other students. I learned everything at home because instructors Are worthless! The admissions office screw up 50% of info and cost u extra money! This school is most expensive do the research!!! I caught one nursing instructor in the parking lot kissing a student! One of her favorites I guess.
College Freshman,1,Computer Network Catastrophy – The computer network at Mount Aloysius College is truly horrible.  There are more times that it is down and not working than it is running.  The campus depends on the internet system for blackboard campus web and many other things for each class.  There are times where homework can't be submitted because of how poor the internet is running.  For the amount paid to come to the private catholic college I would think that it should be sufficient enough for the standards they set for us to use their online programs.
College Freshman,1,"Don't Do It – SUCK. He gave us a syllabus that he didn't follow, he had no idea how much work e was giving us, and it was WAY too much work for a 100 credit course."
College Freshman,1,"They aren't helpful at all. You end up running around trying to get things in order while these people just sit behind their desks glaring at you! And then, tuition is VERY high, and not worth it at all. Financial aid is few and far between, and DO NOT take the Mercy Scholarship. Yes, it's a lot of money, but they ask TOO much from you."
College Freshman,1,"Don't Do It – To be honest, I am not liking it very much. I feel like I'm being watched constantly, and I feel like there are way too many rules. We're supposed to be adults! I was part of the Mercy group, and that REALLY made me hate the whole program. Since when is a scholarship not intended to help you get through college? Seriously, it sucked. I had a teacher constantly requesting extra work and time from me for nothing but her benefit. Because I spent so much time on her 1-credit class that was required for my scholarship, I didn't have any time to do my other work. She asked way too much, I don't care how much money I'm getting. I hated living on campus. To be honest, if I thought my parents could bare it, I'd transfer out. The regular academics are seriously the only thing keeping me there. It's way expensive though, so if you can avoid going here, do."

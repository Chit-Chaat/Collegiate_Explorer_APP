Sophomore,5,"Yes , I took a few online classes . Mostly due to Covid -19 . They weren’t the hardest . The teachers were caring & helpful on making sure everyone was getting the work turned in on time ."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Gordon State was good overall . Everyone there is great , the staff , & students are nice. The classes are easy to find & they have a variety of activities to choose from ."
Freshman,5,"This is my first year attending but the campus is awesome, and the process ito get in was easy as well as communicating with staff."
Sophomore,5,When the Coronavirus started the online move for all academics was better than I thought it ever would be! The teachers did amazing!
Sophomore,5,"I am a rising sophomore at Gordon State College majoring in Early Childhood Education. So far, my experience at Gordon has been great. I’ve met new friends and professors. The professors at Gordon are very welcoming and the other staff, including the President and the Dean of Students are wonderful people as well. They have helped me to become the best college student I could be in this past school year. There is nothing I would change at Gordon because it’s great just the way it is. From day one, I have felt so welcomed and I don’t feel like I would have received that from any other school. Gordon prepares your for your degree and for your life after college. The professors all want you to succeed and be the best at whatever you strive to do in life. Gordon was a great choice for me and it can be great for anyone else as well. You’ll enjoy being a Highlander just like I am."
Sophomore,5,"Online classes have always been a struggle for me. However, that all changed when I received all A’s second semester. The online experience with Gordon wasn’t bad at all. I was more focused and had more of a drive and motivation to get my work done. The deadlines were spread out as well so I was able to get my work done in a timely fashion. There were no technical problems. Whenever I needed help my professors and my advisor were just an email away. This was a drastic change for everyone but it in the end, I got through it and succeeded."
Freshman,5,My experience at Gordon State College is amazing the professors are straight-forward and if you need any help take advantage of their office hours. The staff is friendly they greet who ever they see. There would be nothing I would change at Gordon State College.
Sophomore,5,"When I first attended Gordon State College and living on campus, I enjoyed the campus life. The environment made me feel welcomed and comfortable. I've meet new people, loved my courses and made new friends. I encounter a new perspective of independence and learning how to survive on my own as a college student to make my own decisions in life. If I could change anything, I would probably want more majors for the school"
Sophomore,5,Gordon state is a good college. Great learning experience and great professors and staff. They are willing to help you with anything you need. I enjoy being here.
Sophomore,5,"Gordon is a small school, but a wonderful one.  I will graduate with two associates degrees at the end of this semester and will transfer, but I will be truly sad to leave it.  GSC is a fantastic starting point for students of all backgrounds."
Sophomore,5,It’s a nice small close knit college if that’s the type of thing you like. It’s kind of in the middle of no where but the convenient stores are within walking distance but if a Walmart is what you’re looking for you’ll need a car.  I’ve enjoyed the sense of community you can have many friends or be an introvert it’s so small but big at the same time
Sophomore,5,It's nice to attend a college where the professors actually want to teach. The staff there will even assist you in transferring to other schools if that was your primary objective in the first place. There are even stories from previous students that missed the campus and the classes due to them being over-prepared after they transferred. If you want a nice school with good people and a welcoming atmosphere Gordon state college is the place to go.
Freshman,5,"I like Gordon State College, because its a small college and the professors care about the students."
Sophomore,5,"So far I have had an awesome experience with this college. I am currently enrolled now and plan on graduating with a Bachelor's from this college, as their nursing program has just been accredited again for high performance. Gordon state college is very nice and affordable.  I am thankful for this opportunity. My duty is to serve others."
Sophomore,5,When I first got there I was excited because it was my first time on my own but in reality its just like high school only you get to choose what your schedule is like.
Alum,5,I love Gordon State College! I transferred from another school and couldn't have been any happier. The professors are all so caring about your education and your well-being. They go above and beyond to make sure you understand the content and connect you with community resources. The campus is beautiful and the class sizes are perfect!
Junior,5,Best professors. They take time to help you. Classes are smaller so easier to learn. Easy to get involved in different clubs and the student government. Your advisor is always easy to get in touch with. They have rec rooms on every floor of the dorm buildings. The campus security is great at keeping the students safe. You have the chance of being a RA which helps you save on your total cost of schooling.
Niche User,5,"The campus is very nice , the teachers helps you the lunch is great. ,you have a place to go to do your work , its very peaceful and quiet. The professors are great."
Sophomore,5,"As a girl from a totally different country, there a lot of different people you meet in the school and they treat you the same. The professors are always ready and willing to answer every question you have."
Niche User,5,"greatThere are some really great programs at Gordon, like ministries, education and sciences but there are some programs that could use work as well like the business program. Find out from students currently in the major what they think of classes and professors in that field because those are the classes and teachers you'll be learning from"
Niche User,5,Gordon State is always on top of everything and someone is always there to assist you whether its on the phone or in person and they always get the job completed
Freshman,5,I am currently enrolled in Gordon State College. It is an excellent school to attend. There are plenty of activities and you are able to meet a diversity on people on campus.
Senior,5,I truly enjoy attending Gordon State College. I love the home town feel. The atmosphere  is relaxed. The college offers regular activities.
Sophomore,5,"My time at Gordon State College was really good. I got to stay in my own room and made some new friends while I was living in the dorms. I even participated in club activities that helped me get connected to other people. While Gordon was a great school to live in, it wasn't without its challenges. There were some things I struggled with, mainly writing papers that required approximately 1,000 words. I was good at math but that didn't meant I knew just about everything because I sometimes had trouble understanding the problems and would always seek tutoring advice from another person. Even though I didn't do as well as I hoped, I still had fun while I was at there."
Sophomore,5,"The staff and teachers, and how much they are willing to help you succeed. They food is great, breakfast is best and the droms are amazing to stay in I say everyone should stay on campus"
Sophomore,5,"Gordon State College can be described as simply a hidden gem. It offers smaller sized classrooms where each student can have the opportunity to have their individual needs met. Because of the school's smaller size, it also means smaller tuition but at the same time, over 90% of all professors possess a PhD. Big value with small, hometown appeal."
Freshman,5,Its easy to find where you need to go and everybody is so helpful. The campus is beautiful and the professors are amazing.
Alum,5,"I loved being at Gordon. Its super cheap and the classes can be very good, depending on the professor. The biology labs are nice, and the campus is small enough to easily get around. I got a bachelors degree in 4 years without a dime of debt, so I really am very happy."
Freshman,5,I love how Gordon is willing to help my any means possible. Also I would love to see the price change for housing.
Freshman,5,"IT WAS GREAT, VERY IMFORMATIVE, I LEARNED A LOT GREAT SCHOOL. I RECOMMEND TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR A SCHOOL. gREAT STAFF VERY FRIENDLY."
Freshman,5,I personally feel that Gordon State is amazing college. The staff  is very hands on with their students.
Junior,5,I have been going to Gordon for three years now and I have really enjoyed my time here. I love the fact that it is a small school and professors can give their students more attention because of that. I love living on campus because my friends live there and the dorm rooms are very nice. There are also plenty of activities each day.
Freshman,5,I have a good experience in Gordon State College. I experienced how to be an adult. College is important for me and leaving the house was hard decision for me. Well first month was hard but than thank you to Gordon State College for activities that actually give me ability to participate in them.
Freshman,5,"It is a small campus, with a homey, comfortable environment. Not great parking, but still a great college. Teachers are excellent and friendly, and do what they can to help you. The campus police building is very close and well equipped and excellent. There are many clubs to participate in, and the sports are great, although I would love it so much if Gordon would create a volleyball team."
Niche User,5,"Gordon State College is a beautiful, wide campus with a great student body and amazing, patient professors. It only needs a little help with the security around the parking lots."
Freshman,5,i will be a freshman at Gordon state college in january. and its the best decision i have ever made. i took a gap year after i graduated high school and i was worried about money and the cost for college. But the advisers at Gordon helped me a lot  and walked me through the difficult steps.
College Junior,5,All of my professors thus far have been excellent; excpet for one or two maybe. The quality of the courses are great. The professors know their course and are able to teach them well.
College Junior,5,"The teaching staff is really supportive, for the most part, and are there to help. My advisor, personally, is one of the beat and she really set me up for success with my classes. She was able to let me know the classes I needed without confusion or discouragement. With her help I was able to get everything I needed to enter the Nursing Program in the right time frame! I wouldn not want to attend any other college."
College Sophomore,5,Small classes allow you to get the interaction and the help you need from professors and peers.
College Sophomore,5,they helped me to the direction of a major that really benefited me for my future.
College Sophomore,5,the teachers are really caring and they helped me get through this semester .
College Sophomore,5,I enjoyed myself during my time here . I will do it all again .

College Freshman,5,I have no complaints about my experiences at GSC.
College Freshman,5,Not too much work is given and the work is fairly simple. Online courses are perfect for those who do not wish to commute to campus.
College Freshman,5,Nursing professors are helpful when it comes to putting graduates in the workforce.
College Freshman,5,"Class sizes are smaller than most, so professors are able to help students one on one."
College Freshman,5,"Seeing that most students are guaranteed a job immediately after graduation, especially nursing students, this is a great place to earn a degree."
College Freshman,5,There are great professors at Gordon State College and they are passionate about teaching us.
College Freshman,5,"Gordon State College has a beautiful campus, great teachers, and is located in a small town. Also, most nursing graduates are guaranteed a job after graduating."
College Sophomore,5,"There are a wide range of times and spaces available , but one must be ready to get the class the day the online registration begins, otherwise it is slim pickings"
College Sophomore,5,"The Nursing Program is the best around. Amazing mentors and professors, you have to study all the time and it is difficult to balance social, school, and work life, but is an amazing opportunity for someone who is willing to work hard to be in the healthcare field."
College Freshman,5,Allows you to learn at your own pace. The workload is much more manageable while working and trying to attend classes. There isn't much student professor or peer-to-peer interaction. The classes offered online are not a big variety. They also fill up fast so if you are low on your credit hours (how they do registration)you will probably not get the class you want.
College Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Gordon. Gordon is in a small town and it reminds me of my childhood. The students are nice. The faculty and staff are so helpful and if they don't have the information you need they send you to someone who does. I was honestly scared to start college, but all my professors seem to be great people! So far my experience has been great!"
College Junior,5,I love going to college
College Junior,5,College has really gotten me out of my shell. I love it.
College Junior,5,"I love everything on campus. We just got a new student recreation center, and we're also getting a new library."

College Freshman,5,When picking clsses ffor the next semster you can build it around anything. theres so many options.
College Freshman,5,My first semester was great but now i want to stay on campus so i would need more money.
Freshman,4,Gordon is improving on its technical difficulties. Has gone to extensive measures during COVID-19 to make it more safe to attend classes and college overall. Difficult dealing with staffers in office areas. If you leave a voicemail they will never return a call or probably look at it. Overall alright and a decent price.
Freshman,4,"I had to finish my spring semester of 2020 online because of COVID-19. I enjoy the online environment. Teachers have a layout of the whole schedule ahead of time. There are multiple options for online ranging from hybrid (1/2 online, 1/2 in person) ecore, and GSC online courses."
Sophomore,4,I could see communication changing for the better. The set up of Gordon is amazing. The teachers are amazing!
Junior,4,"I love how small classes are because it allows professors  to have more one on one time with their students, allowing them to effectively teach the material in their courses."
Sophomore,4,"I like that Gordon State College has a very small, hometown feel. The campus is small & makes for a very connected, safe environment. You can walk to a lot of places you need to go in town because the college is right in the middle. The buildings are relatively new looking & pretty & provide a lot of room to study & focus on academics. The professors, as a whole, are very focused on their students & always want them to succeed & be their best. The food options on campus could be a little more diverse. It would be really nice to see more options. The dorms are nice & very accommodating. You are able to control a huge portion of how you live & what you want your living experience at Gordon State to be like. Overall, I’ve been very pleased with my experience thus far here at Gordon State."
Freshman,4,I like that it is small enough to feel like a family. The professors help you.  The athletics are great at Gordon. There is not much to do in Barnesville but it is still a nice atmosphere.  Their is a high number of commuters here.  The school could be more diverse. Minorities either way to me is not good.  Athletics are very good.  The baseball team and softball team are outstanding in the state as well as the nation.
Niche User,4,"Once you are in, it's relatively easy to get the classes you want. The campus is really safe. Just don't go to the dorms. They smell like weed."
Freshman,4,Gordon State College is a excellent school that prides it's institution in helping students achieve good grades and excel it's student's in their major work. The environment around the school is very country like and there are not many distractions so a student can focuses on their work.
Junior,4,I am a nursing major at Gordon State college.  The school is small so you can walk to your classes you will not get lost! It is also  easy for you to get to know everyone on campus. The professors are helpful and they want you to succeed. Gordon also offers resources to help you succeed in your classes such as a tutoring service.
Freshman,4,"Well I haven't started yet. I start on the 12th of August.  I actually go to Fort Valley State University but im a student at Gordan State college. Its a program for the students who met partial of the requirements to be accepted into FVSU. Im not a full time student yet, but I will be next year once I move up to the next level."
Freshman,4,"Friendly, helpful faculty and staff.  Small classes in which students get more individual guidance.  Beautiful campus. Just had a tour of the campus and enjoyed every inch of the campus. From the class sizes to the dorms. They provide a affordable tuition with everything you need to succeed."
Freshman,4,Some of the best professors call this place home. Professors there are flexible for each students academic need. Professors are kind and not afraid to challenge you academically.  The student body and officers are kind and welcoming. I took a tour of the campus recently and they were willing to stay in touch to slowly guide me into the normal life of a student. They have a terrific drama department. They have monthly productions put on by the drama department. The campus is beautiful.  The grounds are well cared for and safety is a big concern. The keep parents well informed concerning the safety of the campus with weekly emails and a email chain you can chose to join. It is a great and cheap place to retain an education. I plan to obtain a bachelors degree from this fine establishment. It is local and affordable. I have a good 30 minute commute from where I live but i would not trade it.
Sophomore,4,"As though in the middle of nowhere, it is a pretty decent school. Classes are easy compared to other schools. Hard on the curfew."
Junior,4,I love Gordon! There is a great atmosphere and the student life is fun. The professors are very easy to talk to and are always willing to help with whatever you need. The community is also very nice and friendly. It is a great community college.
Sophomore,4,"Gordon State College has relatively small class sizes, which makes it easier to get better interaction with professors. The campus is well kept, and many student activities are offered throughout each semester."
Freshman,4,"They have nice dorms,the campus was very nice and to go back to.It is a school you would want to go to for nursing.The food was good and nice to eat .In would say the campus is really safe.I don't know much about it because I only took a tour I don't go there.It is definitely a school I would go to for my  major."
Freshman,4,This school is amazing for these two and four year degrees. The program brother 2 brother and African American male Initiative program are amazing. It was great opportunity to look into and I will like to keep working at the  community service.
Niche User,4,"Gordon is a good college, and the professors are very friendly. The professors take time to answer questions, and explain things very throughly. The students that go to Gordon help one another."
Sophomore,4,"I love how the professors are willing to work with you if you are struggling with their class. As long as you are trying, they will find a way to help you succeed. They are very good at hosting student activities that are enjoyable for everyone. They have tutors for every student needs to help the students be able to succeed. I think that Gordon should add more classes to the McDonough campus for students who have trouble making it to the Barnesville campus. Overall going to Gordon has been a great experience."
Niche User,4,"I had a really good experience at Gordon. The parking is not bad. It is in a small town but I think that is good. Especially for a new college student because a big, new town could be very overwhelming. The small town feel is easier to get accustomed to."
Alum,4,"Gordon was, indeed, a very stressful 2 1/2 years. However, I made a lot of great memories that I will hold dear to my heart. I have met some very humble and sweet individuals, and I have also met some mean and bitter individuals, but I personally feel that if I have never met any of these people, my life at Gordon would not have been as interesting."
Junior,4,I'm  a nursing student at Gordon on my way to my 3rd semester. Gordon is very competitive and diverse. The campus is beautiful and the cafeteria food isn't bad either. I've had one issue and that was that my financial aid hours ran out and the financial aid department advised me 2 weeks ahead of time to come up with thousands of dollars. All on all this is an excellent school.
Alum,4,"Gordon State College is good for students who want to achieve an education at an affordable cost. The faculty/staff are very helpful and attentive to your needs when it comes to the completion towards your degree. I love how the school is very close knit meaning that in whatever class that you choose to attend (especially the ones that pertains to your major) you tend to develop a special bond with your professors and classmates. Some of the classes that I have attended with certain professors they teach you a lot that could help benefit you throughout your college career along with possibly your future career.  As for changes, I personally don't see any that need to be made at all."
Freshman,4,We need more diversity at the college. It feels as if we lack of more cultures from different countries their as if it's slowly turning itself to a party school.
Sophomore,4,"I love Gordon. The size of the school is perfect for people who are looking to get the college experience but not at a huge university. It can get a little tricky walking to class and having to sometimes dodge mowers and such, but that’s an insignificant problem. Gordon also has plenty of majors to choose from, even though it is know for its nursing program."
Alum,4,"Gordon has small class sizes. And boasts an intimate campus experience. It is very inexpensive, paired with quality academic programs. The nursing program is one of the top nursing programs in the state. Gordon is one of Middle Georgia’s best colleges. I’m always proud to be a Gordon College Alumni."
Freshman,4,"I love that the campus is really small and quaint and quiet. Everything is so beautiful when walking to class. The only thing I would change is the disposition of the professors. Many are really happy to be teaching, which shows, but many are also obviously unhappy and take it out on the students. I have heard several students refused help in math classes, when they obviously need it, which really scares me as a new freshman."
Freshman,4,My experience with Gordon State College was like smooth sailing because this is a small college and you will find everything you are looking for. There are many majors you can choose from. A highly recommended major is biology. This college is perfect for a nursing major as well because it has a great two year program with a guarantee job in the end.  If I could change something about this college then it would be to add a dental program to their system. What I really love about this college is that the tuition is low but the quality is high.
Freshman,4,"I love the college here, but I wish there was more too do. I stay here for most of the week and then go back home because there is nothing interesting going on. I don't mean like crazy parties or anything i don't do those. The campus is very lovely and the people are friendly and easy to talk too for the most part as well."
Sophomore,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed all of my classes with Gordon. There is a wide variety of courses to choose from and the professors are very helpful. I wish they had more courses to choose from that are approved for dual-enrollment students but other than that, Gordon is very good starter school or 4-year school."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy being at Gordon. It's a very exciting school because a lot goes on. They keep the students very interacted and involved as far as school activities. One change I would like to see is more students.
Sophomore,4,I believe Gordon State College is a great school. Their professors work with you when you need assistance and they provide many study halls and groups on campus to assist you.
Niche User,4,Gordon State is a great college for those who wish to strive for excellence. The professors push you to continually improve upon self and encourage you to reach beyond your limits.
Freshman,4,The academic part of the school is great. What is lacking is the surrounding area of the college. Not much around the campus besides a couple of fast food restaurant closest Walmart is 30 mins away.
Sophomore,4,"Gordon State is a very resourceful school. All of the free resources from tutoring to internship opportunities are really a great help. I really love the diversity and all of the extracurricular activities there as well. The campus is very beautiful and clean, plus it’s really close to town so u doesn’t really need a car unless you want to go out. The teachers are very kind and helpful and they really are all for the students there, their all for giving individuals an equal chance at education. The food is very good; it’s a lot of diversity when it comes to that as well."
Junior,4,Gordon Professors work with the students because they want them to succeed. I returned to college after many years of being out and I could not have asked for a better experience. 
College Junior,4,"Job prospects are vast, especially with the degree that I am pursueing."
College Junior,4,"This definitely depends on your major. For nursing students that make it theough the program, they are pretty much gauranteed a job offer after graduation. I can not personally speak for the other majors."
College Junior,4,"It definitely is not the easiest of degrees to pursue but, it the end it will be worth all the work, long hours and study sessions. Nursing has been my passion since highschool and this program is going to set me up for success."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, it has been a great experience and I'm looking forward to continuing my education"
College Sophomore,4,The workload seems like it is a lot more than in a traditional classroom but it's not difficult.
College Sophomore,4,I think that it's great.  The quality education is something you can't beat.
College Sophomore,4,It's a lot to juggle but nothing you can't handle.
College Sophomore,4,It's small campus makes it easy to get from class to class and the small classroom sizes make it easier to get one on one time with teachers and get the help you need.
College Sophomore,4,I work through school and my extra activities .
College Sophomore,4,i have taken online classes before but not here . they were just just like the real thing . and i love it .
College Sophomore,4,"I love the food . The teachers are awesome . the community is very welcoming . There were many school events that i loved involving myself in . i love this school , so much ."
College Sophomore,4,"Some professors are a bit over the top, but all in all most of them will work with you in any way they can."
College Sophomore,4,Haven't yet dealt with internship or job prospects but I have heard that Gordon is great working with you to get a job in the field you major in.
College Sophomore,4,"It is a great low cost school that offers a good bit of degrees, the Nursing Program is super tough, but is the best on Georgia. Amazing school."
College Senior,4,It has been awesome for me not to big not to little perfect!
College Senior,4,They are all usually helpfull when you need them.
College Senior,4,It has been tuff but worth it.
College Freshman,4,The professors are usually willing to work with you and help you do your best. The curriculum is just a review from high school.
College Junior,4,I had a very good experience with an online coarse. Everything was user friendly and the teacher explained very thing and responded to questions in a decent amount of time.
College Junior,4,I love the class size. The teacher knows your face and it's more of a individual connection.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The professors are knowledgeable about the subject, and will work with you to help you understand the information."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Gordon is a good college. The parking situation could be better, but the exercise that you get when you walk to class is good. The professors really try to help you learn and understand the material. The staff is very welcoming and helpful. For a four year college, the price and education are worth it."
College Senior,4,I have only been at Gordon for the nursing program so I can't accurately evaluate this area
College Senior,4,I am a nursing student. Stress is my life right now but most of the professors are great at helping. The work load is what you would expect from a nursing program
College Freshman,2,The classes I need are always on days and times that I work. I have to rearrange my work schedule or go completely out of my way for the classes that I need for my Major.
College Senior,2,"This is a very small school in a very small town in the middle of nowhere.  The school is trying to be better and be more appealing to students and employers, but they are not quite there, yet.  I am in my sophomore year of school and have not needed to attend Graduate Symposiums or Career Day as those are only for Senior year students.  The science fields are very good at this school, so if you want a degree in Nursing or Biology, it's a good course fr employment."
College Senior,2,"At my school, a large percentage of students dress inappropriately and appear to be at school for the sole purpose of socializing with everyone else.  Student behavior is everything one would expect from an 8-yr-old child: rude, immature, disrespectful, unaccomplished, and lack discipline.  There is a wide range of economic statuses and political views.  As far as ethnicity goes, most people are either white or black, with a few hispanics.  Most students are proclaimed baptists, methodists, or atheists, although most religions are represented at my school."
College Senior,2,My experience with online class were horrible.
College Freshman,2,There is nothing unique or interesting about our school that sets us apart
College Junior,2,I could have have money to another school of I knew I want going to be living On campus. 
College Sophomore,2,Hard to find online or classes to work around work
College Sophomore,2,Is confusing for a transfer from out of state
College Sophomore,2,"Currently Gordon college dose not have any major career services, nor have a large job prospects as this college is more of a transfer college; However, we do have a large alumni network."
College Junior,2,"Gordon is what you make it. You have to make yourself have fun. I feel like we get treated like kids here. Honestly, i feel like i am in high school all over again. Thats why its time for me to transfer."
College Junior,2,I feel like the dorms shouldnt cost as much since they are not fully furnished with everything. My balance with school have been on top of the roof since i came here in fall 2010.
College Junior,2,There are uneven student body in my school.  There are about 75% black population and 3% Asian population
College Junior,2,Need more computer labs with more available computers.
College Junior,2,very small. Nursing needs more openings for more students to get accepted each semester.
College Senior,2,The students are doing all the same thing and very little diversity.
College Senior,2,Simple College – It is a community college that all the metro Atlanta people go to. I can't say that there are things that Gordon has that sets it apart from other colleges except the immense school spirit the students have athletic events.
College Senior,2,Intelligent Professors – Overall I have professors that have their masters degree which makes me confident with the material I am learning.
College Sophomore,2,"Needs Some Work – I can tell that my college is trying to improve their facilities but they are not  foucusing on the important things like the cafeteria,gym and dorm rooms. Those places seem to look a little ran down."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Live on Campus – Most of the people that attend dont live on campus, they comute. When the people that live on campus  there and the weather is nice then the campus is live. Usually most people go home duriing the weekend."
College Sophomore,2,The Career Oppotunities at Grodon College. I do not really know of a career center on campus. I was only told about one semenar about career opportunites. The only people who are told about their career oppotunities are the nursing students and the early childhood education majors.
College Student,1,There are no post-grad services available at Gordon. 
College Sophomore,1,"Tuition is great because it is very cheep; However, the Financial Aid is a waste of time and the only reason I rate a D is because people in there."
College Freshman,1,"Through email you may get a hold of your teacher, if you're lucky. When I call the offices i've been on hold for 20 minutes. And their office hours are rarely ever, ""flexible."""
College Junior,1,I am a minority at my school and I feel like it affects me academically.
College Senior,1,The administration system is always messing something up. They constantly lose paper work or do not have an answer for anything.
College Junior,1,"Unless you're tech savvy, they're very hard to keep up with and to learn from."
College Sophomore,1,Classes Aren't Meant for Leaning – Being an occupational therapist I expected my classes to focus on my major. The classes I took did not teach me things I need to know about being an occupational therapist. I expected to be taught about my major but it seems as if I'm in high school just taking classes again.
Recent Alumnus,1,"...I would have gotten better grades in high-school so that I would not have had to go to Gordon College, but the hard truth is that I graduated from high school with a lackluster GPA and was sentenced to 2 long years in Barnesville, Georgia as a result."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Pushed Aside – If you're not a nursing or early childhood education student at Gordon College, you are pretty much overlooked. Since a bachelor's degree isn't offered for psychology majors, it isn't really of the school's concern to serve your needs. You are your own advisor- the only thing this school does for other students is offers an associate's degree."

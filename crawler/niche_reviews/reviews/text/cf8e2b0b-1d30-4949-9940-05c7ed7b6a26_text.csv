Alum,5,My online experiences were excellent and the professors were helpful in ensuring that the academics were the same as they would have been if they were face-to-face.

The food is fantastic and the dorms are the perfect size and very well maintained."
Alum,5,"I am an alumni (Class of 2016) and would recommend this institution to anyone looking for a small-town, cozy college experience. Millersville has a few niche majors like Ocean Sciences, Occupational Safety, & Meteorology. These majors definitely brought students in from across the nation and offered strong career opportunities. 

Overall, I enjoyed my professors. I graduated with a Sociology degree with a Criminology concentration and minored in both Spanish and Athletic Coaching. I found all of my departments staff, with the exception of a couple, to be caring and helpful!

There were multiple on-campus jobs and the size of the institution allowed for multiple avenues to get involved. Partying was not very prevalent unless you looked for the party scene. Regardless of individual involvements, I found all students to be welcoming and inviting!"
Niche User,5,"My experience was absolutely amazing, everyone was so friendly and helpful. The campus is outstanding, everywhere is so well kept and beautiful. The food is amazing and the students are taken care of so well."
Sophomore,5,"I was a transfer student of Elizabethtown College, and I am glad that I made this transfer. Millersville University opened my eyes to so many new things and for once, I feel that I have found my place. The professors here are amazing and really understanding and the students are very welcoming and supportive. I have met some of the best people in my life here and I am so glad that I chose Millersville University to be college. They have great benefits for the students and financial aid to transparent and honest."
Junior,5,This is the best school ever. Every since I first took a tour of campus I knew that this place for me and now that I am a junior that has still stood true and I absolutely love it here.
Sophomore,5,Overall this school has been a awesome experience so far and I love it. I've made many good friends and love my classes. The food in the dining halls is nothing to complain about and the dorms are really nice. There are always events happening during the week and weekend so there is always something to do if your bored.
Freshman,5,I'm currently a Freshman here at Millersville and so far the experience for me has been great. Everyone is extremely friendly and my professors are really helpful and have a passion for what they are teaching. The dorms and food in the dining halls is great and you probably cannot get better food than what they offer here.
Niche User,5,My experience when I visited Millersville University of Pennsylvania was amazing since they were very welcoming and they have an amazing campus. I would not want to see any changes in the campus since there was nothing wrong when I went there it looked extremely cleaned.
Freshman,5,"Personally, me I think that the professors are outstanding and want you to succeed in every possible way. The food options are widespread and you almost can't get any more than there is. I felt it was very easy with getting to know people and the campus. Dorms are all mostly very clean and modern and are only a few years old."
Junior,5,I love Millersville University! I transferred from a different university and Millersville felt so much more like home. I made new friends and got used the campus quickly. There's nothing I dislike about this university.
Freshman,5,"I am starting Millersville University in the fall 2019...my first feeling on campus was peace.  The campus is peaceful, clean and just a calming setting.  I felt at home.  I am so excited to start school next month!! I hope it truly is all that I am looking forward to it being !!! Class of 2023!"
Sophomore,5,"My freshman year of Millersville was so good! I was involved in a campus ministry called The Navigators which allowed me to make great friends, have fun, and be involved in extracurricular activities. I think Millersville should include healthier options of food. I commute, but whenever I forgot lunch there was hardly any healthy options to choose from. Overall my first year at Millersville was great. I'm excited to go back this fall!"
Senior,5,"My favorite part about attending Millersville University for 4 years was the cleanliness of the campus. There were never any accidents in the bathrooms, spills in the hallways, and the classrooms were kept neat and clean also. Overall, I would recommend anyone to go to Millersville University."
Sophomore,5,"Coming to millersville has been the best experience of my life. The campus is small enough that everyone feels connected, professors are somewhat respectable and personable, and the surrounding area of lancaster is a great scene for entertainment and art."
Junior,5,"I thoroughly like the campus, and all of the programs Millersville University has to offer. As a current student, going into my junior year, Millersville has been a great outlet for me to realize what I want to do for a career. Without this school, I might not have been in a program that is similar to the Music Business Technology program. Meaning that I probably would not have found out that I want to become a music producer, if making it as a singer/songwriter does not work out for me.
 I would improve how some situations are handled. There are only a certain amount of credited classes that can take part in each building. If a department reaches the maximum credits, classes are moved to an off campus building in Downtown Lancaster, PA. This trip can take twenty to fourty minutes depending on mode of transportation and traffic. It is usually the freshman courses that are held off campus, however, not many fresh have cars on campus."
Sophomore,5,I've had a good time at MU so far. Faculty are very understanding with any issues that may come up and they've all had the time in office hours or even outside appointments to go over work. The food isn't super great but the rest of it is fine.
Niche User,5,"I really loved visiting Millersville. The atmosphere is very welcoming, and the professors are top notch. Plus, the campus is gorgeous!"
Niche User,5,"I just felt like I was in the right place from the moment I stepped on campus for my college visit.  It never stopped being my first choice, even after looking at other schools. I can’t wait to get started at school!"
Freshman,5,"The campus here is very welcoming and friendly. The community is diverse and accepting. The academics are challenging, but to an extent where the student is able to thrive. The campus itself is very beautiful and offers many places for students to go outside and enjoy the scenery. Overall I have had an extremely enjoyable experience here at Millersville University."
Freshman,5,"The art and education program are so amazing. With art, they get your artwork displayed for you to be opened to many opportunities. The art teachers care about you and your growth, as well as your creativity and your story. With art, you get out in the field early on to know that this is what you want to know. The teachers are very helpful, giving you the inside looks of education. Im in art education, so I am surrounded by the best professors, full of so much help and inspiration."
Freshman,5,"So far I have to say it has been great at Millersville. There are constant activities, event or opportunities that happen around campus, though there are many other unexplored places I still have left to uncover. I can see how well I will flourish at my time here at Millersville."
Freshman,5,I would 100% reccomend this school especially if you are an education major! Their program is fantastic! The professors really take time to get to know you and make you feel welcome. Millersville is a home away from home.
Freshman,5,"I really like the dorms, they are great! very spacious, and enough space for people to live for 4 years. I visited and loved how big the campus is but how small the class sizes are, and I really love that"
Freshman,5,"Millersville University of Pennsylvania is an excellent university located right outside of Lancaster, PA. My experience as a freshman thus far has been great. Everyone here is very welcoming and helpful when it comes to adjusting to life on campus. There are upperclassmen, professors and even advisors available for any and all questions that students may have. Millersville is a great place to meet new people and thrive academically. Professors are very willing to help when you may find yourself having a hard time in class. Academic advisors are also a key part of being successful academically while on campus. They will help to guide you in the right direction of which classes to take and making sure that you're taking advantage of all opportunities."
Niche User,5,"My overall experience visiting Millersville during their fall open house was very informative and friendly. I've already been accepted and am more than thrilled to start during the fall of 2019. The faculty and staff were very nice on the open house day, and the students provided me with very helpful information for a incoming freshman. The atmosphere felt very welcoming and the professors offer as much skills as you need to succeed in your desired career."
Freshman,5,Millers ills is a very high spirited university.  They have many activities and clubs to choose from.  I found it very easy to make friends.  Academically the teachers are engaging and I found them to be very helpful when needed.  The campus it perfect for me and has much to offer for my future.  I am a freshman and have enjoyed everything about Millersville and look forward to my next 3 years
Alum,5,"Millersville University changed my life!  I came from a small town with narrow-minded views.  Had it not been for the great education and variety of teaching methods, I am not sure if I would be as open to accepting knowledge and facts.  The professors genuinely cared and helped answer questions when needed."
Niche User,5,"I recently just visited Millersville for an open house and I was impressed with the professors, facilities, dorms and the dining. Everything seemed updated so anyone interested in attending I recommend you check it out!"
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman that grew up going to Penn Manor a school district that Millersville Univesity is located in. Both my parents work here as a cook and custodian that's why I am going to the ""Ville"", and I get an awesome tuition waiver. I practically know where everything is located already. I even know some of the professors by just growing up in the community."
Freshman,5,"Rural and beautiful area.  Great atmosphere, helpful professors, diverse, great opportunities and people, computer labs available for those who need them, and the library has many floors (at least 7) and two of them are quiet floors.  There is a Starbucks shop in the same building of the library."
Sophomore,5,"I came to Millersville as a community college transfer student after considering other colleges in the area (Franklin & Marshall, Elizabethtown College, Lebanon Valley College) and finding that this would be the most affordable option for me while having the most comprehensive program in my intended major (art & design). Academically, Millersville is great for a smaller state school and has a huge variety of offerings; I'm especially excited to pursue an internship or study abroad opportunity.  The campus is really nice and feels completely safe after dark. The faculty in general has been great during the transfer process and are incredibly sweet and friendly. I was a little bit apprehensive about Millersville because I probably wouldn't have applied if I didn't feel my options were so limited, but so far I have nothing bad to say about my experience."
Freshman,5,"I have visited Millersville as a prospective student earlier this summer.  I loved the environment, the helpful staff and students, the campus, and knowing that they take their education seriously. This is certainly a college I would recommend to anyone!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Millersville so far. The academics are everything I could've ever dreamed of. I'm an English education major and I love all of my classes so far. The classroom setting that is provided by my professors is very hands on and intimate, which is good for someone who learns better this way. There are a variety of clubs to join, which is good and MIllersville has a lot of opportunities for students to beef up their resume's. I would recommend this college to anyone."
Freshman,5,"The campus is gorgeous, and it doesn't take too long to get from one side to the other. The people are great, too."
Freshman,5,I liked the atmosphere and how welcoming everyone was. It felt like a place where I could make it my home.
Sophomore,5,"This will be my second year of college and I’m super excited. You have a lot of people who are just super supportive and will offer help without you asking. There’s so many resources on campus and you won’t have a hard time at all. You create your own college experience so whatever you want to do, do it. You can create your own major, organization, sports team, whatever you like. Millersville makes your dreams come true."
Senior,5,"Millersville is a medium sized school, it's big enough to have a lot of different opportunities for students but small enough that you can see a lot of people you know just walking around campus. It's a good community of people."
Senior,5,"I like my professor it was very easy for me to pay attention in class. I learn how to become independent while attending college. I love my major Occupational Safety & Env. Health. Overall these past four years at Millersville University, I learn how to adapt to the school environment."
Alum,5,"My experience at Millersville University has been phenomenal! I have participated in two different organizations (MU Footprints & FUSION Step Team) as an Exec Board Member and have worked my way up to in these organizations and had also begun my own student organization (After School Corps) that focused on student volunteering. In 2016 I was nominated to participate in Millersville University's Homecoming Court and had the privilege of learning about some of the other student leaders from the university. During my time on Homecoming Court my love for the University grew and I was honored and crowned as Millersville University's 2016 Homecoming Queen. Through my many involvements on campus; student organizations, homecoming court, housing employee, and student services employee; I have learned many skills that have been very useful for me professionally."
Sophomore,5,"Millersville is a quality institution for post-secondary education. I'm in an undergraduate program for Technology and Engineering Education, and the professors in my major are all willing to help and they provide the highest of quality in their content areas that really prepares students in the major for teaching in Technology Education. The school itself is highly regarded in this area to the point that there are five or more job offers per student upon graduation of the Tech. Ed. major."
Niche User,5,"Millersville University has offered me more than enough. Millersville has given me access to keep Music a passion along with majoring in what I plan to do with my life, Social Work. Millersville had accessible to me, a tour, a meeting with an admissions counselor, and also meet with a professor to learn more about the department. I was able to access their website and use all the tools they had handy for me to learn more about the college. Through the tough decision, I know Millersville is best for me and is extremely helpful with preparing you to feel comfortable despite all of the nerves."
Freshman,5,I visited Millersville University with my family for an Open House last year. I found the university to be very welcoming and warm. I knew before i left that it was place where i wanted to start my college journey and it was also a place/ community that i wanted to be apart of. There isn't much that i can say about change at the school. Its actually what i've been looking for. My mom is very excited about the school also. I'm glad she loves the school just as much as i do.
Alum,5,"Millersville University offers students a great education at an affordable price. I've been to two other colleges and felt that, out of all of them, Millersville University provided the best educational experience. Professors were both knowledgeable and caring."
Sophomore,5,Millersville University has a great community involvement and atmosphere. The people and the professors are wonderful too.
Sophomore,5,"I am a social work major and i absolutely love the dedication and inspiration that all of my social work professors put into teaching along with their outside of the classroom help and advisement. I am assuming that from who i have meet outside of social work, that Millersville as a whole is a very dedicated and uplifting learning environment."
Sophomore,5,"I recently just transferred to this college, and so far my experience has been great. Even before I was enrolled as a student at Millersville, I thought the campus was beautiful and that the college offered students many different kinds of opportunities."
Junior,5,"Great academics, teachers are amazing. Decent amount of activities for fun and learning. Campus food isn't great and not a ton of surrounding area restaurants."

Niche User,5,When I visited Millersville University it was amazing. It was the best college I have ever visited and I am so excited to live there for the next few years. The Environment is so clean and safe. The people are pleasant and the learning environment is ideal. The surroundings are also very likable. I don't see a need for anything about the university to change.
Freshman,4,I would like covid to end to be on campus. Overall online learning is very simple and the due dates are on a week to week basis.
Freshman,4,Millersville is a really great school. I love it here and would advise you to come here if you're thinking about. The atmosphere of the people and the events are astronomical. You'll have an amazing time with amazing friends all while getting a great education.
Junior,4,"So far due to COVID-19, classes online have not been bad at all. Teachers understand and sympathize with our struggles. They are also very flexible by moving their classes from in school to online. They do both synchronous and asynchronous classes, it all depends the course."
Junior,4,"I enjoy my time at Millersville. There are tons of wonderful people here. They have an excellent library and lots of restaurants around to eat at. The teachers teach exceptionally well, they give good insight on the topics they teach. Many of the teachers will go out of their way to help you too."
Alum,4,"I loved my experience at Millersville University overall. I attended Millersville for my undergrad and earned a BA in Psychology. I came across a lot of passionate and caring professors along the way. Although, a downside to me was that they lack in diversity of the student population. The campus was very safe and parties were intimate, but had a strong sense of community and safeness while still being fun."
Alum,4,Online courses that I took were positive for the most part. I noticed that some professors I had online did not respond as fast to their online courses as they did when I had face-to-face courses with them. Overall it was a good experience.
Sophomore,4,"Millersville makes online learning very easy through their homework page and with the use of zoom for classes that still needed or wanted to meet in person. All the professors, though new to online learning, made the transition very easy and were able to help whenever questions came up."
Sophomore,4,"Millersville is a great choice because of its safety, campus life, events and area it’s located. The dorms are updated and have a very nice amount of space for living in. There’s always something to do on campus whether that be going to the gym or just sitting by the pond."
Junior,4,"My overall experience for online courses is pretty good, the professors explained assignments clearly and were easy to contact and receive a response timely. professors who teach online i feel have more success with students receiving higher grades. 
I have taken a 2 courses online, along with a few courses that incorporated online learning. 
The professors who taught in class and had material online contributed significantly to my success and understanding of course content. the professors who were solely online were great and used the D2L platform effectively and communication has never been an issue with them."
Alum,4,The campus is beautiful which makes walking to classes very enjoyable. Most of the professors that I had throughout my time were very knowledgeable and helpful in my academic success.
Junior,4,"The professors are very knowledgeable and passionate about what they teach. As a bio major, I can say that some labs can be dreadfully boring, however the majority are quite interesting and hands on. Online this university can be a bit over whelming with the amount of work you will receive. Over all, a great college that you can graduate from  confident in the knowledge and skills you've obtained from the courses offered here."
Junior,4,"Keep in mind that I am new to this transition and for many students like me, no one really planned for this big transition. With that being said, I believe the professors handled the situation well and offered lecture vidoes, slides, numerous online office hours, and many links to helpful recourses. The campus has a really nice platform to use for online teaching with either utilizing WeilyPlus or D2L. Both websites are very easy to navigate and are pretty well organized. The work load online can be a bit overy whelming, especially with how many classes you've enrolled in. The majority of the professors are very understanding and lenient when it comes to submission dates. They really understand that as students we're human and we have other stuff outside of college going on from jobs to mental illness which can effect many of us and how well we're able to thrive in this environment. Overall, pretty good online courses."
Freshman,4,"I loved Millersville because they make it feel like a home away from home, a special thanks to the dorm rooms and amazing RA’s. I understand the rules set in place for safety, but the experience is a huge part of going off to college, and they seem to take away a lot of things. Football games are small and fans don’t seem that much into it. Ice Hockey is definitely the best!! Having the option to place intramural sports is incredibly, i was afraid going away to college that I would never be able to play volleyball again. The professors for my major are so caring, they understood the pressure that was put on students with the transition to online."
Freshman,4,"I took 6 classes online. One professor for my science course made the learning easier. Instead of uploading an hour long lecture, he made notecards and slides for us to teach ourselves. It was so helpful. My professors for my major were absolutely wonderful. They took their time teaching us the lesson and allowed us time if we could not complete a paper by the due date due to the pandemic. They really care for their students."
Freshman,4,"Millersville University is an amazing school to go to if you're looking for a good college experience but do not want to go to a huge and far away school. It is a very friendly and loving environment, there is always some activity going on. The dorms are extremely nice and the walks to class are not far at all. I highly recommend going here if you're looking for a milder suburban school but somewhere that still always has action going on on campus and in the town around."
Niche User,4,"Millersville University is located in a small town that is surrounded by little community shops, restaurants and cafes. It has a good student and academic environment that enhances the stay in Millersville."
Sophomore,4,I love Millersville's reputation for being a school that produces good teachers that are prepared for the teaching world after graduation. All of my professors through the education department have been extremely helpful. I've also enjoyed the small class sizes and the effort my professors have put into getting to know us.
Freshman,4,"In the short amount of time that I have attended Millersville, I have found that it is a good place to meet a lot of different people and has a lot of opportunities to get involved around campus. The food is very good compared to other universities and the dorms are bigger and more comfortable then most. One thing that could be improved is the parking situation."
Alum,4,"Millersville University was a great place to go right after some courses I took at a community college.  But, I think like any college, it really is what you make of it. I was able to join a society and really enjoyed my major. I had constant support with my department and even took advantage of the therapy they offered on campus."
Niche User,4,The University cared a lot about its students in the opportunities they offer as well as the clubs. There is diversity in the school and most of the students come from the surrounding area so it may feel very small.
Sophomore,4,"Feels like home. I come from a small town so Millersville is great for me. Great academics, athletics, and peers!"
Sophomore,4,"Millersville offers a variety of resources, however Millersville's status as a liberal arts college can sometimes interfere with the education process. Personally, I felt that all of the gen eds and liberal arts emphasis in the classroom could be very distracting. Other than that, the people are all very nice, there is always some kind of event happening, and the dorms are incredibly nice."
Junior,4,Millersville University has a beautiful campus. The environment is friendly and supportive. There is ample amount of space in the library to get work done and the facilities are clean. I love how everything is in walking distance and it is easy to be on time to classes because of this. The professors know what they are talking about and are always there to help you out. I cannot really think of anything that I would want to change about Millersville University. I have been very satisfied with my experience so far.
Senior,4,"The culture at Millersville is good, and the business administration department can make things such as accounting and taxes interesting due to their professors."
Sophomore,4,"I love Millersville University, the campus is stunning. All the students are very nice and there are so many clubs and activities to get yourself involved and to make new friends. One thing I absolutely love is every professor has there the highest degree in their field of teaching and so they know what they are teaching, also they are very helpful when you need help and or struggling in the class. Through my many involvements on campus in student organizations,  I have learned many skills that have been very useful for me professionally."
Freshman,4,"It's a pretty good school. It's clear that certain changes need to be made, whether in the parking department, older buildings, or some specifically archaic professors. But by and large, I've enjoyed my time here."
Freshman,4,"Millersville University in Lancaster, Pennsylvania offers over 150 Majors with over 50 minors. The school provides many student run organizations that are easy to become a part of. These groups are a great way to bond and make friends on campus especially if you aren't staying on campus. The school offers opportunities for help like tutoring sessions with a student in every major and minor along with one on one student - teacher help. The school also has lots of activities for the student life after school hours such as the typical fraternity parties, outdoor movie nights, and food trucks on campus. If you enjoy lots of opportunities for interactions and success I recommend Millersville university."
Junior,4,"Location-wise, there are a rich variety of activities nearby campus, with Lancaster city just 10 minutes away by car. Campus is small, but beautiful. You have the opportunity to work closely with professors and classmates. My only complaints about the university are the poor-quality dining hall food (you're better off cooking on your own), and lack of communication between the financial aid offices. As a commuting student, I have never felt out of touch with events happening on campus, there are a wide variety of clubs that you can participate in, and there is no shortage of activities."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Millersville University, and have really enjoyed myself so far. My classes have been great and all of my professors have been extremely helpful. I do wish however that there was better communication between the university and the students. There are multiple occasions on which I have been either misinformed or just not given any information at all. Overall though, I am enjoying my experience."
Freshman,4,"Millersville is a great school, it has a very safe and happy campus and always has things going on. I wish they had more activities to do and more clubs but I love mostly everything about it."
Freshman,4,I like the dorms! All of my professors are nice and eager to help me whenever i need it and overall Millersville is a great campus and college.
Senior,4,"The campus is a great size, not to big and not too small.  The university holds a variety of events for students to attend. The suites are relatively new and conveniently located to the main dining hall and student center."
Freshman,4,"Millersville offers an affordable education to Pennsylvania students. The facilities are clean and the library offers a good choice along with group study rooms. Research materials are available through academic sources such as JSTOR. I would like to see newer, or more advanced equipment in the sciences (Biology is my Major) but the equipment they have is standard for a Public college."
Freshman,4,"I love millersville, the campus is stunning! All the students are very nice and there are so many clubs and activities to get yourself involved and to make new friends. One thing I absolutely love is every professor has there highest degree in their field of teaching and so they know what  they are teaching, also they are very helpful when you need help and or struggling in the class."
Sophomore,4,"Millersville University is an amazing school for students looking for a great education with little distractions. The campus is full of brand new or renovated buildings such as the dorms, library, and welcome center. There are a lot of clubs to get involved in, but if you want to focus on school there are plenty of quiet places around campus."
Sophomore,4,Millersville University offers a rural vibe and great academics for the area. Parking for commuters needs to be improved though.
Freshman,4,"Overall, I enjoy Millersville University and there isn't much I would change. The campus is nice and well taken care of, and the area surrounding it is great. It's only a short drive to an area filled with great food and a great community. The dorms are average, but come with many different options to fit your needs. The classes tend to be small, even with required classes. The food is what you would expect from a college, but there are many different choices for whatever your hungry for. I would suggest Millersville for anybody looking for a positive college experience."
Junior,4,Millersville University is an amazing school. It has a nice campus with well known programs in the science and arts fields. It is a medium sized campus so it is less overwhelming to me compared to larger universities.
Freshman,4,"When I took my tour before I decided if I was going to enroll at Millersville University, the staff was very helpful in showing the campus but only talked about academics for a shorter period of time."
Sophomore,4,"I am very excited to be a part of the education program here because it is one of the best in the country. I am quite a shy person, so it's been a little difficult making friends, but I'm looking forward to joining clubs and being more active on campus. I am excited for the future here and after school because I know I will be well prepared for the work force with a degree from here."
Sophomore,4,"Millersville University is a good college with great academics, people, activities, environment, and much more. If you are thinking about joining the Millersville community, it would be a great place to get to know many people."

Senior,4,They have a good education program with a lot of caring and dedicated professors that care not only about what they teach but also who they teach. The campus at night time could use to be better lit so as to create a safe night walk from classes back to the doorms.
Freshman,4,"Campus is beautiful and very safe. There are many emergency posts available if need be, but I have found it to be very safe. Mostly well lit around campus, and smooth layout for walking around."

I also like how interactive and hands-on the education department is with our classes, they really get us out into field experience opportunities to experience firsthand what teaching looks like."
Junior,4,Millersville University is a clean and friendly environment with a multitude of career opportunities. The class sizes are not too big and most of the teachers and staff want to see you succeed. My favorite part about attending Millersville University is the amount of resources that are available to students and it is not limited to educational resources. I am so pleased with the Health Services and counseling center. I recommend everyone to attend Millersville University.
Freshman,4,"I've found that Millersville is a good match for me because all the professors I have had so far have been very helpful and kind, the size of the campus is just right (not too big or too small), and the dorms are very comfortable and I enjoy living in them."
Junior,4,Ask your advisor about dual majors. Not all will tell you. I have many classmates who are in multiple programs but was never explained this in my advisement sessions.
Freshman,4,"I like the overall experience at Millersville University as well as the atmosphere of living in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The transition from high school to college was a very smooth, positive one, as everyone involved in the school and others that I met were all extremely friendly and open to help in any ways that they could. I look forward to spending more semesters here."
Freshman,4,"I like how Millersville has the same small-town feeling that I have back home, there are a lot of family stores and although it's out in the country Lancaster City being nearby is really nice.  The academics are pretty average from what I can tell so far, but it's a state school so that's not a big surprise.  I have had the most experience with the Art, History, and Theater programs so far, and I have to say that all three are very proficient with the Art and Theater programs offering a lot more than I was expecting from a state school that does not specifically focus on one of those fields."
Niche User,4,"I was very impressed with the professors I met they seemed very dedicated to helping the students achieve their goals. The Dorms rooms felt very comfortable and the students were welcoming and friendly. Overall, I felt very comfortable on the campus, it felt like home."
Niche User,4,I was just a frequent campus visitor but the atmoshpere was really nice and laid back. You could tell it was a good school but it wasn't as high pressured as some others.
Freshman,4,My experience here at Millersvillle University has been great it is a very good school.  The only thing I would like to change is the food.
Sophomore,4,"The food will either super suck, or will be fantastic, there is no way to tell each day. There are very few scholarship opportunities available if you lived a regular normal childhood with no traumatic events. There are all new dorms up, which means that for the first few weeks, nothing worked. Super expensive if you don't have any scholarship opportunities."
Freshman,4,I like about millersville is that I see different people that I never seen in my life and I see people who I went to highschool with. Millersville is the safest place I been and everybody show love to everybody
Sophomore,4,"I love Millersville's meteorology program. It's very informative and hands-on. The professors are an all around asset to their students' education. They are helpful, knowledgeable and extremely approachable. The only thing I would want to change is the diversity on campus."
Sophomore,4,I love the professors at Millersville. They are very personable and understanding. All of the professors I have had so far are great teachers and their classes are very beneficial.
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy being a student of millersville. The campus is beautiful.  The campus takes up a large portion of the town.  The students there are all accepting and open to make new connections.  Brand new dorms complete the college.  However the large campus can be tough on traveling but nothing terrible.
Sophomore,4,"I love the atmosphere of the campus. Everyone is so friendly, and upbeat. Everywhere you go, there are students there to educate one another on important topics. The organizations that are available are doing a great job in educating others, and helping peers feel included in making a difference."
Sophomore,4,This college is honestly great. The academic courses and professors prepare you for success in the field of study. I'm a marine biology major and love it.
Niche User,2,"Really not great. No one really seemed passionate about what they were doing, and it felt like you were just going through the motions. There wasn't much in the way of student life, but I went to a few academic clubs, which were alright. Professors were kind of hit-or-miss. The food was pretty unappealing too, and the dorms were just ok."
Freshman,2,"Millersville University is a good school for anyone just looking to go to college. The food is good, the dorms are very nice, and it is very safe. Personally, I was an athlete and a 4.0 student, but had no scholarships or grants. I was told there is nothing to give me, so for that reason I have to leave Millersville and go somewhere cheaper, that will give me a better return on my investment."
Alum,2,"The education major professors for the most part are really good. The general ed. professors lack care of their students in succeeding. They tend to care more about looking smarter than their students, will give lower grades in order to feed their egos. The food is terrible. Don't be surprised if after a few weeks of you start feeling sick all the time. The campus lacks lighting in some areas, they tell you there are at least 2 emergency stations in sight from 1 of them. In most cases this is not true, leaving areas susceptible to possible crimes. I know I was followed at night in one of these suseptable unlight areas. But it was the only pathway to my dorm that got at least some foot traffic on it at night. Better safety measures for those living on campus during winter weather as I have slipped, almost slipped many times on poorly treated sidewalks, roads. Don't be surprised if reverse racism remarks are made by those of ethnicity towards a Caucasian person. Lancaster capus=unsafe!"
Freshman,2,"The academics at millersville are good because most class sizes are small and you'll have the opportunity to have close relationships with your teachers. If you're not interested in having a night life or the big party scene then Millersville is perfect for you. It's very small and quiet, but decent academics. Athletics are not a big part of student life but if you are on  a sports team you will make friends quickly."
College Freshman,2,"I'm a Freshman, but feel like the school isn't taking any interest in what I want my college life to be like. For instance, I want to minor in Spanish and I've told them many times, but they won't put it in my schedule despite the fact that I have room for it. If I'd have know it was going to be this rough I would have applied to Penn State."
College Senior,2,"Greek life is barely existent. Due to local laws in Lancaster, Greek houses do no exist. They are hardly mentioned or known for philanthropy."
College Senior,2,I found that many professors seem to care more about the paycheck and they do students learning. I've experienced teachers who gray so harshly to the point where it's almost impossible for students to pass even if you do all your work
College Senior,2,Overall the students and staff are really nice but many of the teachers outside of the education field are not good at being very open-minded and not having very good munication skills with students. Most of them seem to be very knowledgeable about the subject but expect the  students to be immediately just as knowledgeable as themselves even though the point of taking the class was to learn about the subject. I would not recommend coming back to the school if you're not an education major only because I've had a lot of negative experiences and interactions with professors. They are still really nice people outside the classroom but inside of the classroom I do not feel their teaching skills are very adequate.
College Junior,2,Our football team is literally the worst. I've been here for 2 years and I think we won 2 games total. But the lacrosse team is really good I hear.
College Student,2,"need more perspectives and views, pretty conservative, pretty preppy and bro scene."
College Student,2,everything is a rip off here.
College Freshman,2,Greek life isn't great around campus. I always hear about the money required to participate.
College Sophomore,2,"Field hockey are national champs, football maybe wins one game"
College Sophomore,2,When my boyfriend had an allergic reaction last year we received help but it was very slow they don't take health problems seriously unless it's related to drugs and alcohol.
College Freshman,2,"It is way too expensive to live on campus, especially since they are tearing down the traditional dorms and all that is left are the suites..."
College Freshman,2,"The school gives out scholarships, but it is better to look for independent scholarships. They will be worth more money and easier to get."
College Freshman,2,"Haven't gotten much at all in the way of financial aid. Millersville isn't the most expensive school out there, but I still need a lot of help."
College Freshman,2,"I don't have a meal plan this semester, but the meals I've eaten on campus haven't been great."
College Freshman,2,"I have never had a bad situation with the administration. However, I am basing this rating on the fact that almost every time I park I see someone get ticketed. Tickets are $50 and students are only given a week to pay anything back and that is outrageous. Students are broke enough as it is and should not be ticketed over such a small issue."
College Freshman,2,The process for financial aid was a hassle and they didn't give as much as I had hoped even though I'm in great financial need. Fall 2015 was horrible because I was never told I needed additional forms or how to clear my schedule so classes were almost dropped. The only tip to give is to fill out the forms as early as possible to prevent classes from being dropped.
College Senior,2,the parties are weak on campus so you have to go downtown
College Freshman,2,I had no help with the financial aid process.
College Junior,2,Parties almost every weekend but not of very good quality.
Recent Alumnus,2,"You have to go to Lancaster City to partake in the Nightlife, and that requires either taking the bus and a cab home or a DD. There's nothing in the town of Millesville except a single crowed expensive bar and a pizza shop that also sells beer. A cab ride one way is anywhere from $20 to $32. The Village on Wednesday is the most popular college hangout, and Lancaster City has a variety of clubs and bars."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Many people leave on the weekends, and usually people are clicky in general."
College Sophomore,2,Every other week it seems we are notified about a rape...
College Sophomore,2,ALot of work with little help from professors
College Sophomore,2,Good places are far away and what we have nearby are greasy pizza places.
College Freshman,2,the price is expensive for college students
College Freshman,2,The parking permit is very expensive.
College Freshman,2,I do not participate in nightlife activities.
College Freshman,2,It is internal transportation only.
College Freshman,2,They should offer an individual laptop for each student.
College Freshman,2,It is expensive to have a meal at campus.
College Freshman,2,"The snow has been horrible, we've missed a lot of class at the beginning of this semester. The school also has pretty poor drainage so there are always tons of very deep puddles which is highly inconvenient."
College Freshman,2,"I should not have chosen Biology as my major. I'm not good at math or science. That was on me, however. I knew that the biology program was difficult from the get-go."
College Student,2,It seems nearly impossible to get financial aid unless you know someone who is in charge or has a part in distributing aid.
College Student,2,The Wi-Fi on campus goes out several times a month. The library computers are always occupied or out of order.
College Student,2,"Academically, I love my school and it was the right decision. I know this school is the best thing to put me on the track I want to be on in order to achieve my career goals of becoming a teacher. However, I have a lot of trouble fitting in because I feel as though if you don't party you don't belong. Also, I have had a lot of roommate trouble and the university has been less than helpful with this situation."
College Junior,2,I don't know why this school  is so lame. I'm over it.
College Senior,2,Greek life is low key on campus
College Sophomore,2,There is not much team spirit on campus but the facilities for non-atheletes are good. 
College Sophomore,2,I don't love the dining at Millersville because of the low quality and high prices.
College Sophomore,2,Millersville's uniqueness is in it's quality education for a good price. 
College Sophomore,2,The school is fairly strict.
College Sophomore,2,"For some reason, millersville is a giant puddle. Everyone should buy rainboots and an umbrella before coming to Millersville. Most sidewalks and parking lots flood when it rains. "
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is pretty obsolete on campus. There are numerous fraternities and sororities available to join. The most well known one is TKE. The university does not give them any special housing. Greek life members either live in the dorms or rent off campus apartments. Occasionaly you will see them partaking in community service, but it is nothing major. There is a persistant joke on campus that whenever someone joins a frat it just means they are paying to have friends."
College Sophomore,2,"The sports at MU are okay. But the football team is awful! Not to many people go to games. It is a part of campus life, but by no means is it a big part of campus life. No one really talks about it that much. But the school gym is amazing for those who like to work out."
College Junior,2,"There are not enough healthy options, such a vegan or Salad Works"
College Freshman,2,"theres never a good party
cops always bust
just dumb highschool type activities "
College Sophomore,2,"They need to have more food variety. Also, I've been getting food poison too often after I came to Millersville. "
College Freshman,2,There are usually crowds of people trying to find a parking spot however there are many parking spots. 
College Freshman,2,"Many freeze warnings, flood alerts and floods."
College Sophomore,2,Millersville University is strict about some things and not about others. Parking is very strict. Any time you park anywhere without a permit you are almost guaranteed to get a fine. Drinking is fairly strict as a lot of students do get under ages and in trouble for it but it isn't an everyday thing.
College Junior,2,"It's not great (especially compared to my high school), but it was actually better than I thought it would be."
College Junior,2,Most people are smart about using in public and about using at all. Not many people do drugs at all and very few do visibly. Millersville has a decently strict policy on drugs and alcohol use and enforce it well.
College Junior,2,"There is Greek Life at Millersville, but it's not a huge thing. The sports teams events (related to the sport or unrelated to the sport) have more of a dominance that Greek Life events. The sorority's and frats do have there own housing. They are also very involved in campus events."
College Sophomore,2,"The meal plans are kind of a rip off and the food is relatively average. There aren't really any other options besides the school's food unless you want to take a 10 minute drive to other places. Although annoying, the food situation won't ruin your experience."
College Junior,2,Course availability is lacking. As well as course sections and selections of professors. There not to many spots you can find to study at and the library is still underconstruction ever since i started.
College Freshman,2,"The food is all right on some days, but often falls short of expectations.  The dining hall hours are the real problem. It seems they are closed more often than they are open."
Alum,1,"Great school if you are a traditional female student otherwise PLEASE AVOID!  
At the time I graduated, this school had no interest in upholding state and federal law.  In addition, they spent over $6 million of their own money on stupid solar projects (with oil prices around $20/barrel) instead of improving student life in rational ways."
Junior,1,"Yo this school is terrible socially. Nothing goes on here, everyone from ville goes to shippensburg, west chester, or temple every weekend because we dont do anything."
Alum,1,"Would rate 0 stars if I could.  College administrators with PHDs behave themselves as vindictive teenagers.  In addition, they have no regard for law or the school's written polices."
Freshman,1,"Nothing to do on or off campus, no sense of community. Come here if you're looking for the worst time of your life."
Freshman,1,"I went into my first year here thinking it was the start of one of the best years of my life and had a very open mind keeping a friendly and positive attitude.  It was only about a week in I realized that my fellow students had all given up!  Nobody Cares!  There is no student life!  well the food is good at least...  Other then that however the only things you will find here are mediocrity at it's finest, people who will casually explain to you why they are smarter and better than you and the reason for lack of evidence is simply because they don't try, but above all ignorance I had a speech professor name Gerard Igor a complete joke of a professor who would not allow even politically moderate speech topics because after all ""the republicans freed the slaves"".  PLEASE SAVE YOUR TIME GO SOMEWHERE ELSE ANYWHERE ELSE I DID AND MY LIFE IS SOOOOO MUCH BETTER FOR IT."
College Freshman,1,"If you want to work at a local, small business, then this a great place for you. But if you want to get as high up as you can, good luck. This school is great for the local economy but when it comes to the global economy, good luck."
College Junior,1,"The dorms are horrible. Bugs in the bathroom, no heat in some buildings."
Recent Alumnus,1,Greek's don't really contribute much.
College Freshman,1,Campus is very beautiful and nice but not use for activities.
College Freshman,1,"Yes, to get into this program is extremely difficult, you need medical tests, about four different criminal background tests, you need to maintain a average GPA at all times, and if you want to transfer in you need a certain amount of credits already completed as well as signatures from you advisor and the administrator in charge of that major.The need to make the process a lot less complicated!"
College Junior,1,They are building new housing
College Junior,1,This school is just sad
College Junior,1,I do not use night life activities.
College Freshman,1,"Lancaster, is the worst. superrr boring "
College Freshman,1,"Many computers even in lounges however, the library fills up quickly usually people spend hours on one computer, and the computer lab is always filled."
College Sophomore,1,The price for a parking pass is a bit outrageous but there are a lot of parking spots. The mornings are the best to get a good spot near classes but nearly impossible in the afternoon.
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible. The computers are always frozen or not connected to a printer. When you do get one that is functional, there is usually a key missing or one that doesn't work. The kicker is that right at the bottom of the monitor is a little sticker that says, ""Purchased with your MU tech fee."" The printers are just as bad. Rarely will you find a computer lab with even one working printer."
College Freshman,1,"There is a lot of campus security presence, but they are not usually very helpful.  They would rather search for parking violations and detain students on false suspicions of drug use than look out for actual problems such as burglary and assault, which have occurred with more frequency."
College Freshman,1,I have received no help with the coast of tuition.
College Freshman,1,they are really strict about quite hours in dorms. underage drinking is one of the things that they really really take seriously and that can get you out of college.

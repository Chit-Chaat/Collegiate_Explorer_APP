Niche User,5,I loved everything about visiting MIZZOU! The environment and energy around campus are so welcoming and I am very interested in attending.
Niche User,5,Communicating with MIZZOU has been very easy regarding my application and visits. The admissions team responds promptly and politely.
Freshman,5,It has been very different being all online and not meeting classmates. In a way a bit boring since lots of the activities has been cancelled but good on the other hand because I am able to focus on what is really important. Covid has brought new experiences to my life.
Junior,5,"I did take classes online, I hated it in all honesty, but it's a learning curve that COVID is forcing me to bare. It's something I definitely have to get used to so I can't really guarantee a quality review because I haven't worked with online classes long enough to form a reliable enough review."
Niche User,5,"My instructors were so helpful in getting me started with online classes, i have never taken one before, but with COVID things are changing and everyone has been so kind and taken the time to help me figure things out."
Niche User,5,"The kindness and willingness to help in all aspects, everyone i have encountered has been extremely helpful and always willing to help with anything that they can! I just love it here"
Alum,5,"It is a bit easy but Mizzou sets up their online classes pretty well. I had a few credits my sophomore, junior, and senior year, so I was only part time."
Alum,5,"As an alumna of the Missouri Journalism School, I can say that without a doubt that the Mizzou J-School is an extremely impressive program that taught me so much. After graduation, I got my dream job in NYC, and I give credit to the skills and connections I made while at Mizzou. 

The classes are built around how actual media agencies run and operate, and I feel my education overprepared me for what to expect post-grad. For my capstone, I was on Mizzou's National Student Advertising Competition Team, where we placed 3rd at the national competition. Mizzou's NSAC team continues to place top three consistently at nationals. 

All in all, I am so grateful that I attended the nation's best journalism school. If you're deciding where to go, I highly recommend Mizzou for not only what you will learn, but to also be able to join the Mizzou Mafia (real talk: if there's a Mizzou alumni at a company you want to work for, they WILL pull for you 99% of the time. Networking is everything)."
Graduate Student,5,"The community of Mizzou is unlike any other. I am constantly impressed with the leadership of students, dedication of professors and collaboration between all who live, work or play in the Columbia area. The resources provided here are beyond my expectations and I am very grateful for all the university provides. From the student success center, to the writing center to community service opportunity events and inclusion spotlights, there is something for everyone to enhance their education."
Graduate Student,5,Mizzou has the best Journalism School across the world. The hands-on method is the key to build our career paths.

Graduate Student,5,"My experience at Mizzou was more than I could ask for. I always felt at home no matter where I was living. Whether it was in the dorms, in a sorority house, or apartment I was able to feel safe. The professors always challenged me but I do feel as though my courses taught me a lot that will help me in my career."
Graduate Student,5,My experience with Mizzou Online was easy to follow and grasp. I never had a problem because they always sent out reminders through emails to help students keep up with their work.
Junior,5,Online classes are the way to go especially in the summer. Pretty easy and a good way to get some credits out of the way
Sophomore,5,"It was one of the best choices that I've ever made, I really love how accepting everyone is and meeting people from such diverse backgrounds is also really neat because your not exposed to many different backgrounds usually."
Sophomore,5,My first year on campus made me feel very much at home. The university makes a substantial effort to get student involved and make them feel included by getting to know their community. Over this last school year I’ve made friendships that will last a lifetime and a large part of these friendships are due to the conducive learning environment and welcoming community that the university facilitates.
Alum,5,I interacted online with courses. The online courses I took required me to go to a testing center to complete assessments.
Sophomore,5,"THE BEST SCHOOL. campus is beautiful, everyone is so helpful. Literally the best place to be!!!! Not only have i found my best friends but a passion i do not think i would have found if i would have come to the university!!"
Sophomore,5,"teacher were all well prepared, and really try to get you involved as much as possible!! There really was not much of a difference!"
Sophomore,5,Mizzou made it so easy and approachable to transition into online learning! All my professors were very easy to contact and get in touch with and our online learning system was approachable and easy to use. I was still able to interact with my classmates through Zoom too!

Sophomore,5,I really like the campus at Mizzou. The people are friendly and there are always lots of groups and activities to get involved with.
Sophomore,5,It was a different experience when all my classes changed to online. Some professors had never done it before. But once we got thr hang of zoom meetings and all the new apps it was something that helped the technical side of my college experience and made me excited to be back in a classroom too.
Niche User,5,I haven't quite been there for too long but I can tell you right off the bat that it seems like an incredibly fun place to be.
Freshman,5,"I love everything at the University of Missouri. This school is filled with traditions, events, and clubs. The football season is unforgettable and there are so many ways to make new friends, get help with academics and make memories that will last a lifetime."
Sophomore,5,"Mizzou is a great place to live, learn, and grow!  The faculty and staff are so supportive and take a personal interest in each student.  Connections are made well before graduation to ensure that each student has ample opportunity for employment and success upon graduation!"
Senior,5,I think the University of Missouri is an amazing diverse educational program for anyone to attend. The atmosphere is welcoming and There are hundreds of activities for the students to do. Mizzou provides a variety of majors for students and is a great school for journalism.
Freshman,5,The University of Missouri really cares about all of their students and provides and abundance of career and research opportunities that makes the learning applicable.
Niche User,5,"Well I haven't attended yet because I'm a rising HS senior, but it's my number one choice. Also, based off the virtual tour, it looks like a beautiful campus I could see myself living on for 4 years."
Alum,5,"This University of Missouri-Columbia is an amazing school. I made so many memories and met so many great people. Mizzou has the top education programs for nursing, business, and journalism. The professors here are incredible and always willing to do anything for their students success. Maize has a wide variety of organizations as well from greek life to clubs based on your degree. Everyone who goes to Mizzou loves it and becomes super successful!"
Sophomore,5,"The beautiful campus first caught my eye going on tours all through high school. Then after attending an event called ClueN, I was sold. Loved my dorm, mostly because we had the best food!"
Freshman,5,"Aside from having a wonderful campus environment, I am impressed with the high level of academic achievement the university holds itself at. Even on this large of a  campus, most students are striving to push themselves in the classroom to help better their own futures."
Freshman,5,Mizzou is an amazing environment. Campus is beautiful and it makes walking to class ten times  more enjoyable. Joining clubs can expand your social circle and most people are super nice so if you maximize your social interactions you'll definitely find a group of people you love.
Niche User,5,"I would say that their school is outstanding, the quality of the dorms, food, athletics, student life, and even the city surrounding it are aspects all universities should strive for."
Sophomore,5,"I love the University of Missouri campus, resources and opportunities to get involved. Very nice school with nice buildings, rec center and student center. Also has friendly people and focused professors and advisors who are helpful."
Freshman,5,I liked the feel of the campus. It felt like home away from home. It was a couple of hours away but is still close enough that if I need to go home or just go back for vacation or whatever it's close. Mizzou has all the programs I want and the campus is still small and beautiful.
Junior,5,"My experience at Mizzou has been great. My instructors are always available to help, and there are numerous activities, clubs, and sports to ben involved in. There are also plenty of leadership, mentoring, and internships available for myself and other students to prepare us for careers after graduating! At Mizzou, there is something for each and every student!"
Sophomore,5,I love the beautiful campus and surrounding town Columbia! Professors are amazing and the student life is abundant!
Niche User,5,"Campus is really nice and the people are welcoming the people love to party and the rec center is incredibly nice and large, dorms aren't amazing but not too bad I really look forward to attending Mizzou more. The only problem with it is the financial situation but that is the same with every college"
Freshman,5,University of Missouri is a very helpful college to help you go where you plan. All professors on campus are very helpful with advice.
Freshman,5,"Over the past year, I’ve grown a very strong passion for Mizzou. I first visited the campus over the summer and instantly knew I had a calling here. This campus is the perfect fit for me. While walking the campus and seeing the busy student life at hand, I instantly felt a second home. No matter where I was, there was a smiling face looking back at me. I saw the joy and passion these students had for Mizzou and my dream of being here sparked. Previous schools I visited, every student looked stressed out but there was a much calmer and warming vibe at Mizzou. By attending Mizzou in the 2020 fall semester, I couldn’t be more excited to be surrounded by such a wonderful community. I’m in love with the deep-rooted traditions such as the Tiger Walk to the homecoming festivities, birthed here, I’m so excited to call myself a Tiger."
Sophomore,5,I love that the lake of the ozarks is in the backyard of columbia. everything here is absolutely nothing needed to change about this school.
Niche User,5,I have lived near the University of Missouri for a long time. I have always been very impressed with the school for multiple reasons. I've attended camps and conferences there. The facilities are very nice and the instructors are so friendly! I learn so much every time I visit. I am an incoming freshman for Mizzou and the admission  process has been very easy. Mizzou sends me reminders for due dates and keeps me organized. I would highly recommend Mizzou. My brother spent time in their hospital on campus a few years ago. The staff was kind and once again the facilities were new and clean.
Niche User,5,"I love everything about this college- the people, the teachers, the location. Everything is all I ever wanted and more."
Freshman,5,It is a beautiful campus that has many different opportunities that allow students to grow and flourish. The community is very warm and welcoming.
Sophomore,5,I am only a sophomore but I feel like I have been given so many opportunities to experience college already. I love how big the school is and how it accommodates to every student that attends it.
Niche User,5,"Great school loved the environment, even nicer campus, professor were great also depending on how close of relationship you plan to have with them."
Freshman,5,I love Mizzou as soon I walked on the campus for orientation I knew it was the school for me. Everyone here is like my home away from home. I love going to support are football and basketball teams whenever I get the chance to. There is so many opportunities to meet new people  that you never knew could be your bestfriend. M-I-Z!!
Alum,5,"The University of Missouri-Columbia provides a fabulous university experience. The variety of majors is incredible. The professors are friendly and knowledgeable. And if you like athletics, Mizzou will provide you with all you desire."
Freshman,5,The University if Missouri has always felt like home for me. It’s a large campus but the student body feels more connected than you would think. We rally behind our athletic teams and I have met some great people. All of the professors I have had care about my education and help you to succeed.
Sophomore,5,This is my second year at MU and I have loved it since my first tour before freshman year. I like that the campus is fairly large but organizations make it feel like small.
Niche User,5,"I went on campus to visit this summer, and it was simply breathtaking. It seems like they very much put an emphasis on making a great experience for their students, and it shows. Friendly people, bright atmosphere, beautiful campus; not much more you could ask for!"
Niche User,5,Beautiful campus and extremely nice staff. Incredible buildings with exquisite design. The size of the school suited me well and made me fall in love with Mizzou even more. The clubs and activities they provide shocked me with excitement.
Niche User,5,The campus is really pretty and the staff that I met were very nice.  while I visited the campus the surrounding scenes pleased me and I could just see myself walking around campus and enjoying my time there.
Niche User,5,What I liked is that everyone was nice and if you needed help they where there. Another thing that I like is that you do not have to go that far if you want food.
Alum,5,"Excellent campus atmosphere located next to downtown Columbia,  MO. Nation's #1 Journalism School. The university owns and operates the local NBC TV  affiliate and has the largest Greek system west of the Mississippi  and second largest in the nation . Excellent business and engineering programs.  Rated one of the best universities for the money in the nation."
Niche User,5,"I attended a 3-week summer camp here. It was a truly magnificent experience. The professors were great, the sports teams are amazing, and the dorms are fine."
Senior,5,"I like that my school has teachers who not only conduct research, but also are very talented at teaching."
Senior,5,I loved the hands on experiences that Mizzou provides for their students. There are so many organizations and clubs on campus to provide experience for students in their area of study.
Niche User,5,I liked that there was so much diversity among the students. I also liked that the professors actually care about their students.
Freshman,4,This is my first year. So far so good in-spite of covid-19. I was able to move to the dorms and safely interact with other students my age. Away from other distractions and able to concentrate on what I need to do to succeed.
Freshman,4,"It's a big campus so it's easy to meet new people and gain new friends, but because of the size it's hard to find buildings, classes, etc. so it can be very intimidating at first. The professors I've had so far are very nice and thorough in their explanations. Although the dorm rooms are small, they are a good size for either a single student or roommates."
Freshman,4,Much different than my small town south of Columbia. It is getting easier to get used to and I think once I am used to it I will enjoy it more.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is gorgeous and very simple to maneuver. It is incredible weather for most of the year. They have many programs put in place to ensure the students safety and fulfillment, such as the free taxi service for especially late nights, or the massive recreational center which contains areas for just bout any activity you could think of."
Junior,4,"I love Mizzou. The people are amazing, and the school spirit that everyone has is phenomenal! Everyone on campus, staff included, is proud to be a Tiger! You can feel the energy on campus when there’s a football game on Saturday, or a basketball game or anything!"
Niche User,4,"Although I will not be an official student until the Spring of 2021. My overall experience thus far has been great, everyone is very welcoming friendly and helpful to me."
Alum,4,I took many online classes and particularly liked the self-paced courses as I like to move through quickly. My only complaint is they restricted how fast you could actually move through curriculum which was frustrating when I wanted to et even more ahead.
Alum,4,"The University of Missouri offered an amazing experience in terms of student life and nightlife. The city of Columbia was built around the college, so it provides true college town experiences. My professors were all passionate and driven and my classes were engaging. I am very glad I chose Mizzou."
Graduate Student,4,"I have taken multiple courses online and really enjoyed them. The professors still find many ways to connect with students, examples include discussion boards or video conferencing calls. I think the interaction between professors, students and peers online is very similar to communication styles in person. I think if anything, online classes are catered even more to the student's benefit. With online classes, you are given more freedom. Usually given a list of tasks to complete by a certain date, the student learns valuable skills like time management and responsibility for their own learning. In opposition, in person classes tend to walk through processes, assignments and materials more, providing a ""hand holding"" approach to the course."
Senior,4,"Over all this is a great university. Community is great. Some professors dont care as much about the students as we would like to see, but there is some that put a lot of effort into actually helping their students."
Junior,4,Great experience! Super fun school with a great learning environment. Classes have a great set up as well as the campus as a whole.
Junior,4,"Mizzou was, in my opinion, extremely over hyped and didn't reach all of the needs that I was expecting. Coming in as a transfer student, the dorms were already full for only freshmen. This made it extremely hard to not only make friends, but to figure out when greek life events were."
Sophomore,4,Excellent professors and a very exciting and fun environment. Not too expensive coming from an in-state tuition student.
Sophomore,4,"During my first semester I chose to take a finance course online and the instruction was very clear and straightforward, in turn I felt that the given assignments had a purpose. During second semester we experienced the pandemic which forced all of my course to go online, all in all my professors adapted well to deliver instruction online and deliver curriculum in a way that made us feel prepared for the upcoming academic year."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time at the University of Missouri - Columbia. If I could do it all over again I would return to this school.
Alum,4,A wonderful campus to take classes on. The professors in the Biochemistry department were great! I felt like they really cared about me succeeding in life!
Alum,4,I did take online classes this past semester due to COVID. It was difficult to understand what the professors wanted from me in the homework because I felt like I couldn't ask questions about the homework.
Freshman,4,"Idk never been to a university before nor had any family members so I guess good. Overall, it was enjoyable"
Freshman,4,"The academic experience was just as I expected it to be, in high school I was used to being on cruise mode and not do anything, but in college I managed to take courses that actually mentally challenged me"
Freshman,4,"Due to Coronavirus, a lot of second semester was done online, but the transfer was almost seamless. Professors were understanding when troubles and obstacles showed up and tried their best to make everything available and flexible, which was greatly appreciated."
Sophomore,4,"The online experience I had at Mizzou was varied.  I did not opt for this method of instruction, but it occurred due to the COVID outbreak in the Spring of 2020.  Some professors were totally ready for the move to online and others were not.  My experience was different than some, also, because I am a Theater major and it is very difficult to move a performance class to an online platform with the same results as in person performances and experiences.  Overall, the experience was good.  I was able to maintain a 4.0 GPA as the school moved to online and continued my connections with professors and friends."
Sophomore,4,I love the atmosphere and all of the professors in my major. I have received many hands on experiences and I have memories that will last forever. Very thankful to be a tiger! Can't wait to be back on the campus in the fall studying at the student center
Sophomore,4,I love this university's journalism program so far. I just finished my freshman year and I've already gotten so much hands-on experience. This is what separates MU from so many other schools. They give their students so many resources and programs to succeed. They really care about us
Freshman,4,"The University of Missouri is a lively college full of diversity and exploration every day. With downtown right across from campus, you can head to the night parties and or the mall only 7 minutes away from the campus. The university strives to promote a work mindset in whatever career you are pursuing and will help in whatever way possible!"
Alum,4,"I had the ultimate college experience at Mizzou! I lived in an all-girls dorm, participated in Rush week, and pledged a sorority. Met so many people who were from anywhere and everywhere. Attended football and basketball games - Go Tigers! I worked at a local Mexican restaurant, sadly no longer exists, I had a great social life! My major started off as Undecided, then changed to business. I studied abroad in Australia for one semester which was fantastic! Mizzou offers so many opportunities as far as degrees, social experiences, there's something there for everyone! And Columbia is a great college town! I loved my college experience and wouldn't trade it in for the world! I didn't take the first 4 years very seriously but ended up getting into nursing school and graduating 2 years later. I could have used a strong counselor to better guide me through those years."
Alum,4,"Once you get involved outside of class, Mizzou has a very home atmosphere. It isn't an easy course. The professors really push to challenge you."
Freshman,4,"This is an incredible university that has thus far provided an enriching educational experience with professors that do genuinely care about you and how you succeed in their courses. There are so many ways and opportunities to get involved from Greek Life, to clubs, to campus events, that it is nearly impossible to be bored at any time of the week."
Niche User,4,"I plan on going there after I graduate high school and I been there several times for games, and friends.  I love the campus love the people there.  I would love to go there after I graduate and hopefully I get to."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed the education aspect, however, I didn't enjoy living on campus. Also, many of the students already know each other upon starting so it can be hard to meet new people."
Freshman,4,"There is a place for everyone on campus. It feels like a smaller community on a big campus. The campus is absolutely beautiful, especially on the warmer days when you can sit outside and enjoy the fresh air. Not only that but, there are plenty of food locations that offer something for everyone's taste. The staff are friendly and it is easy to find someone to help you on your journey to your future. So far I have been very happy with my experience as a student at this University."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus with great resources, however I feel the number of student teachers is too high. Other than that, great"
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed the experience of being at such a large university. I got to meet a lot of great people and have already built many memories with them in my first semester. At such a large school, there's something for everybody. The only minor ""inconvenience"" that has come up is how far away I have to park my car - a solid 10-12 minute walk from my dorm. In Missouri that can be frustrating when it is snowing down hard."
Freshman,4,"As a college freshman, I was terrified to start this new chapter in my life. Mizzou made the transition from high school to college so easy and eased all of my worries. The faculty and other students are always there for new students and want everyone to be their best selves. I’m so glad I chose Mizzou!"
Junior,4,"Columbia is a perfectly sized college town. The campus itself is huge and populated, yet it feels so closely to home (coming from a small town). Mizzou holds endless opportunities for involvement. Too many clubs to count, you are bound to find one that fits your interests and personality perfectly. Fun activities such as flag football and sand volleyball are all year around and I had the opportunity of joining a ministry that helped change my life for the better. Unfortunately, I have walked into some years where the structure was a little chaotic with the program trying out new learning tools. However, most of the faculty truly cares about each individual student and the overall spirit is so prevalent. College is definitely harder than high school but you will make it through!"
Junior,4,"It is a home away a from home. Through my time at Mizzou I have grown as a person. I have done this through various experiences on and off campus, and I have received a top tier education. The faculty is extremely welcoming and helpful. I would recommend my experience to any student going to college."
Alum,4,"I absolutely loved my time here, and have made life-long friends .  I wish my academic advisor would have helped me more with my particular situation regarding switching majors, but all is well that ends well and I have had a successful business for 7 years."
Freshman,4,"I've enjoyed my first semester at the University of Missouri. I enjoy the flexibility with scheduling, so I don't feel too overwhelmed. There are so many ways to get involved on and off campus, and I feel welcomed in the community at Mizzou."
Sophomore,4,"I like how it might look like a big campus but after you get to know some people and know a little bit more about the campus it feels like home and it doesn't feel big. My advisors and professors are willing to help me be the best and get the best help that I need to succeed. The University of Missouri, Columbia is like my second home."
Freshman,4,"So far, I love the feeling and energy around Mizzou. Everyone is a family and makes you feel like you belong. Coming from a graduating class in high school of less than 100 people to a large university was difficult but everyone has made me feel welcome. The professors are also amazing especially in CAFNR. They truly want to see you succeed."
Niche User,4,The best and most well known public university in Missouri. Excellent college town and student body. Average academics as far as US universities go.
Sophomore,4,My experience has been good so far. I do not enjoy the party scene as I like to focus on my academics.
Niche User,4,"This has been such an amazing experience for me. This college has opened my eyes to so many different opportunities! I have been able to experience life as an adult for the first time and this college has only helped in those efforts. The professors are pretty average and after speaking with friends at other colleges, courses here do seem a bit tougher."
Sophomore,4,"I love Mizzou's campus. The architectural aspects really make it great for relaxing and walking around campus. It is expensive for out of state students, and the campus is majority non-minority. Classes are generally good and Mizzou services are always there to help."
Junior,4,"Overall Mizzou is a good school. The teachers are nice and approachable. There is a large selection of majors, the campus is beautiful, and the school defiantly has a lot of school pride. One thing that is bad is the parking on campus horrible."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Mizzou has been amazing so far! My professors are all very experienced and have made the transition from high school to college much easier for me. There are countless ways to get involved - personally, Greek Life has enhanced my experience more than I could have imagined, but if that isn't for you, there are MANY other options. The only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because they really nickel and dime you."
Sophomore,4,My experience here at Mizzou has been very good so far. The campus is amazingly beautiful and the environment makes me feel at home. I enjoy my classes and the professors are all really cool and adamant on making sure every student has an equal chance to succeed. One thing I would like to change is the amount of diversity on campus. I know that this year the number of minorities enrolled has increased five percent but I would also like to see an increase in the number of black faculty especially professors.
Senior,4,"I love that engineering is so emerging here at Mizzou. I was lucky to work in two research labs so far, and have loved that hands on experience. However, coming from a private high school I realize that sometimes public universities do not prepare you well."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with University of Missouri has been overall good! Sometimes the administration lacks in helpfulness. Academics are good, There are a lot of clubs to be involved in. It is a very beautiful campus, and has alright diversity."
Freshman,4,"University of Missouri - Columbia is a great school with great programs. The school is two minutes away from downtown and the campus is filled with an enriching history. Not only do they have a good mix of people, but they also have a club, sport, hobby for just about every need. The only downside is the money aspect of Mizzou. Mizzou is very expensive, and every item cost money. It costs money to breathe here.  All in all, Mizzou is a great school but if you want to attend here - make sure you have a plan to pay for school."
Junior,4,The University of Missouri has high expectations of its students and staff that helps their students be well-rounded. The downside of the University of Missouri is the cost of tuition. I would like to see MU give in-state to surrounding states as surrounding states do to Missouri resident.
Freshman,4,The University of Missouri is a great school with its campus located in the heart of Columbia. I have lived here my whole life and the school has always been a dream of mine to go to. It has great professors and it is really easy to get involved in the school and meet new people.
Sophomore,4,"From the time that I've been at Mizzou it has been fun. When I first got there, I was nervous because I didn't know what to expect and I thought it was going to be hard but, it turned out to be easier than I would've thought. In all, the classes are not hard really hard, you just have to do the work and everything else is fun. The sports, the events, the people, it's all a great experience."
Freshman,4,"I never thought it would be possible for me to afford college but University of Missouri-Columbia has so many scholarships, programs, and resources to help out with your financial needs, I’ll have less than 10,000 coming out of pocket, not including outside scholarships. Plus the campus is beautiful, the residencies are amazing and there’s always something going on around campus."
Niche User,4,"As a vastly spread out college, one must prepare themselves for quite a walk every day to get to class on time. The streets were safe for crossing, and there was rarely any sign of danger. Most professors did as much as possible to help students and the journalism program provides a wide range of opportunities that no other college can compare with. It seems as the though the program over prepares you for life ahead when you enter the field. Campus food was average, the same low quality dining experience as many colleges. However, the campus provides a wide range of restaurants to chose from. The Rec center was amazing and I would often find myself there or in one of the campus' many study rooms. The university really lacks in diversity, and there is subtle segregation and I would find myself feeling distanced from locals and students here as an African American. I will say that overall I enjoyed my experience there based on the education I received and the people I met."
Sophomore,4,"Choosing to go to Mizzou was the best decision. There are so many different majors, clubs, academic opportunities, etc."
Junior,4,I have really enjoyed my experience at The University of Missouri in Columbia. The atmosphere is engaging and the campus is gorgeous. You can really feel a sense of school pride throughout the university. I have had an average experience with professors as some have been better than others in their field.  The academic scene at The University of Missouri is diverse and well informative in each and every subject. I typically leave class informed on a new subject matter each and every day. The area around the school is exciting and engaging. The local downtown area is fun to walk around and there are plenty of places to eat and mingle.
Niche User,4,"Very friendly students and staff, I've been on a tour with my school there and it is very enjoyable all-in-all"
Alum,4,"Mizzou has had issues with racial tensions in the past few years but it's done a good job at hiring the right people to steer the university toward brighter days. SEC membership means that sports are a big deal, and Greek Life is still 20% of the community on campus. Lots of niches and friend groups, and the academic life is solid."
Junior,4,"The University of Missouri is a great school for any major! It is located in Columbia, Missouri which is a perfect college town. There are plenty of things to do on and off campus. Whether that's volunteering, hiking, trails, party life, etc. The campus is also very beautiful and inviting. The academic scene is pretty great as well as long as you plan out what you want to do efficiently."
Freshman,4,"I really like the campus and the people that work on it. Everyone is always helping you and they always make sure you that you are doing good. There are many centers that can help you if you are having any problem and the teachers and students are really nice. Overall I think this is a college that has helped me a lot, with the fact of being far from home."
Junior,2,"The University is a great school for academics, there's no argument there. But my experience with the advisors and teachers have been that they say that they're there to help, and then they don't follow through with the help that they offer. They don't work with the students who express their discomfort with the racial injustices that occur on this campus. The chancellor is ignorant to most of the students' concerns about the racial problems and concerns arising around the COVID pandemic and returning to school. It's an incredibly diverse school, the people are great, the campus is beautiful, the athletics are D1. As for the safety, I can't say as a woman on this campus that I've felt entirely safe 100% of the time, especially the later it gets. Police don't make routine circles around the campus so walking back to your dorm room from a late study session can be incredibly unnerving."
Freshman,2,"Mizzou simply wasn't the school for me. It was too large and felt too disconnected for my personal liking. My freshman year, I had 3 classes of 450+ students, making it very difficult to learn. As someone not interested in fraternity life, it was hard to become involved and find friends as fraternity and sorority life was so central to the school. However, this is all a personal thing, and I know plenty of friends who have loved their experience at the school."
Alum,2,"This isn't a college that focuses on academics. Grades are more dependent on class attendance than assignments. Nearly every professor acts as if classes and students are a nuisance. Requesting assistance, leniency due to personal crises, or building a connection with them is difficult. Many of them don't possess basic soft skills and will publicly humiliate students in class. If you call or email them, don't expect a response.

Administrative systems (MyZou) are broken and administrators can't answer questions. Professors don't talk to their departments, departments don't talk to administrators, and everyone is conveniently not responsible for mistakes. It's an embarrassment how much of your tuition is spent on this and sports programs.

For the positives, the campus provides a fun college experience. There's plenty to do and a lot of organizations to be a part of. It's easy to make friends. Countless hours can be spent tooling around the campus and aimlessly exploring."
Junior,2,I like the dorms and the initial welcoming into the University. I do not like the neglect of support & care from staff after the parents leave. The professors are more concerned about their research than actually being an efficient professor.
Sophomore,2,"Trying to get any paperwork done through admin is ridiculous. However, the disabilities center is amazing."
College Sophomore,2,"All the Greek life throws parties all week and weekend long. The parties are loud and annoying to all non-Greek students, and are just an excuse for Frat guys and sorority girls to get drunk and be loud. There is a big problem in Greek life of frat guys raping drunk girls."
College Junior,2,"I think that there is too big of a focus on Greek life. If you are not in a fraternity then you aren't allowed to go to parties but any girl is allowed, how is that fair? When I meet someone new at school (who happens to be in a sorority of fraternity) the first thing they ask is ""Are you in a house?"" and when I answer no they get uncomfortable and sort of awkward. I do not understand the big deal. I sometimes feel left out because I do have a lot of friends who are Greek and they have lots of events and get to have this thing in common and I do not have that with them."
College Junior,2,"After the news headlines, I'm honestly embarrassed to say that I attend/attended Mizzou for the time being."
College Freshman,2,Overpriced. Supposedly a dry and smoke-free campus but those rules are never enforced.
College Freshman,2,Mizzou is awful at every sport except wrestling.
College Freshman,2,"You can immediately spot a sorority girl on campus, which is, again, disheartening. You'd think that there would be some sort of individuality, but in the ""top"" sororities and fraternities, they basically only recruit carbon copies of basic people. I think that a lot of really splendid people have been rejected from Greek life because they don't fit the mold, and I thought that things like this (stereotypes etc) weren't incredibly common, but I was wrong."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life seems like it should be great, but it's become pretty superficial. I know a lot of girls who are very intelligent and passionate about improving our community/environment who got declined from sororities just because they didn't fit the ""Sorority Girl"" stereotype (party-girl, rich, etc.)"
College Sophomore,2,"Greeks look down on non Greeks, and  sorority girls on campus are extremely clickish and stupid."
College Sophomore,2,The administration has taken racist events extremely poorly over the past few years. Many policies are being implememted and campus' environment is changing for the better currently. Many professors and TA's are on the right side of history by hosting walkouts and standing in solidarity with marginalized students who have been harassed.
College Freshman,2,"I have had a pretty bad experience at Mizzou so far. Although the classes and teachers are decent, the atmosphere and overall experience has made me hate my dream school. As an out of state student with no scholarships and limited financial aid, it has not been worth the $40k+ overall price."
College Sophomore,2,"Registering for classes is a pain! Several of the classes that are necessary for me to take for my major either occur at the same time or only have one class time option. This is very inconvenient. It is also difficult to have classes with your previous professors that you enjoyed having classes with because Mizzou makes a point of having the professors teach classes so that they cannot have their previous students again. Fortunately, it is easy to meet the full time college student requirement without having too heavy of a workload."
College Sophomore,2,"Diversity is encouraged by administration, but not necessarily embraced by the students,"
College Junior,2,Have you seen the news this past year?
College Junior,2,It could be a lot better. Sometimes Mizzou waits to inform students of safety concerns until it is too late.
College Freshman,2,As someone not in greek life I often have to worry about the danger they can create on campus. As a minority on campus I must remain aware of the locations in the area that are dangerous to walk through and it's common knowledge around here that walking through greek town can be dangerous or at the very least a bad idea. The tensions/disagreements between greek and non-greeks can be big and small.
College Junior,2,Mizzou gives barely any money to assist you
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lack of cheap housing near campus, but if you have a car it's not that bad."
College Sophomore,2,"It's an idiotic system based mostly off of ACT and SAT scores. If you don't have those, it can be difficult to get financial aid. However, never stop applying because you never know what could happen."
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid at MU is a bit of a hassle. Being a recipient of financial aid is quite difficult. My dad, my sole provider, is considered less than middle class, yet the University still didn't offer much financial aid options, or significant amounts, other than possible loans. Also, I received a refund check in the mail for ""excessive payment"" at the beginning of the semester, but they required that money back by the end of the semester, claiming I owed it to them."
College Freshman,2,"It's pretty average overall, there isn't anything else really interesting about the local cuisine."
College Freshman,2,"If you want to be close to campus, it's gonna cost you and they're going to nickel and dime you throughout the entire process."
College Freshman,2,You'll think it's amazing at first but the meals get repetitive and it's actually not healthy at all.
College Freshman,2,"The parties suck, no fun at all"
College Sophomore,2,The biggest con in Off-Campus Housing is the cost. I absolutely think rent is overpriced everywhere and I don't think it's fair for any students involved be it their parents paying their rent or not. Another thing in regards to cost is that you have to factor in that tuition continues to increase every semester and even with scholarship money a student might still have to pay another $1000 out of their pocket and still have to buy books its ridiculous.
College Sophomore,2,It doesn't take into consideration issues at home
Recent Alumnus,2,"I was never in a frat, so I can't say how it's like to be in one. However, they cause a lot of alcohol-related incidents on campus. The fraternities also tend to be racist and treat women poorly."
College Junior,2,"Your race, gender, and religious affiliation are the biggest determining factors when it comes to professionally progressing at Mizzou, not your credentials and qualifications."
College Sophomore,2,I wish they would give more money
College Freshman,2,"This is definitely a college town. Everything revolves around the college and the businesses are pretty much geared toward serving college student's needs. If you're not in college anymore, you might want to consider moving on."
College Freshman,2,"It depends on where you're living, but in my dorm people are up late almost every night making noise, being obnoxious, etc. The RAs don't really do much to stop it."
College Junior,2,"I've heard of girls being abused during campus parties. If a girl goes to a fraternity and drinks their alcohol, she is expected to ""put out"" for them."
College Sophomore,2,Not happy at all with how scholarships have changed this year. Incoming freshman are getting thousands more than I am for the same requirements (I was a freshman just last year)
College Sophomore,2,Find parking spots early and don't force spots or park illegally because you will get a ticket
College Freshman,2,There is rarely anywhere to park & there isn't really any free parking for visitors
College Sophomore,2,It's Missouri weather.  It has a mind of it's own and you are going to get all kinds of extremes.
College Sophomore,2,"I hate parking.  I currently park in the commuter lot that requires a bus to get to it and it is really annoying, but hopefully I will be in a closer lot next year."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lot of underage drinking, period.  Whether or not you feel left out or not if you do not partake is dependent on your group of friends. Some people will judge you, others will not."
College Sophomore,2,"Being a journalism major at Mizzou is tough, but it will be well worth it in the end.  People know that journalism students are intense and work really hard.  We have to."
College Freshman,2,The dorms have rules but they rarely seem to be enforced.
College Freshman,2,"I do not drink, and do not party and as an outsider I see it as obnoxious."
College Student,2,Alcohol is everywhere. Drugs are less common than booze but definitely still relevant.
College Sophomore,2,"Air transport from Chicago to Columbia's regional airport is expensive.

Bus transport between the two towns is available but times of departure/arrivals are limited as well as length of travel is lengthy at approximately 8 hours.

There is no direct rail transport between the two towns. One must travel from Columbia to St Louis then to Chicago."
College Sophomore,2,"Theres parties every night of the week. The underage nightlight doesn't differ, most people have fake ID's"
College Freshman,2,I'm not apart of Greek life. At times I feel left out but other than that I enjoy it
College Junior,2,"Almost all parking permits are for off-campus commuter parking where you have to depend on a shuttle to campus that's on a loop (meaning there are no specific times for arrival and departure wtf). Parking is expensive, students are the lowest priority compared to if the public needs to park in your lot for a sporting event or other bulls***, and finding a meter on campus is a pain in the ass."
College Sophomore,2,"Missouri weather is always unpredictable. I carry an umbrella in my backpack for unexpected rain, and you always need to check the weather online before heading out. Rain boots are useful to have because campus floods in certain places when it rains hard."
College Junior,2,You will pay too much to be able to walk to campus
College Junior,2,There's a lot of racism on and around campus. Theres not that much diversity but people bond over sports.
College Junior,2,I struggle so much financially. MU told me that there was not really anything that they could do to help me either. That is why I have three jobs during the school year because my tuition is so expensive. 
College Junior,2,"Our internet and wifi connections on campus work, but they are very weak. There are computers that are for student use in the library and in certain residence halls, but that is it. A laptop is quite necessary. "
College Freshman,2,"I received outside scholarships, but the school itself didn't offer me a cent (other than loans). "
College Freshman,2,The summer is HOT and the winter gets pretty cold. 
College Freshman,2,"There are many shops, restaurants and bars downtown but I find Columbia to be very boring. Don't get me wrong, it's a nice town but it's very unexciting and hours away from any major city (STL or KC). After graduation, I don't see myself ever returning to Columbia (or Missouri for that matter) other than on occasion to attend a Mizzou football game. "
College Sophomore,2,Classes are very difficult and GPAs are very low. 
College Freshman,2,"It's Missouri...we have s****y weather which sometimes means it sucks when you have to walk across campus in the cold, rain, or snow, but you learn to adapt."
College Sophomore,1,"there are not even enough professors on campus for every class. the grading system is very flawed and inconsistent. the classes range from so big you cant even see into the classroom to you and five other people staring awkwardly at a struggling grad student. There are a large variety of classes, however you need to be in specific majors to even consider trying to get into the classes."
College Freshman,1,Football sucks and the coaches are bias and unfair.
College Sophomore,1,It is Greek overload at Mizzou.
College Senior,1,Would not want anyone I know to send their children here. I talk people out of it when they ask me about it. Only reason to come here from out of state would be for journalism. Every other school kinda blows beside the medical ones. My advisers have had me take pointless classes and now will not be graduating on time.
Recent Alumnus,1,"If one would like to attend this school that identifies as a minority, I do not recommend it. This University is extremely racist."
College Junior,1,Mizzou is a great place for you if you're the stereotypical Greek bro/sis or Country boy/girl. All others are harshly looked down upon in an explicit manner. Gen Eds are over-populated to the point where it's hard to find a seat during an exam. Professors strongly use favoritism in regards to responding to e-mails and helping in general.
College Junior,1,"If you're not WHITE CHRISTIAN who intends to join the GREEK LIFE, do not even think about attending Mizzou. 75-90% of the campus ( including the FACULTY and STAFF) are NARROW-MINDED, XENOPHOBIC, IGNORANT RACISTS."
College Sophomore,1,I am struggling to pay for the rest of this semester and next!
College Freshman,1,I personally can't stand it. It's not worth the money or the tears. And the parties are terrible. Never go to a frat house alone.
College Sophomore,1,"One day it will be cold, the next it will be really hot. The weather is really inconsistent."
College Freshman,1,"The school is ran by the frats and sororities. Just as with any school, some greek members are very nice and other are just awful human beings."
College Freshman,1,Parking is terrible on campus. It is hard to find a spot and the parking enforcement officers are Nazi's. Use public transportation if possible. 
College Sophomore,1,Campus ticketing is ridiculous even when classes aren't in session.
College Freshman,1,"The bus routes are terrible, they're very confusing and hard to learn, and bus fair is extremely costly."
College Freshman,1,"there are no drugs and alcohol visible, hardly ever"
College Freshman,1,It is worse than the weather in Chicago as far as drastic changes in one day
College Sophomore,1,Long distance transportation for destinations like the Mall or Wal-Mart are horrible. And the hotline for Mizzou's transportation system is horrible too. The people are so rude and talk as if your wasting their time.
College Sophomore,1,The safety is horrible. There has been too many rapes on campus in dorm life. Where you think you would be the safest. 
College Sophomore,1,One day it's burning. The next it's freezing. Then the day after that it's rainy  and muggy. Not cool. 
College Sophomore,1,"Way too expensive and far, total inconvenience. "
College Sophomore,1,"Mizzou is horrible with financial aid, absolutely horrible. Scholarships are even worse, because I am not black, asian, or hispanic I barely receive any scholarships even though I do better in the academic standings. I am by no means racists, I have tons of friends of other races, but even they think it's ridiculous that I have to save every penny to attend school when I deserve a decent scholarship I have worked hard to keep my grades up. "
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly I have no prejudice against greek life I simply cannot afford it, too expensive and I cannot ask that much of my parents. The greek girls specifically just assume you couldn't get in when they ask if your in a sorority and you say no. They do think they are better than non-Greeks. "
College Senior,1,"unreliable public transportation, campus shuttle ."
College Senior,1,"too big, too much focus, not enough emphasis on school"
College Junior,1,"No one can get permit parking($170) in the location they want despite much available parking during the day. I applied for a permit in May and I am a senior in 2 separate majors but could not get any near locations. I work with a PhD student who is in her last semester and had the same problem. With all the fees we pay, this should be changed. Parking in garages with digital ""meters"" require you to purchase a ticket, so if you forget your money for the day rather than getting the regular $15 like at an ""expired"" coin meter, you get hit with $25--even if for an hour or less. I feel that the intention is to trap students into situations where they must pay exorbitant fees. The only person I know who has gotten a desired spot went into the office and actually complained/yelled to get what she wanted. I suggest that route: probably more successful than applying early."
College Freshman,1,"Campus just isn't very safe. If your a girl, guys can basically get away with anything if there Greek. I have seen so many girls get roofied and taken advantage of. They even can get the records erased from the hospitals. So I guess if your a guy and greek, CONGRAGULATIONS, you run the school. But if your a girl be very careful. I have seen so many things go so very wrong."
College Freshman,1,"If your a guy and not in a frat,  have fun trying to go out and party unless your cool with finding the occasional off campus apartment party. Personally I don't like this school because of greek life. They think they are the s*** and it dominates everything. If your into the idea of greek life and are going to join then this is the school for you."
College Student,1,You can get parking on campus but to have to come after 5 in the evening or you have to have a parking permit otherwise you are probably not going to find a spot and not get a ticket.
College Sophomore,1,"Last year as an incoming freshman I was made to believe that it was a highly diverse institution and honestly that was a big part of its charm and a  reason I decided to enroll. However, upon arrival I immediately learned otherwise, not only was their self-proclaimed diverse student body predominately white, but minorities were considerably underrepresented. Although there are exceptions, I noticed as a whole, the student body tends to stick with people who look like them, this may be what is comfortable for most, but often it creates division. To make up for their downfall, there is a multicultural center, which always has events. A few things that are somewhat diverse is sexual orientation, economic background && religion (as diverse as religion can get in the lower Midwest :/ )"
College Senior,1,"There are never places to park, and if you find a spot and you are parked for 5 minutes longer than you expected, you will get a ticket! It is a blatant attempt to sucker us out of more money than they already take."
College Freshman,1,Seriously the most annoying people on campus
Recent Alumnus,1,"This school sucks.  If you are into getting drunk all the time or being in a cliquey fraternity or sorority this is the school for you.  However, if you are interested in academics and want to learn and do great things this is not the school for you.

On a positive note most of the professors are decent at their job but just do not have time to help you because of class size.
Advisors at mizzou are terrible they hand you a paper with things highlighted and send you on your way.  If you do not send up when early registration comes around forget getting into classes professors will not respond to emails about permission numbers.

The rec center and library are nice but both are way to busy to ever use.
I do not recommend going to Mizzou. There are way better schools around save your money."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is horrible. I would definitely suggest getting a parking pass. They are awarded based on seniority (location) but everyone can get a pass. Otherwise, be prepared to search for parking for hours and have hundreds of dollars worth of tickets billed to your student account."
College Freshman,1,The people at Mizzou are very discriminating to those who are unlike them.
College Freshman,1,Most people are from St louis or Missouri which means they have a lot of their friends here and I am from out of state and even if im nice people tend not to be nice back or just don't care because they have their high school friends and they don't want new ones. not the best school ive been too. I make more friends while visiting my friends at different colleges 
College Freshman,1,The parties are so lame and not always fun. Almost all beer which is super lame and they never let other guys in which is never fun I don't need horny frat guys trying to get with me. Some weekends will be totally silent in Greek Town which is even more lame and its even worse cause all bars are 21 so basically social drinking in a dorm or apartment is the only  way to have even a little fun 
College Junior,1,"Parking is worse than a Nightmare. If you live off campus expect to pay extra on gas just to get a parking spot... usually I leave an hour before my class starts and I still, at times, tardy for my first class. The way the roads are set up and the amount of students, workers, parents that drive through campus daily, always congest the roads. Even with a car that has high MPGs (41 on my car) you will end up paying for gas each week, all because you will be sitting in traffic for long periods of time. expect your blood pressure to be high while you are here at MU"
College Freshman,1,"Parking is a nightmare. If you bring a car, you can pay for a parking pass. Then, they will randomly assign you to a parking garage or parking lot, which is usually way across campus. The entire bottom half of the garage will probably be empty most of the time, yet you will be assigned to park only on the very top level...In addition, you have to move your vehicle on weekends when there is a football game (which is almost every weekend in the fall). If you live off campus and drive to campus everyday, you can also be assigned a parking pass, or you can pay the meter. If you choose to pay a meter, you are taking a risk because it is extremely difficult to find open spots. Parking downtown is also a nightmare. If at all possible, walk downtown. If it's not possible, prepare to drive around looking for a spot for awhile."
College Freshman,1,"I received pretty much no financial aide. Unfortunately, not only did I not receive much financial help but I am also an out of state student so my tuition was automatically hiked up 20,000. I would not expect a lot of financial help from the school, you are better off applying for scholarships around your community."
College Freshman,1,"Personally as a non-Greek, I can't stand the majority of the Greek Life.  Most of the students in Greek life are stuck-up, snobby, and usually annoying.  I hear about Greek life only when people mention the parties they're going to.  Greek life at Mizzou is the stereotypical Greek life you see portrayed in movies.  Parties thrown every weekend and lots of drinking is done in the fraternities.  Though there are some good fraternities, the majority of them are the ones described above.  It is also accepted by the majority of the people I know, that Sororities are useless and not as worth joining as fraternities.  This is because men are higher up in the business world, therefore it is easier for them to network and meet people that could help them for future employment, but this does not necessarily apply to women.  There is one fraternity house that stands out on campus, though.  Beta Theta Pi is a house of fraternity row that cost $10 million to build and is one of the nicest fraternity houses ever built."
College Freshman,1,"You must be on time for parties because if they are not shut down, the price jumps. For example, me and my friends were going to a party and it started at nine. At nine the price was five dollars, but we got there at ten and it jumped up to 15."
College Sophomore,1,"Here at Mizzou, if you are searching for a diverse school, this is NOT where to be. For the most part, there is 1 type of guy and 1 type of girl. The guys are all frat star jocks while are the girls are made up, stuck up sorority girls. EVERYONE dresses the same wearing Ralph Lauren & Polo, acts the same, and does the same thing. People generally are really into partying and drinking. If you are into comforming to everyone around, Mizzou will be perfect for you. If you are an artsy individualistic type of person, please apply somewhere else."
College Sophomore,1,Save the trouble and the time and get to school via public transportation. It cost too much and is scarce or poorly/inconveniently located.
College Senior,1,"Although I am not Greek, I see the aftermath of their parties on a daily basis in the Emergency Room.  Bunch of drunken fools if you ask me."
College Freshman,1,"Way to many parties, and ignorant drunks all over the place."
College Sophomore,1,"Need Quite an Improvement – Tickets are given out constantly.  It seems like there is no way to park close to classrooms, dorms, or even campus in general without parking illegally.  There are just not enough spots and areas to park in."
College Junior,1,"Parking on our campus is very inconvienent. Permit costs are pretty expensive along with ticketing and fines which occur  A LOT on campus. The need for a car on campus depends on the student. If they live close, they probably dont need one. If they live far away they might depending on other things they might be involved in that cause them to be other places at times when waiting for a bus could slow them down. Parking is very limited on campus also, we have  a ton of students and our populatin only keeps growing, but are parking is minimal."
College Freshman,1,"Such a Pain – It is very difficult finding parking spots on campus, and when a spot is found the student either needs a permit or has to pay a meter, which is costly."
College Junior,1,"Parking is the worst aspect of my school. Permits are too expensive , there is nowhere free to park, meters are expensive and the prices go up IF there is even a mater available. Terrible parking"
College Senior,1,"The town of columbia could definately use some updating. There aren't many things to do in town, besides bars, movies, or eating. I'm from st. Louis where there are live outdoor concerts, botanical gardens, the riverfront, magic house etc. So to be cultured and come to a city that wasn't anticipating the growth that University has brought, it can get boring if you're not exactly a club type person."
College Freshman,1,"Freshmans get the worst parking ever. It's a lot in the middle of nowhere, and it's so far from campus. It's a scary walk at night. Upperclassmen get the best parking, this is one of the downfalls of being a freshman."
College Junior,1,"It's a pain to find parking. Meter parking is almost always full, and there isn't much free parking available to students who live off campus."
College Freshman,1,"Rape Policy – I believe the University of Missouri's rape policy is far too lenient. Independent research by local Columbia papers have revealed that barely a fraction of ""date rapes"" are taken to trial. In fact, most are not even reported. I adore the University of Missouri but it needs to enhance its rape victim protection."
College Freshman,1,Scholarships aren't that easy to obtain here at the University of Missouri.
College Freshman,1,"It either gets really cold during the winter months or really hot during the time classes begin in august! Classes typically aren't cancelled depending on how the weather is like, so you either are barging through snow, splashing through puddles, or sweating profusely to get to class. Missouri weather is never predictable."
College Freshman,1,Here at MU the diversity is lacking. I mean there are a chunk of black students and Asians students. Though it does not compare of how many white Americans that are here.
College Sophomore,1,"Academic Advisors – I'm an Art History and Archaeology major. During Summer Welcome I met with my advisor for the first time, I told him that I had taken a few AP tests that May, including the AP Art History test, and would be getting the results within the next month. After talking for about 15 more minutes, my advisor wrote down the classes he thought I should take that semester. He never mentioned that I should drop one of those classes if I got the AP credit for the Art History test. I didn't realize until halfway through the semester that I had taken a class that I already had credit for. I emailed my advisor and asked if I was right and if there was anything I could do. He basically told me that I was irresponsible and that he can't drop classes for me. That was by no means what I expected him to do but I did expect him to advise me. I will never talk to him again and am currently trying to get a new advisor."
College Senior,1,Weather is extremely unpredictable and ruins on campus experiences at times
College Senior,1,Low Printing Quota – There is never enough money on the quots to print everything you need for the semester.
College Freshman,1,"No Aid – I hardly receive any aid from the school, which makes it very difficult to pay since I am out of state and have about $10,000 more to pay per year on tuition."

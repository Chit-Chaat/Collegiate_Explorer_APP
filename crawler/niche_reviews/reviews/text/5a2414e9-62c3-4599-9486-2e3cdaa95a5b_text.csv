Freshman,5,I am very impressed with their online resources to help students get the most out of online learning.
Freshman,5,Everyone is very helpful. They will communicate with each other in order to help you.They provide you with information upfront and prepare you well for your program.
Sophomore,5,A great Christian school with excellent staff and a wonderful student body. Highly recommend to anyone.
Sophomore,5,Teachers really made an effort to keep us informed on everything and did their best to continue remote teaching as well as possible despite the challenges.
Niche User,5,The campus is absolutely stunning just walking up to it. They are ranked number 3 in quality of dorms. Immediately you get the impression that the staff wants the best for you and your future and they create programs to get you into the job field as soon as possible.
Niche User,5,"When I toured Union University, I absolutely fell in love! I have never felt such at home on a college campus as I did at Union University. I highly recommend looking at Union University to see if it fits you. The people their are very kind and welcoming. The first time I stepped foot on Union's campus, I made a few friends!"
Senior,5,"Really nice, beautiful campus and dorms. Very friendly staff. Nice places to hang out or go eat on campus and nearby."
Niche User,5,"Union is a place where I get to grow in knowledge and spirit. I am in the art department where I am challenged beyond what I thought I could achieve. Union tries to make tuition bearable by providing free laundry, scholarships, and grants. I hope for more school involvement with in the arts. The art faculty give so much to the art department; some have even built parts of the department. The university’ administration needs to provide more for the art department. With that being said, all the staff at Union is so kind. They always answer with gentleness. The lunch ladies even say hi and want a conversation. Everyone at Union tries to reflect God’s love."
Freshman,5,This was my first year at Union and I really enjoyed it. The community atmosphere is amazing. The professors really care about you and want to assist you in any way possible if you are struggling in their class.

Freshman,5,"Dorms are set up in quads. Four girls share living area and kitchen and there are two bathrooms for the four girls. Dorms are furnished with stove, refrigerator, microwave, and washer/dryer. You pay for 120, 150, or 175 meals per semester. Each time you enter the cafeteria your card is swiped. Once inside the cafeteria you can choose whatever you want, as much as you want. Being a private Baptist University students are required to attend chapel so many days per semester. Students can choose day and time they attend. Faculty is outstanding. They will answer your texts quickly and are student oriented."
Freshman,5,I have never experienced anything like Union University. I felt so welcome the second I got there! The students and staff are great and are devoted to helping you get where you need to be. I’m an art major and the staff helps me to understand where I fit into God’s plan for me. The Christ centered education I am receiving is truely like no other. You can tell the staff genuinely cares about your success and are always available to meet with you to discuss your future and needs.
Junior,5,"This is a great school with a fantastic atmosphere! The community around the school welcomes each student as their own! College is such a fun time in life, and Union makes it very easy to excel while having fun."
Junior,5,Union University is an amazing place to learn and worship our God. All of the staff are very friendly and helpful. They genuinely care about their students success. I couldn't have picked a better university to attend.
Senior,5,"This is a wonderful University, as a nursing student I have learned so much. I feel well prepared for the work field. I would recommend this school to anyone looking for a university in Tennessee."
Freshman,5,So far Union has been very cooperative with everything if I have any questions they have responded very quickly. Everyone is so sweet and kind. The best thing is that Union is a Christ-Centered college!
Alum,5,Union fully prepared me to go into my field of choice. Professors are intelligent and care about their students
Graduate Student,5,"It’s been great. I have really enjoyed the experience. Once i visited the cloud, I instantly felt like I was home in a safe place. I felt very welcomed in a new place and that’s what stood out the most to me because I need to felt warm and needed and not lost."
Sophomore,5,"Union is an amazing place, with a strong Christian atmosphere. Welcome week as a freshman helped me find friends early and allowed me to settle in before school began, professors were very helpful and concerned with my education and understanding of material, the dining hall staff is very nice and treat me like family. Overall this is one of the greatest places on earth for me, only wish they could fix the pool."
Sophomore,5,The professors at Union are so helpful and they really care about your education. What I really love about Union is the community that surrounds it and the ability you have to make connections that are meaningful.
Freshman,5,I really like how Union is very Christ-centered but is also very academically focused. The people are great and the professors are really nice.
Freshman,5,"Union University offers outstanding academics, a great school community, and a beautiful campus. Professors are deeply invested in their students as individuals."
Sophomore,5,Union University is an excellent school. The professors are very knowledgeable and make classes interesting.  The campus is well kept and inviting. Most of the staff that I’ve encountered have been friendly and helpful.
Graduate Student,5,Union University is an exceptional school. I would highly recommend Union to those who are serious about their career and want to make a difference in this world.
Junior,5,"I attend the Germantown location and I absolutely love it!! The staff is always friendly and welcoming. I attended Union for two years for pre-reqs ad had 0 problems during this time. I have recently been accepted into the nursing program and I am sooo excited. It is expensive but I can say, it's excellent quality."
Freshman,5,"All the staff here is amazing. They really promote a Christ-centered education, and are always willing to take their students into their homes for a meal or two. All the departments work well with one another and equally promote events that are going on. The security team here works hard to make sure everyone is safe. It is never hard to make a new friend on campus!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Union! Best school I’ve ever been to! All of the teachers are so uplifting , always positive, and want you to do your absolute best! I’m happy to say I am a Union Student and one day will be Alumni."
Freshman,5,"I love everything about Union: its faculty, campus, dorms, library, multiple cafes, and great central location to the rest of the city. The professors here really care about their students, and they have a passion for what they teach. Everyone here wants to see you succeed."
Sophomore,5,"Love this being a Christ based school.  Beautiful campus and amazing dorms. Classes aren’t over crowded so you can receive one on one help. Great location, close to shopping and great restaurants."
Freshman,5,"The apartment-like dorms are very comfortable and accommodating. Classes are challenging but not overwhelming, and they're relatively small, as well (about 25 students per class). Professors genuinely care about their students and wish to get to know their students. The only thing I would want differently is that the school would have a football team, so we could have a marching band!"
Freshman,5,"Union University does an excellent job of keeping its students informed and involved. There is an abundance of clubs and organizations for new students to get involved in. Plus, Union's dorm rooms receive an A++ from me!"
Freshman,5,"The thing that makes Union so special is the community and the friendships that form.  It is very easy to make great friends, professors are accessible and helpful, and the campus is a perfect size."
Junior,5,"I love that each of my professors invests in me personally. They want to see me succeed and do everything in their power to help me excel. Not only have they invested in my academic life, but also in my spiritual life. They push me to strive to seek, know, and love the Lord. Not only does Union have great professors and academics, but I met some of my best friends for life at this university. They have made me a better person and have shown me how to be a better friend. Union has impacted my life in other aspects such as introducing me to the working field by helping me find a part-time job and fulfilling the requirements of the job. My campus makes me feel safe, for example, when parts of my car were stolen and I called Campus Safety and Sercurity they made their way over to me quickly."
Junior,5,I have enjoyed my time at Union! I will hopefully be spending four more years in Pharmacy school once I graduate with my Bachelors degree.
Junior,5,My experience at union has been great. It’s not a party school but it’s an awesome place to get your educational foundations. The teachers want you to excel and learn .
Freshman,5,"Union University is a place where I found a community of Christians committed to excellence in faith, academics, spiritual growth and well being. The administration and staff are personally interested in every student and make college life a fun and safe place to grow into Christian men and women."
Sophomore,5,"Union University is a great choice for someone looking to get a quality education in a small(er) school setting. They have great faculty that genuinely care about their students, and the small class size allows you to connect with professors on a more personal level. Awesome school all around!"
Senior,5,"The administration, faculty, and staff are all top-notch. Everything is college level, and academics is top priority. Environment is college-life based, and everything portrays the gospel message. Amazing Christian college."
Freshman,5,"Overall it's been a wonderful experience. The teachers are fantastic and truly care about their students, both from an academic and personal growth viewpoint."
Niche User,5,"You university is a wonderful school. It is a Christian-based school and I love the fact that the classes were small, intimate and  personal. There is not too much I would like to see changed about this university because it meets the needs for an adult as well as a new high school graduate to obtain a higher education."
Niche User,5,"So far, just by typing into the search engine for needs and wants for scholarships, this website has been beyond helpful. It's already stressful enough considering or contemplating going back to school for a second degree, along with the stress of having to figure out a way to find the funds to help pay for your education. Luckily a classmate suggested this website and I'm beyond grateful. Trying my best to hold out on getting student loans, so hopefully with all the scholarships I've applied for this far will help in the long run. Any help is good  help and I'm extremely grateful. Union thus far has been a warm, welcoming school that was placed in my life for a reason. I will suggest this school to any and everybody that's looking to a new career change."
College Sophomore,5,I love being able to go to my teachers regularly
College Sophomore,5,"I'm not completely done with school, but I feel they will help the vest they can with assisting with finding a job."
College Sophomore,5,A degree from Union is amazing. It is a very well-recognized school for its tough academics and excellence driven attitude and some amazing people in our country are products of this school. The career center at Union is excellent and works with you to get you the perfect internship or job and will help you diligently. They also help a great deal with networking and getting your name out into the professional world.
College Sophomore,5,The teachers are well-versed in their subjects and extremely qualified. They teach effectively and are very intentional with their students. They care about the student learning and being successful. There are so many different courses offered I couldn't name them all. The possibilities are endless. The class sizes are not too huge but big enough to have good discussions (about 30 students) and the teachers can answer specific questions.
College Sophomore,5,I have never felt unsafe on campus. Safety and security does an excellent job along with the police that monitor. Never heard of any campus crime or assaults. Everyone is completely safe at Union.
College Sophomore,5,"The dorms at Union are A+++. You get your own little apartment with three roommates including: huge common area, kitchen, two bathrooms (you share with one person), and YOUR OWN ROOM. Amenities include: fridge, stove, washer & dryer, couch, chairs, tables, desks, beds, dressers, and bathtubs. The cost is relatively cheap for what you get. Social atmosphere is great. You get roommates but still get the privacy of your own room. The RA's are amazing and literally always there to help you if you loose your key or get locked out or whatever. Also we have the Union Cup where all the dorm buildings compete in competitions for a huge trophy. Res life at Union rocks."
College Sophomore,5,"Greek life is so much fun. I am currently part of a sorority on campus, though if you would have told high school me that I would not believe you. But Greek life at Union is an entirely different experience than what you think of when you think of stereotypical sororities and fraternities. First of all, we only have 3 sororities and 3 fraternities, so it's not like there's much of a class system. Rush week is a really fun experience and there's no pressure to join if you don't want to, it's just a great way to meet new people. I joined Greek life because I met some very genuine and sweet girls during Rush and they seemed so generally happy and excited about being in their sisterhood. Their philanthropy really hit home for me personally and they all shared so many fun memories and events that they experience through their sorority and all the great friends they made. They also just seemed so generally passionate about the sorority nationally. Greek life at union is just a great way to have fun with friends. It's not about parties or getting wasted or crazy rituals you see in movies or hear about from wild schools. At union, Greek life is just a support system you can always lean on. Greeks are loved on campus, but so are non-Greeks. It doesn't really matter what you are- everyone will be friends with everyone. Every sorority/fraternity has their own house on campus where meetings are held and so on. However students are not allowed to live in the houses. The houses are extremely nice and well kept by the national conventions."
College Sophomore,5,"Union is the best. If I could choose any school in the country, I would still choose Union. The community at Union is unbelievable. The people are so inspiring, intelligent, loving, and accepting. My fellow students are among some of the most diverse and all around coolest people I have ever met. Teachers are wise and intentional with students. What makes Union unique is the fact that it is a Christian University with a high academic standard. It's different from other Christian universities because it encompasses Christianity into every class and subject -not just those classes that are specifically ""bible classes"". The academic challenges are great, the drive for excellence is apparent, and the Christianity love shared by all is undeniable."
College Sophomore,5,"My professors desire to enrich my life, and to pour into me, and help me develop as a person."
College Sophomore,5,"Union will help you so much in putting you into the job you want to be in. Union is like the Harvard of christian schools, and being a christian studies major that means a lot."
College Sophomore,5,"Union is a closed off campus at night, and no one is let on campus after 11:30p.m without a parking pass. at 2:00a.m no one is let on campus till 5:00a.m."
College Sophomore,5,"Union's housing is apartment style, and honestly makes school life easier. I have my own room, and share a bathroom with only 1 person."
College Sophomore,5,I was an active member of Alpha Tau Omega my first semester on campus and loved it.
College Sophomore,5,Union University is honestly the most amazing atmoshphere I've seen from a school. Upon entry into union you are loved from the start. you are surrounded by great people with the best instructors imaginable.
College Junior,5,The career center on campus is amazing and almost everyone I've talked to who have been there have been able to find a job or an internship.
College Student,5,"I always feel safe on campus. Everyone there is friendly, and I am completely comfortable walking around alone."
College Student,5,"Classes are small, and the professors are helpful. I'm not a Union student yet, but I like everything I've seen so far."
College Student,5,"If I attend Union, I will probably begin with a major in music education. The music department makes sure that their education majors get internships with local schools in order to learn more about teaching in a real environment from their first year of college. This also enables students to make connections in the schools so that they are better prepared to get jobs when they graduate."
College Student,5,"Union's dorms, which are ranked 3rd in the country, are like living in a palace compared to most college dorms."
Niche User,4,"Union University is a great, smaller university! The staff are supportive not only with your classes, but also with your spiritual walk."
Senior,4,"It's a very nice school. Very religious and laid back. It is just sooo expensive though and predominantly white. The connections you make are great, but once again, the tuition is very expensive."
Sophomore,4,My experience with Union has been great. I am a sophomore and also on the baseball team. The dorms are very nice and the professors are excellent. They care about how you are doing and not just how you make them look.
Alum,4,"Union provided rigorous academics and a great student life. My professors were top notch, and I know I could always go to them no matter what. I do wish the school were more accepting towards the LGBT community though."
Sophomore,4,I love Union!! I love the atmosphere. I love the teachers and how they are so open to help. The entire staff treats us like one of their own. We are never alone and have someone to always talk to
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are generally very approachable. If you need help with something, the President gives you his personal cell to contact him for help. From personal experience, it really means a lot to know that the President cares that much about each individual student.  We have Chapel at least twice a week on Wednesdays and Fridays. I love the worship times because the songs bring to mind God's goodness and praise him for his character. Lastly, the campus is very beautiful, especially during the changing seasons."
Sophomore,4,"My time at Union has been enjoyable. If you are looking for a school with little diversity, this is definitely the place for you. Most of the students are able to identify with one another. It has wonderful faculty who are willing to go above and beyond to help. I spent time in a program called Keystone, which has great teachers, and helped the students stay on track. They have a lot of activities happening on campus, and many different ways to get involved. My only regret with my time at Union, was not being able to live on campus, if you don't live there it can be difficult to stay plugged in."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I've enjoyed my experience with Union University. The academics are great, and I've especially enjoyed the dedicated study environment. However, I would like to see more campus events and student involvement."
Sophomore,4,"I love Union! There is no other place like it. The academics are challenging while still maintaining a fantastic Christian community. There are many groups on campus, so it is easy to find a place to fit in. If you can afford to attend, it is an experience you won't regret. Just beware of getting too comfortable and forgetting that the rest of the world won't be so kind."
Sophomore,4,Union University is such a great place! I love the home-like atmosphere that the students and professors create. I am a current sophomore there and have enjoyed my experience so far. It's a great place to grow spiritually and mature in your identity! You should totally come visit.
College Sophomore,4,"We have security on campus, she's very aggressive."
College Sophomore,4,Union really shows concern about their students. They do their best to meet every expectation.
College Sophomore,4,"GO BULLDOGS. Student involvement and support of our teams is huge. Everyone paints faces and gets all dressed up when its game day. Whether its a basketball, volleyball, soccer, or baseball game. Students are extremely supportive of their fellow student athletes. Union's basketball team just got bumped up a division so I guess you could say were pretty good. Everyone cheers for the Bulldogs and we all love our new real life mascot- Buster. The athletic facilities are very nice. 3 different gyms, tons of fields and field houses, an Olympic size pool, and a great workout facility. Intramural sports is also extremely popular for students and fun for everyone. Whether you play for a sorority or fraternity, make your own team with some friends, or cheer for your roommate along the sidelines."
College Freshman,4,I've mostly heard good things about people getting jobs after college from Union.
College Freshman,4,All of my professors are helpful and care about their subject and classes.
College Freshman,4,I really like the individual rooms.
College Freshman,4,I'm really glad that I picked this college.
College Junior,4,Health and Safety is very important at Union. Its a closed campus and the campus police have a very visible presence on campus.
College Junior,4,Union has great teachers who care about their students. It has amazing dorms and an amazing community but they can be very narrow minded at times.
College Junior,4,The dorms at Union are awesome! The social atmosphere that connects dorms on most campuses by floor or across a hallway is missing at Union because all of the dorm rooms open up to the outside.
College Junior,4,The entire school is very involved and supportive of the sports at the school.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is really helpful and there for you.
College Junior,4,The school does a good job of making sure that students are set up for opportunities after graduation. Many alumni come back to recruit for internships and jobs.
College Junior,4,"Although living on campus is pretty expensive, Union has some of the nicest dorms i have seen at any school."
College Junior,4,Union has been the best years of my life so far.
College Senior,4,"There is very little reported crime (bicycles being moved if unlocked is the most common problem). We have security officers patrolling at all hours. And the entrances are locked after hours, with people needing to come on campus requiring IDs to pass through the gate. I feel safe on campus, even after dark"
College Senior,4,"The professors are wonderful-- I have been invited over to the homes of many of my teachers, and even some that I have not had for classed. They care about the students as individuals and will support when hard times come, like health or family crisis. The courses are hard, but the classes sized are small and the teachers care about their subjects."
College Junior,4,"I usually feel safe on campus. Police

Cars drive around campus, securing the perimeters."
College Junior,4,I've enjoyed the professors and most courses
College Junior,4,I enjoyed living on campus. My roommates from freshman year are still my friends now.
College Junior,4,The environment is very positive. Teachers are very understanding. It's a great school to attend.
College Freshman,4,"I changed my major the day before classes began and they made the transition easy and simple. My car was broken into off campus and they helped me pay to replace stolen items. The dorm I lived in had some issues and they moved me quickly and easily into a better living environment, and I have suffered from Mono for the past month and my professors care about me and my success and are helping me the best that they can."
Recent Alumnus,4,I have loved most every professor I've had at Union. They are here because they love students and truly want to have genuine relationships with them.
College Freshman,4,"Although I need more, I was able to work with the school to get just enough in order to feel okay with attending Union but it is still not close to comfortable. I work regularly to apply for scholarships and have a part time job during the summers as well as a work-study during the year. Because I strive to put classes first, it isn't possible for me to work any more than I already do during the school year although I am always looking for small side jobs with friends in the area as I'm needed."
College Sophomore,4,I think there is a great amount of different options all around campus. And a ton are within a mile of campus!
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus at Union is great because, for the most part, the students are really spontaneous. Sometimes walking out of your dorm, you'll see an impromptu mini-concert on the lawn, or perhaps a quick game of soccer. Every year we have a Quidditch tournament between the dorms! We have movie nights, and lots of cute little get-togethers in the commons area for any and all students. The ResLife is really dedicated to the well-being of the students, so some nights get-togethers are replaced with workout/yoga nights, life lessons (like how to do taxes or change a tire), or even like what we are having this week - a seminar on what it's like to be a young adult living with depression, and where to find help. Campus life is great!"
College Freshman,4,"They are strict where they need to be strict, and they are lenient in the areas that they don't need to be to strict on."
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of chain restaurants around campus, but there are enough where it's not always the same food."
College Freshman,4,Safety and Security is always patrolling around campus.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are nice compared to other schools. There are four to a suit and each gets their own room. Freshman have one bathroom in the suit, a kitchen, and a sitting area. There is some furniture depending on where you live."
College Sophomore,4,"The gym facility is okay on campus. I do not pay attention to school athletics, therefore I do not know about team performances, fan support or school spirit."
College Sophomore,4,"Security personnel is very friendly and readily available. I feel very safe on campus, and feel security is readily available in case of emergency."
College Senior,4,"It's a small program, there are many opportunities to be invested in by the prof and students further along the program. Many practicum opportunities."
College Senior,4,It depends on the program. My program offers excellent courses.
College Senior,4,it's cheaper and not too far (if you live in cherry grove)
College Senior,4,super safe! I used to leave my window open all the time.
College Senior,4,Union has great financial support for students as well as on-campus jobs/workships for students in  need.
College Senior,4,There are many options from fast food to ethnic foods. People from surrounding towns come to eat in Jackson.
College Sophomore,4,"Typical fast food, more sit down places."
College Junior,4,"There was ALOT to do and buy before the semester starts. I felt comfort on knowing my books would be used the whole program, but the financial struggle is the biggest problem for me."
College Junior,4,"I was a transfer student and the process was fairly simple and everyone was very willing to help me. The financial part is tough and sometimes I feel like I won't be able to pay, but the payment plans do help. I'm a commuter and I wish there was a place for us to hang out and study and there isn't really anything like that for us. I feel left out in that way."
College Junior,4,The professors are very caring and willing to work with the students. The workload is tough but the environment and spirit of the school makes thing feel easier to work with.
College Junior,4,I don't party much but I hear some Greeks throw great parties
College Junior,4,Its great always gotten help when needed
College Junior,4,"The professors are great, workload is somewhat large depending on your major"
College Junior,4,LXA has been a great experience for me thus far but non-greeks and greeks have somewhat of an unspoken dislike of one another
College Junior,4,there is always something going one at Union
College Junior,4,There are a lot of different ethnicities and backgrounds due to missionary kids.
College Junior,4,Most all of my professors are very helpful and really care about how well you do.
College Junior,4,It is a great program with great professors and opportunities.
College Junior,2,"Based on personal experience, the school does not value athletics like most other schools do."
College Sophomore,2,Its a small Christian town
College Freshman,2,"At times, Cobo had good food that was also healthy but this was rare. The Lex had the same choices all the time and got old quickly. However, we are getting a new dining service this year so Cobo and the Lex no longer matter. Hooray!"
College Sophomore,2,Not like there's much of one because of Union's rules.
College Sophomore,2,The open dorm hours affect everyone's social life. Union thinks that if you have a person of the opposite sex in your dorm people are going to automatically do things they shouldn't be. Did they ever think that maybe we just have friends or people we need to help with school work?
College Sophomore,2,"For how much the school cost to attend, they should be offering many more scholarships than they do. All they want is your money, and all of it, but do not give it out very easily."
College Freshman,2,"There are lots of things that they are way too strict on, but that's just because it is a conservative Christian college. That's to be expected. I just personally believe some of the rules are based of the rule-maker's beliefs, not necessarily ""what the Bible says."""
College Senior,2,"If you are into open parties, we have greek life. If you want to party in general? this college isnt for you."
College Sophomore,2,Pretty crazy. There are tornados and ice storms in the spring.
College Sophomore,2,Pretty darn bad. Also the IT department is pretty slow.
College Freshman,2,Theres lots of places to shop and eat. But Jackson as a whole is incredibly boring. Really nothing to do here unless you go to Memphis or Nashville. Not really any attractions.
College Sophomore,2,"No one really cares about Varsity sports, and there is not much team school spirit. Some people probably don't even know who our mascot is. "
College Sophomore,2,"You can find off campus housing without too much difficulty, but getting permission to move off campus is TOUGH. 
"
College Sophomore,2,"There are quite a few places with student discounts, but everything is a chain. There are not really very many locally owned places. "
College Sophomore,2,"The available off campus housing varies on how far you are away from campus. The closest isn't very safe but you could easily walk to campus while the more far ones are safer and nicer, but a ways from campus."
College Freshman,2,There is a rather strict policy for dorm visitation that takes time getting used to. Also there is a strict policy against alcohol or drugs on campus or at fraternity/sorority houses.
College Sophomore,2,"NIghtlife at Union is not the greatest. There is only one ""club"" for students 18 and older. That specific place is nicknamed ""Desperate-ados"" because it is only a place people go to when they are absolutely desperate to do something, or to get laid. There is a pub for 21 and older students within walking distance of the campus that a lot of students enjoy during the week or weekends. Parties are never found on campus, but usually you can find a mediocre escape in the apartment complex also with in walking distance of the campus. In fact, some of those apartments are a stones throw from the dorms on the edge of campus. Many students choose to live in that complex which leads to lots of student parties held in the area. A common thing you will find there is a ""double-decker"" where you will find two apartments stacked on top of each other both throwing a party together for crowd control. A great party is found on average 3 times a semester; a less than impressive number when you know there are parties most weekends. If you are looking for a party school, Union is not the place for you."
College Sophomore,2,"I have received financial aid, but not without a fight. Also, it was no where near what they had originally said I was getting. I was promised $10,000 and only received $2,000. That's quite the drop. They did not let me know about this until one week before I was supposed to move in, leaving us to find and extra 8 grand. 
A few tips for getting financial aid would be:
1. Stay on top of those people. Absolutely bug them to death and they will finally give you answers and $$$
2. Write them letters explaining your circumstances for why you need the money. This has worked for several classmates of mine. 
3. Don't hold back. When you think bringing up your families issues financially, majors surgeries and medical issues, and even personal struggles sounds whine-y, use it anyways. These people need to hear how much you need the money. They want to know everything 
4. Lastly, show them you are going to work hard at the school. Discuss your current grades and plans to increase/keep them high(er)."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is known around campus to be pretty awful. I personally don't mind the taste and cooking, but do stay rather sick while I'm there. We have a cafeteria and a fast-food sort of service. The cafeteria just recently got a new head chef and food variety and quality has improved immensely since then."
College Sophomore,2,"If you come to Union looking for a party scene, you are at the wrong school. There are some sororities and fraternities which have parties, but other than that, you have to drive to Memphis for that kind of entertainment. However, there are concerts at least once a month at the coffee shop on campus and lots of other things to do if you look for them."
College Sophomore,1,"Jackson is pretty terrible. Everything that is here is pretty much shut down at 10 PM and there's a ton of crime. We're somewhat near Memphis, but not close enough to make a difference. Also the roads and parking lots are planned terribly."
College Sophomore,1,There are no transportation options here at Union.
College Sophomore,1,"They are very strict about dorm open hours, which means that most of the time you cannot have boys in your dorm at all. "
College Sophomore,1,There is none. It is extremely annoying. Parties are very hard to find--even clean parties.
College Senior,1,"Safety has become an issue here in Jackson, TN. There has been several shootings and gang activity."
College Freshman,1,"There is said to be a network via facebook to help students find rides to locations or possibly home but I have never found that page. Thankfully a majority of my friends have cars and I'm able to catch a ride with them wherever I go, plus there is a nice shopping center and very short walk from campus."
College Sophomore,1,"I have received some financial aid, however, it was an awful process. Also, the amount I received was far less than what was discussed prior to coming to union."
College Freshman,1,"The campus is not very diverse. It is mostly made up of Caucasian conservatives. However, the students are very accepting of other races. I've never seen anyone discriminate because of race on the campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Strict Campus – Outside of residence life, most of the rules are pretty fair, and the ones that are overbearing aren't really enforced very often. Residence life is another matter. Open dorm hours here aren't implemented very well. You can only have members of the opposite sex in your living room area between 2-10 on Friday and Saturday, and 12-6 on Sunday. These rules are enforced very strictly, and the punishments can be very severe for breaking them. Aside from that, you are not allowed to drink alcohol at all while attending school, even if you are legal, or if it takes place away from campus. They are also fairly strict about homosexuality here. You can get in trouble for just being seen holding hands with a member of the same sex and anything beyond that can get you kicked out of the school. For the straight people on campus, it's a little better, but not by much."
College Senior,1,"Absolutely the worst, full of fiber though, willing to let you go loose in the bathroom"
College Junior,1,The school does not offer scholarships for Second Degree Nursing students so you must get outside financial aid or loans.

Alum,5,"I had no online learning, but if I had needed it, I am sure I would have not had any issues. Using blackboard for certain assignments was quick, efficient and convenient."
Alum,5,"Talk about prestige! Not only for Black students , but for others who come and excel in engineering, nursing, vet school and so many more degree programs. I was a product of Basil- the building that built me into the best nurse I could have ever imagined being: strong, confident, intuitive, special, and driven! Tuskegee gave me a grounded education and solid nursing sisters to go through the program with. I ""balled"" laughing with the friends I made on the yard and ""parlayed"" down the ave during the times I was free from studying. Nothing takes away from the experiences I enjoyed, whether it be winning the freshman talent show, joining the Golden Voices Concert choir, being a contestant in the Miss Black and Gold Scholarship Pageant, joining the 1st Black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc., serving as treasurer of my beloved sorority, joining the Women's Glee club and graduation itself. There is so much to see, experience, and enjoy in the pride of the swift growing south!"

Senior,5,I was able to break out of my shell and become the person who I am today. Meeting people and getting to know them really helped a lot in my development as a human being.
Sophomore,5,"When they say we are all family it is the truth. Professors work closely with students who are having trouble, and the tutors are are  very knowledgeable. The classrooms are small; it is easier to focus on each student not like colleges with 100+  students in each class. Here everyone knows everyone no matter what you are involved in.  Every single staff member from whether they are a professor, custodian, or cafeteria worker go above and beyond for the students here. The Alumni provide internships and other extracurricular opportunities for students here, and it is so enlightening. They are the most supportive people I have ever met besides my family back home. Tuskegee is a second home to me. Whether some one joins an organization, sports, or any other extracurricular at the school everyone is family, and we support them. The atmosphere is amazing. I would recommend this college to any one wanting to attend an HBCU and entering the STEM field. Tuskegee is the best choice."
Sophomore,5,"When I first heard about Tuskegee University, I knew I wanted to go there because of the historical significance. I looked at videos and pictures and instantly felt that Tuskegee is where I belong. The African American culture caught my attention. Seeing black excellence is such a wonderful feeling and it makes me appreciate my culture and where I come from. Everyone is so friendly and it felt like I've known them for years. I love it and I highly recommend it to others."
Freshman,5,"Everyone at Tuskegee, particularly the teachers and students welcomes everyone regardless if you’re from across the globe. The staffs in the bursar office,  Financial aid office and etc. are very unprofessional and bitter which makes it a challenge for students, parents and more to communicate with them."
Niche User,5,Tuskegee is an amazing University!! Their homecoming is unlike any other homecoming at an HBCU! Their engineering program is one of the best in the country  producing some of the finest black engineers in the country. The nursing program is very challenging but produces some of the best black nurses in the country.
Freshman,5,"I have had the chance to meet wonderful/ amazing people, and I do not know where I would be without these excellent people in my life. I love how Tuskegee is an HBCU school, and you get to connect with your professors and some of the classrooms are high school class sizes.

Sophomore,5,"I love this school, despite the things I’ve been through. I made a lot of connections with fellow students, and that’s saying a lot considering the fact that I’m pretty shy. The campus life is what really gets you. I would say to make the best out of your experience, join as many things as you possibly can. That’ll make other things easier for you. Also, utilize the things the camp i offers to further your education."
Niche User,5,"Tuskegee University is a eye opening school. What excited me the most is the environment and how several of historical black achievements have been accomplished. Although, I had basketball offers I decided to attend Tuskegee in the fall semester of August 2019. I'm more than 100% sure that Tuskegee is the school for me. Especially being that I want to become a successful black woman. It's a automatic process being that Tuskegee offers sororities & several other extra-curricular activities. After visiting open house I noticed how the upper classmen were very supportive amongst their other colleagues. Its very apparent and obvious why Tuskegee is one of the top 10 HBCU's. I wouldn't miss the opportunity to attend for anything!"
Freshman,5,"Tuskegee University is a great school. Attending here, I’ve learned so much in such a small amount of time both history and academically.

Freshman,5,"Tuskegee is one of the best schools for me because it has one of the best veterinarian programs. I believe this program will most definitely help me pursue my dreams of becoming a great veterinarian doctor of all times.  Tuskegee University has its ups and downs but the people there are so friendly and supportive that they will help you with anything you need help with. The admissions office is very generous. They seem to be so concerned about you and is willing to do anything. They also look out for you, say, for instance, if they know you are missing very important documents for you to be admitted into the college, they will call and email you throughout the day till they get in touch with you. Tuskegee is a Historical Black College. There will be competition everywhere you go from dressing good, sororities, fraternities, overall just making sure you look good and also having good grades.

Freshman,5,"Fortunately, there is a lot that I would like to see change I can't see it all happening in a year. I wish the dorms were more architected and fix up these historical buildings. The student life and the involvement of them is what really makes this place worthwhile. You will meet people that might make your experience here truly interesting. I want better working vending machines and better food offered at the cafe. Although it isn't mandatory to eat there, it would be good because sometimes you have to lower your standards and make it work. The good thing is you can choose from a variety of foods I guess. Sometimes, the party scene could really be better but that's alright."
Freshman,5,"My first year at Tuskegee University has been a complete culture shock. I am a city girl from Los Angeles California. One could only imagine my surprise when entering the rural area of the deep south. The first semester was full of adapting to accents,  food, and limited resources. My second semester I wanted to focus on changing my study habits. The entire year has been challenging because it is my first time away from home. But Tuskegee University has helped me adjust to their family-oriented faculty."
Alum,5,"Tuskegee University is not only a University but it is a home. Tuskegee University raised me into the woman I am today.

Tuskegee University teaches you to make a difference in your community with our education."
Alum,5,"I really loved my overall Tuskegee experience. I chose the school initially based on the vet school reviews, but I decided to pursue a B.S. in biology. It proved to be an excellent chose, as I was given the best department leads at the school. I was involved in extracurricular activities, mainly band. Band alone allowed me to meet and befriend some of the most amazing and talented people. The students are what make the experience and Tuskegee University will be your welcome ticket to the south."

The teachers want to help you and see you succeed. They help with summer internships that may lead to jobs in the future. The people, classmates are willing to help as well. The campus holds many facts. It's such a historical place with a statue to represent. The campus may be old looking but behind it is a wonderful meaning and wonderful people there to help a person strive to be there best."
Freshman,5,"My name is Aliceah Wilson and I’m currently a Freshman student at “Tuskegee University”. There’s numerous of reasons why I chose to come to an “Hbcu” but I will just share a few . One of my main reasons why I chose Tuskegee was because when I was a senior in high school I spent lots of time looking up how certain colleges would benefit me and I came across this school . I was so hyped about how important the school history was to African Americans , starting from the history of Booker t Washington for being an important aspect to Tuskegee, and even the famous history on the Tuskegee airmen , the first black to fly . Black colleges are important because it helps you understand your importance as a young black person and helps you understand how meaningful education was to African Americans by creating our very own colleges to show the future we can be great as well and I will continue to show my greatness as a student at Tuskegee university as a well respected college."

I love that the must knowing I can be involved with my teachers instead of sitting in a class filled 50 or more people trying to get help from my teacher. This school feel like home, and the people here helps each other.  There is so much going on campus from speak-outs, or bible study, or fashion shows for students. I can email my academic adviser and she will email be back quickly when I need guidance. Tuskegee offers tutors, and counselors for us."

Freshman,4,This school is amazing from the staff all the way to the students. This school also has the best homecoming week and it really gives you that HBCU experience.
Niche User,4,Tuskegee is a wonderful school. I have enjoyed living on campus and working throughout my days. I would definitely recommend this school to anyone in the animal science fields.
Freshman,4,"After completing my first semester at Tuskegee University I would say I love it there, everything isn't perfect but I've made a family there and I love my University and I wouldn't change it for the world. The food is college food nothing sometimes good sometimes bad.  Some professors are willing to go the extra mile to help you some are not, luck of the draw. The campus is beautiful and rustic but could use some updates. Overall a great school to be. GO GOLDEN TIGERS!"
Junior,4,"If we had more money, most of the current issues would be totally fixed! There is no place like an HBCU, and the overall experience at Tuskegee is one that is unmatched."
Niche User,4,"Tuskegee was a really good experience and I only stayed for a week. I never felt lost or out of place, everyone was very nice and caring towards me.

Niche User,4,"My experience at Tuskegee University was friendly and approachable. I say this because when I arrived, the students were nice and welcomed you with open arms.  My father and I went because of open house. Current students and visitors met in the chapel where they had sing-a-longs and words from administration. The campus tour was well organized. We were able to meet some of the professors and see the classrooms. The food was decent for an open house. We did not go in side the dorms or commons but we did get to see the buildings which were nice."
Graduate Student,4,"This school will help you find your pat, one way or the other. You will have support , love and family no matter where you go after you graduate from this illustrious university. The downfall of attending a small, private school like this is that they are very old school in handling paperwork and this may cause you to run around to get things done but it prepares you for whatever  the world may throw your way."
Junior,4,"Tuskegee University saved me. When I graduated High School I chose to go to a big PWI a few hours away from home and was miserable. After going on a tour of Tuskegee I instantly felt at home and welcomed. Transferring has been the best decision I made. The atmosphere has made me feel at home, the professors make sure you learn and the students feel like family. My only complaint is the facilities aren't up to date and could use some work especially considering the cost of tuition."
Junior,4,"Tuskegee University is a campus built of family and support. I've never felt unsafe or unsupported during my experience here. On every corner there is another student, a professor, or other faculty members ready to help you with any troubles or issues that occurs.

You won't regret it
Niche User,4,Visting Tuskegee University is great the campus is very historical. And so is the events for students and the locals in the area.  Even thought Tuskegee is an HBCU it still has diversity.
Sophomore,4,"Picking the college that is right for you is hard. I can hands down say this is the best decision I have ever made. Although the school is pretty pricey, I wouldn’t want to be anywhere else. I’m a sophomore and within a year I have turned friends into family. I use to have really bad anxiety in high school and being at Tuskegee makes me feel like I’m at home, I’m able to be myself. My mental health has become has reached a new scale of healthy. It’s hard wondering how I’m going to afford to continue my education here but I’m persistent on staying here. Although it hurting my pockets heavily because I’m paying for school myself, I love my school."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Tuskegee University has been pretty good. The best part would have to be the social interactions. You meet some great people here, make some connections, social networking. And they events and activities are fun as well. I feel like they could work on the academics and faculty though. Some of the teachers just make it difficult to learn anything there and the faculty needs some extreme help they will having you running around the school just to get one thing accomplished. One person is telling you something and another is telling you something totally different. They need to work on there work ethic and communication. Other then that Tuskegee University is a great school."
Junior,4,"The school has a very strong community. Being that it is a small, private university, you get to see familiar faces everywhere. The historical landmark status of the university truly makes you feel like a part of the history here. The biggest drawback is the slow response time of the administrative department."
Sophomore,4,"Tuskegee University is great school to attend. The people there are so nice, you really feel the southern hospitality."
Sophomore,4,My Freshman year at Tuskegee was a bit rough but was definitely worth the experience because it taught me self- motivation and endurance. I definitely lived life my freshman year and met a ton of great people. My sophomore year will be much more academically draining but I know it will all be worth it at the end of the day.
Sophomore,4,"My positive experience with Tuskegee started with my college road trip tour of the university. Everyone there was welcoming, helpful, and overall had my best interest at heart. What I like most about Tuskegee is the wide range of programs they offer. For me, aspiring to work in the field of Vet medicine, Tuskegee was a great choice due to their high ranking in best vet programs. Tuskegee is well rounded in the science, engineering, architectural, and business studies, but I feel they would do even better with more fine art programs."
Senior,4,"I had a very pleasant so far at Tuskegee University. I have been a part of the Tuskegee University Pre-Alumni Council, the Debate Club, a tutoring program called Next Step Up, and I am a resident assistant (RA) at Tuskegee for their residence halls. I met a lot of friends and enjoy my time being at an historic HBCU."
Niche User,4,"My experience at Tuskegee was relatively positive. While the classes are definitely not easy, most of the teachers do their part to try to help the students understand the material. The dorms are in need of work, and the quality of the food could be improved as well. Even still, Tuskegee has an air of homeliness that makes you feel like you belong."
Senior,4,Tuskegee is a good HBCU but it needs better looking dorm/housing for the amount of tuition that we pay.
Freshman,4,It's a great school. HCBU's are always great to attend. The campus is very nice many historical places to visit and museums. The campus life is decent. Depending on your dorm room situation it can either be good or bad. Incoming freshman  out of state may have some trouble getting in touch with the help services just try your best to call early to make sure you can talk to someone to help you out.
Freshman,4,I like the Tuskegee University is enriched with history. I've learn more about black history during my first semester than I ever learned in school before. The downside of it being a Historically Black University is that the buildings are old. Major repairs need to be done to the infrastructure of the University but over than that the experience is one I could never forget.
Graduate Student,4,Tuskegee University is a very good university based on academics and extra curricular activities. I love the atmosphere and the ability to learn in the subject I have dreamed since I was young.
Sophomore,4,"Overall Tuskegee University has been a great experience. I came here when I was only 16 years old, and the environment is very tight and feels very similar to a large family. The fact that this university is private keeps the amount of students relatively low which allows smaller classes and more opportunities for one-on-one teacher to student experiences. Here I am very involved and very familiar with all of my professors and those in my department know me by name. This is extremely helpful because when you have a personal relationship with leaders, it opens more doors for greater opportunities and connections. The Tuskegee experience so far, has been a joy to me and I would encourage any high school students to choose this as their college choice."
Freshman,4,Very fun and exciting HBCU experience! You’ll love the people from all over you meet and binds you build
Freshman,4,Great learning experience with a rich history.  The class size is great for reaching your fullest potentisl.of learning
Junior,4,"I love the people and the education. I can honestly say that I love my university. I came into the school completely blind due to my past experiences. I love the fact that I am surrounded by People that look just like me. The most important part is that there as smart and as motivated as me. I wouldnt rather be anywhere else. TU, you know !"
Freshman,4,My overall experience at Tuskegee University has been very good. It would be even better if there were more places to go to and eat at around campus.
Sophomore,4,When I first got to Tuskegee University. I felt alone and was very home sick. The students and staff welcomed me in the school with open arms and now I feel more comfortable and I'm not home sick anymore.

Freshman,4,My experience here was great! It is a big family environment. The school has great education. I loved it.
Niche User,4,"Last year during spring break, a group of kids and I came to Tuskegee University on a college tour. At the time it was reading so there was a gloomy setting to the scene. The first thing we did was eat lunch. Not only was the food great but the students there were very helpful. The campus is huge but my favorite part was when the A.K.A's did their stroll and let everyone else join in for a dance."
Niche User,4,"I attended the prestige Tuskegee University from the year 2012 until 2013. Tuskegee offers a wide variety of majors, minors, & extracurricular advancements. Though an awesome school the price of tuition was too much for my single mother to handle."
Freshman,4,It's only my first year and so far it's been great. I have been enjoying myself and have made friends very quickly. The workload isn't as hard as you make it to be and you can always go to the professors for help if needed.
Freshman,4,"I am a new incoming freshman so I will  have that much experience from this school. But however I have done research on it is the place to be to further your understanding of different cultures. This so was founded by George Washington Carver, Booker T. Washington,  and Lewis Adams three great men who wanted to give back to their people."
Freshman,4,"My overall experience at Tuskegee was a challenging. This year was my first year and it took a lot of time to get adjusted to my new environment. But, luckily I had friends, professors, and tutoring programs to help me through the semester."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is a historic land mark and its ability to remain in time can be beneficial and hendering. Our lack of technology and needed resources can be frustrating.  Most professors are good teachers. However, you have the occasional crackpot professor who should have retired before the stone age. The food is a hit and a miss, and if you are out of points then your out of luck. We question where our funds go because most of the dorms are still communist showers, and some are offline.  We have a little diversity but the majority is African-American."
College Freshman,4,"I don't know, this will be my first time attending this school."
College Freshman,4,Everybody is different in their own way and that's what makes the teams at the school great
College Sophomore,4,"The school spirit is phenomenal during football season. The seats are filled with current student, alumni, and family. Everyone loves home games and support the team with great effort. Even though our facilities are not up to par, that does not tarnish our spirits.We enjoy our football games, basketball games, and volleyball games through out the year."
College Sophomore,4,"Attending Tuskegee University, allowed me to broaden my views and perspective of life. I was able to face challenges and conquer them with no problem. Being away from home for the first time, allowed me to gain more maturity and wisdom. I became involved in various clubs, and was introduced to many activities I never thought I would be interested in. I became a tour guide for ""The Oaks,"" home of Booker T. Washington, and a volunteer at the George Washington Carver Museum. I also went through woods with my professors, searching for streams to test the water for alkalinity, hardness, and pH, due to an internship I earned through out the school year. I met new people and created new bonds. I believe I enhanced my knowledge in the field of Chemistry, and I am ready to learn more of it so that I can be the best at anything I decide to do. I was invited to do an internship at Iowa State University under the Center for Biorenewable Chemicals, and I proudly accepted it. I finished my first year with a 4.0 grade point average. My first year of college was very successful, and I plan on many more successful years at Tuskegee University."
College Sophomore,4,I feel that attending Tuskegee gives you a great chance at getting a career after college.
College Sophomore,4,I fell pretty much safe around campus.
College Sophomore,4,I love my school. Its very family orientated and the people there are so nice and caring!
College Sophomore,4,"My overall college experience has been a very interesting experience. I traveled from the busy big city of Los Angeles,California to the country small town of Tuskegee,Alabama which was a complete culture shock as it was more slow pace with spacious land. The expired fe was truly humbling, fun, challenging at times and took me out of my comfort zone. It took me out my comfort zone being that I am the only child and first in my family to attend college so it was all new to me, but none of the less helped me to have a new found of independence and growth as I learned more about myself as a person. The professors were all very welcoming, motivating, and helped ease us into our journey from high school to college. Also the campus events were always fun and interesting rather they were a campus party or a forum on police brutality there is always something going on and something to be apart of on campus."
College Freshman,4,"I wouldn't say we have the greatest diversity on campus, but we have diversity. We have other races other than African American, we have people that is from over seas. Most people if not all students are accepting of it and are friends with these students."
College Freshman,4,"It is great to live on campus because if something is going on on campus you won't have to try to find a way to campus when you already on it. The social atmosphere is okay, I wouldn't say it is bad or horrible. The housing process did send my packets to the wrong address twice, but other than that it is good."
College Freshman,4,"We do not have Greek housing, the Greeks live with everyone else. They are not stuck up or anything like that, they are just like everybody else. They don't think they are better than anybody else besides the other Greeks but its only a competitive thing. Other than that they are friendly especially to the others Greeks."
College Freshman,4,Its been a great experience so far
College Junior,4,Main focus is football. Football season gets lit.
College Junior,4,"We get L-I-T, especially during homecoming."
College Junior,4,Party life at Tuskegee is pretty fun.
College Junior,4,"My experince was pretty good. The professors are very supportive and work with you, but only if you try to do the work and participate in their class. Class size is no more than about 30 and the professors are interactive."
College Sophomore,4,"I was living in one of the good dorms , so i didnt experience any trouble. I did suffer from a dirty roommate and that was bothersome. Also it was very easy the housing process . Some dorms are terrible and too small for living. Everyone doesnt get along , but not a lot of disputes in the dorm. RAs were very helpful."
Sophomore,2,"The first semester was great, after paying my tuition and doing everything I needed to do I made friends on campus, I attended my classes, which I thought were fun, got my grades, and left. Second semester however, I was shown the very very poor management system the college has in terms of managing payments as I was locked out of my dorm and forced to sleep on a couch for almost a week because the office students were to pay at was closed for the week. Don't come here unless you have a great scholarship or money isn't a problem. The people and education are wonderful, but the hassle you go through with basic management of your financial aid isn't worth that."
Alum,2,"College is about what you make it. It was okay. The dorms where not very well put together. Bats would fly into dorm rooms at night, and there isn't much to do in the town. The school tries do have activities but majority are partying or sports based."
Senior,2,"I love Tuskegee as an academic institution; however, housing at Tuskegee is horrible. The people in the housing office do not care about the students at all."
College Freshman,2,All money goes to the football team and it still isn't enough to do much for them.
College Freshman,2,My school does't have a lot of resources and I feel like I'm all on my own. All my school cares about is its history.
College Sophomore,2,Only certain dorms are decent and may seem to be nice. However the older dorms are in terrible condition and need to be updated tremendously and more modernized.
College Freshman,2,"we have a bad pest issue, there are ant hills every where a stray animals all over. most dorms are bad, poor outlets, foul smell, looks very old inside. a one way heating and cooling system so its either extra hit or extra cold."
College Sophomore,2,They are over-rated here. They are the popular kids on campus but don't function as contributing members of the community for the most part. They are very exclusive and tend to alienate non-greeks. I don't see any purpose for them here.
College Sophomore,2,Housing is not the greatest! We have 3 good/nice dorms all others are a major issue and need to be remodeled!
College Sophomore,2,there are not many options
College Freshman,2,"There aren't an y nice restaurants. Only fast food dining, unless I traveled thirty minutes to auburn or montgomery."
College Sophomore,2,it could be a lot better
College Freshman,2,Theres only a few places off campus to go in Tuskegee. In order to get a wide variety of food you would have to go to wither Auburn or Montgomery. Late night the only place open in Tuskegee is McDonalds and not everyone care to eat McDonalds all the time. The same thing everyday gets boring.
College Freshman,2,"My experience as a freshman dealing with the food on campus was interesting. For the longest I was using actual money to buy food from Austins, the C store, and Kickin Chickin because I wasn't informed that I could use my points/ flex dollars. At first the cafe food was good but after a while eating the same thing every week got old. There's really no where to go off campus except the coop, McDonalds, burger king, taco bell/ KFC, and churchs. Walking is kind of far so its best to have a car. When I don't want to go to the car I go to Austins because they have more variety than Kickin Chickin but that too begins to get old after having it so much."
College Freshman,2,The only reason why attractions and activities are very bad in Tuskegee because there is not much to do here. We have to go to Auburn to get things done like shopping. The atmosphere is pretty rural and quiet here.
College Freshman,2,"There are not many choices because Tuskegee is in the middle of no where. We have KFC, Burger King, McDonald, Pizza Hut, Subway and a Taco Bell. That is pretty much it There needs to be more healthy choices around and more fancier restaurants for fine dining. The cost is average and there are really no student discounts."
College Freshman,2,There are a few off campus apartments and they are old. To get a decent apartment you have to stay in the next town over which is thirty minutes away. Commuting back and forth to campus can really add up to be very expensive which is why it is better to just stay on campus.
College Freshman,2,The nearest hospital if anything happens is in another town that is more than an hour away. There is hardly any law enforcement established in the town itself.
College Freshman,2,"This town is pretty desolate. I don't leave campus much, but when I do I go to Auburn or Montgomery. I don't not stay in Tuskegee because there is nothing here."
College Freshman,2,I don't even know who they are. They are very hidden on campus until there's a party. I wish they were out more.
College Junior,2,The police are very strict in parking. Weekly I notice that someone has a ticket or a boot on his or her car. They do not allow drinking or smoking at any school event.
College Sophomore,2,It's a small rural area and not many places to eat
College Sophomore,2,Bad first year. Hopefully it will be better with the new president. Hopefully.
College Sophomore,2,Just like three places to eat.
College Junior,2,The off-campus housing is satisfactory. There are a number of apartments surrounding the campus but availability is limited. There are also some nicer apartments located in the rural area of town but there is no public transportation and it makes it difficult for those students that do not have vehicles.
College Sophomore,2,Financial assistance is terrible at Tuskegee.
College Sophomore,2,Reasons: Houses and apartments are old. Plumbing not good at all. No public transportation so living more than 5 blocks away is impossible.
College Sophomore,2,Does not fit with class schedules and non existent on the weekends
College Freshman,2,"Most people who don't live on campus live in Auburn, the next city over"
College Freshman,2,"If its past nine, you're out of luck my friend. Very slim pickings, definitely for those who want to eat healthy."
College Freshman,2,"In Tuskegee, Al there is Tuskegee University and that's about all. Seriously one club, McDonalds, Taco Bell, overpriced grocery store. That's pretty much all to do here."
College Freshman,2,"Almost everybody on campus drinks, and a lot of people smoke. The only way you get caught is if your school does a drug test."
College Sophomore,2,Very few places to shop. Travel to other cities to shop. Cultural events are offered around the campus.
College Student,2,Best to have your own transportation
College Freshman,2,"The quality of food at the local restaurants is good but the chain restaurants quality is bad. We only have McDonald, KFC, subways, taco bell, and pizza hut. The pizza hut doesn't even deliver."
College Freshman,2,"The shuttle to class are usually late, the shuttle to take you to the nearest grocery store or mall only comes on Saturdays and thats not even every Saturday. So if you have a care bring it if not make friends with someone with a car and always have gas money."
College Sophomore,2,Everyone is segregated. Wish we all would come along as a family 
College Sophomore,2,It isn't safe in Tuskegee 
College Sophomore,2,"It's too strict, We are all adults"
College Sophomore,2,"Pros : School spirit, everyone on campus has a positive attitude, the freedom 
Cons: the violence, tuition is too high, the food needs improvement "
College Freshman,2,There is not really anything fun to do around town besides two small clubs. 
College Junior,2,"Tuskegee University was founded since 1881. The buildings are very historic and old looking. The buildings in my opinion are in horrible condition compared to other universities especially dormitories. The housing process is lazy, they will take forever to process you in a dorm and will mess up and put you in the wrong dorm."
College Junior,2,"We have TUPD but it seems like when you need them, they are no where to be found. But when you trying to avoid them, they are everywhere. 2 students were killed this semester because of violence which is very sad to me. I feel like we do need stronger security."
College Junior,2,"The wifi is horrible. When im in my on-campus apartment, the wifi will cut off at random times. I was taking a online test and the network cut off which shut down my test. I had to beg my teacher to let me retake my test and it wasn't my fault. The printing is pretty good only from 9am-5pm. After that the library is the only source of printing, IF THEY HAVE PAPER!! Yes it is important to have your own computer so you could do class assignments that are giving online."
College Junior,2,"Everyone I know smokes  but they are still able to get their work done in school and function. It is a bad thing but the people that I hang around, it doesn't effect them in any way possible. But yes I believe that 70% of the school uses drugs."
College Junior,2,Atmosphere is bad. Its always conflict between us!
College Junior,2,The school is strict on a few things but lenient on most.
College Sophomore,2,Security is very poor and really needs to improve especially because their are alot young people around.
College Sophomore,2,"The school is a HBCU; therefore, it comprises mainly of African American students. However, there is a small population of Caucasians and orientals especially in the Veterinarian college."
College Junior,2,"Parking can be a nightmare but you have to come early to get a good parking space so that you can make it to class on time. Plus, make sure you do not get towed."
College Sophomore,2,"Tuskegee, Alabama is a very rural town with unpredictable weather. In the summer and fall months Tuskegee is very hot and humid. There is always the chance of unpredictable rain which is very strong rain as well as very strong winds . With severe rain storms and heavy winds classes rarely get cancelled. In the winter the air is very dry and I tend to get nose bleeds which affect my focus within my classes. But, all and all when the weather is nice the campus life is fun."
College Sophomore,2,"Off-campus housing in Tuskegee is not necessarily the safest option. Living in Auburn is less convenient and more expensive but definitely worth it. In Tuskegee, off-campus housing is very cheep but aren't always in the best environment. I feel as though you pay for what you get. If you live in Auburn and pay more for rent, it will be worth it. Driving to Tuskegee everyday is worth it versus living off-campus in Tuskegee."
College Junior,2,The school supports football but that's about it.  There's no track for the track team and the tennis team does good but no one comes out to support.
College Junior,2,"There are only the few fast food restaurants off campus, there isn't really much to choose from unless drive to auburn."
College Sophomore,2,"Tuskegee is extremely small. There really isnt much to shop for unless it hair products and food. There is no walmart, you have to catch the campus shuttle to Montgomery to get to walmart unless you have a car then you can just go to auburn which is 20 mins out from skegee. but basically anything small you need can be found in skeegee but if you really wanna go grocery shopping or regular shopping with your friends you A) need your own car/friends car or B) need to catch the shuttle on the weekends to the Montgomery Mall and/or walmart"
College Sophomore,2,"Not really much around here to get just a few things like McDonalds, Subway, Burger. No real restaurants like outback, applebees, or chilis."
College Junior,2,The weather varies tremendously. One day it might be 60 degrees and the next day it's 85 degrees. It might rain one minute and then becomes a nice sunny 10 minutes later.
College Senior,2,The Tuskegee University diversity is fairly low in terms of color of skin. However I have come to find that diversity can come in many other ways as far as language and culture. Tuskegee University is a Historical Black College and/or University so history I believe makes our University more diverse.
College Freshman,2,"Restaurants are not a premium in Tuskegee. It has not really developed into a colege town yet. There are alot of ""mom"" and pop"" type restaurants where the food is very tasty. If you want more of a variety, you can go to Auburn or Opelika which is about 15 minutes away."
College Junior,2,"Since Tuskegee is in the middle of nowhere in the country, options are limited. When I say limited, I mean limited. There are maybe 3 clubs, same people throw the same parties, were better off having a house party and saving $10 to dance at the same club every weekend and listen to the same DJ play the same music."
Niche User,1,No communication. When you email some of the professor they don't respond in a timely manner.  They need to be more professional when working with others. No one should have to wait days for response
Niche User,1,My daughter attends TU this was her year to graduate from the nursing program this past summer. Due to Covid-19 they were unable to complete their preceptorship which they need to graduate. The University made them come back in the fall to complete the program. This was an extra $6000 that had to be spent.  Now since school started in August some of the students still have not started their preceptorship and the semester ends in November and they need 200hrs to graduate. Not only did she do 4yrs plus this 1/2 year they have the nerve to still say they can't complete the program unless they have 200hrs. This is no fault of them but fault of the school who assigns them the preceptorship. It's sad that they don't take in consideration what's going on in the world and expect these students to complete something they gave them no time to complete. No one gives you answers they are RUDE. I just want her to have what she worked hard for and that's her Nursing degree. Answers needed!!
Freshman,1,You can never reach your financial advisors. For the money you are paying the school is in poor condition. The one good thing it is a family environment but we are still lacking a lot for the cost.
College Freshman,1,The dorms are old and have mold. They don't care about how we live on campus and they constantly fine us for things in the dorms.
College Junior,1,"Most of our residence halls and campus apartments are somewhat outdated. I recently moved to another apartment due to black mold growing in the closet of my previous. My new apartment does not have the same amount of space, so I am in between cities bring my valuables back and forth. Before my previous apartment was completely evacuated, the mold in my closet had already been painted over, yet, it took me 3 days to move into my new apartment due to the lack of communication between faculty and maintenance to bring a new mattress to my room. Housing costs absolutely too much for the facilities we are afforded to be in the conditions that they are."
College Senior,1,"Housing is only relatively good if you stay in an honors dorm. Other housing options including off campus living and on campus apartments are literally atrocious. Last semester the school ran out of space, and had to force students to stay in the hotel on campus! Amenities are sparse, maintenance is sparse, cleanliness is sparse, space is sparse, and although some dorms have been refurbished, it still feels like they just painted over the cracks."
College Sophomore,1,Could be better at the amount me pay for school.
College Freshman,1,"I absolutely hate my dorm. The girls are loud, nasty, and ratchet. The bathroom is always a mess on my floor but other floors tend to be cleaner. It honestly depends on which dorm you are in because there are 3 other girls dorms i would love to stay but the one im in currently is a tragedy"
College Freshman,1,"Tuskegee University is by far one of the most overrated schools in my opinion. The classes are not difficult at all, and the professors here, treat you as if you are still in high school."
College Sophomore,1,Lewis Adams Hall is not a good dorm.
College Freshman,1,the only places near campus are mcdonalds and taco bell which are very unhealthy
College Freshman,1,"We just have the basics, McDonalds, Burger King, Taco Bell, KFC, Subway, Pizza Hut and Chinese. McDonalds is  the only thing open late night."
College Freshman,1,"The only off campus dining options are McDonalds, Taco Bell, KFC, PizzaHut, Subway, a Chinese place, and three small local businesses."
College Junior,1,Tuskegee is in the middle of nowhere. One has to have a car/bus to take him or her to the nearest Wal-Mart. We have a Dollar General but that is not Wal-Mart by far. There are museums on campus but that is the only attraction Tuskegee has.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I don't interact with the community as much because I no longer live in Tuskegee.  The community really stays to themselves.  I feel like there are many opportunities there but everyone is looking to get away from the town as soon as they get what they want instead of trying to uplift the community and make it better.  Tuskegee University is a prestigious university and there are many people who come through the university who could make big changes that would improve the community, but like I said people don't stay."
College Sophomore,1,They don't want to share their money.
College Junior,1,only 3  fast food places. No restraunts
College Sophomore,1,Limited of choices locally. Must travel 50 miles for variety of dining.
College Sophomore,1,Getting someone to answer the phones on the many attempts.  Was informed to apply for various aids offered however no one contacted me as to why I did not receive aid. A major problem.
College Freshman,1,If you know people you can get around.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do here
College Sophomore,1,"The transportation at Tuskegee is very poor.  The bus only goes to Auburn on the weekends and during the week I have to walk, plus the school is very isolated."
College Sophomore,1,"We have shuttle that are suppose to run from 8-5, but doesn't follow the schedule. Not very many pick up locations. There is no off campus transportation, best opinion is to find someone with a car to give you a ride"
College Sophomore,1,"Housing is pathetic and ridiculous, the price is over the top in relationship to the value of the buildings. Only two renovated dorms available on campus but the price is still outrageous"
College Sophomore,1,There are very few options for off-campus dining. The options that are available closed early so those late night meals are out of the question.
College Sophomore,1,There are very few eateries and none within walking distances. Often the workers have poor attitudes and the food is not good.
College Sophomore,1,"The parking at Tuskegee is awful. The permit costs are outrageously expensive. The city is so small there is hardly anywhere to park. The parking is not strictly enforced, but when it is they do random searches for parking permits and they give out tickets. That is not fair to the people that paid for the parking permits for the beginning of the year when everyone gets to park on campus for free."
College Junior,1,"Restaurants in Tuskegee are horrible. Because this is a small and historical town, there are only four fast food restaurants and a few other privately own food places. Although the town is small, a short drive to Auburn or Montgomery will unveil tons of eating places."
College Sophomore,1,Tuskegee University is an HBCU and it is an historical site. The cost of the school is over rated to me as far the dorms and the food. The dorms and buildings can look alot nicer for the price people pay to go there. The food is disgusting but they did have some good days but it was all that.
College Sophomore,1,All around Tuskegee University's campus its never that much parking. Its not enough parking at The Bioethnics buliding there and that is where students classes are more than likely. At the Chambliss cafeteria there is not enough parking there either. The parking all around campus is horrible mosgt people get tickets because they can not find a parking space convient for them. People who park in a non-parking space get tickets.
College Junior,1,Tuskegee university campus life is not that great being that it is historic it not that up to date . A lot of renovation need to be done
College Freshman,1,"The on campus dining options are very slim and inadequate. The original dining hall, Thompson Hall, is under reconstruction. Therefore, the current dining hall had to accomodate for all the students. It is not equipped with the proper space or staffing to accomodate for the masses. It is a really unfortunate situation with all those with meal plans. The meals are good sometimes, but it lacks the Southern style of cooking. Also, the times of dining halls are very inconvenient for students, especially in sports or other extracurricular activities. The other eateries on campus are very expensive when it comes to points or money. I suggest not buying a huge meal plan, if you don't have to."
College Freshman,1,"At Tuskegee, honestly, drugs are accessed easily and used commonly. Peer pressure, however, is uncommon."
College Freshman,1,"The food is not very satifying. 
Dining hall is too small
There is not much of a variety.
There are not any good and afforable places to use flex dollars."
College Freshman,1,"It has probably one of the most disgusting cafeterias I've ever been to, but they are building a new one now so hopefully it has a variety of foods and better cooks."
College Sophomore,1,The off-campus dining is horrible. The atmosphere is ran down and country. McDonalds is the most popular spot.
College Freshman,1,"Get it done by yourself, they will not help like you think they  will."
College Sophomore,1,"The parking situation could be way better. The school parking lots and driving areas could have been set up in a more logical and conveinent way. A lot of the time, it is very hard to find a parking spot and the campus police don't take this into consideration when passing out tickets. A year long parking permit is $75 which is a little costy based on the parking situation."
College Freshman,1,"Tuskegee has a campus transportation that circles the campus. The bus runs about every twenty minutes, but the buses only hold about 15 passengers so seats are always filled. The bus runs off campus on satudays and sundays but it is not very reliable when it comes to being dropped off and picked up at said time."
College Sophomore,1,The Ease of Doing Drugs – 80% of students either smoke weed or drink. smoking is more popular on campus. I see people smoking all the time. I do not think campus security really minds. I smell it in my dorm all the time. Students come in the dorm drunk and high and no strict consequences are enforced.
College Junior,1,"What you see is definitely not what you get. The brochures and website show you one thing, but you get the total opposite. There are some that are under construction, but over all they all need work."
College Sophomore,1,"In the Middle of Nowhere – The community around Tuskegee is relatively poor so theres not much to eat besides mcdonalds, taco bell, subway, the chinese place, or buy food from the expensive grocery store. There is one good place to get chicken and thats the coop."
College Sophomore,1,"Out in the Open – At Tuskegee there a huge amounts of people drinking, smoking, or both. It is very obvious to the students and the faculty. The school does not do anything to prevent it or take measures to ensure that it is not happening."
College Junior,1,"I Feel Like Im in High School – No inner room visitation from opposite sex, no opposite sex allowed on that side after certain hours, restriction on visiting hours, Wednesday night is study night ( no opposite sex visiting), weekly room checks, the list goes on and on"
College Freshman,1,Work Is Needed – Tuskegee is a very small town and the university is a small campus as well. There is no public transportation provided for students within campus nor outside of campus. It is required to own a car in order to get to and out of school. Since the school is small there is no real need for public transportation on campus but it would be nice if there was a shuttle working for the students like the Tiger Transit over at Auburn.
College Student,1,"campus shuttle on campus only goes to specific stops. the workers driving the shuttle take unnecessary brakes outside of campus. The shuttle bus during the weekend only takes you to two places; Walmart and the mall in Montgomery for a couple of hours, which is a verry big inconvenience for students without cars"
College Freshman,1,"We have buses that go to Walmart and the mall every weekend, there is nothing around Tuskegee so we must go to Montgomery 40 minutes away to get anything. It is not very convenient, I would definitely suggest getting a car if you go to Tuskegee."
College Freshman,1,"Everyone Drinks/Smokes – Almost everywhere you go at Tuskegee someone is smoking or drinking, it doesn't matter what time or day it is. Someone is always getting drunk/high or as the students like to call it ""turning up""."
College Freshman,1,"Bad Dorms – In my opinion, Tuskegee can do much better. The dorm I lived in had mold in the hall way on the walls. It was small and you couldn't bring much. They were always having mandatory dorm meetings that had nothing to do with the dorm. The showers were horrible. The walls in the shower were never clean. My total experience in my dorm was horrible."
College Sophomore,1,"The Restaurants – Tuskegee does not have many dining options. Especially when it comes to late night hungers, most of the restaurants in Tuskegee shut down after nine pm."
College Junior,1,The wireless access needs to be better. I can't connect my printer wireless anymore and access is low in parts of the building.
College Junior,1,"Shopping and Activities – Barely any attractions. Once we get established professional businesses in Tuskegee it, will become a thriving college town, with a booming economy. But as of now, the town is dead and depleted of any excited. The university however host a number of events which brings life to the entire city"
College Sophomore,1,"Not Too Many Options – Tuskegee is a really small town. If you don't have a car of your own, most likely you'll have to find a ride with a friend. However, they do have a shuttle to take people to Wal-Mart and the Mall in Montgomery on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday between certain times of the day. As far as getting to places on campus without your own car, you'll have to walk. To me I don't mind walking, it's good exercise. The only time I would need a ride to class is if I was late or if it would be raining."
College Junior,1,"Hard Time Getting Money – No matter how high your GPA is, the school will give you little to no money. In some cases, they will take it away and raise the tuition."
College Junior,1,"All the Greeks on campus are well known for the parties they throw, and not the community service they do. The feel as if they are better than the none Greeks and that they run the entire campus."
College Junior,1,"Workload at Tuskegee University is very heavy and can sometimes cause extensive stress. The teachers feel as if it is our job to keep up, seeing as that we are in College now. Multi-tasking is not for everyone and can lead to all ""f's"" and one ""A'."
College Freshman,1,"At Tuskegee, we have a fair group of international students for such a small, private campus; however, the campus is primarily black seeing as to how it is a historically black college."
College Junior,1,"I no longer stay on campus because its too expensive. All of 13 dorm halls except 2 (James Hall and White Hall) are lousy, and resemble prisons. The walls and floors are concrete, the places are infested with roachs, the heating and cooling units are always off, its hot when its hot and cold when its cold. The windows, doors and definitely the furniture are out of date. Our facilities are the main reasons why our retention rate is pretty low. Students do not see what they are paying for"
College Freshman,1,"Tuskegee really needs to work on helping students with financial aid. I undestand it is only so much they can do but, to the students who work their but off for high GPA's they shouldnt have to beg for help especially when its your job to help!!!"
College Senior,1,ALABAMA SUN – At the beginning of the Fall semester and if you're attending the summer session...you need plenty of sunscreen and an umbrella and a large brim hat and bright/light colored long shirts and pants because walking from class to class around campus will be dreadful without them.

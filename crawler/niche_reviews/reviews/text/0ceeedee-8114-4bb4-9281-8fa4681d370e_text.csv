Freshman,5,"My experience at Tufts so far has definitely been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, but I'm proud to go to a school where students have generally been taking precautions and rules for safety seriously. Students are incredibly friendly and welcoming, but the environment is definitely very white with considerable wealth. Professors and fellows at the ARC, Staar Center, and Tisch are incredible resources for students and all of the classes I've taken I've thoroughly enjoyed (even despite many being through zoom this semester)."
Sophomore,5,"I like that Tufts is really accepting of any person and has AMAZING resources for FGLI or POC students. Tufts even have 6 ""centers"", each an institution designed to help the underrepresented communities of students of the African Diaspora, students of Latinx Heritage, Asian American students, LGBTQ+ students, and women, and FIRST generation students. As a frist-generation, latina, college student, I don't feel too out of place in a predominantly white institution such as Tufts. I have no concerns!"
Sophomore,5,My online learning experience with Tufts has been great! My professors have all been doing their absolute best to ensure that students still get an interactive learning experience. I still feel connected to my community back at Tufts.
Sophomore,5,"You can tell the professors care about the students and are highly dedicated like the students. Coming from the Southwest, people seemed cynical at first, but once you get close to your peers you realize that they are very genuine people. That said, there are all types of personalities here, just like at any university. My favorite thing about Tufts is how easy it is to get involved in clubs and activities, and how easy it is to talk to professors."
Sophomore,5,"The online learning method is a little hard to get used to at first, but the professors are dedicated to making sure the quality of education is still top tier."
Freshman,5,Everyone is very welcoming and kind. Tufts students are some of the nicest people you'll meet and the staff are great as well.
Senior,5,"Tufts is undergoing a complete transformation with new phases taking place each season. Most noticeably, the addition of programs such as the MSDS and the Cybersecurity program with Fletcher are bringing in a lot of interest. Students come to Tufts because they want to be challenged, they want rigor. And you'll find that here. Also, the whole ""quirky"" persona thing is outdated. The newest generation of Jumbos is an entirely different breed."
Sophomore,5,The professors really care about you and there are a lot of opportunities available in research and student leadership.
Niche User,5,"It is a great experience. At fist I was nervous due to the status of the school and going out of state to meet new people, but those worries are gone. The people around me are very welcoming and friendly. My professors are amazing. I am a biomedical engineering major and the program is AMAZING."
Freshman,5,Tufts University is one of the few institutions that cares deeply about its FGLI students and has systems in place for them to succeed. The FIRST resource center helps them find the necessary resources to excel at an elite university like Tufts.
Junior,5,"Great school, smart, talented students who are kind and collaborate, checked-in, mostly great, accessible professors. School of Arts and Sciences can be disorganized.  Engineering school is terrific, well-funded, intimate, well-organized, and the professors are very good to excellent--world experts in their field with so much research opportunity for students.  A lot of dorms are shabby and gross, food is decent.  Extracurriculars and Ex-College are the bomb. Graduates go on to great jobs and stellar grad schools."
Niche User,5,"Every person I met on the tours was extremely helpful and so passionate about every part of the campus that they were involved in.  There was a strong sense of community, and I really felt as if every student genuinely loved everything they did there."
Freshman,5,"Great students. Haven't met an aggressive soul here yet. Though some professors aren't the best, the majority are very open to meeting outside of class for questions and providing help. The school food is fantastic (caprese salad, quality kimchi, great deli meats) and the party scene isn't too aggressive. Boston being only a couple of subway stops away definitely helps liven up your weekends."
Niche User,5,"The faculty is very welcoming and the facilites are very pleasing. Some of the dorms don't have air conditioning, though."
Junior,5,I feel like I am truly able to be myself here on campus. The friends and connections I've made on campus will last a lifetime and I'm really grateful to go here.
Sophomore,5,"After my first year at Tufts, I feel deeply engaged in the community and strongly connected to many academic departments. I quickly formed a great group of friends and continued to make others throughout the year. Tufts student body is big enough that there is meaningful diversity is thought, personality, and interests, yet it’s small enough that I never feel too disengaged from the community. I went to a rigorous private high school and took many APs and university classes, but Tufts has been significantly more challenging. With that said, there are many resources to help you, and my professors always were happy to provide support. One of my favorite parts of Tufts is its strength in research, and I have found it very easy to reach out to faculty and get involved. I think Tufts offers something for everyone, but remember that nothing comes for free. You must work hard, but in the end you will gain knowledge, opportunity, and connectedness among yourself the university."
Sophomore,5,"Not too big, not too small - the perfect community! Many clubs and sports to choose from, and there are almost too many classes to pick. I love it there & I would encourage anyone who likes a close knit community to attend. The partying isn’t crazy, so if one were to be into heavy drinking and lots of parties, Tufts would not be for them."
Sophomore,5,"I could not be more happy with the experience I’ve had at Tufts.  It is a very demanding academic institution but also provides us with the cutting edge of research and the best professors, so you know why so much is expected of you.  Additionally, Tufts is always expanding and improving itself, and the passion that the administration has for heightening what the school has to offer has given me so much confidence that Tufts is not only an elite college but also still on the rise.  I am definitely proud to be a Jumbo!"
Sophomore,5,"Excellent professors and student body full of passionate and intellectual people. Nice campus, decent facilities, great opportunities for research, internships, and study abroad."
Sophomore,5,Tufts University has been a welcoming community that has many opened doors for my future. It has become a comfortable home away from home for me to grow and expand my knowledge. I equally enjoy the students and faculty and have never had any conflict. Tufts has been the perfect place for me.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, I’ve found the people at Tufts to be extremely approachable and friendly. Everyone seems to look out for eachother rather than the competitive nature expected at some top schools. Campus is beautiful, socially it is a lot of fun, and academically it is incredibly stimulating. Involvement in research is extremely available (even as a freshman). 

ps the whole “quirky” thing really scared me before coming to tufts - not that different is bad, I just wanted to fit in. It’s more of a school wide running joke at the fault of poor admissions marketing years ago. While the students are diverse in many ways (this being one of my favorite things about the school), “quirky” is not an honest overarching description of the student body b"
Freshman,5,"As a freshman at Tufts, I am constantly blown alway by endless opportunities available to undergraduate students at various academic departments, student-run organizations, and Tisch College of Civic Engagement. Students are here to learn from a wide range of perspectives and always listen carefully to one another to reexamine their thoughts. Even in today's political divisiveness, I find Tufts students relatively open-minded and tolerant to perspectives and thoughts that might be contrary to their own. Furthermore, as a student who plans on majoring in International Relations, I am always struck by how organized the program is here at Tufts. Professors and students are experts in their field, and I can easily see future diplomats and leading scholars in my classroom. There are conferences at the Fletcher school almost every week where leading scholars and researchers come and speak. I love Tufts!"
Graduate Student,5,"As a graduate student in Tufts University's Urban and Environmental Policy and Planning Department, I am enrolled in the post masters Certificate in Advanced Graduate Studies specializing in Urban Justice and Sustainability. I am able to pursue this program at Tufts in the Boston area even though I am a practicing planner residing and working in Roswell, NM. The faculty in this program are exceptional. The student colleagues are also working professionals with planning and other backgrounds such as law and education. I love this program because we are exposed to literature and ideas from many different fields. The assignments make us think as we attempt to articulate our ideas on a variety of community based social justice and sustainability issues and policies."
Graduate Student,5,"Tufts is a place like no other. A diverse population of students and faculty, who all have the same dream - strive for excellence. An inspiring and forward reaching academic drive ensures the students unlock their full potential and succeed in achieving their goals to create a solid foundation for their future. The warmth encapsulated by the entire community at Tufts makes each student part of the Tufts family; an irreplaceable feeling. Finally, the world-class teaching and faculty make Tufts stand out from the crowd, as a school with exceptional standards in all realms."
Freshman,5,It's been 4 weeks here and I'm actually really enjoying it. The only complaint I have is with myself. I'm just getting really lazy.
Freshman,5,"Amazing school. The classes are all incredible, and the professors want you to succeed. You are taught things that will last a life time, not just book smarts that pertain to the certain subject - each discipline has a global and worldly focus. The food is amazing, dorms are being renovated (some are super nice!) and every student I’ve met is incredible. Couldn’t recommend it more."
Sophomore,5,"This is an excellent school with classes, clubs, and opportunities for all possible interests. The student body is intelligent and passionate, but is also incredibly kind. Competition is not a problem. The professors are impressive and compassionate. Such a special school culture."
Alum,5,"Great place to go to school for an undergraduate education - strong academics and post-graduate professional opportunities. Close enough to Boston for leisure and convenience but far enough to have the New England liberal arts college feel. 

Alumni seem to go on to do quite well in both academia and their professional pursuits, although perhaps a slightly greater pre-professional bent to Tufts might benefit undergraduate students more in today's environment; many of my peers have gone to graduate school to supplement their Tufts education. 

Greater international and regional diversity might also benefit Tufts - the student body is noticeably less diverse in this respect than neighboring schools such as Harvard, MIT, and BU. 

All in all a good experience, if a bit ivory tower."
Sophomore,5,"I'm a current sophomore at Tufts. The students here are some of the most intelligent, interesting, and compassionate people I have had the privilege of meeting. Moreover, they are all so down to earth. The professors here are wonderful, the attention on individual students is incredible, and the overall student life experience has been a great fit for me. This university is best for someone who is politically/civically engaged, passionate about what they study, and seeking a community that will foster those interests."
Alum,5,"When I started at Tufts I knew it was the place for me, and four years later I can proudly say it is my favorite place on this planet. The teachers are campus are great, but the students are what make the school truly amazing."
Niche User,5,"I'm a current Tufts 1+4 Fellow. I took a bridge year to learn Spanish, experience a different country and culture, and give back to the international community. After graduating high school and before beginning university I spent a year in Cuenca, Ecuador. I lived with a wonderful host family and volunteered with two different local organizations, a government branch and a tech startup. The 1+4 Program is unique because Tufts covers all costs for students on financial aid. Thank you Tufts!"
Freshman,5,Amazing school. Great people and academics especially for international relations. Other good things are premed bio chemical biology
Junior,5,"Tufts is everything I wanted in college. Stimulating academics, diverse and compassionate student body, a beautiful campus and professors that do whatever it takes to teach and inspIre growth and learning."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love it here. Tufts is the place for you if you're not conservative and are looking for a well-recognized university without the cutthroat atmosphere of an ivy league. The people here are so genuinely kind and fascinated by the world around them; no one cares what anyone else's grades are, and you're much more likely to have a conversation about why standardized tests are philosophically atrocious than about what your standardized test scores were. Almost everyone here is a nerd, whether it be for science, theater, anime, or all of the above/anything in between.

If you are socially conservative (I am repeating this for emphasis) or care a ton about sports, you probably won't have a great time here. 90% of the school still doesn't know if we won the homecoming game, and that's exactly why I like it. Being openly socially conservative is, for better or for worse, like committing social suicide."
Freshman,5,"Tufts offers many special programs such as the Time Management & Study Skills one. A student can receive support for how to better study, how to take better notes, etc. all for free. I think this demonstrates how Tufts often goes the ""extra mile"" for its students."
Junior,5,"Tufts is an incredible university. The academic level of the university is known to be very high and it owns up to that reputation. With that said, something that separates Tufts from other universities is how incredible the school spirit is. Everyone can find common ground in their love of the university. We have many diverse clubs and programs and anyone can find a place to shine."
Freshman,5,"Excellent over all experience. Great teachers, great classes, fun clubs and sports, and extremely intelligent and passionate student body.
Food is great. Super fun clubs and groups to get involved with.

Unfortunately, it is not an Ivy League."
Niche User,5,The environment is really nice; their student body is very unique; their faculty members are disposed to help. I loved Tufts ever since my 1st visit to its campus.
Niche User,5,"Beautiful Campus in a nice Boston suburb, professors are very knowledgeable and very approachable. Food also looks great and they have many healthy options."
Niche User,5,I toured there and I felt at home. The campus is very pretty and the city is just a subway or bus ride away.
Freshman,5,"The only things I would change is the housing situation and the tuition. The people are friendly, cooperative, and love too involve themselves in activities."
Niche User,5,Love the school and the people in it. Facilities and faculty members are great with an amazing location right outside of the city of Boston.
Freshman,5,"Being an International, I felt home at Tufts. It provides the best education and tons of resources. Campus us beautiful"
Freshman,5,"I love Tufts University.  I just finished my first semester and could not be happier.  My professors were amazing and made learning easy.  The food is great, and the campus is beautiful."
Freshman,5,"Tufts is the best decision I have made. The people here are so kind, passionate and fun! I love all my classes and professors, the sports teams are successful yet so manageable, and the parties are great! I definitely recommend applying. Davis square is a quick walk away, and Boston is a short 20 minutes on the T"
Freshman,5,"Tufts provides not only a quality education, but also has great student life. I love the location because travelling into Boston is very quick and easy, but the campus doesn't feel so much like it is in the city and is very safe."
Freshman,5,"Tufts is an amazing school! The intellectual environment is extremely is stimulative. The Professors are very passionate about what they teach and are open to helping any of their students. The food is good too! Students are generally friendly depending on the crowd you hang out with. The political environment is one of liberalism. I love this school and would attend it again when given the chance. There is diversity in terms of the many people from different backgrounds and categories. The surrounding area is beautiful! The school is not called the ""Light on the Hill"" for no reason"
Senior,5,"Loved it there. Endless resources, amazing professors, awesome people, and great food. Transferring there was the best decision I made."
Freshman,5,"I love Tufts! It's the perfect mix of everything I wanted- in a small college town but right near a big city, really incredible academics but not at all a cutthroat competitive vibe, good at sports (even our football team has finally started winning a lot of their games!) but it's also not the only part of anyone's life, etc."
Freshman,5,"I love Tufts so far. From the beginning, people were incredibly friendly and welcoming. The campus and beautiful and the people are awesome. I love it here!"
Niche User,5,"I have visited Tuft many times. I like all the academics and sports it has to offer. It ever has a chess club (chess is my favorite sport). The environment is great as well. In short, it is a great college with lots of opportunities for everyone."
College Freshman,5,"I was nervous, but found there was nothing to worry about the moment I first walked on to campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Graduating as a Jumbo not only means that you have a great school on your resume, but amazing alumni connections and career services that will help you well past your 4 years in school."
College Sophomore,5,"I've loved virtually every course I've taken. Expect work in most classes, but there aren't many classes with overbearing workloads (Comp 40)."
College Sophomore,5,"Health Services at Tufts are amazing. Everyone there is caring, supportive, and knowledgeable."
College Sophomore,5,"There are no ""bad"" dorms at Tufts. Housing isn't guaranteed after Sophomore year, but most people choose to live ""off-campus"" (I put it in quotes since many off-campus houses are as close or closer to campus as some dorms) regardless of their lottery numbers."
College Sophomore,5,Tufts is an amazing school with wonderful kids. I'm happier there than I've ever been.
College Freshman,5,"Health and safety here are great. The administration is transparent about crimes in the area and offers safety tips and precautions and regular updates. Mental health services, health services, safe havens, etc. are all made clearly available for those in need of help. Police are a welcome and friendly presence on campus, and they care most of all about the students. They are not out to get anyone."
College Freshman,5,"Courses are diverse and engaging, professors are both brilliant in their fields and really cool as people, and students create an excellent community."
College Freshman,5,This school leaves you with excellent job prospects and is very helpful in helping students find career paths.
Freshman,4,"I've mostly taken classes online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but Tufts professors are still putting in great effort to their teachings despite the virtual format. My friends have really enjoyed their classes that were already online, but others are doing well in following their footsteps."
Alum,4,"Overall good experience. Faculty care about students, and Tufts alum seem to take care of their own. Would recommend."
Freshman,4,"Professors are trying to work with students through all of the online work, though it is difficult for classes that should be held in person.  Although it is a lot of reading and zooming, it is the best they can do right now."
Freshman,4,"This is my first semester at Tufts and it is a different experience due to COVID, but Tufts is doing well with doing twice a week routine testing, limiting capacity and activities to help students feel safe and comfortable on campus."
Freshman,4,I did not take any classes online but I'm sure they're great. Especially with the current COVID-19 situation the online curriculum will be improved.
Junior,4,I love the atmosphere and the community surrounding Tufts as a whole. The people really help to make the experience special.
Junior,4,"This past semester I took a couple of online courses due to COVID. Most of my classes increased in ""difficulty"" due to the fact that it was online. I think that all of my professors did the best they could with the given resources, so I think that it was an interesting experience overall. I think that Tufts online learning could use some work in order to get some system in place for online learning, but besides that I think it was quite good"
Senior,4,"This past semester was online and my professors were flexible in making things work. The experience was challenging because academics at Tufts are notoriously rigorous. However, finding a balance between academic requirements and online learning is something that we'll only be able to master with time."
Sophomore,4,I love the diversity of Tufts University. The one thing I would like to see change is more on campus housing opportunities.
Niche User,4,The certificate classes are affordable and the quality of education and feedback the teachers provide is excellent. Many students have requested more classes that allow for students to get experience with web design or interface design; this is an area the SMFA could improve.
Freshman,4,"The college transition is hard! And I think freshman year is hard no matter where you go, so the difficult things I experienced this past semester weren't specific to Tufts. 

Pros: The best part about Tufts to me is the resources in general: a diverse array of clubs to find affinity with other students, as well as a counseling center, career center,  center that addresses issues of sexual assault, financial aid office, Academic Resource Center, Student Accessibility Services, etc. The classes and professors are pretty amazing at Tufts. The food is great and accessible to people with dietary restrictions/allergies.
Cons: It is a predominantly white university, which certainly takes getting used to, and I think the biggest issues I have with Tufts are issues of race. The faculty isn't nearly diverse enough, and neither are the students. The race classes are fantastic, but I wish they were required or something because the people in them are usually already ""woke""."
Sophomore,4,"I love the suburban setting and the friendly, cooperative environment. The faculty is very supportive and Tufts often consider students' feedback."
Junior,4,Tufts University is in a nice region of Medford which is not too far from the city of Boston. The autumn at Tufts is incredible with the foliage. Students are bustling with their clubs and have put in lots of ideas for different organizations. Everyone is welcoming and willing to help out others.
Junior,4,"Great for research, professors are friendly and always looking for students to join their teams. Mostly everyone gets into their choice of research."
Junior,4,"The campus and the surrounding area is full of diverse options for hanging out, socializing, and relaxation. Although the academics is very difficult within the school, the help received by outside sources and fellow students really enhances your experience at the university."
Freshman,4,"The most surprising thing about Tufts is the people -- I remember going on college tours how every tour guide mentioned that the people are amazing, but I never took that to heart because it seemed cliche and I did not know how authentic it was...however, Tufts is the real deal. I have never been in an environment where every person I meet is so friendly, curious, accepting, and interested/appreciative of your hobbies/extracurriculars/passions. Tufts is a place to thrive, explore your interests, and take risks - very happy here!"
Freshman,4,"The atmosphere at Tufts University is great. The students and faculty are so kind and willing to help with any problems. The location is amazing because it is not downtown, but it is close enough that you can get into Boston quickly. The classes are really interesting and you are able to take classes that interest you."
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed visiting Tufts University. It had wonderful, modern classrooms and an open, non-cramped campus I could fall in love with. There are a variey of majors, including a Verterinary Medicine major, which I plan to achieve."
Freshman,4,"I love Tufts, however they do not do a good job making you feel important! It is really hard to get into classes and the dorms are gross. However if you can suck it up and focus on how smart the facility is, it is worth it. The people on campus are all so nice, however doing a a pre-o is a must if you want to make friends.  The food is great for campus food, and easy to find things with allergies."
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore engineering student at Tufts, and I'm really enjoying my experience so far! I personally have found social life to be perfect for me, and I am surrounded by incredibly intellectual, driven students. Teachers are a mixed bag, especially in the intro engineering classes, but for every subpar teacher there are two or three really caring ones that are willing to meet you halfway if you reach out. Diversity is lacking but seems to be improving grade by grade, and surrounding myself with people from diverse backgrounds has not been too difficult."
Junior,4,I love how supportive my English and International Relations professors are and I feel grateful to have them as my mentors.
Sophomore,4,"Tufts is fueled through the passion within the Tufts community. Students will readily engage in conversations as specific as a protein's structure to as vague as the meaning of life. The social climate is under-the-radar yet outgoing, creating the perfect climate for studious social butterflies."
Alum,4,"Excellent teachers and a great place for an artist who is already confident in their abilities and simply needs space and support to further pursue their practice.  For all the young artist and designers who are interested in learning the gamut of creative possibilities and career paths that creative professional follow, please look to other universities and colleges. The school does little to prepare students for life after graduation other than to pursue a full time studio practice with affiliations with higher education institutions or art galleries and museums.  

But for those that are already passionate and confident with their practice will enjoy the relaxed vibe and intellectual headspace the school promotes."
Niche User,4,"Tufts offers a great diverse community of students and faculty. Tufts allows students to engage in one to one conversations with professors, allowing them to start expanding or building their network."
Sophomore,4,"It is a very good school, definitely focuses on academics. That being said, as a division 3 school, the athletics are more influential than I had thought they would be. Although, the party scene truly is whatever you make of it. If you want to go out often, you can, but there are plenty of other opportunities and events. That theme can be observed across many aspects of tufts. From academics to food there are people with similar beliefs and customs at all times. Most importantly, Tufts is very supportive of all beliefs, practices, and backgrounds."
Junior,4,"I've found that the Professors at Tufts are, normally, extremely approachable and care about the success of their students. That being said, they do not give students answers when they ask for help, instead choosing to teach the students how to find the answer on their own, which I feel is more beneficial to the long-term success of the student."
Sophomore,4,Tufts has great academics. Davis is a cool area with plenty of young people and food. It's just too bad that it's such an expensive school and therefore has quite the population of privileged students.
Sophomore,4,"Tufts University is a great community where everyone is doing a lot of interesting and amazing things. It's not too competitive, but you still feel the challenge and push to do your best. There are always going to be people you don't like in life everywhere you go, but it's also very easy to surround yourself with loved ones."
Sophomore,4,Classes are rigorous yet interesting and there are plenty of clubs/ activities to get involved in with different levels of commitment. Professors are generally work very hard to help students understand material and they really go the extra mile.
Freshman,4,The student body is incredibly caring and supportive while also driven and talented. Don't worry about the name  we're on the come-up.
Alum,4,Tufts is a very demanding and competitive liberal arts school. The student body is very passionate and outspoke about a wide range of issues. You can easily find something to fight for or get convinced to join a cause anywhere on campus. The academics is very demanding and you will find that students work long hours just to pass. There are a great amount of resources and opportunities on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Very prestigious and academically rigorous school. The professors are clear, experts, and seek to help you."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel extremely safe walking around campus at night, walking by myself, and walking in the surrounding neighborhoods"
College Junior,4,I enjoy the community and rigor of school. I wouldn't choose it again since it's so far from home.
Recent Alumnus,4,Campus police are fairly prevalent around campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There is a wide, successful alumni network."
Recent Alumnus,4,"We have some great D3 sports teams, with multiple of them reaching the national tournament."
Recent Alumnus,4,"i think my advisor is the most important person, truly a mentor who cares about my success"
Recent Alumnus,4,"always something to do, see, or learn about"
College Freshman,4,"Greek life, like sports, is present at Tufts but not a reason to attend. They are pretty low-key and care more about their community than their national affiliations. They throw the parties and have a presence on campus, but there is no pressure or judgement regardless of whether or not you rush."
College Freshman,4,"Sports are NOT what Tufts revolves around, but athletes are always a presence on campus and in our campus news. Despite that, the gym is accessible and popular among students, and healthy living is always encouraged and doable."
College Freshman,4,I have enjoyed the short amount of time I have spent at Tufts and look forward to continuing on.
College Freshman,4,Tufts has been a great experience so far and a degree from this school is valued and respected by employers or future academic options.
College Freshman,4,"The application process is always a very stressful and complicated process, but it seemed clear that the program was set up to be as accessible and clear as possible. It also created a number of opportunities for me to put my own hopes for grad school and my own personal accomplishments to the forefront."
College Student,4,"Health services fee is mad expensive, but it covers for so many things."
College Student,4,"Professors are always available and none of the classes are taught by grad students or TAs, unless it's a lab and is supervised by a TA."
College Student,4,I am a freshman so I don't know but I have heard it's pretty good.
College Student,4,"Dorms at Tufts are pretty comfy. They are certainly not the best but utilities are relatively new, and rooms are spacious."
College Student,4,"I go to the gym all the time and the facilities are pretty good. While varsity sports is not a big part of Tufts life, you still have much opportunity to attend events and see them."
College Student,4,"Honestly, I love Tufts so much, and it is worth the money. Although my school is crazy expensive and all that, financial aid officers always try to assist students to find ways to finance their Tufts education. When I was a prospective student at other numerous, and mostly prestigious college, the only responses I had from financial aid officers at other school were ""I  am sorry we don't have anything for international students."" However, I was offered so much non-monetary helps and advice from financial aid officers at Tufts, including an RA position, on-campus job, and an exchange program that would help me so much in terms of money. Staff and faculty at Tufts are incredibly helpful and understanding."
College Freshman,4,"No major problems that I know of, but that doesn't mean that there aren't any."
College Freshman,4,"They offer help, but everything is just very competitive."
College Freshman,4,"Not too much emphasis on sports, but they're definetly around if you want them"
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are generally excellent. Workload isn't bad, except for STEM classes. 

But, I wish there were advertising or business classes."
College Sophomore,4,"Very helpful career services, and professors are the best to go to for help getting internships."
College Freshman,4,Tufts has excellent health (including mental) services. Tufts also has a very accessible police department and I have never felt unsafe while on campus.
College Freshman,4,"Even though the courses are challenging, I have loved every subject that I have learned. There are always resources available if you're struggling, the professors are extremely approachable, and overall it feels like everyone is rooting for you to succeed, including your classmates."
College Freshman,4,"The athletic facilities are incredible. Everything is brand new, extremely well maintained, and has every type of workout resource one could think of."
College Freshman,4,The academic courses are indeed rigorous but all of the material that I am learning is extremely engaging and I feel that just about everything I do is meaningful.
College Freshman,4,"Especially as an engineer, I feel like my opportunities are endless. I can do whatever I set my mind to, and Tufts has helped a lot with that."
Freshman,2,"Stay away. This institution is such a waste of money. I honestly wonder why Tufts has so much prestige because the professors are sub-par, the campus is very grungy, and the classes are mediocre at best. My high school was harder and more rigorous than Tufts. Students are rarely challenged, the professors are not good, and the classes are not worth paying for. I am a Tufts freshman, and I'm transferring. I remember reading reviews that the administration puts up an act during Jumbo Days & tours, but I ignored those statements and became someone who fell for that act. It's just an act. This university sucks. If you want to go to Tufts, then go to a state school. You'll save so much money and the classes will be the same. The sports and night life will probably also be better. Medford (where Tufts is located) is a total dump, and Boston is about a 40min-1 hour train ride away, so students generally stay in Medford for most of the time. No school spirit either because why would there be."
Graduate Student,2,"Classes were decent, however, the student services department was extremely unhelpful and dishonest. Expect to receive almost no guidance on steps to graduate."
Graduate Student,2,"The SMFA directive is ""Make big work. Get into museums. Put our name out there.""
Professors had clear favorites. As an older student, I was invisible. You have to fight for attention, studios etc. The quality of instruction varies in extremes. I loved the dedicated staff, however. They are terrific.

Although I practiced art throughout my life, the SMFA took the passion right out of me."
College Junior,2,I feel that this school has made it extremely hard for me to hold onto the passion and love that I have for the arts. I was so excited for a place that marketed itself as a small and tight knit community of driven students who strove for their own excellence as well as encouraging that of those around them. Faculty are often times unhelpful and lax distracted by whatever else holds their passion more than their job. I think thats fine but the school has a tendency to hold on to these faculty and dismiss the faculty that challenges the mediocrity that is encouraged in the school environment. It's taken all that's in me to even want to continue and just finish out my education. The only thing keeping me going is that it will end soon. There have been a few professors and peers who have made my time there at least worthwhile enough to stay and try to change the environment but this has been so discouraged by the community at large that I struggle just to hold onto my love for creative arts and what I know it can do for people when effective.
College Sophomore,2,I am biased-- I really don't like Greek life and don't think it adds anything to our community that is positive. Luckily it doesn't have a huge presence here.
College Freshman,2,My college has a very low-key greek life. They are only known for having incredibly rich members and crowded parties that have lots of alcohol.
College Freshman,2,I live in one of the grossest buildings with some of the most annoying people.
College Freshman,2,"I got lucky with Haskell Hall, but it depends a lot on your community."
College Junior,2,"I spent time filling out the applications for financial aid and only qualified for a loan, which I did not ask for or accept. The office was helpful though!"
College Freshman,2,"Our teams are not very well known, except for a special few. Sports don't really dominate the social scene, but they are always an option for those who are interested."
College Freshman,2,"Because of the addition of the green line right next to campus as well as a crackdown on the number of people able to live in one house, houses around Tufts are becoming more highly-demanded and more expensive. The location is prime, but the houses themselves are not in great shape. A lot of upperclassmen get houses solely to get a non-dorm experience."
College Senior,2,"Living off-campus used to be one of the things rising upperclassmen looked forward to because the idea of living in a house with friends is very appealing. The rents and quality of houses near Tufts has been rising and steadily mediocre, respectively. Many students find the process of ""house-hunting"" and signing leases to be time-consuming and frustrating. They have ideas of what kind of apartment/house they'd like and the rent range, but these might not line up with the availability of houses and the proposed rents of the landlords."
College Freshman,2,"Friday nights are often dead on campus. Frats are really the only places to party, unless you make fast friends with very social upperclassmen, the campus is very strict about alcohol and noise complaints, and Medford is far enough away from Boston that it is inconvenient to go into the city."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a very strong Greek scene, and people who are into it are very into it. Personally I don't find the frats to be that fun, and the frat boys to be extremely stuck up and annoying. Usually the frat parties are freshmen and sorority girls. But if you're not into Greek life its easy to find a different niche."
College Freshman,2,"The administration is very lenient about campus security. The school does a good job outlining its rules and policies, but also informs students of their own rights. That being said, many students have been able to get around the ""zero-tolerance marijuana"" rule. Regarding underage drinking, TUPD does not normally write up students when breaking up frat parties or dorm parties, but students who are intoxicated to the point of being hospitalized face disciplinary action."
College Sophomore,2,Classes were not as interesting as i had hoped and that is in large part due to the profs. there are not a ton of course offerings and it is not easy to sign up for classes as many seem to be filled quickly
College Sophomore,2,greek life is fairly invisible and not really given much attention. there may be 1 or 2 parties every weekend but that is it. many thursday and friday nights when nothing is happening
College Sophomore,2,lots of variety for majors and workload is rigorous but doable. internships don't seem to be easy to get through the schools career center
College Sophomore,2,registration is random so you get what you get. professors are relatively accessible but many are brilliant minds that are not able to teach to a class of undergrads- this in turn makes for a miserable academic setting for students as we have to teach ourselves everything
College Sophomore,2,Football team has not won a game in 3 years but there are definitely some good teams if you want to watch games. Athletes tend to be the majority of attendees at athletic events. School spirit is pretty minimal.
College Sophomore,2,"Health services is horrific. I know many people who have been misdiagnosed or denied medication that wound up later being absolutely necessary which is strange for a campus with such a strong pre-med focus. There were a lot of concerns this year with the sexual assault policy at Tufts, but even as a freshman girl I never felt unsafe. Crime is low."
College Student,2,"Essentially everyone is a rich white kid, and people from different ethnicities don't interact with other ethnicites"
College Student,2,No one cares about the sports teams. New athletic facility is beautiful and super expensive
College Student,2,So hard to find parking and it coasts a fortune
College Student,2,"Very few options, if you're not getting drunk at a party, you're hanging out in the dorms with your friends"
College Freshman,2,Parking anywhere in Boston is a nightmare. Why any college student in Boston would want to have a car is completely beyond me.
College Freshman,2,"A lack of consolidated on-campus housing leads to a lack of options. There's the Cafe at school, which is pretty good, but it's basically useless if you're not actually at school. It's not a lack of quality but rather a lack of availability."
College Sophomore,2,Like it's bad. Weekends are usually somewhat boring and don't offer a lot :(
College Sophomore,2,"Prices are so high compared to neighboring areas because landlords assume that we're all wealthy college students who can pay a lot for housing, so they hike up prices. Apartments in nearby areas go for $300 a month, whereas we pay $700 a month or so. It's ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, parties are broken up way too much. I only view them as there to break up my party at 1am and nothing else."
College Freshman,2,Not a party school by any means
College Sophomore,2,Small but loud. Main source of party life on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Most places right around campus are sketchy pizza places, Dunkin Donuts, convenience shops, etc. If you're willing to walk ~10-15 minutes, there are way more options and much more variety."
College Freshman,2,"There's nothing directly near campus, you really have to go into Boston if you want to have fun."
College Junior,2,"I have had some horrible roommates in the past so my dorm experience was very poor. Also, residential facilities is known for screwing people over."
College Freshman,2,"Since I'm from Los Angeles, California, the weather in Boston kind of sucks. The winter is really long and the snow just makes commuting to school really difficult. I also don't like rain, so when it rains, it just makes my day/commute worse. The weather in Boston is very unpredictable. It can be bright and sunny one day, and freezing and windy the next Take advantage of the warm, sunny days by going outside."
College Freshman,2,"Because it's a small private school, they don't provide much financial aid. It was so bad for my family that I had to take a leave of absence for the second semester of my freshman year. They're sort of stingy with their money."
College Freshman,2,"Tufts is very beautiful on the outside, for the most part. Most of the dorms are hideous on the outside, though, and ever worse on the inside. I am blatantly unimpressed by the facilities at such an elite school, and fully expect that they improve this in the very near future. The athletic center is newly renovated and is very nice. The student center is alright, compared to most buildings. Green spaces are beautiful, though. Tufts is very lacking in traditions, since University officials have done away with a lot of them, especially the famous NQR (naked quad run). This is something that truly makes me sad."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The Greek life at Tufts is very underplayed, especially when comparing with traditional Southern schools. Even compared to other Northeastern schools, our fraternities seem not much more than glorified basements (to those outside Greek life). It's the main source of parties for underclassmen before they branch out into knowing older students or get apartments of their own."
College Freshman,2,"My biggest complaint is the campus police's strictness in terms of parties. They love to shut down parties all the time, which can get pretty annoying, especially when the parties aren't even rowdy."
College Junior,2,"I gave it a C, mostly because this question is really about where you stand on the issue.  Practically everyone here smokes cigarettes, and you'll see the cloud wafting out from the front commons as you walk by.  Mixed with the cigarettes you'll see plenty of joints being passed without reservation.  Teachers are mostly lenient about smoke breaks, and students walk to the park to smoke marijuana over lunch break.  You'll occasionally have critiques where teachers allow students to bring in wine/booze.  Final review boards often have alcohol present.  There is plenty of off-campus drug-usage, but thats not really the responsibility of the school.  SMFA offers on-site drug/alcohol counseling."
College Junior,2,"The computers SMFA has in the MacLab are modern, but there are too few of them.  The internet is usually painfully slow, so that teachers wanting to show videos in class often cannot even do so.  More scanners/printers/copiers are needed for the amount of students here as well."
College Freshman,2,"Tufts prides itself on being a ""diverse"" school. But really, we are mostly liberal, agnostic or jewish, upper middle class or wealthy, and white. There are definitely students who don't fit these parameters, but that is the overall feel of the student body. Nobody discriminates because of skin color or economic status, but there are Christian groups who feel discriminated against here. There is DEFINITELY some prejudice towards anyone who calls themselves a republican or conservative. For the most part this is joking, but there are definitely students who seem to equate being a conservative with being a killer of puppies or something horrendous of that nature. The most diverse element on campus is sexual orientation - people of any orientation are widely accepted."
College Freshman,2,"There are 9 frats and 3 sororities (though we're supposed to get another in the fall!!). Freshmen will spend a lottt of time at frats, and upperclassmen will go if they are friends with brothers, but definitely not as much as freshmen. A lot of people rush, though definitely more guys than girls, simply because there are more frats. There is definitely a hierarchy in the greek system, and a couple of the frat houses (DTD, DU, and 123) have great houses, the others are kind of run down. You'll figure out which houses have which reputations when you get on campus."
College Freshman,2,"TUPD breaks up parties A LOT. That being said, nobody at the party gets in trouble. They just tell you to tone it down or leave. If you are caught drinking in your dorm, you will probably get a warning the first time, and if it happens again you will get written up. They have very little tolerance for underage drinking here, but as long as you don't advertise your pre-game and keep it down, the RA won't bust you. It's only when it's obvious that the RAs do something. Don't smoke weed in your dorm. Just...don't do it. You can do it outside, but if you do it in your dorm the whole hall will smell and then you WILL get in trouble."
College Freshman,2,"Housing options were extremely limited if you were looking at dorms. It was also difficult to find apartments within a decent budget considering the school is in Boston. The school is somewhat helpful, but difficult to deal with during the process."
College Junior,2,"Parking is limited, and expensive. As a residential student, you have more options, but don't expect to be able to park near your dorm. There is a parking garage, but it is expensive to park there regularly."
College Junior,2,"Greek life is present, but not dominant. You go to the parties freshman year, and then you get tired of gross basements and rude brothers at the door and avoid them."
College Freshman,2,"People go to frat parties, but the sororities are for the most part awful. Few people rush for sororities, and those that do are not extremely well regarded."
College Junior,2,"Athletics are disappointing. Despite a shiny new gym, and efforts to get fans out at sporting events, athletics are neither exciting nor competitive."
College Junior,2,"Frats are there for parties. In general, there is a slight skeezy factor about them. Its not awful, but if you don't join, you aren't missing anything. To each their own."
College Junior,2,"As long as you don't flaunt rule breaking, and no one gets hurt, you're fine."
College Senior,2,"I received next to nothing compared to the cost of tuition, but that's not a huge surprise when attending private art school."
College Freshman,2,"I would say that over half of students go out on weekends (Thursday through Saturday). Alcohol is incredibly easy to get even for those who aren't 21 - If you don't know someone old enough to buy for you one of your friends will. Marijuana is also very popular, most guys and a lot of girls partake. The only way you will get in serious trouble for drinking is if your drunk enough that EMS are called - and the first time that happens you just have to go to a meeting with a counselor. Basically don't be obvious and don't be stupid and you can party as much as you want."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The athletics are pretty poor at Tufts, especially the football program when I was there. The gym is also very outdated and at least one of weight-lifting machines is usually broken. They did just expand the athletics complex but I don't think this will have an effect on the quality of sports offered, unfortunately."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I was only offered a relatively small loan and work study. Tufts is known to be expensive and give out little financial aid. A friend of mine was given a huge package his first year which then significantly decreased the following year, leaving him with the option of transferring or taking private loans."
College Senior,2,"not enough studios for everyone, black mold is present"
College Sophomore,2,"Fairly Subduded Outside of the Houses – Greek life is actually pretty low-key, except for the Thursday, Friday, and Saturday night parties, which are fun to go to and rarely distruptive otherwise.  Parties can be very difficult to get into as a freshman, however."
College Junior,2,"Greek life has its place at Tufts, but the quality frats and sororities are few and far between. There are many other opportunities for social engagement in clubs and such that bring lots of quality people together."
College Sophomore,2,"Religious wise, very little, I think. There's a huge Jewish population, and there's nothing wrong with that, but it overshadows everything else. Politics, too, though I'm not complaining most Tufts students are as liberal as you can get. There's definitely sexual orientation diversity, and moderate race diversity, though most students are white."
Senior,1,"Tufts online learning is not worth the $70,000 tuition. Some professors do not work well with technology."
Alum,1,"I dropped out after 2 years & wish I had spent my time elsewhere. The quality of teaching is all over the place, but for the most part my classes were 6 hours of critique with very little input from the teachers. I found myself wondering why we were paying the school, instead of just hosting free peer crit sessions. The facilities are also vastly lacking. The video department is mostly tape cameras & some Sony Vixias, & there weren't enough desktop computers for our 12-person video class.

There was almost no practical arts education (e.g. skills), & far too much emphasis on thinking about art – & the ""thinking about art"" component tended to be a lot of meaningless nonsense."
College Senior,1,You can get into greeks if you are white. it's that simple. They will allow a few token students of color in but it will never be more than their personal quote. Their parties are usually very exclusive and the rich of the rich students join Greek life. Personally tend to stay away.
College Sophomore,1,i think the fact that all upperclassmen live off campus (as only 2 years housing are guaranteed) at such a small school really destroys the 'community' feel of the school. campus is pretty barren much of the winter and you may only see a couple people outside at any given time. the off campus housing spreads out students and ruins student unity
College Sophomore,1,honestly there is not much going on. if you want to have fun this is not the place to be. parties are monotonous and rarely happen. one to two events a weekend and it tends to get shut down VERY VERY early (latest it will go is until 12)
College Sophomore,1,"People here are very academic, quirky, and socially reserved. Do not expect a very social campus (many weekends there is nothing happening) and do not expect very attractive people"
College Sophomore,1,"If you want a strong social scene, this is not the school for you! Most parties are held at frats."
College Sophomore,1,The facilities are literal s*** holes. Basically every building needs renovation.
College Sophomore,1,The food is so disgusting and no variety or healthy options. I hate it.
College Sophomore,1,The suck so much and gave me no where near what I needed.
College Sophomore,1,"Our school literally incorporates no technology into our curriculum, it's so sad. It will drive this school behind in a few years, no joke."
College Sophomore,1,The campus shuttle sucks so much. I absolutely hate Boston public transportation (so inefficient compared to New York's).
College Sophomore,1,"I absolutely hate my school and would never let my children attend. The faculty and administration are all on a pedestal and just have a desire to fulfill their academic and bureaucratic visions. Everybody is so freaking weird and awkward, I can't handle it. I only like going there because I have an off campus job downtown, am on a sports team, and try not to interact with most people. I just don't fit in."
College Junior,1,"There's not much parking available, most space require you to be a Massachusetts resident, or one needs to pay for a space in a lot. It's really not necessary to have a car in Boston, public transportation is simpler. Unless, you're commuting I wouldn't recommend driving."
College Sophomore,1,"It's there if you look hard enough. Police are unforgiving, however."
College Freshman,1,"Housing is off-campus. You'll have to find an apartment anywhere in the neighborhoods of Boston. But there is the subway and public buses. However, the atmosphere in public transportation is not always pleasant, and expect some delays when the weather gets bad."
College Junior,1,"If you are wealthy or have some way of paying $1700+/month for a studio, you can have a nice place to yourself in nice neighborhoods near school. Looking to pay less than $1200? That will get you a tiny box or maybe something rat-infested in a bad neighborhood.  Even with roommates, renting here is extremely costly.  Realtors will try to lock you into ""split"" apartments which usually just means someone rooms in the living room with a partition or curtain.  Parking is virtually impossible in most neighborhoods, so if you have a car, expect to pay $100
+/month for a private spot or just pay oodles for all the tickets you will acquire.  Because Boston is such a college-centered town, there is a mad rush to get into apartments on Sept. 1st.  I recommend starting your search far earlier than you feel you need to, look for Aug. 1st or other dates to move in if possible, and plan ahead for the pandemonium that is Boston's move-in day!"
College Senior,1,"photo area is full of chemicals with poor ventilation, and black mold"
College Sophomore,1,"i mean, i hear lacrosse and girls soccer is pretty good, but in general, we f****** suck at sports. but who comes to college to play sports anyway?"
College Sophomore,1,"Our school doesn't really care about athletics. Our football team is one of the worst in D3. We actually have very good lacrosse and rugby teams in our division, but it's not a big thing."

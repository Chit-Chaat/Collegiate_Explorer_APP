Sophomore,5,"I don't know how other schools are handling online learning, but Carleton professors have been extremely dedicated to replicating the vibes of their courses through online systems.

I particularly appreciate the ""honors system"", which makes test-taking more flexible and helps me put trust in the academic community as a whole.

The primary flaw is that there really is no way to do science labs virtually, but Carleton is slowly offering more in-person options to their students."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed my classmates who are very motivated but also relatable and supportive people. This helped with getting through tough academics and athletics, and in general the social life and community are great. The campus is beautiful and the arb is a wonderful place, and thankfully campus is relatively small compared to other universities, making the commutes not too long. The day to day structure does get a bit repetitive as the term goes on however."
Junior,5,"Carleton is a really great place. I have made fantastic friendships and learned more about myself than I thought possible. People are so curious and kind and humble here, which is so refreshing compared to a lot of the über competitive schools friends of mine go to. There's a genuine sense of caring on campus, from both students and professors. The only changes I would make are pretty shallow -- better food, better location, better weather etc."
Freshman,5,"A welcoming and accomodating community of outgoing and curious with a passion for learning. I just finished my first year at Carleton (although it was cut-short by COVID 19) and absolutely loved it. I worked hard and grew as a student. More importantly, I made the best friends of my life and had a ton of fun in between rigorous school work and studying. The best of both worlds."
Alum,5,"Superior teaching. Diverse student body, Excellent extracurricular activities including athletics , Attractive campus, Strong alumni support,"
Freshman,5,"Carleton has fantastic academics, student diversity, athletics, and housing. The small college town vibe is great for those trying to get away from the big cities and the on campus life is usually lots of fun albeit busy."
Niche User,5,"I am so impressed with Carleton.  Their standards and practices for academic, social and physical well-being are beyond my expectations."
Sophomore,5,"I love Carleton. It is a supportive school with incredible professors and wonderful opportunities. There is always something to be involved in, but it is just as easy to take a step back and spend some time in the arboretum when you need it. Northfield is a sweet little town with a cozy vibe."
Sophomore,5,"People will help you when you need it.
Great professors.
It would had been great if we had more of the popular classes."
Sophomore,5,"Carleton has wonderful faculty and their selling point would definitely be the academics. Carleton is also very generous with giving financial aid to students, which has helped me tremendously. Although it is secluded in a small town, I find this to be very good for my safety (honestly, you'll probably be too busy being on campus to even want to go to the cities). I think the dorms are above average for a lot of colleges in America. I've visited many, and Carleton's ""worst dorm"" (which I lived in) was very nice. Overall, great school! Can't wait to finish my degree."
Freshman,5,I enjoyed the top-ranked academics and the focus on undergraduate teaching. The students were passionate about learning without being competitive.
Senior,5,"It's a great liberal arts school where the faculty members really care about each and every student, and sees the potential in you. You can grow so much here academically and personally, great supportive community and intellectually stimulating. Very intense academic course but, you will be able to see the best in yourself!"
Senior,5,"Absolutely amazing school.  World class professors and an uncompetitive academic environment mean you engage with your classmates and focus on real learning.  The town is small, so there aren't many bars, but there are always good parties happening on campus that everyone is welcome to attend.  Some of the athletics teams are really good, like national competitors.  Other teams aren't but students still go to the games to cheer on their friends and socialize with each other.  Carleton is a very challenging place, but at the same time everyone is willing to help you."
Niche User,5,"I have lived in Northfield all of my life, and I can honestly say that Carleton has always been a dream school of mine. I was part of the ""buddy"" program that they run, and I met an amazing college student. She showed me what her life is like on and off campus, and I got to meet amazing people. It is an absolutely beautiful campus full of stunning buildings. The community is amazing as well, for there are a tremendously small amount of incidents regarding theft, etcetera. This is definitely in my top choice of schools."
Junior,5,"Carleton is very academic. You will have the access to professors and all sorts of educational resources. The food and dorm are pretty bad, to be honest. The sports is definitely not the biggest thing here. Frisbee people will tell you they are national D1 champion but it's ""club D1"", which is not even as competitive as ""NCAA Division 3"". You will meet a lot of weird people but definitely worth spending 4 years there. Parties are fine. People do drink a lot though."
Freshman,5,"Love everything about Carleton! The surrounding area is very safe because it's right next to a small town, and the professors are so knowledgeable in what they teach. Plus, they're available whenever you need them."
Alum,5,"Carleton has excellent academics, professors, friends, every extracurricular you've ever dreamt of and more, a beautiful arboretum, and it is a wonderful environment for trying new things."
Junior,5,"My experience at Carleton has been challenging, but incredible. Overall, I would highly recommend this college to anyone who genuinely loves learning and is comfortable in a liberal climate."
Sophomore,5,"Absolutely love this school. Professors are great, the community is welcoming.  I play a varsity sport here too and it's been a wonderful experience. It's definitely challenging, but so worth it in the end."
Freshman,5,"At Carleton College the professors, staff, custodians, and alumni all want to see you succeed.  Before my Calculus 2 final I said hi to a custodian who I had never talked to before and at that particular point I was feeling low and a bit discouraged.  After talking to her for a little bit and a hug I was ready for my exam.  Carleton is not an easy college but there is a village supporting each person here. Carls help Carls."
Sophomore,5,"Carleton's community and academics are amazing.  Inclusive community and dedicated, skilled professors."
Freshman,5,"The school has an incredibly open community; cliques are fluid and almost anyone is welcome and can feel comfortable sitting with any group. Dining hall food is great, although there are few good restaurants in the area. Classes are fantastic and the trimester system works very well for people who live far away (winter break extends from before thanksgiving to after new years). In addition, the trimester system allows students to fit three academic terms into one year while focusing more intensely on less during those terms, all the while still leaving room for a long winter break.
The biggest downside for me is that students seem less individual and more self-effacing than some other similar liberal arts colleges."
Junior,5,"Absolutely adore this school in every way possible... incredible academics, a once in a lifetime opportunity of learning in its purest form."
College Sophomore,5,"Coming from a very violent background, Carleton is just amazing: I do not have to worry anytime about people coming in and out of rooms and buildings, and anyone can walk 247 alone without being in danger."
College Sophomore,5,"Residential life is one of the best parts of Carleton. Students, staff and security do a great job keeping this place tidy, comfortable and fun every single day. I just love it so much."
College Freshman,5,The class selection is so amazing that it is almost overwhelming. All of the classes are so interesting and quirky -- this term I am taking a course called the Anthropology of Humor which has been absolutely fascinating. The professors all knew my name by the end of the first week and made an effort to connect with each of us. It is hard to come by professors as passionate and caring as the professors at Carleton.
College Freshman,5,"Carleton is everything I had hoped for in a college experience and more. The people are all incredibly down to earth and ambitious yet not competitive. I am getting a liberal arts education in its finest sense surrounded by other extremely bright individuals who are passionate about learning. I would describe the overall culture of the school as quirky, but in the best way. I feel so blessed to be attending a college where the professors truly care about their students and I can receive an amazing education while surrounded by some of the friendliest, most peculiar, interesting individuals I have ever met."
College Sophomore,5,"Phenomenal. Professors are for the most part excellent, and very few are concerned about only doing their research. Most are friendly, although a few can be a bit hard to approach, the vast majority are kind and willing to help students in office hours. Curriculum is a bit limited given the amount of faculty, so course diversity in smaller departments is lacking. Registration is easy and you can almost always get your first-choice classes, depending on your interests. Workload is pretty high, but then again this depends on your major and how you balance your classes. Study abroad is crazy popular and most do it at least once in a country of their choice - the Cambridge program is excellent."
College Sophomore,5,"Absolutely one of the safest towns and campus communities in America. The biggest concern is drunken Friday nights, to be quite honest."
College Sophomore,5,"While Carleton is virtually unheard of outside Minnesota, the skills it develops in its students make their ostensibly useless liberal arts degree very worthwhile and marketable. I've seen English and philosophy majors land fantastic jobs, but even more important, perhaps, meaningful jobs."
College Sophomore,5,"Courses can be a bit limited in variety in smaller departments, but the interactions you have with profs makes up for it. Classes a mostly discussion-based, although some intro classes lean on the side of interactive lecture rather than just pure discussion. Class sizes for non-science majors are fantastic and average around 10-25, depending on the prof's popularity. Science class sizes tend to be on the larger side, by Carleton standards, at around 40-60 or more for intro classes. The best departments by far are political science, biology, chemistry, geology, religion, psychology, math, and English, while the weakest are sociology/anthropology, linguistics, physics, statistics, and economics."
College Sophomore,5,"Carleton was my dream school since high school. Getting accepted was amazing, and my time here has exceeded my expectations. While the location is not that exciting, how many chances in your life do you get to live, learn, and love in rural MN? Most departments here are exceptionally strong and have a huge focus on students and their success, even the larger departments. Students are exceptionally intelligent but they don't brag about how many awards they've won or how they got a 2350 on the SAT and turned down Cornell and Johns Hopkins. There is a great sense of humility here and general noncompetitiveness, although I would say the latter is more of a myth than a complete reality."
College Sophomore,5,"Wedns-Sat theres always something happening, you just have to find out what. There tend to be campus inclusive events almost every week, but other than that house parties, dorm parties and progressives tend to be pretty inclusive other than the 'low key hangouts' and 'sport/major' only progressives. Nothing hugely party-hard or intense, but everything is really fun in a more relaxed way."
College Sophomore,5,"Its pretty great. Helpful, challenging, varied and engaging. More focused on developing you and your capabilities rather than making you memorize or recite."
College Sophomore,5,"Only deal from people you trust, do that and you'll be okay (and wont get ripped off). But don't trust people you think may be chemically experimenting. Will mess you uuuuuuuuuuuup"
College Sophomore,5,"The overall experience is whatever you make it, thats the thick of it. But Carleton no doubt gives you the opportunity to embrace your college experiences, with its resources, environment and underying desire to help you achieve whatever you want to achieve. What I can really appreciate at Carleton is how everyone is tied by a yearning to be passionate about something, and that really shows in the chill, ""no pressure unless you want pressure"" atmosphere it exudes."
College Senior,5,"The Studio Art program at Carleton College in Northfield, Minnesota, is outstanding!  The professors are all top educators and artists who enjoy teaching undergraduates and spend time with the small group of art students.  The new Weitz Center for Creativity has a great deal to offer.  Carleton College is a hidden gem of undergraduate arts programs!"
College Freshman,5,"Great professors, tough but insightful curriculum, registration process is useful and makes sense, workload is very heavy."
College Freshman,5,"I have never felt unsafe on campus, although my bike was stolen for a few days (and then returned!). Perhaps I should say borrowed, not stolen."
College Freshman,5,"Aside from the price, I have had incredible experiences with campus housing, which I hear from people at other schools is rate."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love Carleton. I have met amazing people and been intellectually stimulated. Also become involved in extra curricular activities and grown as a person.
College Freshman,5,Professors genuinely care about students and are devoted to their time in the classroom. Profs are passionate about their field of study and do a wonderful job of transferring their knowledge and wisdom to the student body in an effective (yet intense) way.
College Freshman,5,"Prior to attendance, most students assume Carleton grads lack in job prospects due to its relative anonymity among fellow high school students and peers. However, this is not the case once one advances to the working world. Carleton is nationally known as one of the top liberal arts schools in the country."
College Freshman,5,"Have thoroughly enjoyed my first term, have not had any problems with campus housing."
College Freshman,5,"A ton of fun, education has surpassed my standards. I feel genuinely ""smarter"" after just my first 10-week term."
College Freshman,5,"So happy I made the choice to come here -- was a tad bit concerned that it would be too ""out-there"" for me but it has been amazing so far."
College Sophomore,5,"Carleton is an incredible place to go to school--the people really care about academics, real issues, and each other. There are also literally hundreds of activities to get involved with, so there is pretty much something for everyone."
College Sophomore,5,"Since everyone lives on campus, it fosters a sense of community through partying unlike many state schools with frats. Parties are always fast to get to, and people party hop all the time. You can walk into parties and not know people but still feel welcome. There is always plenty of alcohol and the RA's are so relaxed you don't have to worry about getting in trouble for drinking or partying."
College Sophomore,5,"The scholarships are pretty attentive to need, and it shouldn't be a problem for applicants."
College Sophomore,5,There are very large rooms and the dorms are always kept clean. The social atmosphere is great.
College Sophomore,5,"Amazing friends and professors, friendly and accepting atmosphere. Brimming with opportunities to do anything and everything. I wonderful place to explore more about yourself and the world."
College Sophomore,5,"Fantastic Professors, Engaging Classes, Enthusiastic Student Body"
College Freshman,5,Students and the administration seem to get along well.
College Freshman,5,I love the rigor and my professors are great!
College Junior,5,"People don't really do bad things on campus, but Security's there if you ever need them."
College Sophomore,5,Having affluent parents is always the best form of financial aid.
College Junior,5,"While most of campus is rather liberal, it is very easy to have a rousing discussion with someone about any aspect of diversity, and how it exists in various ways on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"wonderful. the workload is very tough, but extremely rewarding. the profs are fantastic."
College Freshman,5,"Over my first term, I have already met so many interesting people from very different backgrounds and ways of life.The people at Carleton are very accepting and unique and strange...so just like me. It's nice to have that paradox of diversity and sameness."
College Sophomore,5,The people are all nice and unique. I wouldn't get the same academic or social environment anywhere else.
Sophomore,4,"Carleton is an excellent, underrated liberal arts college. 

The main issues I have with it is that the political climate can be unfriendly to those with non-liberal ideas, the student body tends to be kind of awkward/homebodies, and although there's a ton of support/connections for those wanting to go into academia, there's less support for those wishing to go into other careers."
Freshman,4,"Carleton is wonderful in many aspects. The community, the resources, the campus, the classes, the professors- all wonderful. I am constantly shocked by how wonderful Carleton is. Coming from a rural, primarily low-income student high school, I was very surprised at the difficulty of the classes and their workloads. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced before, and to be frank, I was overwhelmed my first term. This school is hard for a lazy student, but there are also many opportunities to unwind and relax in many different ways. It's also very expensive, but the financial support you see on campus is amazing. Most events on campus are free, its TRIO services are great, and there are many services that offer supplies and resources to those who can't afford them."
Freshman,4,"Incredible academics with opportunities to match. If you're passionate about anything, Carleton will give you what you need to make it happen.

Socially, however, be prepared to be in the middle of nowhere Minnesota. It's cold, it's not tasty, and it's really white."
Junior,4,It is an incredible education experience. I do not feel like I am just a face among the crowd but feel as if I am building lasting relationships with my peers and professors.
Sophomore,4,"Carleton is a great liberal arts school with professors that care about the students as well as students that care about the students. It is a nice school if you want to go on a school outside of the city, but if you are a city person, then Carleton would not be the best place to be. Finally, the academics is very good!"
Sophomore,4,I have had a great time at Carleton. There are so many amazing professors who care about their students. This is really important because it is not something you will find at every college.
Senior,4,"Carleton has an incredible community of passionate individuals. The environment is quite intense, but I'm grateful to have experienced it. I've been forced to learn how to ask for support and take care of myself. And I've found many people--students and professors--who care about my well being and inspire me to grow."
College Freshman,4,"The Career Center reaches out to each student and has incredible programming designed to help students get internships, externships, connect with alumni, and find jobs for after graduation. I feel very good about my job prospects upon graduation."
College Freshman,4,"I feel generally safe on campus, even walking around alone at night. Also, security is very responsive and will always walk you anywhere at any time if you feel unsafe. Sexual assault is an issue as it is on most American college campuses, but I do feel that the administration and students are taking active steps towards diminishing the problem. It seems that the rate of sexual assault at Carleton is lower than other campuses of similar size/setting."
College Freshman,4,Some of the dorms aren't as nice as other but all of them are nicer than the average dorm at other college campuses.
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms are no luxury apartments, but most I would say are way above average when compared to other college dorms. The best are the newest: Cassat and James (they're like a combination of a sleek hotel and children's hospital), followed by the older Burton, Davis, and Sevy, and maybe Evans if you're a sophomore. Mid-tier dorms include Watson and Nourse. The worst are by far Goodhue due to its location as well as Myers and Musser due to its small rooms and amenities. Houses for seniors are also probably the best option but go quickly in the housing lottery. Off-campus housing is practically non-existent but its fairly decent if you're interested."
College Senior,4,"Smaller seminar classes are usually very small, probably something around 12 people. Larger lecture classes can get big, but even the largest is capped at about 150 people, since that's the size of the largest lecture hall."
College Senior,4,It's an incredibly safe campus -- students regularly leave laptops out in the open.
College Senior,4,"The lottery system is kind of a nightmare, but housing options do get steadily better as you approach senior year."
College Senior,4,Carleton has a great teaching program and is generally a great place for academics and extracurriculars. The social environment can get a little stifling after 4 years.
College Junior,4,"Carleton provides an academically rigorous, safe, and welcoming environment to people from most all backgrounds."
College Junior,4,There is a vast alumni network and a lot of opportunities to receive fellowships and scholarships from the school.
College Junior,4,"Carleton is generally very safe and closed off to the outside world. There have been, however, several cases of sexual assault that the administration has not handled very adequately."
College Junior,4,"Carleton College is unique in that it is composed of a great community of learners who are supportive, curious, and have good senses of humor. People here aren't afraid to be themselves, and professors genuinely care about what they're teaching and students' success in class."
College Sophomore,4,Its in a small town which is relatively safe. People tend to leave their doors unlocked and can walk around campus alone just fine. The only problems are stolen bikes and the sexual misconduct policy. The former can be solved with a bike lock. The later is being worked on by everyone. Police and Campus Security are super helpful and understanding.
College Sophomore,4,"Depends on what you come in expecting, especially as a freshman. The space just enough but not enough to be spacious. Room size varies massivey, but you start from the bottom as a freshman and eventualy become more grateful for the space as you grow. Small dorms like in Musser make up for it with great floor life and location, while Goodhue has good life, bad location but pretty big rooms. Myers is kinda creepy but has good floor life. Watson, Nourse and Cassat, are all pretty far from things, have huge rooms and not great floor life. Burton is the penultimate for big rooms and good location but has awful floor life. Things aren't ever really that bad, but they only get better."
College Senior,4,"We have some very serious athletes at Carleton College and the Division III sports program is growing.  Football is probably not our best sport, however."
College Freshman,4,"I have had thoughtful professors who really care about me and the rest of the students. One professor who was unorganized, but still tried very hard and was incredibly passionate."
College Freshman,4,"People are really into intramural sports, especially ultimate frisbee."
College Junior,4,"Top-notch professors, a generally positive and invigorating environment, an a great deal of interesting, bright, passionate peers. On the less positive side, the administration can be inflexible, drinking culture is at times overpowering, and the community, while on the whole accepting and open-minded, is less so than you would hope."
College Junior,4,It was easy to get into my program once I showed I was a committed artist
College Junior,4,The art program is great though it isn't a huge major at this college.
College Junior,4,Being an art major is great -- they have good classes and teachers. The Weitz center could be closer to campus though.
College Junior,4,"The professors are very good, particularly the arts ones."
College Junior,4,The student hangouts are nice and they have events going on for students very frequently.
College Junior,4,The area is very friendly to college kids and there are some nice events such as Jessie James Days.
College Junior,4,"The courses are quite good, especially the art courses. The art professors are excellent"
College Junior,4,"The security is pretty good -- sexual assault isn't very prevalent, though there is some theft."
College Sophomore,4,"The alcohol policy is incredible, and I didn't realize it before I got here. Basically, the official policy is that students under 21 can't drink alcohol because it's federally illegal. But students can only get in trouble for drinking if they're walking around with open containers, and even in that case an RA on duty will just ask them to throw it away. The RA's want students to be with other students and form friendships, and let you do whatever you want in your room. The RA's are also great about drunk students and will help students take care of their friends who have had too much, whereas at other schools students can get written up by RA's for being visibly drunk. The alcohol policy is extremely lax, and it creates a nice environment of tolerance and respect."
College Sophomore,4,"I love living on campus. Most freshman live in Goodhue and Musser, which are the ""worst"" dorms, but create a strong freshman community that usually lasts throughout all of college, and the rooms are still much larger than any other college dorm room I've seen. The longest walk to class is probably from Goodhue to Weitz, but that can be done in 15 minutes if you walk quickly. Housing quickly gets more luxurious from year to year, and by junior year you can get a very nice room, or if you're lucky by sophomore year. Seniors usually live in suites in Memo (James) or Sevy, a single in Cassat, get a house off campus (although only 60 seniors get this), and the townhouses are also very nice if you have a good draw number. Interest houses are also a great option for people who have bad draw numbers, and are very nice and foster a great sense of community. The housing process is a little difficult, but I think they're changing it this year to try and make it easier for students."
College Sophomore,4,Delicious but not too many ethnic options.
College Sophomore,4,Great admin. Cares about student body.
College Sophomore,4,Really fun and no peer pressure.
College Junior,4,Some good restaurants like Basil's and Chapatis are nearby
College Junior,4,Strict in a good way -- limits unnecessary fuss
College Junior,4,Financial aid is very good at this school
College Sophomore,4,I had an internship where I worked in an office setting.
College Sophomore,4,Lot's of variety but it doesn't have all the options you'd find at a larger school.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not sure yet, but it seems that many students go on to do work in their chosen field."
College Freshman,4,There is support for people but it's not perfect
College Freshman,4,"I love being a part of the sports team! Fans, etc are great. The facilities could be improved."
College Freshman,4,The F/A process was really straightforward. I sent in my finanicial information and received the amount that was necessary to afford college.
College Sophomore,4,"The academics here are pretty great, if a bit challenging"
College Sophomore,4,Tokyo Grill is the best
College Freshman,4,"Northfield is lovely, and close enough to Minneapolis for relatively simple access (to the cities)."
College Freshman,4,"There are occasionally some missing items, but they are more often than not located and returned. Otherwise campus crime is not an issue and everyone is safe on campus all the time. Campus security is always available to help in any situation."
College Freshman,4,"There is always something going on, to fit whatever your taste may be. I've heard of a progressive (""moving party"") in which everyone named Alex met up and got to know each other while partying. The partying culture fits the school; fun, quirky, and safe."
College Junior,4,"Each dorm has its own personality that people learn to live with, whether they love it or not. Most people end up loving their dorm."
College Junior,4,"The are three plans at Carleton and each works well with the type of lifestyle you have; whether or not you skip breakfast, or prefer the cafe, or live off campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I generally always feel pretty safe on campus, even though I am more cautious about walking alone late weekend nights. Security is always on duty, and usually comes pretty quickly when they are called on campus. They also take issues very serious no matter how awkward it may seem to you. There is also a student and health and counseling office on campus that is able to assist with minor health issues such cold and flu and sexual health as well."
College Sophomore,4,"There are always a ton of things to do while at Carleton!! From campus parties and dances and there is always the option of going off campus into town for a few drinks and eating or a trip to Mall of America in the twin cities is always a fun option, too!"
College Sophomore,4,"Carleton is located in a small friendly town. There are many small little restaurants, and little shops, coffee shops, and even groceries stores all within walking distance."
College Sophomore,4,"The academics at Carleton are rigorous yet very fulfilling!!! Before a major is declared the middle of sophomore, you are free to explore just about any class you desire. The registration process is usually very easy and smooth-sailing unless you have a poor registration number causing you to register last and hardly getting into any of the classes you wanted. In which case, you can definitely look forward to a better registration number and the classes you want the following term. The workload will definitely require great time management skills, but the list of courses offered are definitely unique and fun and totally worth all of the effort."
College Sophomore,4,"In regards to the social life on campus, policies are very ""fun-friendly"". Generally, school officials including security do not go looking for contraband, unless an issue has arisen. Professors and deans are very approachable and understanding as well. While guidelines and rules are set in place in regards to academics, it is not hard to meet and exceed the standard"
College Sophomore,4,pretty lenient on underage drinking. a little more strict on weed/drugs.
Freshman,2,"I took online classes for the spring trimester, and while I thankfully did not have any issues accessing the resources I needed, it was not as enjoyable as being with my classmates. It felt more isolated and harder to feel motivated dealing with the demanding academics. Most of my classes tried the flipped classroom approach, where we are asked to read and watch videos of the content on our own time on top of attending zoom class sessions and homework, which felt much more time consuming and arbitrary than taking classes in person."
College Senior,2,Athletics really aren't a huge priority here. Frisbee is probably the most popular sport.
College Sophomore,2,"People are accepting but diversity is pretty limited. 10% international students means, what? 50 kids a year right. It's Minnesota so white is to be expected, but pretty much everyone here is from the 'burbs.' Ethnic diversity is kind of sad but understandable.There are a lot of different political beliefs, but they aren't explicit. Everyone here is accepted no matter who they are or where they come from, theres pretty much a group on campus for everything, but that doesn't stop diversity from being not great."
College Sophomore,2,"It is pretty isolated, and in a small town, so there is not much going on past 10 off campus"
College Sophomore,2,very cold. expect snow in may.
College Junior,2,"Nightlife, HA! Partying is limited to weekends and once during the middle of the week. Our motto is work hard, play hard. When we do get together, we make up for lost time. However, often the party is dead by 1 or 2. That's what you get in a small town. One bar only. Most gathering are 5-10 close friends drinking and playing some games."
College Sophomore,2,"There are just not many low-cost options to get places. While Northfield Lines is very good about break buses, on a normal day if you just want to hang out in the Twin Cities and/or Mall of America you have limited options at very bad times. You can't park here, so that's out the window. Taking a taxi/shuttle will cost you dear. So if your flight getting back to campus is late and you miss the last Northfield Line bus you might end up very screwed booking a First Choice Shuttle last minute (if you're even early enough to book) and drop a large amount of cash, or just take a taxi and drop perhaps even more cash. The one redeeming quality is the frequency of Target buses."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Decent, but Gets Old and Is Really Expensive! (And Mandatory...) – The dining hall isn't horrible, but it gets old fast. While they have good ideas about certain things (sustainability, for one), and they are decent at food prep and cooking, the part that always bothered me was the cost. There is no good option for students who live on campus but don't want to eat in the dining hall all the time (as it gets really, really old after about a year). If you want that option, you have to choose to have 12 meals a week, but you don't get compensated enough ""dining dollars"" to make up for it."
College Senior,2,Grading Horrible – Grading scheme is horrible. Professors dont explain properly
College Senior,2,"Northfield Is Small – Dining options in town are very limited.  The food is nothing to complain about -- Hogan Bros. has awesome sandwiches, El Triunfo's Mexican food is great, there's a Chapati and a couple of Chinese restaurants, plus your usual fast food -- but you run out of options pretty quickly."
College Freshman,2,"Over All Experience – So far I'm not having the best time here. The academics are great. But other than that the town is pretty boring, there isn't great diversity, and you feel very isolated there's definitely a ""carleton bubble"". This school probably isn't for me."
College Junior,2,"Rigid Administration – The main thing that frustrates me at Carleton is that we have a bunch of bureaucracy that has gotten in my way.  There are strict policies when it comes to declaring a major or requirements.  Most people never come up against these rules, but if you want or need to do something a little different, it's a bit of a battle with the administration.  However, the professors are amazing when it comes to individual attention and support and the other students are open-minded."
College Senior,2,"I am from a very VERY caucasian town, so I believe that diversity at Carleton is ok.  However, I gather that many people do not agree, and they are probably more qualified to comment on the diversity than I am."
College Senior,2,"Difficulty in Breaking Through – There are people of many different races at Carleton and the literature portrays them as intermingling at will, but at times it is difficult to integrate oneself into groups where the common bond is a shared international culture. At the beginning of the school year, for example, Carleton hosts International Student Orientation about a week before other students arrive, so by the time new students arrive, the International students have already solidified friendships and closed themselves off to other avenues of interaction. This is not the only example, however."
College Junior,2,It Doesn't Get Colder Than This – It is so cold that you can't be outside for more than 5 minutes. Anything longer than that and you will feel needles piercing through your skin all over. Getting way below 0 degrees is commonplace and snow days don't exist.
College Sophomore,2,"Not for Everyone – This school is definitely not for everyone! If you don't mind the lack of hygiene and the awkward conversation, then this could be the place for you.  The classes are also more work than they are worth.  Being on the trimester system is extremely stressful and you do not get to take as many different classes than if you went to a semester system college, even though they try to convince you otherwise!"
Freshman,1,"Carleton is not a good school for a normal person. Being an athlete, I was an outcast at Carleton and you are looked down upon for being so. The school is extremely weird and there is no social life. You can only find a party on Saturday nights, and they are pretty awful. High school parties are definitely superior. The only upside of the school is strong academics with great teachers, but I did not enjoy my experience here. Also, being near Minneapolis is not a good selling point since there is no good transportation and nobody really likes to go into the twin cities."
College Sophomore,1,"For students under 21 it's pretty much nonexistent. There's one bar in town that seems to enjoy having Carleton students around, but it's fairly hard to get in if you're underage. Even if you are 21, it's not that great."
College Senior,1,"We don't have Greek life on campus at Carleton College, which is absolutely fine by me."
College Freshman,1,"No merit scholarships offered, so it's hard for me to pay."
College Sophomore,1,"No Greek life. I'm grateful for this, since Greek life can mess with a college's culture. However, there is interest housing which I think fulfills a lot of what Greek life aims to offer."
College Sophomore,1,Very Limited Options – Only a few lucky seniors are able to get draw numbers high enough to live off campus. Carleton also wants to limit the amount of off campus housing in the future. Boo. At least you're close to campus.
College Senior,1,"You're Still in Business? The restaurants here are painfully subpar.  Nothing is awful but I have yet to be impressed anywhere.  Come on, it's a college town, can we get ONE decent restaurant?  I'd be willing to pay a little extra."
College Junior,1,Luck of the Draw – you can't live off campus unless you have a high number in the room draw lottery system.  only 15 numbers or something can live off campus.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Awful Experience – Carleton may have been a great school at one time, but it's not anymore.  The school spends so much money on hooking you in with advertising.  But once you're past freshman year, they could care less.  The food is AWFUL!  The majority of students are incredibly awkward!  I can't imagine a worse college experience.  Employers (even those in MN) have rarely heard of Carleton.  It doesn't help that the career center is useless.  I recommend going to spend $50,000 a year elsewhere.  It's just NOT worth it."
Recent Alumnus,1,Food Poisoning – I had food poisoning three times while eating at the dining hall.

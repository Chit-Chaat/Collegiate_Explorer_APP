Alum,5,"The online experience varies depending on your professor, but most classes offer hybrid courses or at least use blackboard to facilitate assignments. Online nursing classes usually super easy, vocabulary tests, online education majors must film themselves for tests and show the prof that the room is empty, some professors never touch it, some reuse material, some are amazing and should be the demo version for the Blackboard sales team (G. Corso)"
Sophomore,5,Morehead is a beautiful school with a nice small town. It is surrounded by mountains and plenty of opportunities for hiking and camping.
Sophomore,5,"It is difficult at times, but my professors are very helpful and are ready to assist in any difficulties I am having."
Freshman,5,I love Morehead! Both the town and school are incredibly welcoming of students from all walks of life!
Freshman,5,"Each teacher individually emails their classes with clear, distinct instructions on how to access their class either through Zoom, WebEx, or Blackboard."
Freshman,5,"Everyone at MSU are very sweet, friendly and goes above and beyond to help their students. When my daughter passed away in June they were there for me and took over my enrollment and did all they could possibly do for me. I'm a transfer student and I am so glad I made this switch."
Freshman,5,I have taken the virtual success academy and I really enjoyed the online flow. The staff is extremely helpful.
Junior,5,"Great school, even with everything going on today, they are adjusting and improvising to help their students get their degree."
Junior,5,"Have not taken but people say they are great and very understanding, they are helping thousands of people a day!"
Sophomore,5,great college. can walk everywhere. make tons of friends from every where. life long friendships. lots of clubs. college helps any way they can.
Sophomore,5,they have lots of online classes and this past semester was online and it went well. Professors will help you any way they can.
Freshman,5,I just recently became enrolled to my online classes at Morehead and the professors have already emailed me before the school year as started to get to know her students!
Freshman,5,"Morehead State University is such a great campus. Right in the middle or Morehead but when your on campus it's just campus. I went on a visit recently and the tour guides, office workers, and my advisor were all so friendly and helpful. Student life on campus is also a great plus, sororities, fraternities, the BCM. And you have accommodations like the gym right there on campus."
Junior,5,"So far I have had a pleasant experience. I will be transferring to MSU this fall. Any and all questions I have had, the staff has been so helpful and getting me on the right track!!"
Junior,5,I haven’t started my classes yet for online at MSU but everything that I have done online through this college has been easy and great!
Freshman,5,"The school is amazing. The people are nice and helpful. The environment is just wao, gorgeous and pretty diverse of stuff. Love it"
Sophomore,5,"Morehead is a great school with a beautiful campus.  Housing really ranges depending on the dorm. Got in the new dorms this year, Andrews Hall which is wonderful. Campus has a lot of outdoor hiking and things to do. Not really into the party scene to comment on that.  Athletics gym is one of the top. I didn't think I would like going to a smaller school but I have really enjoyed my time and made some great friends. Most classes have been good as have the professors. I have used the career center and recommend it if you are unsure of your major or have questions. Several buildings including the student center and new or remodeled and are very nice. Space center is one of the best there is out there."
Senior,5,"While it's the only college I've been to, I love the time I spent there and can't wait to return.  The staff has always been kind and incredibly helpful, and I cherish the knowledge I gained."
Alum,5,"I had an amazing experience at Morehead State University. I transferred there after attending a local community college, and ended up on one of their regional campuses, close to home. This was an amazing opportunity to be able to stay close to home while finishing my degree. I had great classmates and professors who knew their stuff. I would 100% recommend MSU to anyone looking to further their education."
Freshman,5,My first semester at Morehead State was nothing less but great. I got the opportunity to meet new friends and was around wonderful people that helped me succeed.
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful with many places for students hang out with friends or study for upcoming exams, finals, quizzes, etc. There are a variety of people that are also attending this school which provides for a great opportunity to meet new people and gain new friendships. Overall, many buildings on campus for students to live are in fairly good conditions. There are many classes offered for such a wide variety of fields. There are great restaurants on campus as well as numerous resources to get help for different concerns. Being a first year college student was a big change, but the professors made a welcoming gesture and eliminated extra stress that many incoming college students were facing. I would recommend this college to anyone planning to attend college. When riots start on campus because of LGBTQ members, it makes it extremely difficult to not say anything to those trying to push their belief onto others. Numerous people leaving out God has been my biggest struggle."
Sophomore,5,"Good school with nice professors. But I would like to more opportunities for help paying to attend the school. Also, it is very hard to get help in any department that you need it in."
Niche User,5,Very beautiful campus. They are working extremely hard at trying to help the process with incoming freshmen.
Niche User,5,"Just walking on to campus, I knew this was my future college. They personalized the visit for me and looked at some of the early college classes that I took and told me how they would transfer. The student and staff that I got to talk to where so nice and knowledgeable. I’m very hands on learning style and MSU understands the different learning styles and told me that with the student staff ratio, I would be able to not only learn but succeed. MSU is the school for me and I can’t wait to start!:)"
Alum,5,"Morehead, Kentucky is such a great college town. I was in Greek life and the relationships built in our chapter and with others completely changed how much it felt like home to me. Campus itself is beautiful any time of year and with how stressful classes can be at times, living in Morehead really gives you the opportunity to clear your mind, relax, or explore. I remember always liking to go to Lockegee Rock, Cave Run Lake, or just on long drives down the 60. I never once had a professor I didn’t care for. All faculty were encouraging and approachable at all times so I felt comfortable coming to them for career advice towards the end of undergrad. I’d recommend this school to anyone especially those who are comfortable joining other organizations to make friends"
Alum,5,"Morehead State is more than a university ... it has proved to literally be the family that I didn't have. Thanks to the compassion of my mentor and the encouragement of faculty and staff who pushed me to be a better, stronger person ... I am successful in my field of art and design. I would not be where I am today without the connections I made at MSU."
Sophomore,5,"Great university. Excellent learning environment. Everyone is very helpful at this college. Couldn’t have picked a better school.  Have met many new friends from all over KY.  Wide variety of programs offered just about any field you are looking to study is offered here.  Wonderful on campus living experience including beautiful dorm rooms, pool, work out area, pristine Lake, etc."
Sophomore,5,"Morehead State University is more than just a University but a family. There has not been a day that I have walked across campus without at least one person saying good morning or just waving. The professors truly care about your education, and work with you every step of the way. Never be afraid to ask help from your professors, they are an amazing resource and some departments offer FREE tutoring! If you are looking for a university that is dedicated to higher learning and is a family, then Morehead is the place to be!"
Sophomore,5,I love Morehead because it’s the perfect size and a great environment! There are tons of extracurricular activities constantly happening and millions of ways to always stay busy and involved. Morehead has also allowed me to make connections with professionals for my major. This school has been absolutely perfect for me.
Alum,5,"I am a three-time graduate of MSU. Loved my experiences as an undergraduate and graduate student. Have watched the university grow tremendously. Strong academics, personal attention. You're not a face in the crowd."
Freshman,5,"All in all, a great school. I love the campus and the people. It's a very friendly, open environment. It's a great place to further your career and nurture your love for knowledge."
Freshman,5,The campus is inviting.  The staff is friendly.  The dorms are nice and large.  Morehead offers plenty of degree choices.  There are lots of different activities  to participate in.   The campus has lots of different food to chose from and it's all you can eat.
Senior,5,I am currently a senior at MSU in the social work program. From experience I can honestly say that the faculty is AMAZING. So willing to help push you to reach your fullest potential.
Sophomore,5,I have enjoyed my first year at MSU.  It has been very beneficial to my education and my social life.  I will be attending again in the fall.  This university and its teachers really do care about the students and their success.
Junior,5,The experience at Morehead State was so amazing! The staff and students are very friendly and so helpful. The community surrounding the campus is also very nice. Living conditions and food are a little disappointing but they are working very hard to fix that. Overall I say that the experience there was quite nice!
Niche User,5,"Morehead State University is a very safe campus with realistic resources for students.  Students are the universities first priority and it shows.  Affordability, wide acceptance rate, generous staff and a beautiful, modern campus allows students to thrive throughout their education."
Freshman,5,"Morehead is the perfect place to go to college if you like a small, quiet town. I love how convenient the campus is, and the people here are very friendly. I feel very safe walking from the student center at night, as the MSU police are right on campus all the time. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus and everyone is welcoming. I'm very happy I chose to come to Morehead."
Sophomore,5,Morehead is my home is it the place where I feel comfortable being me. Without being judged for it. Thank you Morehead for always  excepting your student for who they are. I’m learned so much at Morehead with me going into a double major of Art for Graphic Design and Business for a General Business Degree. I’m ready to learn more with my years left at Morehead State University
Niche User,5,"I went on a campus tour, and the students were very respectful. They got to know you, and what you wanted to major in. I also got a one on one tour in the nursing department and it was spectacular. The campus was very safe and had phone booths designed specifically to be used for calling help if in danger. The campus was beautiful and felt like home. Every student looked very happy there. Also, their food is outstanding. Morehead provides their students with anything they need on campus such as: ""gas station but for food"", free washer and drying to wash clothing, huge dorms, amazing food, many activities to do while on campus, one on one time with professors, and so much more. Many encouraged me to further my goals in majoring in nursing."
Niche User,5,"I liked the community especially the people. It is a well rounded school and they are very friendly. They make you feel like home. There may not be a lot of diversity, but the professors and food is spectacular and the sports are great too! I definitely recommend this college to someone that wants to get away from your home town to a different town that is very nature friendly. I also recommend going to the football games and really any sport because you will have a great time! Also, the hiking trips are eye opening and very adventurous if you plan on taking one. I personally loved Morehead and I hope you will too!"
Niche User,5,i haven't been at the school yet but i have heard great things this school and i am really excited to see what this school has to offer and experience the college life.
Niche User,5,"While visiting Morehead State University, I thoroughly enjoyed the atmosphere. Being in a town that felt like home made me love it there. Their dorms were very nice and new, as well as their cafeteria. Morehead is one of my top picks right now because of it's location, amenities such as the wellness center, the lake, and the library, and also the academic programs they provide there."
Junior,5,"This campus is not only a great learning environment, but also an environment to meet new people and have a great time altogether. The professors are very friendly and accessible, the campus itself is not too but nor is it too small. The fun events that are presented to the students along with the intriguing clubs keep the students happy and amused apart from the studying. It is just an overall great experience."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love this university!! I was extremely unhappy at my previous college and coming here has allowed me to do better with my academics, I feel so much more at ease with the professors, and honestly I wouldn't switch schools again for the world."
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore at Morehead State and have so far enjoyed my time here. I have made good connections with professors, and have joined several organizations that allow me to give back to the community, help me deal with stress during finals, and have given me opportunities to make some life-long freinds."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Morehead's campus and staff. The campus is set up in a way that makes students feel at home and at ease about going to school there. Everything is within a 15 minute walk (if you are walking slow) and set up in a way that is easy to find. The staff is always available and go out of their way to help their students succeed and learn their desired major. I could not imagine myself in a more comfortable, welcoming, and helpful environment."
Sophomore,5,I am a 3rd generation student at Morehead State University and I transferred here from Eastern Kentucky University last fall. I love the size of MSU. It isn't too big but isn't so small that you feel like you know everyone TOO personally. The facilities are nice and the many of the professors here are super sweet and willing to work students.
Junior,5,I have been apart of the business and math college. Both are excellent the teachers care about their students and are always willing to talk and help. The campus is small and easy to find everything. The local area of morehead and a very beautiful little town with mom and pop shops all around. If you're looking for a small town campus this is the best choice.
Junior,5,"I really love Morehead State University because of the small town atmosphere in between the beautiful mountains of eastern Kentucky. The college itself is very down to earth and is very personable. The student to faculty ratio is about 20:1, giving students the opportunity to connect with both each other and the professors. Morehead State offers a unique and personal experience for all students who attend."
Freshman,5,I like that Morehead State University is just the right size for me. Morehead is a place of positiveness and exploration. Every student learns something new every single day.
Freshman,5,"I am only a freshman but Morehead has been great. I love my professors and they are all so helpful, I’ve made so many friends and I feel like I’m being very prepared to be a teacher here."
Niche User,5,"Even though Morehead State University is a smaller campus in size compared to other colleges in the state it has a  homey, safe, feeling that most bigger campus around it does not. I have been living on campus for one month each summer for a program called Upward Bound. Upward Bound is a educational program which helps low income or first time students finish high school and then go to college. The program and Morehead State has left such a positive impression on me I plan to attend there for my degree."
Junior,5,This school is smaller but is the perfect size. The professors are really there to make sure that you are successful. I am so glad I chose to go here
Niche User,5,Morehead State University is the perfect university if you want the balance between a small town life while attending a division 1 university.
Niche User,5,"though i'm not a student of morehead, my  visit to morehead was absolutely amazing, it is a beautiful campus, amazing amenities, it even is directly affiliated with NASA, I mean, whats not to love about morehead?"
Niche User,5,I like the athletic and class size along with the community! I think morehead is a great fit for anyone wanting to go to college
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman at Morehead State University starting classes on August 15. I have been to the campus three times and have called several times. The reason I choose this school was because after talking to representatives of the school they were very helpful, more so than any of the other schools I considered. Although the other schools might have been nicer the deciding factor for me was the willingness to help me from the people I talked to at Morehead State University."
Alum,5,Wonderful small school with hands on professors. I received a quality education in the Agriculture department before moving on to graduate school.
Sophomore,5,"Morehead State may be in a small town with not a whole lot to do, but I had an amazing time there. It is in a beautiful area, with amazing professors and facility that truly do care about you."
Junior,5,I've had a great experience at Morehead so far. The Theatre Program is great and I've made so many friends. The ROTC program is great as well and I can't wait to commission in 2019.
Alum,4,"An amazing school with a lot of great programs, campus life, and people in one of the nation's most picturesque areas. 4 stars because sometimes maintenance is a little too cool with the amount of mold in the dorms and the campus is dry. The local community is incredibly supportive, inclusive, and helpful to students. 

They offer courses from self-defense in a dojo to something where you get to go to a shrimp farm. Yee haw!!"
Freshman,4,"Morehead State is a university that feels like home. My professors and mentors have worked hard to stay in contact with me and make sure I always have everything I need. The school has many resources for students in need or even for tutoring. People in he surrounding area are extremely friendly and willing to help when needed. Beware, the town does lack diversity which could be uncomfortable for people like myself. I have found in my time here that I really enjoy how refreshing the beautiful environment is, along with loving the lake on campus. You should absolutely pick Morehead State if you want a good experience."
Freshman,4,I love the size of the school. It has the amenities of bigger colleges without the overwhelming size or tuition price. My only complaint is that I've found it difficult to find a group that I fit in. That is more so my fault than the University's though.
Sophomore,4,"Morehead State University is my home. With fantastic academic programs, a plethora of student services, and a welcome environment, MSU sets its students up for success. All of the staff is friendly and helpful. The professors are super professional and really care about their students success."
Sophomore,4,While I genuinely enjoy this school and most of the professors the school itself definitely need some upgrades overall make sure you have a good pair of rain boots constantly carrying an umbrella and you’ll be good!
Freshman,4,Since starting Morehead I've grown to love the place a lot! It has great facilities and dining options. The dorms and apartments could use a little more love but overall its not bad.
Freshman,4,"As a incoming freshman to MSU and being completely new to the entire college scene it has been a terrifying and stressful process,although all the staff,professors and advisors I have met have been beyond the spectrum of helpful even to the degree of life saving at times. The campus is very well up kept and the scene is warm and inviting a very pleasant. Campus has beautiful scenery,plenty of extra curricular activities and is very much so my top choice of college as freshman. The advisors maintain a very professional stance while offering incredibly unbiased and well educated opinion,although they are very down to earth making it feel warm and inviting to chat with them. They have handled and talked about my concerns and issues doing their best to make sure it's a less stressful and more inviting experience. I am very pleased with just the little bit i've been there to see"
Niche User,4,"great animal science program. I have not been to college yet, but from the information i have gathered from research i am fairly positive it is going to be a great  college for me. There are a lot of hands on activities on campus and within each major or pathway that any student wants to accomplish. This is a great learning environment for all students especially beginners, like me. Not only is it a great learning environment, but a healthy, thus making it better for students mental state. furthermore, for everything a student gets when first joing here is very remembering. This leads me to my next point, they offer all of these advantages to the students, plus it is fairly affordable!"
Sophomore,4,"At Morehead State University, the ratio of students to professors is great! It really gives you the option of knowing your professors and being able to get the individual help you may need! The campus is great and the town of Morehead is a great city to be in! The community at MSU is always inviting and friendly."
Sophomore,4,"Morehead is a relatively quiet place with friendly people. There is sense of security where you can walk down main street after dark without any problems. The classes are rather engaging. The only downside I can see is that like several universities in the state mold was a problem in the dorms, but it was manageable."
Freshman,4,"as a student the campus life is easy to be away from home, because this campus is my home away from home."
Freshman,4,"I love my overall experience with Morehead State. The campus is beautiful and close together, I don't have to hike to class."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the work given by many professors. The environment is fun and safe for the students. Everyone is nice and helpful when walking around campus. 
Something that i would like to change would be having students more involved in every way they can. Most events going on aren't really seen out in public and it keeps students wondering whats going on."
Freshman,4,"Love the small town atmosphere and campus is just right size for me.  Professors seem to be willing to help in any way they can to see you succeed. 
Dorms are all kept nice with the addition of a new one in last couple years.  The recent opening of ADUC with several places to eat, the book store and places to hang out is a great addition to campus.  The Recreation and Wellness Center is a great facility to utilize as well.  Overall MSU was a really good decision for me and I would recommend it to any of my friends that what a great college experience but don't want to attend a big university and get lost in the shuffle."
Freshman,4,"As a starting freshman I can say my experience so far at MSU is good. The professors are very helpful and informative. The academic advisers are very productive and consent. 
There are over 100+ clubs you can join and attend too. The campus is very clean. 
It is a big hilly campus which makes it hard to get to classes on time, but with the right professor you can contact them and you'll be okay."
Junior,4,I am still enrolled but i feel like i am being prepared for the work force and that I will be a very good teacher. The food and the confusion with paying for school can be better though.
Senior,4,"The time I spent at MSU I felt was time well spent. The small class size was beneficial to a more one on one education. They excel in their art programs and I can't wait to go back and finish up my bachelors. Recently, they ""improved"" ADUC, a center for students to eat, gain information on the school, hold meetings, and a few other things. It cost a lot. That money could have gone towards programs Morehead took away so that they could pay for this renovation. That money could have gone to renovate buildings that desperately need it, like the English and Business building: Bert Colmbs. That money could have gone towards hiring new people instead of completely taking away much needed jobs. I love MSU, but I am incredibly bitter about their recent ""improvements""."
Senior,4,So far I have had a great experience . The professors I have had all have been great and some even go out of their way to make sure I understand what we are learning or just how my life in general is going.
Freshman,4,"Morehead was a good school with lots of opportunity for an aspiring medical student like myself. The atmosphere in the town is reasonably quiet, without too many insane night life antics. The extracurriculars at morehead we’re top notch; the new $20m rec center was the icing on the cake of my first semester. Overall I love the school and look forward to many more years there."
Alum,4,I loved the small classes and individual attention. I wish the teachers were paid more and that the chemistry department had better instructors.
Sophomore,4,Pretty good. Campus is pretty much all up hill. Good classes and professors except in the chemistry department.
Junior,4,"I love MSU! For me, I choose MSU because I was close to home, but far enough way to have freedom! MSU is a beautiful and small campus. Everyone in your department will go out of their way to help you!"
Senior,4,It's a great campus. Small but the people are caring. If you like the outdoors then this is a great place to be.
Freshman,4,"I really do love this college but there are some downfalls to the way things work. They have a tutoring center but sometimes even the tutors aren't sure how to help you and that can be really frustrating. I live in a form and I have to say, there are some RAs who seem to be a little too into your personal life and it doesn't always feel like there's much privacy. I am unable to go home on weekends so I have spent time looking for things to do on and around campus but there really isn't much to ever do. The problem I have with the food is sometimes you find hair, my hair is very very short so I know a really long hair can't be mine. I have noticed lots of the workers don't wear hair nets when they're handling the food. Overall I do love this college but there are some improvements that need to be made."
Senior,4,The health promotion professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. The campus has a nice recreation and wellness center. The food on campus is about average. There are a variety of clubs to join. They have a career services building to help students prepare for after college.
Junior,4,"The professors are great, the campus is beautiful, and the people here really make you feel at home and safe under all the pressure and stress. All and all, I would recommend Morehead State University to anyone who is interested in learning and having fun."
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore  at Morehead State University. This school is great, I have switched my major twice and the advisors really helped me out. The career center is awesome. Especially if you are like me and do not know what you want to major in. They give you this personality test to evaluate what you would excel at the most. The social life is pretty great as well. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus. So far, I am pleased with my decision to attend Morehead State University."
Sophomore,4,Morehead State is a great place to spread your wings without being too far out of your comfort zone. The campus is a lot smaller and closer knit than those around it and there is always staff and officers willing to help!
Graduate Student,4,Morehead State is a one of safety and academics universities in the south.It would be great or your academic study.
Freshman,4,"I like the small close knit campus with the good eating options, my only complaint would be that the school learns liberal instead of in the middle."
Sophomore,4,"Good, friendly atmosphere. Professors are friendly, understanding, and very helpful. Lits of organizations to get involved with. Dorms are nice."
Junior,4,I'm a distance learner in one of their online degree programs. It can be hard to make sure everything is set up and in order when you aren't face to face but everyone there makes it a breeze. The teachers are helpful and knowledgeable and their online classes are so convenient!
Sophomore,4,Morehead State is a great university at a very reasonable price. It has some very good programs here and the professors want to see you succeed.
Freshman,4,"I went to Morehead state and am currently still attending as  Music education major with a focus in voice. I chose MSU because of their world wide highly ranked music program. The professors are excellent and personable, the criteria and classes are challenging, and the cost isn't going to dig you a grave of debt."
Sophomore,4,The college is beautiful but some of the majors are terrible (the teachers suck) and scheduling is the worst.
Freshman,4,"I love the campus, its very pretty! I enjoy sports events, and when people are together on campus. The only problem is living areas though, they should be updated."
Senior,4,"Morehead State University is located in a safe, and welcoming city known as Morehead, KY. The campus is beautiful, and there are a lot of friendly people. Morehead State University has an outstanding Psychology department. I dislike how the University makes the $100 per semester meal plans mandatory for off campus students, and would like to see that change. I also dislike how much renovation and construction that occurs on campus throughout the semesters. I would like the University to limit the amount of construction/renovation on campus during the semesters, and plan for the majority of it to take place in the Summer when there aren't as many students on campus."
Freshman,4,Wonderful university with caring Professors and staff. Safest campus i have ever been on because of the small campus and the dedicated MSU police force. They are Building and expanding on a massive scale. new building going up and renovations going on every year. construction an be inconvenient but the safety and quality of facilities is always in mind for the students. They have an excellent teaching and education department. The University of Kentucky has a partnership with MSU and helps to advance the health care programs.  Overall i am so glad I decided to attend Morehead State for my collegiate career.
Freshman,4,"It's such a pretty campus! It's all uphill though, so it can be a struggle at times. They are currently renovating the dorms! Many of them are nice looking on the inside. They offer a lot of different courses with many hands on type degrees"
Alum,4,"Had fun, made life long friends. Morehead is set in a beautiful valley of the Northern Appalachian Mountains The campus is modern, well-kept, safe, and friendly. Academics are easy (I majored in Journalism). Sports are middle of the road but the social life is excellent. Great way to get away from reality for 4-5 years."
Freshman,4,"I am attending Morehead State University currently. I love the environment there. What I would like to see change is the food and the majors. At Morehead we do not have very many majors or minors. I was wanting a Biochemistry major, however Morehead does not offer that so I had to major in Chemistry and get a Masters degree in the future if I want to be a Biochemist. Also, the food there is not that great and the hours of when restaurants are open are very small. I would hope they change the food and keep the food open longer than it is now so that people who have night classes can get something to eat after their class gets out."
Niche User,4,Morehead is a beautiful  campus with amazing facility and staff. They have every thing a college could have and students would be lucky to be accepted and attend. 
Niche User,4,Morehead State University offers a wide variety of majors. They offered classes through my local high school. It was a great way to start my college education. 
College Junior,4,I feel like there's a lot I can accomplish
College Sophomore,4,Watch out for the Man Cave Gang... Lively group of partiers!
College Sophomore,4,"A lovely school and Society. it's a small town, but has big heart. Accepting of different cultures and religions, and because of that, it's a diverse place... a walk of all lives! GO EAGLES (PS smokers behind Biard music hall is the best!)"
College Sophomore,4,I chose this school because of its reputation for having a great nursing program and it has definitely lived up to its expectations. All of the professors and advisors truly care about our success! They take time to listen to your questions and help however they can.
College Sophomore,4,The courses with professor are generally interesting because they make them seem interesting
College Sophomore,4,"We may have the best team, but the school spirit remains regardless."
College Sophomore,4,My overall school experience progressively gets better and better all the time. It is usually interesting on a daily basis.
College Freshman,4,"the people are iffy, but overall, i love the school"
College Junior,4,"MCCLURE CIRCLE. It's unbelievable how many brain cells have been lost there. The place is fun, isn't super sketchy, and is a great way to relieve some stress on Thursday nights."
College Junior,4,Didn't I already write something about this exact same thing?
College Junior,4,"Personally, I haven't seen many problems relating to diversity and inclusion, but that doesn't mean there aren't any."
College Junior,4,"Having lived in two of the nicer dorms on campus, Mignon Tower and Alumni Tower, I have had a very positive experience. My friends who have lived in various other buildings haven't had such a great time. But the opening of Andrews Hall in the fall of 2016 will definitely set a precedent for housing at MSU and I'm looking forward to living there. RA's are very laid-back and can be some of your best friends or worst enemies. Some dorms have very tight-knit communities and great atmospheres because of the groups that end up populating the lobby nightly and hanging out, but some others don't have much interaction between residents."
College Junior,4,"Honestly, can't complain about anything. MSU is the place to be."
College Freshman,4,I think I will be highly successful after college and I really believe my major and classes are what is going to make me successful
College Freshman,4,I love my school and I am very happy with the decision I made to go here.
College Freshman,4,I love East Mignon hall! It is absolutely beautiful and I love the four-person suite.
College Freshman,4,Our rec center is absolutely fantastic. I am not a hugely athletic person but I really enjoy playing softball and It's easy to get into the softball intermural league to play and have fun.
Sophomore,2,"I love this campus and how pretty it is. There is also some help for students with general advising. However, it feels like this school doesn't care about its students and is only wanting money. Parking passes are $180 for a year. Dining is outrageous, especially for freshmen, and the food honestly sucks. Don't fall for how amazing the Rock is when you visit. Any other time the food there sucks. If you want to live with a parent off-campus before you're 21 or have 60 credits, make sure you get your exemption waiver turned in or it's $100 late fee. You're paying your professors to teach you, but don't expect them to actually teach or help you. Many won't. Safety is something they advertise when you visit. It's a joke. If you file a report with the police department, they'll ""look into it."" Housing maintenance doesn't exist. Fire alarms go off all the time in many of the halls at any hour of the day or night. There's not much to do around campus except party or greek life."
Niche User,2,"As part of the Craft Academy program for gifted high school students, I lived on campus for the duration of my time at the University.  I found them uniquely ill-prepared to handle the transition between life at home and life on campus for those of us with socialization issues.  Definitely not what they advertised to myself and my parents."
Junior,2,"I enjoy the faculty here, but a lot of the students are rude. This school has felt like an extension of high school where people need to learn to grow up but choose not to."
Freshman,2,Beautiful area. Very expensive education for those who are out of state. Love the lake on campus. Not easy access to healthy food.
College Junior,2,My last roommate said that they used him being late on dues as an excuse to kick him out temporarily because the club wasn't as popular as they used to be. My roommate spent most of his time at work getting money to pay for tuition and dues and class and playing a star wars mmorpg. It's not his fault that there were some new popular jocks on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,Professors felt like they were trying to be friends with you rather than your teacher.
Recent Alumnus,2,Hated every minute there. I have to start all over at a new school just to redo the damage they did in helping me with my future.
Recent Alumnus,2,They didn't really teach me anything that would help in my field or getting a job with it.
Recent Alumnus,2,"They seem nice at first. But, after a while you notice that they only care about social status. I tried rushing a sorority, and it was miserable. The girls only wanted to know the basics, like my name, my major, and where I was from. Then they only wanted to talk about themselves."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If I could put it into one sentence, it would be, 2 years wasted here. I went to Morehead to finish up my Bachelors. I went because family and friends went here, they always said it was the best school for me. Just the two years there made me felt like I was lied too. Frist, I didn't really learn anything in my field to help me when I graduated. Second, they only care about getting their name out there. Third, student body is not very diverse, such as they only care about athletes, students in on-campus organizations(student clubs and greek life), if you are not any of these you mostly treated like dirt. Sadly, I have to go back to school to redo the damage this place did for my future. Thanks!"
College Sophomore,2,My freshman year experience wasn't the best. The rooms were nice but I didn't get along well with the people I was placed with.
College Sophomore,2,"Housing was not as terrible as it could have been, but the housing office really makes it hard on students. If you live in a room and have 50% or less occupancy, then you go through a process called consolidation. It's mainly just filing up empty beds and using as little space as possible. However, this process was not smooth and took a good three weeks of worry and hassle to get through."
College Sophomore,2,Housing will be better with the new dorms more then likely
College Sophomore,2,To me even a little bit is bad.
College Freshman,2,"Our sports are not a big part of our college life, which I prefer. I much prefer that the school focus on classes than sports"
College Junior,2,The bars close at 12. one is only open on thursdays and no one has parties that don't get busted
College Junior,2,i know high schools who are better than what we have for a college
College Junior,2,We are a growing campus without growing food. always long lines and there is never what you want avalible
College Sophomore,2,"There are house parties, but few bars."
College Senior,2,"Off-Campus options are terrible for a college town. There are no fast-casual options like Moes, Panera, or Chipotle. There are a few mom and pop style restaurants around town that are okay, but Morehead is really lacking in off-campus dining. Fast food is terrible."
College Senior,2,The financial aid department is the worst department on campus. They do not care about the students. I know multiple students who have had to drop out of college because the department made mistakes on their aid.
College Junior,2,There really isnt anything here. The biggest attraction would be a few small bars.
College Freshman,2,You can get away with a lot of stuff here. It's pretty ridiculous. I'm trying to study here not party all day every day.
College Junior,2,The housing sucks. The elevators are always breaking down and the washing machines eat your cloths if their not stolen first.
College Freshman,2,There's nothing to do here and you're very often bored.
College Sophomore,2,The campus police are very helpful in many ways but in my opinion they go WAY overboard when it comes to ticketing people for parking! There is not nearly enough room on our campus for everyone to park anyways and they just make it worse.
College Junior,2,Boring town but a lot to do on campus.
College Junior,2,School spirit is fairly low but rising every sport's season.
College Freshman,2,Campus living could use an upgrade.
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid building is of no help, you are better off going to billing."
College Freshman,2,Theres not a lot of off-campus housing around and if you are from out of state it is more difficult to live in off-campus housing.
College Freshman,2,"The school, when you first apply for everything, really tries to confuse you in taking more money from you honestly. I hated it with every fiber of my being, but I know that I need financial aid and have to fight through it. I am probably in no place to give advice about financial aid, given that the school doesn't exactly 'help' when you need them to. All I can say is good luck to anyone trying to figure it out; and praise you if you do."
College Freshman,2,"A lot of kids drink. ""Thirsty Thursday"" is actually what it's called around here. If you party, I guess it's a good thing.

The frats are almost always having parties, and they typically do a good job of covering themselves when it comes to parties, but the only thing, at least I feel, the cops around here are worried about is where people are parked; not alcohol. As far as any other kind of drug, I'm not sure. I do not associate with anyone who participates in that kind of thing and also do not intend to."
College Sophomore,2,"The parking is not enough and with reserved parking it is expensive and they are never full. I can not go out to the store, movies, or anywhere during the week because of parking. I know that if I leave I will have to park in overflow and I paid for zone S, which is more money. I hate that half the time I am parking in parking spaces where the price is half what I paid because there are no parking spaces. And overflow is far away, across a busy street and I do not feel conformable parking there. "
College Freshman,2,they over sold parking passes
College Freshman,2,"there is one bar close by, iv never been but its the only thing iv seen"
Recent Alumnus,2,Just a few local establishments with a few fast food.
College Sophomore,2,"It rains a lot, and walking to class can be a pain. "
College Sophomore,2,"Typical, run-of-the-mill fast food places. "
College Freshman,2,You can pretty much do anything wherever. 
College Freshman,2,Most people are fine staying in to watch netflix.
College Freshman,2,Scholarships are very hard to receive here.
College Junior,2,"anything and everything goes on,"
College Junior,2,scholarships are very hard to get.
College Junior,2,there's 2 to choose from.
College Junior,2,professors can be very difficult and unprofessional.
College Junior,2,not great at all. after 4pm the choices and food quality is terrible.
College Freshman,2,"few events, usually on Thursdays, no weekend nightlife"
College Freshman,2,"most things are closed on the weekends, few things to do in town"
College Freshman,2,Its hard to gauge how campus police will act because most officers react differently to different things.
College Sophomore,2,"While still functional, the wifi dependability is atrocious."
College Senior,2,"The weather in Morehead is always worse than in my neighboring home town. If there is a slight chance of rain, its definitely raining in Morehead, Ky. I used to live in a dorm and I can only remember them calling off classes twice due to weather, and I was stuck on campus in the snow. Sometimes I do believe they need to consider students safety a little more and know when to call off class earlier. "
College Junior,2,"The bar in town is for 21 and older only... which is stupid when you are trying to encourage people not to drunk drive. There are no clubs. There are plenty of parties, but you have to be careful about which ones you attend."
College Freshman,2,The Wi-Fi on campus goes out a lot. The computers in the computer labs are slow and the GAs in the labs get angry when someone brings in a laptop. The printing cost is a little high and you have to have Beaker Bucks to print anything. A personal printer will help a lot as will a personal laptop.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life usually just have parties. I never hear them do anything good for the campus.
College Freshman,2,"I love in Nunn its usaully nice to live in. But a lot of times you cant use the washer because people wont get their laundry or its broken down. Its always loud people yelling, playing music loud, or just running up and down the balcony."
College Senior,2,"The options are basically all the regular fast food chain restaurants in any town. While there are a few good mom and pop places, they get old fast."
College Sophomore,2,"Personnel are not very helpful and are very hard to get up with. For example, my housing exemption and meal plan forms were lost and could not be found multiple times. I even had to fill the form out twice, and drive an hour to get a notary public's stamp for no reason."
College Senior,2,Parking on campus isn't that great. This year there have been more parking permits sold than parking spots.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking at Morehead State University is decent in terms of availability but the cost of parking permits seems a little outrageous. To park on campus, it can be close to $200 and most of the time those spots are taken by those who don't have an on campus parking tag."
Junior,1,"This place sucks. I hate my life everyday at this college. It is all about money. The professors make everything so much harder than it has to be and I hope everyone who does that loses their job and knows and feels the pain that they cause everyone. We are required to take stupid classes that we do not need just so they can receive more money from us. Education should not be about money. Sadly this is a very ""normal"" thing now in almost every college. I hate everything about this place. I am on depression and anxiety medicine now because of this awful torture they call a college. For the love of everything you believe in, DO NOT GO HERE. It should be illegal what happens here. The professors love to feel superior by making students feel dumb. They do not have to make it this hard but they do. Probably they are mad at themselves for have doctorates and just using it to get a crappy paying professor job that barely gets them by on their bills. Serves them right."
Niche User,1,If you are a minority of any kind STAY AWAY FROM HERE.  There is no diversity at all.  The truth is the people who work here and the students prefer it that way. If they could not hire minorities or not have minority students they would be happy. If you're a minority wanting to go to school here teach here or work here you should REALLY look into the school. The confederate flag is everywhere. Its on cars houses and people's clothes. Don't let the pictures fool you because they got the only minorities on campus in them and alot of them are not there any more. There is nothing to do on campus or in the town especially if your a minority and the nonminorities don't want you in their stuff. If you compare it to other universities you would really see the difference. I don't think the people have ever been out of the county. Sometimes they don't have classes that you need to graduate and alot of the professors don't get back to you when you email them. The whole place is run badly.
Freshman,1,"Morehead allows excessive bullying and does nothing about it, I don't recommend good going there because if you have a problem they will not do anything about it. Worst college!"
College Sophomore,1,They're the only ones who get excused absences & the good jobs.
College Junior,1,It is the worst thing I have ever experienced. I am so un happy with it
College Sophomore,1,It is a very confusing process and no one in the office is able to explain the ordeal.
College Junior,1,"My financial aid counselor is absolutely terrible. It takes her at LEAST three weeks to get back to me, if at all. She has a rude tone in her emails toward me, and offers no help or advice as to how to fix things. I lost my federal work study AND my KEES money due to her. Financial aid is something that all MSU students have had problems with. It is definitely something that they need to work on in the worst of ways."
College Sophomore,1,The cost is just way to much for parking. 
College Freshman,1,You might as well just not bring a car.
College Freshman,1,There is nothing to do on campus except for house parties.
College Freshman,1,Parking is literally the worst. there is no where to park and everything is so far away.
College Sophomore,1,"There are places to park but not nearly enough for all the students on campus.  Do not move your car during the week or else you will probably end up parking on the complete other side of campus, far away from the dorms.  A lot of people go home on the weekends so parking spaces become readily available during the weekends."
College Freshman,1,I never see spaces open or they take spaces away. And some students will stand in empty lot for their friends.
College Freshman,1,"The price for a permit is ridiculous and you still may not even find a spot. On the website, there is a disclaimer that states that just because you have a permit doesn't guarantee you a spot. If I'm gonna give you that much money, you should dang well guarantee that I'm going to get a spot. Also, sometimes, your dorm is on one side of campus and you may have to walk half a mile to the other side of campus to reach your vehicle. It's just plain ridiculous!!!"
College Freshman,1,"Could Be Better – They got rid of the 24 hour computer lab and placed the computers in the library. The bad thing is that the library is only open until 11pm during the week and 6 or 7 on the weekends. So if you work until midnight and need a paper printed for your class the next day, you're out of luck."
College Freshman,1,"Not Enough Spaces – There are fewer on-campus parking spaces than on-campus permits and no where near enough dorm spaces, so you may have to park in one of the far-off or overflow lots.  Plus, it doesn't matter if you are a senior or freshman, the likelihood of getting a space is the same."
College Junior,1,Rain and snow make campus a very horrible experience. When it rains campus side walks and cross walks flood and it is impossible to stay dry. When it snows side walks are snowy and slippery.
College Junior,1,Greek life on campus is a complete joke to me. I don't believe they do anything for the campus or community. I feel the only reason people join is to buy friends and party. If I knew they did something productive I would have answered differently.
College Freshman,1,Parking is terrible. You have to pay $120 just for a parking pass and then there still isn't any where to park.
College Senior,1,If you are a girl greek life is not that important.  You can still join the events anyway.  If you are a male then you are either greek or nothing.  You cannot really come to greek events unless you are a greek.

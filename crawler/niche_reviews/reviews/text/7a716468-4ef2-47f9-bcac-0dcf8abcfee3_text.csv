Freshman,5,Due to covid I'm doing my first semester online and it's been very smooth so far. I am really hoping to be in person next semester. Everyone has been very helpful.
Freshman,5,I didn't take any classes online yet. Becaus I'm a freshman and I have to live on campus. But when I'm thinking about taking classes online because I want to stay at home and relax.
Freshman,5,My sister want there and it feels like home to me. The reason why I'm going beacuse it safe and it not far from home.
Freshman,5,I have not taken any online courses. The courses that I am in do offer online lectures if we are not able to attend the class.

Sophomore,5,I love being at Oral Roberts University! It's such a awesome place to be. The professors and staff are so helpful. There are so many organizations and clubs to join on campus. If you want to go to a  great christian college this is the place.

Sophomore,5,"ORU is a great place with such a nice community of students, staff, and professors.My experience at ORU has been totally pleasant and fun. From the first day I arrived I felt at home (although I am very far from home). There are many places that you can go in your free time and share with your friends, just like there are places, like the prayer tower, where you can go to spend time by yourself."
Sophomore,5,Online classes are great! The online platform we use is D2L and it is very easy to use!Teachers have done their best to give us the best of online education in an easy way. Most of the classes are via zoom which means you can share and see your classmates and share just as you would in a classroom.

Junior,5,Being at ORU for 3 years has made a huge impact on my life. from the professors to the community and the spiritual aspect is great. The one thing that I would recommend change toward is the housing restrictions and why it is so difficult for students to petition to not live on campus.
Sophomore,5,"Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, I got to experience taking online classes. All the professors were understanding and took the students into consideration of where they were in the world."
Sophomore,5,"Oral Roberts is not just a college, it is a community that invites others to be apart of a family. Each year new people from different nations come to Oral Roberts, and it is amazing to see them bring their culture to Oral Roberts."
Junior,5,I have taken some classes online. Some of these classes are set up like an independent study class where you log in and do the work at your own convenience. Other classes are a bit more structured and require work each week or each class.
Junior,5,The best planned/laid out class I’ve ever taken online. Easy to use the platform and you take a course that teaches you how to use it so you’re earning credit while learning how to be an effective student.
Freshman,5,"Great! Oral Roberts University has help me in every part of my life, not just only academically, but also spiritually and physically. I love every part of the University and I highly recommended to everyone!"
Freshman,5,"Yes, having classes online is almost as the same as taking it on campus, professors eventhough dont see you face to face they are still willing to help you in everything you need. Obviously being on campus is the best, but is incredible how Oral Roberts University tries to make you feel just like you where on campus while taking the class online."
Freshman,5,I would like to see more Barbadian students accepted and I love ORU and I have been blessed with amazing teachers and I have been given many various amazing scholarship opportunities and I have the opportunity to represent Barbados to take national titles home to be a young pastor I would like to see the culture change and the food change every week as well and I would like to see housing be open for free and I would for more quest live zoom sessions be open for students to connect and I have been taught how to pray more and devote more time to God

Senior,5,Spirit filled with excellence honor and integrity as a code. Very good rigor!  Don’t underestimate the small size.  ORU features more diversity than any other place.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the community and the ability to make friends quickly! Beautiful campus that students can enjoy, by either eating outside in the garden or playing games in the student hall. It is very lively and fun."
Freshman,5,I love this school. It really prepares you for adulthood without all of the unnecessary partying. Great educational environment with high standards but many helpful resources.
Freshman,5,"I went for an ORU visit and I immediately loved it. I attended some of the classes and the teachers were amazing. They prayed with the students before class started and even took time to hear how their day was going. The cafeteria food was pretty good, infact too good, might have to watch my weight when I start school. I loved it!"
Graduate Student,5,"There are many good things about this university! Best campus life! The professors are fantastic! 
The student's life is very active! The campus is outstanding, and the food is good too! 
The tuition is affordable. 
The university focuses on nurturing students with whole-person education to impact the whole world. 
The Alumni intensely engage with students and professors!"

Niche User,5,"I absolutely loved my time taking concurrent classes here. I took both Spanish 101 and Spanish 102. I honestly loved my professors and feel like I was taught the subject matter clearly and well. The courses were difficult and challenged me, but my confidence in speaking Spanish has gone through the roof.  I'm so incredibly grateful for this school"
Freshman,5,"I love the diversity of students that Oral Roberts University has. I get to know about other cultures and traditions that I have never heard of and it was fascinating. Teachers care about students' education as they make sure students get the information they need from the class. Teachers show love and respect towards their students as students also show to their teachers. Also, Students express their love and kindness towards their peers as students hold doors so they can enter the building. Everyone in the school, including staff and teachers, always have a smile on their face as that brightens up my days. The facilities work extremely hard to keep the school clean and the clean environment makes me feel really happy. I love how we have two chapels every week and I am able to hear words of wisdom from preachers. Every time I went to chapel, it eases my mind as I am prepared to hear words from God and I felt that I am closer to God than ever."
Freshman,5,"I love the atmosphere at ORU! Everyone is so friendly and welcoming and that was exactly what i was looking for in college. Along with the presence of the Holy Spirit, it is my favorite place to be away from home."
Niche User,5,"I am excited to go to Oral Roberts University and experience the social, academic, and spiritual opportunities the school is offering. Hope to get involved and be a beneficial member of the ORU community."

Senior,5,"I love Oral Roberts University with all of my heart.  One of the best decisions I've made yet is coming to this school.  The people here are second to none, the campus is gorgeous.  I love this place."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this university for many reasons. I have seen a change in myself that I would not have obtained with a traditional university or college. They have a whole person approach not jut the knowledge for the degree and it includes the body (being in shape and fit), academics, and spirit. This college is like none that I have ever heard of. If you want a degree and you want a full life change then you need to seek Oral Roberts University. It will change your life."
Graduate Student,5,This school has some amazing qualities. The only things that need to improve is the cafeteria and also the housing.
Sophomore,5,ORU is dedicated to education whole persons. Every faculty member is passionate about watching students succeed.
Junior,5,"ORU is a beautiful campus,very clean. There are a lot of students from different ethnicities,so there is a feel of multiculturalism. Academics are very rigorous,but tutors are provided to help with student success. A lot of campus activities are offered for student involvement.  The area is surrounded by a Christian Church and a lot of nice restaurants. There are a lot of sports teams at ORU and intramural teams. Breakfast is the best meal served on campus.  There is a feeling of safety  on the campus."
Sophomore,5,I love it! Such an amazing school. It is so easy to get involved in the student body and meet new people. The classes are exceptional and every educational.
Freshman,5,This university's atmosphere is incredible and definitely one of a kind. The Holy Spirit filled environment is better than advertised and the community of family that you become a part of is wonderful.
Freshman,5,"The campus was so beautiful; the professors were very kind, understanding, helpful and taught information in a way that made it very easy to grasp; it was close to family; they provided scholarships and many ways to help students pay for college; they are a Christian facility and their main objective is helping students grow closer to Christ and grow spiritually in their faith. It to me is an overall beautiful school with wonderful people and great learning options."
Senior,5,I love my university Oral Roberts University! It is a smaller college and so it takes time to meet people but the people you meet are guaranteed to be incredible. It is always easy to get help with academics from professors and I find it challenges me well!
Sophomore,5,"Oral Roberts is a life changing university.  It's like a piece of heaven fell and landed on earth. Everyone one is welcoming and warm. The university provides all the material and resources needed to learn. Books can be expensive but students have come with a chat that allows students to buy and sell their books to other students for a cheaper price. The teachers are open to helping students when it comes to tryin to raise a grade. There are plenty of places and material like virtual reality simulation, books, group study with a teacher, etc., to help students study. Campus and dorm life is always up beat, even on a slow day."
Senior,5,If you are looking for a college that will give you whole education and grow you Spiritually as a Christian that ORU is the college for you. The environment ar ORU is conducive for building long-time friendship and finding your God-given purpose.
Sophomore,5,"Oral Roberts is a great school attend. I've grown mentally, physically, and spiritually since I've arrived. It's just something you have to experience on your own. The reason why it's such a good school is because they put God first and they lay down the path for you to focus and be successful in whatever you do."
Niche User,5,"Oral Roberts is not only an exceptional academic institution that grows you intellectually, sets you up with connections and the skills to succeed and profit in the workplace or any future endeavors, and accepts you as an individual, its also a community of great people and staff members that want to see you succeed in life more than anything."
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere is great.  The people are great.  The professors are helpful, just hard to understand since so many are foreign.  There is a large multicultural population and you can get to know lots of foreigners."
Sophomore,5,I've had such a great experience at ORU so far. The professors really care about the students and are always there to answer questions and emails about anything I have questions about.
Sophomore,5,"I am an online student. I live in Tulsa, so I am allowed to visit the campus when my schedule allows me too. The professor and assistants are always willing to help you with any area.  The campus is really spread out and it takes a lot of energy to get around.  If you get lost the students and facility are always will to direct you to the correct place.  The classes require a lot of preparation and study.  This is the best discussion I made in years.  I am a 63 year old return student. with an excellen GPA."
Freshman,5,"My time in Oral Roberts University had been of significant impact and challenge in my life. It isn't only the experience and opportunity to make friends around the world but also the interest of the professors, who are looking to motivate the students and built a culture of leadership around the world."
Alum,5,"There is something very special happening at ORU. The community is sweet, the teachers (mostly) are phenomenal (stay out of ICD), and the Lord's hand is on the university."
Sophomore,5,"I love ORU! You have a community of people that care to see you succeed and won't let you hang on your own. One of the things I wish could be changed is the quality of food that is given at the cafeteria and uncleanness of the workers when they make the food. But other than that, ORU is great."
Junior,5,"Attending Oral Roberts University has been a major blessing for me. With classes in spirituality, hearing God's voice, and knowing the Holy Spirit, my relationship with God has gone to a whole new level. I would recommend this college to anybody that is seeking to do the will of God and who wants to be thoroughly equipped with a top-notch education to do so."
Freshman,5,"The christin environment and easily aporoachable professors. The university has diverse sports which are highly facilitated, the food is diverse so one has many options to choose from. The people are friendly and its easy for one to have friends on campus. The security is expectional both on campus and around the university"
Freshman,5,"You can grow, not only as a student but as a whole person. Whole person empowered education. For a better future."
Sophomore,5,Student life is so wonderful. The academics are challenging. I do not know of a person who breezes through any part. We all work very hard. If you have a disability this school is maybe not for you.
Sophomore,5,"Experience-wise, I have had the time of my life at this university. I am thankful for ORU for the ways it has pushed me out of my comfort zone in order to achieve things I never thought possible."
Junior,5,"My experience at Oral Roberts University so far has been wonderful. The atmosphere is healthy and friendly, the teachers want to help you succeed and the student body as a whole has a good feel to it. The school has ongoing events, all kinds of sports and a top-notch academic curriculum. I would highly recommend this school to anyone."
Junior,4,"I have taken classes online and in-class and Both have been great experiences. The professors are very personable and only want the very best for their students, you aren't just seen as a number in their classroom. Overall they have a great staff and there are plenty of resources if a student is in need of help."
Junior,4,Oral Roberts University is a fantastic college that I would recommend to everyone. The culture on campus is awesome especially if you want to go deeper with your faith. There are a lot of opportunities and so many amazing people to meet.
Senior,4,"I have taken a few courses online that were independent study, and I enjoyed them. If I had any questions or concerns, I was able to go to my professor's office on campus and speak with him. In terms of switching to an online format during the COVID-19 pandemic, ORU did a great job of transitioning. I did not find it any more difficult to continue my classes online and my professors were very understanding since the transition was new to everyone.Even though we were all separated, they made a point to make us feel connected."
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at ORU very much. I was struggling to figure out what I wanted to major in, but I knew I wanted to do something with language. I was interested in translation and interpreting, but the only language options were with Spanish or French, and I wanted to do Chinese. So I talked to the head of the department about it and he got it approved for me to major in translation and interpreting with Chinese. He was very understanding and excited for me to be the first student at ORU to graduate with this major and expand the program. All of the professors care about their students and work with them to achieve their goals, and the overall atmosphere is great. Such a great community."
Freshman,4,"It was great. The overall campus was amazing, but if you are looking for a school that hosts parties, then I would look else where."
Freshman,4,The professors made sure that we were well situated to learn online. They were dedicated to helping us and were always available to talk. It was a great experience.
Junior,4,Extremely easy to work with to get the details worked out and explaining the process of applying and starting classes. They have classes planned with working students in mind. They have a non-traditional semester schedule which allows flexibility for full time working adults to still work towards their degree. Due to it being a private school their costs are a little high even with the discount given in tuition for online only students. Other than that a great school.
Senior,4,"I love Oral Roberts University.  There have been a few challenges, just like anywhere else, things are always changing. I have had an overall wonderful time here at ORU and will also be doing my grad. school here. ORU has some of the best faculty and staff; however, I wish they would hire new professors because we are falling short nowadays."
Niche User,4,"Oral Roberts is an excellent Christian college that not only equips you to be successful in your career, but also helps develop and grow you as a leader in life and in your profession. A lot of other colleges just focus on teaching you the necessary tools for your career, but they don't invest in you as a person. Oral Roberts University trains your whole person. Your mind, body, and spirit. Definitely something no other college can provide."
Junior,4,"the school is very great, the professors really want you to succeed, and do their best to provide the equipment needed to help us succeed. When it comes to culture and campus life, it can be difficult to connect with big groups of people in the sense that there isn't much school spirit and improvements could be made regarding the cafeteria selection and the dorm rooms buildings, but I know in the next few years they will be fixing both of those so I'm anxious to see what they do with the place!"
Junior,4,I am currently am a Junior in the online program. I am in ministry and leadership program with a focus on outreach and evangelism. The teachers are so willing to help and the classes have expanded my knowledge immensely. Love this school.
Sophomore,4,"I love ORU, everybody is so friendly, and everyone smiles as you walk past. Everyone is a family there. There is a lot to do at ORU, from sporting events to student held parties. And if that is not for you, we have concerts, and you can always go out and explore Tulsa."
Junior,4,"ORU  has been a great college experience. If you are looking for a safe place to be exposed to diversity it's rather ideal. Students are from all over the world so you get to know people from vastly different cultures. Almost every professor that I have had classes with have been willing to work and help you throughout your semester, giving them chances to learn about you and you chances to learn from them. The only reason I haven't give the school a five-star rating is the lack of support for the arts. ORU is the only Christian college that I have found to have any kind of competent art program, yet they don't seem to want to fund it. Other colleges of the same price would help pay for a computer and the software you need to complete your classes. ORU does not. This is one of the few flaws I have really found with the school."
Junior,4,"I love the atmosphere and the people. The professors really take time to invest in their students and the academics are rigorous. Lots of opportunities to study abroad and do missions. Also, the campus is very diverse, representing students from 90 different countries. The campus grounds are beautiful and it is easy to get to know people. The only issue I had was with the size of the counseling department. It was too small to meet the demand for counseling and many students had to be turned away. They are currently working on expanding."
Sophomore,4,Oral Roberts University is a great Christian University with a lot of diversity and great academics.  ORU has good professors that want you to excel and succeed.
Sophomore,4,"My experience has been good I have been able to prepare myself better for the future. Also, I have been able to cultivate at ORU."
Graduate Student,4,Oral Roberts University is founded in principles that have stayed consistent through the many changes our nation has seen. The education is top notch because the faculty keeps it that way.
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time here but it is a little too expensive.  I have reached the end of my senior year and can not graduate because I have ran out of federal funding.  That makes it so I can't graduate without more help, and I haven't gone to school before."
Senior,4,Oral Roberts University is an excellent school for growing closer in your personal relationship with God and connecting with fellow Christians. I would like to see the attendance and swimming proficiency policies change.
Junior,4,I really enjoy the whole person assessment here at ORU! They teach to your mind body and spirit(whole-person)! I love having a college where I can be developed wholly!
Freshman,4,"Oral Roberts University allows you to grow relationships from different backgrounds. Furthermore, this university also further develops a student intellectually, spiritually and mentally."
Freshman,4,"Oral Roberts University has helped me in multiple aspects in my journey to become more successful and to grow as individual. One aspect this university has helped me in is to cope with the pressures of college life, for instance: during finals week the school hosted a small roll coaster ride for students to use as a stress reliever. Also, in the school's hammer center there was free candy at the front desk. This helped me and other students greatly."
Senior,4,"The community aspect is really nice. All of the staff are very nice to work with and they try to answer your questions within a timely manner, or send you to someone who can better help you."
Freshman,4,"Oral Roberts University hosts a variety of different events/activities that embrace international students, and ORU has a range of various activities for students on campus to participate in"
Freshman,4,"It’s a great school! Campus life is fun, students and faculty are encouraging. I have never heard of a music school where everyone encouraged you instead of competed with you, but this school is it."
Sophomore,4,"Oral Roberts University is a place where young adults can come and share their walk with God with other students. While also learning in a Christian based automosphere, ORU is on the best university in the US"
Alum,4,This school has good academics. I studied Biology and the professors made it challenging and helpful. The school could have offered more scholarships and helped more with post graduation  job search.
Freshman,4,"I admire the professors and their intrigue in the field they teach. The dining area could use a touch up, but I still love the place."
Sophomore,4,"Though it is a Christian university, do not let its religious belief deter you. The academics, campus, students, professors, and local area all combine into a great experience and educational opportunity."
Junior,4,the university has taught me how to become a whole person meaning that I'm getting educated for the world out there physically by exercising mentally and spiritual. Additionally it has motivated me to have different worldviews and to go to the uttermost bounds of the earth  to show Jesus to  the ones that haven't experience him yet .
Sophomore,4,"Oral Roberts University has provided a fantastic experience so far. Individually, it is a university well suited to different personalities, cultures and lifestyles, but collectively ORU ensures I grow in spirit (it is a christian college), mind and body. ORU makes college a time of fun. The faculty and staff are readily accessible and the provide a rich learning experience in classes. 

 The many associations and clubs on campus, dorm life, and intra-murals promote unity, community and togetherness with my friends and I, along with the lounges for the commuters.  The campus worship, chapel services and devotions have developed me spiritually and helped my Christianity. Overall, ORU is has been an amazing experience, and it is a highly recommendable place to achieve the next stage in educational aspirations."
Alum,4,"I like the loving community. the pursuit of excellence, not only academically but also physically. The professors are genuinely caring with their students. 
The things that I would like to see change, even though these changes are already in effect. I would like to see more investment towards the betterment of student life.; the upkeep of classrooms and dormrooms."
Junior,4,"I have loved my experience at ORU.  The students and faculty are very welcoming and easy to work with.  I have gained a lot of connections which will help me in my future profession. I have also learned many essential skills in business and personal communication.  Overall, ORU is a great university that I would highly recommend to anyone I meet."
Junior,4,"It is a very safe campus. The classes were enjoyable for the most part, and the people there (including the professors) were very nice."
Junior,4,I love the community and academic environment at ORU. The Whole Person Education theme brought to every aspect of life as a student here has been life changing. The relationships and experiences I have received here will help me to better my future endeavors and reach goals set out before me. I would like to see better campus living in future years. That is the only thing I would change about this school.
Sophomore,4,"Provides an environment that focuses on mind, body, and spirit. Each area is heavily enforced by allowing the use of fitbit to ensure physical readiness, a prayer tower to keep you spiritually alive, and prayer gardens for you to go to for relaxation of the mind. ORU is one of the first major universities that has incorporated Fitbit into a students everyday life and be able to take data from it to see physical fitness. This is just one of the innovations at ORU."
Junior,4,"Oral Roberts University is a unique, culturally diverse place. It's built on the dreams of Oral Roberts, ""Make no little plans."" Though it isn't the biggest campus, the grounds are beautifully kept with plenty of places to relax and walk outside. Each building offers quiet clean places to study. The academics are high standard and I have only encountered two professors I did not approve of during my two years here. There are many opportunities to enjoy sports (soccer, baseball, volleyball, and basketball to name a few), theater and music throughout the year and lots of student events. Living on campus has been a good experience. I have ALWAYS felt safe here at all hours. The only thing I'm not happy with here is the cafeteria food provided by Seduxo. Though there are often healthy options, they are extremely limited. Overall, I have had a wonderful experience at Oral Roberts University."
Freshman,4,"It's a great school, with the best professors you could ever ask for. They all go above and beyond their duties as teachers and I am thankful for them everyday."
Sophomore,4,"ORU has a huge student diversity, accepting of all walks of life.  Professors push students to understand the material, not just memorize it."
Alum,4,"This school was amazing in letting me grow intellectually, physically, and spiritually. The school is based upon having a ""Whole Person Education"" which they achieve successfully. While in attendance at this university I was tested to only make me become the whole person and ready to go out into the world whether it be to further my education at another institution or help the needs in my area of expertise. Oral Roberts University is founded upon the idea that students will go out into the world and have ""no little plans"" for their lives. I believe that no matter who walks on to this campus will have their life changed for the better."
Sophomore,4," Classes are easy and teachers are nice! Of course there are some who aren't, but the nice ones are more prevailing. The only thing is if you transfer in anything be persistent about registrar's and admissions to actually let those credits transfer in. Also be aware that there is class fees they don't tell you about until you are half way in the semester and you can't register for next semester. So basically be prepared for ""adulting"" A LOT right off the bat(I mean its college so you had to know that was coming). Also make sure to get a whole bunch of scholarships so you can not fret about financial stuff and enjoy the college life and things like partyfestival,the random dancing events, and (if you live on campus) the brother-sister wing events(which are totally awesome and a great way to connect and socialize)! Also best meal plan to get is the 10 days a week and $350 sodexo bucks because it literally lasts you a semester and saga(cafeteria) is on and off good with food!"
College Junior,4,Courses are varied and beneficial. Professors are very involved and caring.
College Junior,4,There is almost no campus crime here. It's almost perfect. I don't personally know of any attacks or criminal behavior here.
College Junior,4,I feel like a degree from this school is quite prestigious. I feel privileged just being here.
College Junior,4,It's great living on campus. My dorm is like 10 minutes away from my classes. It can be a bit noisy but that's college life for you.
College Junior,4,I used to be an athlete but I feel challenged to begin a health & fitness regimen again. There is high school spirit and the athletic facilities are quite impressive.
College Junior,4,"The school was founded by Oral Roberts, a great Charismatic Christian leader. O.R.U focuses on developing the whole person and not just part of a person. They succeed by doing this with well balanced programs in academics, health & fitness & spirituality. I greatly appreciate the Spirit Empowered teachings by Dr. Bill Wilson. The Chapel services are also great every week with dynamic Christian speakers."
College Freshman,4,"The employers are pretty good and understanding, so it's great!"
College Freshman,4,"The safety is great, you can walk around campus with no fears!"
College Freshman,4,The athletics I think are pretty good although they don't have football.
College Junior,4,"Housing is a very good option no matter what age.  When you are placed in a dorm, you have social gatherings and study groups to grow with.  I love this a lot about ORU."
College Junior,4,"We have dorms on campus, so there are no sororities or fraternities."
College Sophomore,4,The Sports teams show Team Spirit and Show team work.. Everyone gets along with everyone or atleast thats what they show.
Recent Alumnus,4,Most of the teachers I have dealt with have been very nice and helpful. I have only had a bad experience with a couple of teachers. One thing I really do not like about a large amount of the teachers is that they tend to give a lot of homework. It is almost like they forget we do not only have one or two classes. They have many different classes to choose from each semester. The class sizes I would say are probably normal sized overall.
Recent Alumnus,4,"One thing that ORU has some Juniors and most Seniors do before they graduate is an internship or clinical hours so that the students are prepared with connections and real experience in their intended field of work. I have been amazed with amount of student and alumni that work at ORU and then stay to continue working for ORU. I actually have not worked with the career service yet, so I do not know much about them."
Recent Alumnus,4,I feel safe when I am waking at night on campus. They have a number you can call for the campus police and they come right away. Plus they are driving around all the time.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have not lived on campus yet. The convenience is great, but the cost is not so good. The amenities are pretty good and the social atmosphere is great, but the housing process is not always a great experience."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The teams performance it normally great and the school spirit it really strong. Overall the fan support is great, but it is better for the male sport teams than with the women's sport teams. The teams athletic facilities are great too."
College Sophomore,4,"Living in the dorms provides great housing, as well as a social atmosphere that is fun. It the dorms are very close to all other areas of campus."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletic  involvement, as well as the facilities are top notch and are very well maintained. There are many students on campus, that are involved in varsity sports."
Junior,2,"I attend Oral Roberts University as a transfer, non-traditional student. The atmosphere and the people are very helpful however the communication between professors and students is lacking. As well as attending school I work and have a family and with the current set up with Oral Roberts it makes it very hard for individuals in my situation. The institute is focused on traditional students and does not take in account or accommodate commuter or non-traditional students well."
Sophomore,2,"School is very cliquey! Many students go to high school in Tulsa and then end up here with their friend groups who aren't willing to meet new people or add them to the group. There are lots of fake people here since we are required to sign an honor code. It can be challenging to find genuine people here. The campus is beautiful but there is not much happening. There is ALOT of diversity and international students. Don't come here unless your main goal is to get closer to God, you miss out on the college experience in a lot of ways."
Senior,2,"There are a few areas of study at Oral Roberts University that are excellent programs, including accounting, finance, nursing, and theology.  Most other programs at ORU, however, are very poor.  The ORU culture is also very strict and intolerant.  You must sign an honor code stating that you will be a Christian and follow a strict moral code.  Students have been denied their diplomas because of their beliefs, sexual orientation, etc."
College Junior,2,The school doesn't tell you about the Honor Code you have to sign. This code entitles you to follow rules that they don't tell you about. Not being able to live off campus unless your married or 25 really makes it hard to be social and hangout off campus. Required to attend church twice a week. You get three misses then after that they charge you a fee for missing. Very strict school.
College Sophomore,2,For me it was pretty. I just finished my freshman year and I had two had roommates so I ended moving to a private room.
College Sophomore,2,Sometimes feel like there is not much help available
College Freshman,2,there are no party's here so i cant describe the party scene
College Junior,2,Mostly because it's such a hassle to get approved by the school to live off-campus
College Sophomore,2,"Although we are grateful that we have options and food in our stomachs, they could do better. I've known people (including myself) that have gotten sick off the food in the cafeteria. They should also wash the dishes better."
College Sophomore,2,"Personally, I have only seen one security person in the two years I have been at ORU, and he was in a booth near one of the parking areas. He was not helpful at the time. At night, I have never seen one, execpt maybe in the booth near the Mabee Center, where there are rarely any students or parking. I feel I am on my own when walking around campus after dark. I think there is a false assumption of safety on campus and in buildings."
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid office continued to loose my information over and over again causing my financial aid not to be submitted until 3 months after my mother had submitted the fafsa and any other information. Now I do not have the financial aid I need to pay for school and even though my mom trying to hide the truth from me I know she can not afford to pay for my school.
College Sophomore,2,Was the most painful experience.
College Sophomore,2,"When I walk on to the basketball team I Plan to change the team around. The environment, school spirit, and team energy."
College Freshman,2,We don't have football!! :(
College Junior,2,"Because of curfew and the strict rules against drinking, there is a small amount of people who participate in nightlife, but it is not a big part of this school."
College Junior,2,"I am from Colorado so living in Oklahoma is very different.  The humidity in the early fall in miserable, and the bitterly cold, icy winters are hard, even from an on-campus student.  The only season I enjoyed was the last six weeks or so before the end of the school year when the weather was pleasant and mild.  The rain is normal, but the campus has leaks and flooding everywhere when there is a mild rainstorm.  The ice practically shuts down the campus.  Very little ice melt is put anywhere, and very few walkways are cleared from the ice and snow.  Going to class in the winter is a life or death situation almost everyday!"
College Sophomore,2,very windy.  Very cold. Very hot.
College Sophomore,2,TOO hot in the summer! And there's tornadoes! And it's humid and muggy a lot in the summer too. Winter isn't bad - sometimes there's even snow days!
College Sophomore,2,"So much to say... Towers and Gabby are the nicest, most spacious dorms. Claudius is a great, social dorm for girls. EMR is AWFUL!!! I made a mistake living here this year. It's like living in a musty, nasty locker room with matching meatheads. If you want to live where guys throw eggs and mashed potatoes down your own hall, twerk naked, and throw microwaves out of windows, then live in EMR."
College Freshman,2,"There will always be the exception to the rule; someone will have some type of illegal substance. However, drugs are not popular on campus whatsoever. "
College Sophomore,2,Everything fun is in Oklahoma City.
College Sophomore,2,You need your own car to get around.
College Sophomore,2,They don't have the best of food choices.
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid process for my first year was very smooth. The second year was a challenge to get answers to the questions that I asked. Approaching my third year and I find out two weeks before class is to start that I won't have enough money for tuition and none for books. It would have been most helpful to have known this earlier.
College Junior,2,We are not allowed to live off campus. There are a lot of nice options around campus.
College Junior,2,The food here is ok. The restaurants on campus are better.
College Sophomore,2,"There really isn't a lot of transportation options, but many students have cars and are very willing to get you where you need to go. But I would recomend getting  a car if possible."
College Junior,2,The tickets for parking in lower lot are unreasonable. They need to find a better policy for parking in lower lot as there are usually lots of empty spots. It would be great if there was a 2-hour limit parking ticket or something.
College Freshman,2,It's been very difficult for me. Because people tried to stop me from coming here so I wasn't able to participate in Whole persons. That hurt me a lot especially because I had to take out loans to get here and was told this was the only time that was happening. I wish they had offered more or lowered tuition because right now i don't know if I am coming back or not.
College Freshman,2,One dining hall and 3 restaurants close VERY early!
College Sophomore,2,Most of the boys are afraid to talk to girls here.
College Freshman,2,"The weather is pretty unpredictable, and it can get annoying trying to predict what it is going to be like."
College Freshman,2,"Oral Roberts is a religious university so it is not a topic that is highlt encouraged on campus. The best night things that go on are like swing dancing, movies, and occasionally epic concerts."
College Freshman,2,Plain and Simple – There is not too much to do around campus at night. There is occasional activities organized but otherwise you really need to have a car to get off campus.
College Sophomore,2,On-Campus Living Is Preferred. The only reason people do live off campus is because they are a commuter or married or a graduate.
College Senior,2,"There aren't very many opportunities to go out and party, but I know a few students who make to a couple clubs close to campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Way More Caucasians – Although we have lots of international students, and we have some African Americans, Hispanics, Asians, the majority at ORU is white. Most everyone is Christian, as this is a requirement to go here. A lot of the students here are rich, white kids."
College Freshman,2,Very Limited Housing – I have had a hard time finding housing.  I finally found a room to rent in a young woman's home.  Housing off campus is limited.
College Freshman,2,"Tulsa Closes at 9. Pretty much the only places open after 9 are Taco Bueno, Walmart, and the dollar theater. Tuesdays are 75cents! That's fun...."
College Sophomore,2,"Not So Good! For some reason our cafeteria is called Saga by the students and my friends and I call it ""Nasty Saga."" There is a large amount of mystery meat used and the food is sometimes stale or burnt tasting. There is always cereal as an option, but man cannot live on cereal alone!! Saga is not so good!"
Niche User,1,"The people are really friendly and chapel is great! The dorms are somewhat small but clean. The coffee shops and restaurants on campus are nice. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to finish out my semester because of a misunderstanding with my roommate."
Senior,1,This school is complete trash. Avoid at all costs and don't say I didn't warn you. Here's the main deal: they just want to drain your pockets completely and then come up with reasons why they need more of your money while giving you no value whatsoever.
Freshman,1,"I LURVVV serving the LORD jesus christ here at oral roberts university! Everyone is so Christian and nice (only if you are a white evangelical too though :) !!!!!!!! BUT, the academics are awful. While my professors are nice people, they're sucky teachers and don't help the STDudents out much. And my friends who just graduated can't find any jobs because the school doesn't help them with that (they are in the business and english fields). They told me a degree from here is pretty much worthless, so I'm going to try to transfer out of here. But I will miss the LOVE for OUR LORD AND SAVIOR JEEESUS CHRIST I witness everyday here at ORU!!"

Junior,1,Not a very good experience... safety is low people here are friendly staff not so much. There are some activities hosted by student association and there fun. Not much to do on campus.  Off campus is not very safe.  Sketchy Walmart draws in weird people. Overall not a good school. 1 really big plus is prayer tower and chapel they are really great places to connect with God. Food is okay people complain about it a lot something you get used to on campus. Not everyone is friendly interdenominational so no specific religion.
College Junior,1,there is not a greek life
College Junior,1,"Greek life, and the issues, stress, and division Greek life brings, is a non-issue on this campus because it doesn't exist"
College Freshman,1,We don't have one at this school..
Recent Alumnus,1,Christian school secular parties are not accepted.
College Junior,1,There isn't a party scene on campus at ORU. That isn't what we are here for. Social experience is still very good. The typical ORU student isn't worried about a party scene. I'd say the party scene could be replaced with missions and outreach. We get turnt for that.
College Sophomore,1,There isn't a nightlife at ORU. There is a strict curfew.
College Sophomore,1,No nightlife unless you include hanging with your friends in your room watching netflix. Some people go off campus but because of the strictness it has no nightlife.
College Sophomore,1,"Since students aren't allowed to live off-campus, I can't really say anything about it. However, there is a lot of cheap housing available near ORU, and it's way cheaper than living on campus."
College Freshman,1,You are allowed to commute if you live close by.
College Freshman,1,When it comes to parties and drinking its bad.
Recent Alumnus,1,There are absolutely no scenes of drug use on Oral Roberts University campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Good luck getting to live off campus. The housing department is extremely strict, and most people are required to live off campus. It's not really an option. If, however, you find a way to live off campus, there are great apartments close to the school."
College Freshman,1,We are not allowed to live off campus unless we are either married or living with parents.
College Sophomore,1,You aren't allowed to live on campus unless you are over the age of 25
College Sophomore,1,"Although off campus housing is available in Tulsa, ORU has ridiculous rules about who can live off campus and who can't. I found it very frustrating because even though I had people that offered to let me live with them and it would have saved me lots of money in loans ORU did not give me permission to live off campus."

Senior,5,"From a low-income student: a lot of the resources I was able to take advantage of on this campus don't exist at similar institutions (free textbook library, food pantry, generous emergency fund which helped me out with things ranging from dental surgery to a flight overseas for a family funeral, very affordable housing in town all year, wide-ranging campus employment, programs to compensate you for unpaid internships and even pay for professional interview attire, etc.) For someone with an EFC of 0, this place is definitely worth checking out, but keep in mind that a lot of the student body is monied and there is some inevitable culture clash there. I think it's a less snooty atmosphere than peer institutions, and there's a rich network of first-gen/low-income students and alumni for support. Take advantage of resources like the CRSSJ, the CLS, SHAW, and Academic Advising. Facebook groups are a necessity. Grinnell has its issues, but it did me a lot of good to spend four years there."
Niche User,5,"Grinnell is a truly exceptional and creative college that offers extraordinary teaching and a nurturing academic experience that is carefully and individually tailored to each student's interests and needs. Academics are very, very rigorous. Students need to be dedicated and motivated. I have seen incredible growth in my child in her time at Grinnell --  she has blossomed from a typical adolescent into a very kind, humble, thoughtful, and tolerant adult who is well-informed about a broad variety of issues. This is a wonderful school for bright, motivated kids who want to make a difference in the world."
Alum,5,I think Grinnell College prepared me to be an academic and a critical thinker. I find I am over-prepared in all other graduate programs because of the rigor and expectation of academic performance at Grinnell College.
Freshman,5,"Great so far. Very good institution, even greater academics, amazing faculty too! Mental health resources are lacking, however, I've personally struggled to keep up the academics due to this. Besides that, wonderful open curriculum allows for plenty of exploration unless you are pre med and want to major in the humanities. In that case you will be a bit more restricted but still have enough room to explore some new interests. The town is very wonderful and charming. There is lots of diversity and if you are very liberal and respect others you will love it here. It really is home away from home and the best experience I could ever ask for!"
Freshman,5,"I love this school, this community. Challenging but rewarding in terms of academics. The people you meet will become lifelong friends."
Freshman,5,"I just finished my first semester, and I can confidently say that at Grinnell, the opportunities are endless, and the campus culture is positive and collaborative and justice-oriented. Professors are at the top of their fields, and student dorms/dining is great (Norris needs improvement). There's a very diverse and incredibly talented student population to inspire you and most of the courses are very well-taught."
Alum,5,"Amazing academics, opportunity to pursue undergraduate research, professors who are there to teach. I also appreciated the small class sizes and intimate setting. The campus is beautiful and brings many speakers and events to small-town Iowa."
Alum,5,"I had a great experience at Grinnell. The students are really interesting and curious. The classes are small, and it is easy to get individual attention .from professors. They make themselves very available. The dining hall is really nice too, with many options for healthy food and treats."
Freshman,5,"If you’re looking for somewhere with small class sizes, great academics, and a wide range of activities- but don’t feel like dealing with east coast pretentiousness- this may be your place. A great sense of community. The professors will absolutely kill you, but do it with a smile. Whatever your passions arw- you’ll have the ability to follow them."
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful school. All of the students here are sincere and intelligent people. I'm continuously impressed by my peers everytime I go to class. Everyone is hard-working and curious, and no one would struggle to find a like-minded intellectual here. 

The professors are notable people who are well known within their respective studies, and they genuinely care about your growth and experience at the school. I used to go to a high school where I felt I learned nothing new day after day. Here, I learn both in and outside of the classroom thanks to all the amazing resources Grinnell offers.

Kids who didn't get into Harvard but got into Grinnell are lucky. This is the school that truly will define you and make you into the well-rounded and intelligent person you may wish to be."
Senior,5,"Grinnell College is home to an extremely diverse and welcoming populous. It offers a lot of opportunities to it's students (jobs, sports, majors, etc.) and since it is quite small, it is easy to get to know professors and staff very well."
Freshman,5,Incredible place. Every kind of person you could ever imagine is on campus. No pressure to be anyone but yourself. Truly and exceptional college that everyone should feel honored to attend. From athletics to academics there is something for everyone.
Freshman,5,"Grinnell College is a place that has allowed me to find who I am as a person, while simultaneously bettering myself through both academics and social interactions. The academics are fantastic, with the professors all being extremly helpful, kind, and encouraging during your time with them. I love the personability that comes with smaller classes, and the sense of community that joins Grinnellians together."
Sophomore,5,"Grinnell offers a great breadth of academic courses, thus allowing students to explore different majors that they may be contemplating. The campus is stunningly beautiful. Student life is improved by creating bonds with the advisers, deans, and peers. Interest groups also keep one inspired while attaining academic goals. Lastly, dorm life, in general, is good including gym, laundry facilities, etc."
Freshman,5,Incredible Academics. Every Professor is phenomenal. Whether you pursued sciences or humanities you will have an amazing experience.
Freshman,5,"Grinnell is great! There's a very collaborative attitude among the students. The academics are top quality and there are outstanding resources and opportunities. If you're thinking about Grinnell, visit! People here are kind, helpful, and happy, even with the pressure that comes with challenging academics."
Freshman,5,"I love Grinnell College. It is in a very small town, but there is always a lot going on. Everyone is wonderful and there are so many academic opportunities that I wouldn't get anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"Grinnell has a very diverse student population.  Choosing classes is great because other than the courses needed for my major, I am free to explore any classes I want for my electives.  There are no unnecessary electives needed."
Freshman,5,"I moved to Grinnell from an even more rural place, so the culture of the town here and the amount of things to do was expected for me. People here are very Midwestern. They are friendly and always open to talking to current students. This culture is reflected in that of the college as well. People are always open to hear about what you are taking part in on campus and will come watch and support you when possible. Professors care about you and will also take the time to attend your events or sit down to lunch with you. The campus is beautiful and the college provides access to just about anything you could want from rock climbing to sailing or political activism."
Junior,5,"Grinnell is geographically isolated in a way that isn't for everyone. Located in a small town in central Iowa, it's not a college people tend to go to for it's surroundings. While this isn't great for everyone, this also means that people who go here enroll their first years in spite of where it is, not because of it. They're seeking out the specific social and academic environment that it provides, and aren't coming for the surrounding nightlife, or for a huge football program. It shows the most in classes and in the tightly knit campus community, where I've found that people are engaged and willing to learn with and from others. I would go again in a heartbeat."
Freshman,5,"Amazing student body. Everyone are phenomenal gems of people. Bright/sharp students, progressive, great proffs who are kind and caring and lots of fantastic opportunities if you can find the time to squeeze them in."
Freshman,5,"Overall, Grinnell is an amazing place where you have opportunities available to you that may not be available at larger institutions. Because the school is small, it is easy to get to know professors, and other faculty/staff members within a short period of time. Because of this, it is easy to become involved on campus, either that be through conducting research, or hosting your own radio show."
Senior,5,"Grinnell is an academic rigorous school with a strong sense of diversity and community. Some people find the location to be a negative based on where its located, but I find it to be a positive. We have students coming from all over the country and world, so its definitely a global school, but there is not only a strong community, but students actively choose to be there. They provide many opportunities on and off campus too for students. Provides great financial aid and resources for all students to take advantage of. Many clubs and organizations to join and many concerts, events, performances and speakers to keep you entertained.  "
College Freshman,5,"The small classroom size is such a plus. You're actually able to be noticed by your professor (which can be a good or bad thing depending on who you are). Also because of the small campus, people actually end up learning each other's names and for the most part you know you can always run into a friend or so at some point."
College Sophomore,5,The alumni network wants to help students find internships and careers after college. The network is close-knit and loves helping each other.
College Sophomore,5,The professors really are passionate about their work and incorporate their studies into the lessons. The professors care about individuals and their well-being.
College Sophomore,5,I love Grinnell and my fellow Grinnellians. I cannot wait to return in the fall.
College Sophomore,5,"I have run track and cross country here and it's been awesome, but the facilities are also very open to non-athletes and they are so nice. It's amazing to have such nice facilities at such a small school."
College Sophomore,5,"I have loved my time at Grinnell, it bums me out that I'll be in quite a bit of debt when I graduate, but I believe that it is worth it."
College Freshman,5,"The professors really care about my academics and whenever I'm struggling in a class, my teacher will typically email me and ask to meet with me. They really want me to succeed which is wonderful. I love having a place where people really care about my education."
College Freshman,5,I live in a really great place on campus and I'm glad that I was put there because of the fact that it is sub-free and my room is very spacious. I'm able to easily reach all of my classes within five minutes from my dorm which is very convenient.
College Freshman,5,Courses are demanding but super interesting. The professors are all really knowledgeable in their fields and have great achievements. But they also pay great attention to making the class more engaging by always open to new suggestions and innovation in teaching styles. I especially love the class size since it gives me more opportunity to engage in discussion with both classmates and the professors
College Freshman,5,"I love most things of Grinnell. The student body is welcoming and friendly ( not pretentious at all). I feel very comfortable voicing my thoughts because I know I will be heard and I think this is very important. The faculty and staffs are also super helpful. There seems like there's not a lot of things to do beside fixed and weekly parties and hangout, you can always find a niche and enjoy other types of entertainment as well. I don't think you would feel isolated at all even if you are no involved in the drinking culture. Courses are demanding, and takes up much time. But the materials is very interesting! I enjoy most classes I have had so far."
College Sophomore,5,"The CLS, from the few times that I have been there, has been extremely helpful. With help in polishing a resume or cover letter to finding resources that can put you in touch with alumni in your field, the CLS is great! They are accessible and the closeness of the community, like with the Externship program and alumni events, make me feel a wee bit less stressed about my future."
College Freshman,5,"The alumni network at Grinnell is stunning. Alumni care for current students more than at any other university or college I visited. The CLS (Center for Careers, Life, and Service) is a wonderful resource for making connections with alumni and important organizations for internships and externships. Opportunities are available to all students, and there is no time that is too early to start planning for post grad study or job prospects. The staff are wonderful at answering all questions as well."
College Junior,5,"The student body is very inclusive and open as every event is free and open to everyone on campus. What's great is that the entire student body chooses to be in Grinnell, which is truly what makes our community special. We don't have a Greek system, but we have over 500 events each year, including speakers, parties, performances, and bands, and over 200+ clubs and organizations. You only need one other person who is interested to start your own club or group, if we don't have it and you can get funding from our Student Government Association."
College Sophomore,5,Grinnell has consistently wowwed me with my financial aid package. I've received an awesome education from an institution I wouldn't have been able to afford otherwise with very little accompanying debt.
College Freshman,5,"Every dorm has a different vibe, so if you end up in the right dorm you'll be more than happy. Research before you fill out your housing app so you know where you belong."
College Freshman,5,Great great financial aid opportunities. Grinnell absolutely prioritizes socioeconomic diversity. Grinnell gives merit aid which is also super nice
College Freshman,5,Grinnell profs are great. My classes are engaging and the work load is not too heavy
College Freshman,5,"The professors are very approachable and helpful, and always understanding if you need any accommodations. If you don't think you can finish your work in time, its better to just ask for an extension rather than turning it in late!"
College Sophomore,5,Students are provided with great resources and opportunities on campus. Professors are always there to help and students can go to other members of the Grinnell community for academic guidance.
College Sophomore,5,School is not very strict--self gov.
College Sophomore,5,One of the best schools in the country for providing necessary financial aid.
College Freshman,5,"Everything about our campus life and school policy revolves around Self-Governance. It is the first thing we learn at orientation, and it is truly part of everyday life on campus. If you are acting with respect for yourself and others, you won't encounter problems."
College Freshman,5,"We have very strong academics. Every freshman is paired with their Tutorial professor as an academic adviser, which creates a really strong relationship. There are tons of resources on campus for improving academic achievement, such as the Writing Lab, the Math Lab, the Spanish Lab, Student Tutors, Writing Mentors, and others."
College Freshman,5,"The Drug and Alcohol policy at the College is extremely comprehensive. Like most colleges, drugs and alcohol are present on campus. However, it is something completely up to each individual if they want to take part in them. Most policies on campus can be boiled down to our philosophy of Self-Governance. Basically, if you're not hurting anyone else, you can live your life however you wish. If a student needs medical assistance from drugs or alcohol, neither that student nor any of their peers will get punished. This makes it so that students never hesitate to get the help their friends need."
College Freshman,5,"I'm currently in the Education program with a Major in English. I love both programs. Something unique about studying Education in Iowa is that the Iowa licensure is one of the most prestigious in the country. Therefore, Education students begin with rigorous and engaging coursework from the beginning."
College Freshman,5,"Campus life is great in Grinnell. We are close-knit, but I still feel like I meet new people all the time. We have a lot of All-Campus Events that are a ton of fun and a great way to meet people. We are a very green campus, with a lot of outdoor green space and environmental awareness."
College Freshman,5,"Grinnell is a wonderful place for growing into your own skin. Everybody on campus, be it students, professors, or staff, cares so much about making your experience the best it can be. Grinnell is a cut above the rest."
College Freshman,5,The diversity here is amazing. I am good friends with a lot of people from around the world and from my city. It is really nice to get to know everyone here because I can learn so much about their backgrounds and get a first-rate experience of what their cultures/lives are like.
College Freshman,5,Diversity is something that Grinnell prides its self on.
College Freshman,5,Open curriculum is the best. No required classes so you can take what is required for your major and what ever else you want.
College Freshman,5,"Self-gov basically means students are accountable for their actions and the school feels like it can trust us to act like adults and make informed - if not always perfect or ideal - decisions. It means you, and not anyone else, certainly not the school, is responsible for your actions, and you will either reap the benefits or face the consequences. The school expects not to have to babysit you, and accordingly rules are few and somewhat vague where they exist to allow for interpretation, but they do a good job of educating you on the topics on which most schools spend whole handbooks of rules - alcohol, harassment, drugs, safe sex. With these kinds of topics they are pretty strict, but they aren't seeking out to ruin your party or anything like that."
College Freshman,5,Computer use at Grinnell College is good. There are many computer labs that students can use and unlimited printing that are helpful and setup in almost all buildings.
College Freshman,5,The school does a good job of keeping the students safe and has many opportunities where students who don't feel safe can seek for help and that help is available. 
College Sophomore,5,"Grinnell operates under the self-gov principles which are: responsibility, respect, compromise, accountability, awareness, trust, communication, community and common sense. We are responsible for taking care of our selves and for our actions. The campus security is very friendly and their main goal is to help students not reprimand them. The police only goes into dorms if there is probable cause. In general the college treats us as adults and is centered around promoting good behavior and not punishing people. That is not to say that the law is not enforced in cases where there is a clear and blatant violation observed by the campus security."
College Junior,5,The education you get at Grinnell is without a doubt going to be invaluable and will put you ahead of most of you peers when it comes to competing in the job market.
College Junior,5,"It's very rigorous and you get what you put in. At Grinnell, you can feel and see the drive in students and most people put everything they've got into their academics. But always remember self-care. You'll learn so much at Grinnell but take advantage of all the incredible people surrounding you"
College Senior,5,"This is one of my favorite things about Grinnell, diversity. Through programs such as the posse foundation or targeted advertisement of the college in eastern Europe, I have been able to become friends with people from all over the world. It is needless to say that they are all integrated and accepted by the broader student body. I think the ethnic and racial diversity is perfect and adds a lot to the college's culture. Everybody is accepted in Grinnell for who they are. Their economic background, political beliefs, religion and sexual orientation does not matter in this regard and it makes the college what it is. A place to find out who you really are, while everybody is supporting you!"
Sophomore,4,Grinnell likes to talk a lot of talk but there is a big divide between administration and students which makes it difficult to get your voice heard.
Niche User,4,Online classes have been good but can't compete with the on-campus experience with its discussions and labs.
Alum,4,"If you're ready to put aside four years of your life attending amazing classes, learning from some of the best professors in their fields, and meeting brilliant students from everywhere around the country and world in a god forsaken, cold and depressing small mid-western town, you've come to the right place!"
Junior,4,"Attending Grinnell has given me the chance to meet people that I would never have otherwise had the chance to meet. Overall, I would consider Grinnell to be fairly middle of the road when it comes to many things, but the academics are top-notch (in my opinion), and the campus is fairly diverse in terms of its student body population. There are definitely issues with the college as a whole, such as the college's handling of the student union, but overall I believe Grinnell to be a fantastic college."
Niche User,4,"Well grinnell in a wonderful place to study in, it is so diverse and you never know who you gonna meet next so i love that about grinnell."
Sophomore,4,Grinnell College is a great college! Mostly every teacher and faculty member is looking out for you. I love how important academics is to the college and really tries to make decisions based on student opinions.
Freshman,4,"The social life at Grinnell is great, parties are very calm and controlled, everyone is respectful of each other, and the campus feels safe.  Class sizes are small, and the professors are always ready to work with students.  Very accepting to all and fosters a growing atmosphere."
Junior,4,"The students are bright, curious, and from a variety of different backgrounds, making Grinnell College an engaging place to live and learn. They are committed to social justice and activism, participating in their courses in a creative and intellectual way that very clearly connects their education to their passions and ""real-world"" lives. The faculty dedicate a huge amount of time to ensuring their students are receiving the education they need while still reserving time for their own research and writing. However, the administration needs work on the way it communicates with the student body and implements policies, and the location of the college creates a sort of ""bubble"" that can cause Grinnell to completely absorb the lives of students and faculty."
Senior,4,"I came to Grinnell to be challenged academically, and that's what has happened. Inside and outside the classroom, I'm learning things on a daily basis. Grinnell has made me rethink my values, political opinions, and views of the world, while still staying true to myself.

Socially, I've encountered more diversity in the student body than I ever will.  While students come from all over, identify themselves and love differently than their classmates and neighbors, as a whole, they are the caring and passionate, and work together to address local and worldwide issues.

Coming to Grinnell, I've found myself and my passions in the classes I've taken, the professors from whom I've learned, and the students I've befriended."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of the dormitories do not have air conditioning. Some rooms, such as Clark pit are small."
College Sophomore,4,"It really is a great college. My only complaint is that I was raped and the school did not find the respondent guilty. Because of this, the rating of the school went down as I will have to walk across the graduation stage with my rapist."
College Sophomore,4,Grinnell College is definitely diverse for a private liberal arts school but we still have work to do
College Sophomore,4,"I believe that prospects for graduates are very strong. Everyone at Grinnell, including alumni, wants you to succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel safe on campus, we did have some issues last semester with someone recording people while they were showering and a flasher though."
College Freshman,4,"What makes my school unique is the fact that there is an open curriculum and there is self-gov which everyone follows. You don't have to take any classes that you don't want to and you can start off taking classes that actually interest you. My school is wonderful and if I had to go through the applying process all over again, I would probablly pick Grinnell again."
College Freshman,4,"Crimes are rare, and I feel the school and student staffs as well altogether work hard to make students feel safe and in a way they succeed."
College Freshman,4,"THere are always jobs and internship/externship posted on the web, and events providing chance to network with alumni in various fields."
College Freshman,4,People in my hall although different in cultures and habits but overall we get along well and they are very welcoming
College Freshman,4,We don't have Greek life so I think that's partly why I feel more involved because there are not exclusive cliques or similar groups
College Freshman,4,"Overall I really enjoy going here. It's a little too isolated which makes it hard to find things to do, but the amazing academics make up for it."
College Freshman,4,I like living on campus a lot but I wish things were a little more regulated.
College Freshman,4,"I love the academics and the small classes. It allows students to form quality relationships with their teachers. I've only gone here one semester, and I've already been to one of my professor's houses!"
College Sophomore,4,"Grinnell does a pretty good job of this, mostly due to the students' own concern with the issue. We demand accessible and concerned resources. For this reason, the groups that employ students, such as the Advocates or Peer Support group, are much better than those offered by the school. Recently though the school has started to improve its resources by hiring more counselors and generally trying to make aid easier to find."
College Sophomore,4,"The class size was and has been one of my favorite aspects of the school. It allows you to get closer with the brilliant professors and spend more time with your fellow students. All the classes I have taken so far had a large emphasis on discussion, which is also a must."
College Sophomore,4,"My school has so many opportunities for students to get involved in clubs and student-run groups, and the opportunities remain for research side-by-side with professors. They are very accessible and are always willing to help. Part of this comes from the small student body, but other resources, like the chaplain, study-abroad office, and the Center for Careers, Life, and Service will help any student, at any time, with looking for work or research in their field."
College Freshman,4,"Grinnell is a school that advocates for self-gov. This means that you are responsible for the outcome of your actions, and how that may affect others. Because of this, crime and theft is very low on campus. There have only been a few instances in which this has occurred, and the group of students who stole were quickly apprehended. Campus security is always available, and do their best to personally connect with the students. If it is a party night and you feel unsafe walking around on campus, you can call for a campus security escort at no cost. The campus is focused on safety at all times, and police and upperclassmen student safety workers are always on hand at campus parties and other events to ensure the safety of all students."
College Freshman,4,"The professors really care about their students, and strive to ensure that they are as successful as possible. Especially with first-year students, professors do their best to make sure that they know all about the college, outside community, and academic expectations. The coursework is very difficult. I took IB classes in high school, and my senior year HL classes were on par with the level expected for incoming first-year students. Though the coursework is demanding, the environment is accommodating. For example, many students stay up late into the night to do work, but they do so in groups with trips to the Grille for food and coffee. The professors are willing to discuss any problems you are running into, especially around assignment scheduling. Their focus is on your work quality over quantity, so due dates are often negotiable if you find yourself stuck in a hectic schedule. The work load ebbs and flows, with a few key weeks known as Hell Weeks sprinkled in. While these weeks are challenging for all, the campus hosts events such as 1am pancakes and Puppies and Pancakes for stress relief and study breaks. The classes are very small, with the average being 15 or less students. This makes classes great for discussion. The reading load in many classes is heavy, and the expectation is that you not only read the material, but synthesize and analyze it. This is challenging for many students, but the Reading Lab and Writing Lab are always there for support."
College Freshman,4,"Campus housing creates a long-lasting community built on support. One of the great things about Grinnell is the fact that residence halls include all class levels. On my floor, for example, we have members of all class levels and we are all friends. This creates a mixed campus environment that is inclusive of everyone."
College Freshman,4,"The athletic facility is great for athletes and non-athletes alike. There is no competition between the two groups, and the atmosphere makes everyone feel welcome."
College Freshman,4,"Grinnell is a wonderful place, and the perfect fit"
Recent Alumnus,4,"It was a great experience, but it requires that you are self-motivated. I thought I was at first and it was a hard wake up call. You will be beaten, but you will come out better for it."
College Sophomore,4,"High St is where its at. Off-campus housing options are typically reserved for seniors. This is where the parties are and their is an unspoken understanding that if you live off campus, you should throw at least one party a year."
College Sophomore,4,"Repetitive at times and with limited options. Other than that, people know how to have a good time and after busting their tails at homework all week, almost everyone seems to want to let loose.Most weekends have something going on. Concerts are the best part of Grinnell's nightlife, especially when high street throws a banger afterwards"
College Sophomore,4,"Campus housing is your best option at Grinnell and is also required for at least the first 3 years except in the case of certain circumstances. Floor communities are generally really well cultivated and I've had great friends who've lived next to me. There's always a good mix of class years on the various floors. South Campus is where you'll find more parties and more drug use, North Campus is where athletes and more frat style parties go on, and East Campus is the quietest. I've lived on South all my years at Grinnell and loved it."
College Freshman,4,"The houses are usually cheap. They're popular with upperclassmen. People generally have an easy time getting houses. They're also relatively close to the school, within a mile."
College Freshman,4,"They work hand-in-hand with the students. They allow us to be responsible for ourselves, and ultimately try to foster a safe environment."
College Freshman,4,"Grinnell has an incredibly large endowment, and they provide everyone with at least some financial aid."
College Freshman,4,"Parties occur every weekend. The whole campus is invited too, which is nice and inclusive. It's a nice way to meet new people."
College Freshman,4,"Dorms are close to classes and are quite large compared to other schools. Most dorms are excellent, except one (Norris!!)."
College Freshman,4,"For a small school in the middle of Iowa, the parties are pretty frequent and good. Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday are when there are the most parties, but you can do stuff any time. There's definitely a culture of drinking and of hooking up, but that's common at most schools."
College Freshman,4,Athletes do their thing and non athletes do their thing and the facilities are nice.
College Freshman,4,People who live off campus have cool set ups.
College Freshman,4,"Grinnell really only turns up widespread drinking wise on wednesday, friday and saturday but you can always find someone to smoke or drink with whenever."
College Freshman,4,"The quality of the dorms totally depends on where on campus you live. South campus always smells like cigs and weed. North campus dorms are nice depending on the hall. East campus has the nicest, most modern rooms and is quieter. East also has elevators and air conditioning."
College Freshman,4,Great restaurants in town with good food and great service. Not a ton of options but enought
College Freshman,4,The administration is very relaxed regarding drugs and alcohol
College Freshman,4,There is some conflict between athletes and nonathletes. No one really pays attention to sports
College Junior,4,Financial aid is need-blind and very supportive of students.
College Junior,4,There is a huge divide between athletes and non-athletes on campus.
College Junior,4,The economics major at Grinnell covers the basics. They ensure exposure to critical ideas.
College Junior,4,"Off-campus housing is difficult to maneuver, the school should do more to make this option feasible."
College Freshman,4,"Campus housing is quite good, though a few rooms are too small and few dorms are less nice than others"
College Freshman,4,"Depends on the type of person you are, there are crazy parties and okay parties and sub free parties. You have options"
College Sophomore,4,"Good, cheap food all around. Better and cheaper than college food."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a Division III school, Grinnell has a very inclusive athletic program for anyone wishing to participate, but overall the campus has struggled in the past with a divide between athletes and non-athletes. That stigma has really been improving over the years, but as a result of that past problem, the teams are very tight knit, which I really appreciate. Athletic facilities at Grinnell are amazing, very updated, and nationally recognized, for example, the Indoor track is hosting 2016 Division III nationals, which is usually hosted by larger schools. It would be nicer if the general school population were more into sports and attendance and interest was higher, but friends and professors are very supportive of my athletics, like with any other student and their respective interests."
College Sophomore,4,"The school does a fairly good job providing tech support, especially since there aren't many other options for tech help. The school is equipped with a number of computer labs in each building, but almost all students bring personal computers."
College Sophomore,4,"While it may seem like nightlife revolves solely around partying, there are endless things to do on weekends out in the cornfields. Virtually everyone stays on campus on the weekends, and a typical weekend's offerings will include one or two activities held by Weekend, the really fun sub-free group on campus, a Harris party once every three weeks, a handful of off-campus parties, or simply hanging out with friends in someone's dorm room and watching a movie."
College Sophomore,4,"Food at Grinnell is generally pretty good. Despite there only being one dining hall, they work hard to bring variety to the meals, and you can always find something you want to eat. In addition, having one dining hall really helps campus community, as the Dhall serves as a very central, joining place for Grinnell. There are two or three other on campus options, but i usually stick to the dining hall for meals."
College Sophomore,4,"In general I feel very safe on campus, and the majority of students feel the same way. Students at Grinnell are very trusting of each other, and are not afraid to leave their doors unlocked or walk around alone at night. There have been a few incidents with items being stolen, but like many other aspects of life at Grinnell, students are very bought into Self-governance. The campus does need more blue-light security posts, as even though campus is small, there are only three or four currently around campus in rather obscure locations."
College Sophomore,4,BioChem is a lot of work but Grinnell provides ample support so that anyone can succeed if they apply themselves.
Senior,2,"It has a very cult-y vibe. Isolated location + high average IQ = ideology. Everyone there stopped thinking after they read Das Capital and whatever feminist sect they most naturally gravitated to. Not a lot of thinking goes on here, mostly they just agree with each other."
College Freshman,2,"Quite remote, although the town is quaint and nice"
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't many choices for off campus dining. Students can go to few fast food restaurants and some chain restaurants, however they still feel that there should be better options."
College Sophomore,2,"Shuttles only run around breaks, so you usually have to find a friend to drive you, which is fairly inconvenient. But rarely do you need to go somewhere outside of Grinnell."
College Sophomore,2,It's a quiet town but you won't notice that because you'll be so busy working you'll have no time to adventure out.(depends on major)
College Freshman,2,"If you have need-based financial aid they love to help you, if not you get f***ed over"
College Freshman,2,There is quite the stigma for drug use on campus because it is very visible. There however is no peer pressure to partake. The policy is self government so no one really messes with the people who use drugs.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the available off campus housing is through the college. The prices are pretty decent and they are certainly cheaper than regular room and board. But you have to find at least 2 other people to live with you to make it affordable. These houses are close to the campus so it doesn't take a lot of time to get to campus. Food is also cheap in Grinnell so the cost goes down a lot when living off campus. Finding apartments that are not college owned is tougher because the availability is not great, and their condition is not the best. They are also more far away from the college. Yet, they are the cheapest option."
College Freshman,2,"There are lots of available computers, but they are very slow and the labs are understaffed. Printers are often out of paper and toner, sometimes for days at a time."
College Freshman,2,"No Spirit – The teams are always together, but the games are not that great. The teams lack spirit and the only good team is the basketball team."
College Sophomore,2,"Fun but Limited – There is little to do in the surrounding town, but there are a few nice restaurants and a cinema.  If you attend this school the campus community is all you can depend on."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Great During Winter Time – There are not that many options and it is difficult to get permission to live off campus. The convenience of living off campus is not that great, especially in the winter time. Most students prefer to live on campus because of the proximity to academic buildings and the availability of information on what is happening on campus. Grinnell is generally a very safe area."
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't a lot of options as far as majors go, and although the school flaunts students' ability to create independent majors, these are strongly discouraged and support is minimal."
College Junior,2,Residential Campus – there is no need for a car or even a bike. Classes and dining options are all walking distance
College Junior,2,"Hipster Haven – The greatest conundrum of Grinnell is how much effort students put into being unattractive. Hipsterdom is, unfortunately, pervasive. The students try so hard to be ""alternative"" and artsy, but they end up just smelling funny and looking disheveled. On top of that, so many of the students are so insanely idealistic and sensitive to any hint of un-political-correctness that its difficult to enjoy their company."
College Junior,2,The Weather at Grinnell is very unpredictable. It could snow one day and then be super warm the next with everyone wearing shorts. The wind is especially chilly.
College Junior,2,"The town has a population of 9000--including the college! There are a few bars off campus that students go to, but they are fairly dive-ish. However, with Grinnell's self-governance system it isn't difficult to get alcohol on campus, most of the parties and such occur in the various dorms. The school also sponsors Friday and Saturday parties at concert venues around campus--notably, Harris parties."
Recent Alumnus,2,Grinnell doesn't offer any athletic scholarships. Most people I knew took pride in how bad the football team was.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I mean, it's Iowa. It gets pretty cold and windy in the winters, and there are always a couple big snowstorms that leave huge drifts for a while. I don't mind it that much, but I've always lived in similar climates. People complain about it, but honestly, I think there's so much more to worry about than the weather when you're looking at a college. It is what it is. Spring and fall are beautiful here though."
College Junior,2,"Little Diversity – Mostly middle class white kids, some black kids on scholarships, some internationals.  Everybody is extremely liberal politically, though."
Freshman,1,"If academics is your priority, Grinnell College is the place.

If any other factors of college life come near or on par with the impact you want to make on your academic education, there are a plethora of other options that will make your experience the best it can be.


And if academics are your priority take advantage of Grinnell's research, MAPS.
You have to be comfortable with the rural, Midwest's environment and climate."
Sophomore,1,Best thing is you can drink if you are under-aged but the scene gets old. The administration pretends to listen to the students but they rarely act. If you are lucky and one of the profs like you they will set you up.
Niche User,1,"Grinnell is known for its stellar academics and winning athletics teams, but it is not what it seems. Grinnell will claim that a student is ""Academically Dishonest"" for writing 5 or more similar words to an article online, despite the fact that the words aren't even in the same sentence. It has no problem failing students for doing exactly this, despite the endless research papers each class assigns.I find it very hard to believe that nearly every student I know at Grinnell somehow plagiarizes at least once a semester.  I would highly recommend that you DO NOT go to Grinnell, as many of my friends have been failed from a class and even expelled because of their 'dishonest' writing. I am tempted to take this claim to court. DO NOT consider Grinnell as a college you are interested in, unless you want to get kicked out for having the same opinion as someone online."
College Sophomore,1,Alcohol is a huge problem here.  There are hospitalizations every year.  I believe it is a result of the stressful workload and  lack of healthy social events.  People work really hard during the week and only get Saturday night off so people let loose.
College Sophomore,1,It's cold from October/November to late April.  Winter is cold and dark :(
College Sophomore,1,Off Campus dining is good if you're from small town Iowa and have no other options but if you're from anywhere else (any real college campus) you would expect some more diversity.  All ethnic foods here are awful.
College Freshman,1,"There are very few restaurants around. The college even lists the grocery stores as ""restaurants"" on their handouts!"
College Junior,1,There are no frats. Students create fun wherever they are.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Definitely There – Man, Grinnellians love their illicit substances. Pretty much every party will have alcohol available, and it's not uncommon to see people carrying around huge handles of Jack on a Saturday night. Sometimes the loggia will be littered with beer cans and cigarete butts At least occasional weed smoking is pretty expected of you if you're on South campus, less so for the other campuses.  In my experience, some hard drugs are pretty available and semi-openly discussed, but you sort of have to know people. People aren't just snorting coke off of toilet seats. If you're uncomfortable around substance use, there are definitely options for you. Sub-free is pretty established here, and East campus is generally pretty tame whether you're in sub-free housing or not. But if you want to party every night of the week, it's not hard to find people like you."
College Junior,1,"Grinnell is about 2/3 middle class kids from extremely liberal backgrounds.  There is virtually no diversity of opinion on campus, and criticism of politically correct views is not tolerated.   The remaining 1/3 are split between internationals and minority students, some who integrate and others who form tight cliques."
College Junior,1,"Can't Get Away – Nearly impossible to get away, even for break. The college runs 1 or 2 shuttles per day to DSM, none to CID. Flying anywhere will cost close to $400 round trip. One Greyhound line runs through town with infrequent and slow service.  No train available."
College Junior,1,"Tiny Town – Tiny town, but most of what you need.  Transportation anywhere else is almost non-existent.  Shuttle once or twice a day to DSM for break.  Hard and expensive to get home."
College Freshman,1,Not Much – There is very little parking at Grinnell because most students live on campus. Parking permits are ridiculously expensive. There is usually visitors parking by the athletic building and library. Other wise there are no good parking places. If you are really lucky you can get a streetside spot.
College Freshman,1,Amount of School Work – There is an ungodly amount of school work each night and even over spring break! It's really tough but what sets Grinnell apart is that most students are ok with all the work and do most of it.

Freshman,5,"Beautiful school and really caring professors. Food could be much better, but they certainly try to keep it interesting."
Graduate Student,5,Chatham University is an awesome institution with a strong student centered focus in a rigorous yet supportive learning environment. faculty are engaged and motivated to inspire students to develop professionally. There is much emphasis on professional writing and meeting national standards within their respective programs.
Graduate Student,5,An excellent asynchronous learning environment in where students develop great scholarship as evidence of their  student centered curriculum. the asynchronous learning platform is supported by faculty student engagement for scholarly development intellectually.
Freshman,5,"Chatham University treats all students equally and with dignity, and helps each student to grow into who they want to be. The campus is beautiful, and the dorms are housed in old mansion with alot of character and warmth. The faculty and staff help to grow relationships with their students and are always on hand to help."
Niche User,5,I absolutely loved Chatham University when I toured the campus. From its beautiful and unique architecture to it's centralized location it had everything I could ever needed.
Sophomore,5,"I transfer to Chatham University this spring semester. So far, the faculty are very friendly and helpful in a way that i really need help. I start class for a week now and the professors really take an effort of helping me."
Freshman,5,I would like to see more diversity in the chatham community I love being at chatham its quite its refreshening. chatham I think could use more activities to do or more engaged activities with everyone not just select few
Niche User,5,"I am planning on applying to Chatham University, but before doing so, I've decided to go on a campus tour. I was pretty nervous when I first got there, but I felt all that uneasiness disappear once I saw the property. The vibe given off was warm as most of the property was filled with plants, trees, and grass as it was located in a place away from any loud noises one would normally hear in the city.  There was also dorms dedicated for female or males or were co-ed, which I really appreciated it. The only thing that really bothered me was the fact there was no air conditioning, but it isn't really a huge issue since most students wouldn't be present during the summertime. It's also understandable considering the dorms aren't brand new, but either way. I highly recommend the campus for anyone who are more of an outdoorsy person and prefers to go to a small college/university."
Junior,5,"As a non-traditional undergraduate student, I chose Chatham for its small-community feel and more intimate class sizes. I feel a strong connection to my classmates and my professors as I continue my journey to a BS in Human Biology."
Junior,5,Chatham University has a welcoming and sustainable atmosphere. The class sizes are smaller and the professors truly take their time to invest in your learning journey at the school.
Senior,5,"Chatham is a beautiful campus open to everyone with the most caring and friendly staff. I am from Wexford, Pa originally which is about 30 minutes north of the university. I am a transfer student studying Psychology and playing hockey there too. Everyone truly cares about your future and gives you the tools to succeed as a student and as an adult. I am so grateful that I transferred to Chatham and I hope I can continue there during grad school as well."
Sophomore,5,"The best college decision I have ever made. I absolutely love this school! Chatham University offers so many opportunities that other schools lack consistently. They offer things like awareness months and activities for all types of ethnicities and races, to educate and teach students and faculty about other cultures. There is an outpour of support and respect that you can not find at any other college. Chatham is unique in the experience that it will offer both its students and faculty. I highly recommend this school to anyone on the college search."
Sophomore,5,"Chatham is a beautiful campus tucked away from the craziness of a city, but just close enough to still have the city life. Would love to see more students come to chatham. Dorms are beautiful old mansions. University run apartments are great too. Would like to see academics expand more as more students come to the university, and the social scene could be better too, but there is still tons to do. Athletics are growing so I can not wait to see what will come in the future."
Niche User,5,"I am very excited to attend Chatham University. Every time I have been to the campus, it has made me more sure of my commitment to this college. I have attended three visit days and one interview day. I love the community, the architecture, the nature, and the location. I am happy with my admissions counselor; she is both helpful and friendly. Each time that I have visited, faculty members take the time to have a one-on-one conversation with you. 
I look forward to moving in and studying here."
Freshman,5,"As an incoming  future cougar of Chatham I can’t tell you how impressed I am with the level of education and attention to students this university gives. 

  The campus is beautiful and each professor knows who you are and truly cares about the successes you can have being a student here at Chatham."
Niche User,5,"I like Chatham University because the class sizes are smaller, it is close to a big city, and it has a wonderful sustainability major."
Niche User,5,I loved the atmosphere. I felt like it was a very nice community and I feel like I can easily make friends there.
Sophomore,5,"All in all, I feel Chatham has been a wonderful school. Attending a program that is so small has been a great experience. It provides easy one-on-one time with my professors, rather than having a lecture with 100+ students, where I hardly ever actually speak to the professor. Not only does the school provide wonderful educational opportunities, but even the events are wonderful. The amount of speakers that come to the campus to inform us of gender roles, women's leadership in society, the important notes on why it's important to be politically involved, and so much more has been great. I am being educated in so many ways more than just my degree."
Niche User,5,I love this college when I first stepped on the campus I felt a home feel I really like it and couldn't ask for a better place to want to start college
Graduate Student,5,"I am currently enrolled in the Doctor of Nursing Practice program, which is an online program, and am thoroughly enjoying my education.  Although it is very involved the outcomes are very rewarding and the instructors are caring, compassionate, and very knowledgeable."
Sophomore,5,My first year spent on campus was fantastic. All the professors are wonderful and the rest of the staff is too. Chatham has a beautiful campus within Pittsburgh.
Freshman,5,"Chatham University has various things to offer. The campus I very close to the downtown Pittsburgh area, where you have the opportunity to explore the city and meet new people. The school itself has amazing teachers where their main focus is to know you on a personal level. This helps with finding internships or jobs, even networking events. As for the students, they are provided with many clubs and activities on campus to distract themselves from homework, and take a break."
Niche User,5,This is University is the hidden gem in Pittsburgh. With they going Co-ed recently has brought move people to them. The staff and everyone that works there are a delight. The academics are amazing.
Senior,5,"I love the biology curriculum-- I like being able to focus on human biology for the entirety of my undergrad career. The small class sizes allow students to get to know the professors, and that has been extremely beneficial. I also like that students are required to complete an internship. That takes the guess work out of the grad school/job search."
Niche User,5,"Chatham has a very beautiful campus, as well as a great student body. I was there over a weekend, but the people that were there seemed very kind and welcoming. I overall enjoyed the vibe that the campus gave off and the view of Pittsburgh from some of the buildings. I think the best part of the campus is the architecture, but then again I am trying to major in interior architecture, so I focus on that kind of thing. I really enjoyed the campus and I recommend those who are planning on going there to view the campus."
Freshman,5,Chatham university is a very welcoming school in a great location. Teachers who care and give you your full attention.
Alum,5,"I loved my college.  The study abroad programs, business classes, and facilities were amazing.  I just wish Chatham had more connections with companies for students after college."
Freshman,5,"Chatham is such a lovely school. I like that it has its own secluded and save campus, while also being so close to the city of Pittsburgh because you get the best of both worlds."
Sophomore,5,Chatham University is a beautiful school all around. The professors are wonderful and the academics is also pretty good. Going to school here is enjoyable.
Graduate Student,5,"My experience at Chatham University has been extremely positive. I'm in the midst of a master's program for counseling psychology. The classes I've taken and the professors I've had have been challenging, helpful, and insightful. The campus is beautiful and the student body is very active. I have a bit of a limited scope of the college as a whole because I live off campus, but I would recommend Chatham to anyone who wants a challenging, social-justice oriented enducation."
Freshman,5,"Positive liberal arts education that specifically focus' on women's advancement. It is now co-ed and the staff is struggling to maintain many of these principles while also acknowledging things like sexual assault and alcohol abuse. Everyone complains about the party scene, but we are 0.1 miles away from a party school, so you never have to worry about being caught drinking at Chatham. In the end, it's a great small liberal arts school where staff and students care about each other, and it is finally getting the recognition it deserves. "
College Freshman,5,Sexual assault information is being enforced upon entry to the school!
College Freshman,5,I've really enjoyed Chatham and know that I am getting a wonderful education here.
College Sophomore,5,"Large gym with weight room, pool, track, and field."
College Sophomore,5,I felt very welcomed from both students and faculty
College Sophomore,5,I have not heard of any crimes taking place on campus but if any issues did arise then I am quite confident that our campus police would take care of them immediately.
College Sophomore,5,"As a dual sport athlete, athletics were a huge part of my first year experience and they definitely helped me succeed throughout the year. The coaches truly care about their players and try to give them everything they need to succeed in their sport(s). Additionally, all of the athletes help and support each other on and off the playing fields."
College Junior,5,Alcohol was not prohibited on campus. In fact beer and wine was sold in cafe rachel (with a strict ID policy). I think the administration has a healthy attitude towards alcohol. Some students smoked weed but I never saw it on campus. Sometimes you smell it in the dorms and occasionally there would be a drug bust but it was unusual (depending on who you lived near but you'll see that at many colleges).
College Senior,5,It has a home feeling away from home.
College Sophomore,5,I love the one-of-kind atmosphere and the campus is breathtaking. I am truly a person and not a number. My professors and staff are exceptional and our academics are very strong.
College Senior,5,"Pittsburgh is magnificent! It's my hometown, but I'm still discovering new things about it every day. Pittsburgh has all of the opportunities and amenities of a major city: access to Fortune 500 companies, professional sports teams and a thriving Cultural District. At the same time, it has the feel of a small town: kind, comfortable and big on character."
College Senior,5,"A primary reason I chose the Arts Management program at Chatham was its flexibility. I got a well-rounded business education supplemented by seven electives in my arts area of concentration. In a 5-year program, students also have the option to earn a Master of Arts Management from CMU's Heinz College. Even if you decide not to pursue graduate study as an undergrad, there are plenty of options to customize your education to fit your post-college plans."
College Senior,5,"The students I've encountered at Chatham are stunningly supportive and endlessly kind. There is no sense of competition here. Everyone genuinely wants to see their classmates succeed, and they are always willing to help one another. The faculty and staff are just as generous with their time, investing in students and ensuring that everyone has the opportunities they need to flourish. The academics are strong and the campus is beautiful, but what really makes Chatham extraordinary is the sense of family."
College Senior,5,"Between Shadyside, Squirrel Hill and Oakland, there are an amazing number of restaurants to choose from within walking/shuttle distance. Pittsburgh is packed with eateries serving up cuisine from all over the world, and plenty offer cost-effective options for college students."
College Senior,5,"I lived in the Chatham Apartments for a time. As a first apartment, it was perfect: two bedrooms (one single, one double), a kitchen, a private bathroom and a common space (with seating and a dining room set). Our apartment faced Fifth Avenue, so we had a giant window overlooking the street. For me, it was an excellent experience allowing for community living without sacrificing privacy."
College Freshman,5,Being a short bus ride to Pitt and a short walk to Walnut street or Forbes Avenue there are tons of options for off campus dining.
College Freshman,5,"Chatham gave me a great scholarship, it was so much that I could not pass it by."
College Freshman,5,"The campus is isolated from the busy-ness of the city, but as soon as you step off campus you're close to Pitt and downtown, and there's plenty to do. You can have the isolated atmosphere with the convenience of stuff to do in the city."
College Freshman,5,Internships are required and they help you find them
College Freshman,5,The athletic center is brand new
College Junior,5,"Great city, great school, great people, great atmosphere"
College Junior,5,Forbes ave is not far away and it has tons of places to eat
College Junior,5,I love my major and the opportunities at this school
College Junior,5,"Everyone is very friendly, understanding, and helpful"
College Junior,5,The chief of police is so sweet and the department as a whole is very helpful
College Junior,5,Everyone is very friendly and helpful. The campus is beautiful
College Junior,5,"Nice, affordable, clean, close to classes, overall awesome"
College Senior,5,"For the money, it is a great experience. The more classes you get out of the way, the more affordable it will be."
College Senior,5,The atmosphere is very friendly and we try to make things accessible
College Senior,5,"I used financial aid, and the school is extremely helpful. I had the best experience with tuition experience at Chatham."
Junior,4,"Academically, this school is great. Living on campus is overpriced for the outcome. Food is not up to par either."
Niche User,4,"The campus is absolutely beautiful, and it's only a few minutes from downtown Pittsburgh. The school offers a wide variety of majors and programs, and takes takes pride in its sustainability and eco-friendly campus and cafeteria. The lacrosse team specifically, with whom I have played with at prospect clinics, are incredibly welcoming and pleasant to be around, and I look forward to applying their as a senior."
Sophomore,4,Chatham is great when it comes to being close to the city but also secluded from the busy part of Pittsburgh. It's just a quick bus ride down to the city in order to see everything that Pittsburgh has in store but once you're on campus you can't see or hear anything. It's a quiet campus that also has a lot of stuff going on. A great campus to have a little bit of everything.
Junior,4,"The best thing about Chatham University is that the teachers actually care about you and you get to know them on a personal level. They take an interest in your success and want to see you succeed, both in the classroom and outside of it. They are very helpful when it comes to athletics too, they are willing to work with you to find a solution when a conflict arises. It is not only athletics that they are helpful with, they have a big understanding when it comes to family to. As long as you talk to the teachers about what is going on, they are usually willing to help. One thing that is less great about Chatham is some their food services, usually in the dining hall they do not have the best or freshest option when it comes to food. It is usually the same thing over and over again with the rare occasion of some great food."
Freshman,4,"I love my professors. They are always available and willing to help you. My complaints are towards the variety and quality of food available. The janitorial staff are hardworking and make living efficient. I would prefer more activities correlating with volunteer work because it is minimal on campus. Overall, it’s a nice campus though."
Sophomore,4,"I love Chatham’s campus and small community. Although, the dorm life is occasionally sub-par and the food isn’t too great."
Sophomore,4,Chatham University has allowed me to get the small school learning enviroment and class sizes while being in the middle of the hustle and bustle of the big city of Pittsburgh. It also is extremely resourceful and uses the other universities around it to help students have the best possible college expirence possible.
Sophomore,4,Chatham has good daily life activities and wonderful proffesors and the overall staff. I especially like their no drug/smoking policy. The dorms and classes are good and Chatham is located in a very convenient area.
Alum,4,"I attended Chatham as an adult continuing ed student. The classes are rigorous and the professors invested in the students success. The campus is a beautiful, peaceful, secluded section of a vibrant city. For those who crave the occasional night-life, your student ID will get you a bus ride to downtown Pittsburgh or Oakland (where Pitt and CMU, and several other student bodies make up most of the population). 
The food is delicious, with vegan, vegetarian, international cuisine, and farm to table products of the Eden Hall campus and other local farmers. 
You can also get a delicious burger and fries, if you are determined to eat junkfood.
There were opportunities for international travel, networking, career councilling, tutoring, work study, internships with leading companies, and fun field trips."
Freshman,4,"I am an incoming freshman at the school, and my experience so far there has been excellent! The campus is beautiful and woodsy yet is situated in the heart of Pittsburgh, so it makes it very easily to find good jobs and internships for whatever major you choose! Some of the staff is very helpful, especially with all my credits coming in. Go Cougars!"
Freshman,4,At Chatham you have the chance to get to know your professors because of the small class sizes. Your professors you your name and know who you are and are willing to help you.
Sophomore,4,"Some quick notes:
-Diversity is a priority to the faculty and most students. Mostly WASPs, but diversity is growing.
-Growing male athletics. Not super competitive, and most sports are welcoming to walk-ons.
-Dorms are better (IMO) in comparison to bigger schools (Pitt). Many rooms located in cool old mansions. Others more modern, including the apartments.
-Professors are helpful. One-on-one meetings are common. Each professor I've had has been understanding and accommodating.
-Safety is great. Police are there if needed, not overbearing. Many have a good relationship w/ them, as they are pretty cool people.
-Small, pretty campus. Students love sitting in the grass on nice days.
-Huge parties are nonexistent. Smaller, discreet parties are common and most students are chill.
-Activities are average. You have to jump in on your own terms. Pittsburgh is an amazing city with lots to do.
-Least favorite thing is the food. Students order often."
Junior,4,My experience so far at Chatham University has been alright. I have loved most of my professors with the exception of a few. I would like to see some improvements made on the housing arrangements.
Niche User,4,"I greatly enjoyed the amount of green space around Chatham's campus. It is located in a quiet part of Pittsburgh, but this has great access to public transportation and entertainment. Their programs in teaching, social work, and sustainability are widely recognized for their excellence. I would recommend this school to anyone interested in studying these programs."
Alum,4,"The structure of the academics and diversity was very good, but continued help from career development department is lacking. "
Sophomore,4,"This is a good school. Class size is ideal. If you get to know the staff, they're more than willing to work with you"
College Senior,4,I really enjoy my experience at Chatham. The whole environment is a friendly one where you feel at home. The professors really care about the students' education and don't try to put up unneeded obstacles to overcome. I feel like I'm really getting an education that will prepare me for my field.
College Freshman,4,Don't know much about them.
College Senior,4,I enjoy the program I'm in
College Senior,4,The campus is very safe and constantly patrolled by campus police.
College Senior,4,Employers are often recruiting on campus
College Senior,4,"I am a graduate student who lives off campus. However, the dorms extremely safe are located throughout a beautiful neighborhood that is full of intricate estates."
College Sophomore,4,It's great but not living on campus. Can't afford a dorm
College Sophomore,4,It has everything I'd need
College Sophomore,4,"During my first year at Chatham, I had a very good experience. The athletics are top-notch, the students are kind and caring, and the majority of the professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. I love how the Chatham community tries its best to make each and every student feel inclusive and accepted. I think that this is very important for all young adults and it will allow them to enjoy their college experience more."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Chatham is a great college and the professors and staff are personable. The campus is beautiful and rich in history, but the culture is changing to be more diverse."
College Junior,4,There is a good bar scene.
College Junior,4,"A women's college is a very safe place! Many students came to the school for this very reason. I always felt safe on campus, even walking across campus at night. However, there is no more women's college. I haven't experienced the new coed environment. I imagine it hasn't made a huge difference yet but if you give it a few years and I'm sure it will catch up with the rest of the country in terms of lack of safety (please excuse my pessimism)."
College Junior,4,I loved my professors but I wished that Chatham had more options for majors. I ended up transferring to a larger school to accommodate this.
College Sophomore,4,"Campus is very safe, but I doubt think they would be prepared if anything serious happened"
College Sophomore,4,"Professors have a large interests in the subjects that teach, this is obvious"
College Sophomore,4,The apartments are a great option
College Senior,4,I feel welcomed and wanted here.
College Senior,4,Very high expectations from Chatham Students. Quality Education is provided here.
College Senior,4,We all at the campus get involved.
College Sophomore,4,"Our alumni network is smaller, but we have excellent internship placements and a ton of networking in both Pittsburgh and other major cities."
College Sophomore,4,"I've loved having small classes where professors know not only you're name but also what you're involved with and your career goals. Scheduling higher level classes can be difficult, but thankfully we can cross register at most of the other universities here in Pittsburgh."
College Junior,4,Every issue I have ever encounter at Chatham University have been handled in a professional and timely matter. The professors have always made time available if any tutoring was needed and always responded to emails or voice mails in a very efficient manner. The university is very student friendly and have numerous opportunities for students to become involved with this school.
College Freshman,4,"Chatham's campus is literally so safe. I can walk from the gym at 10 pm and feel 100% safe. I have never felt unsafe on campus. However, if you venture onto fifth avenue and go to Oakland. That is another story. Regardless, Chatham has an extremely safe campus. Literally nobody ever has to call the police."
College Freshman,4,"The general education classes are stupid. However, all professors genuinely want each and every student to be successful in their life/classes. The courses are interesting for the most part, and include a lot of discussion."
College Freshman,4,"I personally love my room. I have the biggest room in Fickes. It is very spacious. Fickes, Rea, and Laughlin are the biggest residence halls on campus. However, they are the farthest from where almost all of the classes are. Woodland rooms tend to be much smaller than the other residence halls, howeverWoodland is the most central residence hall and it is very easy to get to many places on campus!"
College Senior,4,The campus in general is pretty safe. Campus safety is rarely used when it comes to crime and security.
College Senior,4,I have lived in two dorms: Chatham Apartments and Fickes. Fiches felt just like home and it was very clean. Facilities came to clean the bathroom every morning so I made sure I was the first one to shower in the morning and use the bathrooms. The single and quad I had were spacious and comfortable. CA are nice too. Theres tons of room and with the right decorations you can make it feel like home.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of nice people who wants to keep everyone safe.
College Freshman,4,Every professor wants their students to succeed.
College Freshman,4,I like the fact that students are trying to adjust to the changing of the school's history and traditions.
College Sophomore,4,"From living in gorgeous historic mansions (I've got a walk-in closet with a window, separate from my roommate's walk-in), to having classes with only 15 other students (hello discussion and dialogue) and having a killer advisor (who answers every email, hooks me up with scholarships and internships, and always has time for me) I'm pretty damn happy with my school. If only Anderson Dining hall could get it together, then I would feel justified in giving it a 5 star review. If you're looking for solid academics, a close-knit community, and a gorgeous campus, Chatham is for you. If you want wild parties and large classes, try Pitt-- you won't find those here."
College Sophomore,4,What's made my graduate school experience at Chatham University great so far has been the overall helpful and invested nature of my program's faculty. Each of my professors has been extremely helpful in giving me general advice and making me feel supported as I move through the program.
College Sophomore,4,"Good location, easy access for professionals in Pittsburgh, PA"
College Junior,4,Small class sizes and many courses are discussion based. Very liberal beliefs of most at the school enable good classroom discussion with no judgement or loss of respect for anyone if beliefs differ.
College Junior,4,"Gorgeous campus and friendly students, faculty, and staff."
College Freshman,4,I have personally not lived off campus but I hear that it is a great option and most seniors get off campus apartments.
College Freshman,4,Our campus is fairly laid back compared to most campuses. They like to let us do our own thing and make our own choices. Though they do not tolerate drug use at all.
College Freshman,4,It is bad that there is only one dinning option on campus but they are soon bringing more. There are many options to choose from and its all you can eat. I also love that I can spend my unused meals to buy snacks and drinks.
College Freshman,4,The housing on my campus is mansions that have been restored and turned into dorm buildings. Every room is unique!
College Freshman,4,"The housing consists of converted mansions, so it's different than any other school"
College Freshman,4,Right now we only have girls but next year we are going co-ed.
College Freshman,4,"It's hard to get used to a new art department after high school, and there are a couple of art instructors that I'm not a fan of, but the facilities are great and the classes are great."
College Freshman,4,"While the campus is strict, they understand you are adults."
College Junior,4,"Some of the places can be expensive, but if you don't mind the commute find a place a little further away for cheaper"
Freshman,2,"Was very hard to go from engaging classes to watching a whiteboard for two hours. The professors tried,  but I believe the school could have given them more time, or allowed us to cancel finals to help some students with stress."
College Junior,2,"I don't see many graduates I know from Chatham using their degrees yet. If you get good grades you can go to grad school but if you don't plan to apply to grad school, be very selective about your major so that you come out with job options. Do your research and select your program carefully at whichever school you go to. Your major matters more than the school you go to."
College Freshman,2,There are not that many jobs there and the hours are not good.
College Freshman,2,For how expensive the food is I would hope it would be better.  The food depending on what it is can be either super tasty or not at all... It just depends on the day and what they are serving.
College Junior,2,Most of the time there is only pregaming parties at Chatham before everyone goes out. There are lots of bookworms and shut ins so it's fairly quiet when everyone goes home for the weekend.
College Junior,2,"Not much around campus that isn't expensive. Closest available affordable apartments are in Bloomfield, so it sucks if you don't have a vehicle because the 64 bus is only every hour."
College Junior,2,"As a single-sex university, there are no men."
College Freshman,2,The surrounding area is so expensive that it is not worth living off-campus.
College Freshman,2,This year has been particularly bad with the weather.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Worst possible campus housing ever.  Buildings were falling apart, leaked, balconies on buildings were physically separating from buildings.  Roof had green vegetation growing on it, as it was so old it needed to be replaced, and leaked."
College Senior,2,"Chatham University is located on top of a hill. This means that your only access to the campus is along a relatively steep hill, or steep, winding, and occasionally crumbling stairways. All of the sidewalks are unreasonably narrow and often end abruptly. This is easy enough to navigate in the summer and spring months if you are fortunate enough to not be in a wheelchair. When wet weather, snow, and ice begin to set in, it can be a bit exhausting or dangerous. My suggestion is to invest in a good pair of hiking boots and watch your step!"
College Freshman,2,"Parking is awful if you dont arrive early, the lot is small, there is not enough room, the only way to reach the lot is down a bad brick road. The cost is $280 a year for a parking permit, which is insane because there is no need for it to be so high."
College Freshman,2,The Admissions tend to serve students who are a majority and not a minority. They are really communicating with the minorities who are having rough times adjusting.
College Junior,2,"so far, really happy with the courses in my graduate program.  but i wish they placed you in your practicum experience. a lot of extra work that i think should be on the school, not the student"
College Freshman,2,You really have to go off campus if you want to go to any parties. Chatham does their best to provide fun activities on most weekends though.
College Freshman,2,"Chatham does offer some scholarships but it does not offer enough scholarships. Also, sometimes the scholarship application deadlines aren't made clear. Some scholarships are only offerred to incoming freshmen/first years. Chatham needs to allow for more opportunities to apply to different scholarships each year rather than just the first time you enroll as a freshman  to  the college."
College Sophomore,2,Catering Too Much to Vegans – The quality of the food is average.  They focus too much on giving vegas and vegetarians many options. There is only ever one or two choices and the salad bar.
College Sophomore,2,Parking on campus is prohibited unless you obtain a parking permit for a payment of a few hundred dollars per semester. Recently students living on campus were given parking permits also which made it very difficult for commuters to obtain parking spaces. Chatham would be much more efficient in their parking systems if there were additional lots added for commuter students.
College Senior,2,"If you're visiting the campus, good luck finding a parking spot. Though parking places are extremely convenient in location, the price is awful! minimum of $200/semester when it only costs $20/year to get an off campus parking permit (or nothing at all depending on the neighborhood!). Most commuters take advantage of the 2 hour maximum placed on visitor spots and use those instead, causing lots of issues for visitors attempting to park on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Our teams don't win often, so the fans in the stands are often friends or family members of the teams. It's hard to rally around the teams since they don't win."
College Sophomore,2,"The facilities are nice, but we lack a track team, which is the sport i'd like to participate in.  I've never gone to a Chatham sports event and the games are not advertised.  I don't think a lot of people go to the games unless they have friends on the team."
College Junior,2,"I have a few problems with Chatham, but these are hight on the list; they randomly seem to cut entire programs such as the entire upper language program and the theater department, then they go on to doing things like slighting entire departments of students by enforcing asinine rules such as the new paper cut. Chatham has an extremely short add/drop deadline, if you have to decide in the first week you will not actually know what the class is like, and then you tend to have more dropouts/with-drawls then you would with a NORMAL add/drop deadline. Finally I find their distance from the students' issues heavy handed and far from endearing.  

NOW this is not to say that I do not enjoy my school. I find it very refreshing to find people of like interests, students and teachers alike. I find the classes are very good, especially when we have a nice and small class; you can really make sure that everyone is following along and clear on the subject matter. We have some really great resources at our fingertips, including our wonderful library, our own theater, a wonderful science department, a friendly and in-tune campus police force, an eclectic collection of clubs and an interesting (for lack of a better word) student body."
College Sophomore,2,Chatham is more focused on building up student enrollment rather than making sure current students are happy. The administration is very good at marketing but unfortunately does not keep their side of the bargain.
College Freshman,2,"Not as Good as It Could Be – Chatham does not have doctors on campus, only nurses. If a student has a serious health issue she needs to be transported to urgent care or the emergency room. This is the first year Chatham has not had doctors on campus because students did not think the doctors were available very often on campus (which isn't true, the doctors were available on an appointment basis, but the uneducated girls here thought that a doctor should be available whenever they want it. I have seen girls go to the emergency room with a minor stomachache). Now Chatham does not have healthcare on campus aside from nurses, thanks to the girls who must have really good insurance to be wasting an emergency room visit on a minor stomachache.

Chatham is a very safe campus, except for when the girls who love to attend Frat parties at Pitt and CMU decide to bring men they just met into their dorms and wonder why they get attacked. The girls on campus need to be taught more about personal safety. The police cannot help you if you are the ones bringing the strange men into your dorm!"
College Senior,2,"Gen Ed – Although they are changing our general education requirements as of this year I wish it would've happened earlier or at least gradually, if at all possible. I feel like I missed out on a lot because administration was slow acting on this."
College Sophomore,2,Not Yet – I haven't really experienced anything to specific about my major yet.
College Senior,2,"The School Is Great at Marketing but Not at Holding up Their End of the Bargain – The academics are excellent.The teachers are some of the most experienced and educated. Work load from classes can be overwhelming. They often cancel classes due to lack of students. The housing is poor compared to the schools in the area. Campus is much safer than area schools. The food is lacking; undercooked, no meat, and too experimental. It is my belief that the school takes your money but does whatever they want with it without keeping the students in mind. During the winter they hardly ever plow the snow or salt/sand the roads. The roadways are narrow winding and often quite dangerous. You may get the run-around from certain departments while others can be very helpful although, most take a long time to process your things. Bottom line is the reality does not live up to the promise."
College Sophomore,2,"Food Is Ok.. I enjoy being able to have Cafe Rachel to go to in the morning. However I don't like the hours that the dining facilities are open and if you don't like whats for dinner at Anderson (which is a whole other story) then you don't have have a lot of other choices (only the Weathervane which is mostly greasy unhealthy foods). Andersons meals are not always good and even when so I find the food rather fattening. Not many healthy options are available (only a salad bar), and it gets boring eating salad every night..

I suggest stocking your mini fridge with snacks and some food options.. that's what I did because I ended up getting sick of Anderson."
Recent Alumnus,2,"PR and Photography – We lost (due to cancer) one of the best professor's I have ever had the privilege to work with. He was the head of the Photography department...no one quite measures up to his genius. And, by the time the Photo dept. is back on track...I will be long graduated."
College Junior,2,"Little to None – I was a commuter, so I was unaffiliated with the drug scene at Clarion.  I would assume that it was average."
College Sophomore,2,There are not a lot of interesting things on campus for underage students. There needs to be more activities.
College Junior,2,"Ruthless at Times – They are ruthless at times, but at others, not so much. It's easy to get caught if you're a jerk. I was a jerk, but it was the best time of my life. Plus, Conduct Board is a joke."
College Junior,2,"Tech can be Nightmare – Printing and computer labs in the dorms are a nightmare: no paper, low toner, awful margins/no Wi-Fi, viruses/slow, the list goes on. Rea and Laughlin DON'T have Wi-Fi. Hello, this is 2010. All library main computers are lovely. So is the Mac Lab-I love Apples! The 24-hour lab SUCKS: old keyboards/mouses/desktops, slow."
College Junior,2,"Campus Parties are Lame – Nightlife on campus is pretty low. Unless we are planning a party with everyone, there is never really a party going on. Usually I will leave campus to party. The other problem is that some people on campus just don't party, so when others do and get loud, it is a problem. Overall, parties on campus are lame."
College Freshman,2,There are not many places for visitor parking on campus.
College Freshman,2,"The school itself wasn't bad but the housing was. Also, I had trouble with my first roommate, but they said that since I was a first-year that I had to have one and that it was part of the ""college experience."""
College Sophomore,2,"Not Too Diverse. We have three main ethnicities here: Asian, white, and black. Everyone stays with their own race aside from the occasional ""hello""."
College Freshman,2,"There are some places you can go, yet it costs money for most things, and being a first-year is hard in terms of finding nightlife."
College Freshman,2,Registration Process – I think that the registration period can be extremely disorganized. It is very difficult to get in touch with the appropriate individuals when having difficulties with registration.
College Sophomore,2,"Non Existent – Chatham has a few on-campus student events at night, but most students will go off campus, usually to another college in the area for some real nightlife."
Graduate Student,1,"The IArch program is very cliquey for how small it is.  A few good professors.  It is a LOCK STEP program-if there are classes you can test out of the student has to fight for the right to test out.  Dean makes it seam like an inconvenience- money is the bottom line, is classist.  If you do go here get Everything in writing from Dean so you can back up your convictions.  This program is Not for introverts, cohorts not as supportive as may seam. Loaded with unecessary competition, no good constructive criticism from peers or collaborative learning.  The program is constantly going through changes be wary.  If you have any design or art background consider another program in the area.  Undergrad students and grad students learn same material at this school, instead of combining students for beginning courses they basically teach the same thing twice to get double the cost."
College Junior,1,Disappointed in Chatham's decision to abandon its women's college.
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek life. If you want to go to a Frat party, you have to go to Pitt."
College Senior,1,We do not have Greek life on campus. Students are able to join other Greek organizations outside of campus but very few students know about that.
College Freshman,1,There are no parties here.  You have to go to University of Pittsburgh or CMU
College Junior,1,We don't have a greek life on campus but if you still would like to be apart of it you can rush at University of Pittsburgh
College Senior,1,"Upon being accepted into Chatham University, I inquired about possible scholarship opportunities. I was informed that Chatham offered no scholarship opportunities for graduate students, and was given little to no resources beyond that conversation. It is only now that I'm realizing that there are plenty of opportunities out there for graduate students, even if not university-based! I suggest beginning to look earlier than I did."
College Freshman,1,They do not give you enough financial aid. They do not send you to scholarships or grants they send you right to loans.
College Junior,1,"I hate winter. I really should be living in the Philippines. But anyway, winter is terrible in Pittsburgh. It really doesn't matter if there is light snow or heavy snowfall during winter. Either way, its going to be grey and moist and cold. And you're going to nice full sleeved shirts, sweaters, a coat, scarf, hat/ear muffs and gloves, if you don't have pockets. All that may even come in handy shuffling between classes around the campus, despite its small size. The campus does look really pretty though when it does snow, which I suppose is a plus point, if you're inside and not out."
College Senior,1,"Science Building Needs a Lot of Love – The school is unwilling to replace the autoclave in the science building or help to supplement student research so professors are required to entirely fund themselves and their students that have to complete a required senior tutorial in order to graduate. Besides the autoclave, the school is unwilling to provide the necessary equipment for even basic laboratory class success because it would rather spend the money elsewhere - and people wonder why there are so few women in science!"
College Sophomore,1,"It's a Women's College – and you think it would mean that the girls would be educated but these are, by far, the dumbest women I have ever met."
College Sophomore,1,"The Campus Is Very Intolerant – The campus is so small if you make one person mad at you, you lose all your connections to the community. People will turn their nose up at you even if they are mentally ill and have poor grades. Keep to yourself, don't make friends with anyone not interested in going to college for work"
College Senior,1,there are rarely parties on campus; you have to go off campus to do anything fun on the weekends
College Junior,1,"DEAR GOD. Please no more of this. They won't update the dorms because they would have to comply with codes for historical buildings. SO THEY LEAVE THEM. I have seen the paneling on the ceiling fall off, someone's windows be ready to fall out all winter(later to just have plexi-glass screwed in), the bathrooms are never quite clean and have improper ventilation (there is mold and scum most everywhere, also someone smeared fecal matter on one of the bathroom stalls last year, and it has yet to be removed), roommate horrors abound and yet..... nothing changes. (p.s. the list goes on, but I do not have the time or energy to devote to such ranting.)"
College Sophomore,1,"Dining Services? The food in Anderson if often burned, meals at other locations are at odd hours, and when there is something edible, it is often taken off the menu or has run out quickly."
College Freshman,1,"Chatham is a women's college, but one of the things that sets it apart from other women's college is that it is Co-ed at the graduate and doctorate level. Many girls on campus do not like this because they feel Chatham should still be a women's college. Chatham was forced to go co-ed in order to increase enrollment. As a result, Chatham's standards of enrollment have decreased as well. There are students attending Chatham would not be attending college if it were not for Chatham's substandard approach to admissions. Women's colleges are supposed to be more challenging, but many students at Chatham simply do not care about their education. There are many girls who come to Chatham just to party at the local schools and end up on academic probation. Chatham does have an honor code, but it is not enforced whatsoever. Students on academic probation can expect to receive their degrees in 4 years just like the students who actually work and put an effort into their college education. The administration refuses to kick out any students who do not perform well academically because they are afraid of the university being closed forever due to lack of enrollment. There are also many students on Chatham with severe mental illnesses and also those who feign illness as well. Students learn quickly that if the Chatham administration thinks  a student as a mental illness, that student is not held accountable for her behavior whatsoever, even if it harms herself or others. Many undergraduate women have attempted suicide and even participate in cutting behavior but the administration does not remove them from the campus community. The honor code is simply a piece of paper used rather well in marketing to bring new students to campus. Students have yet to see the honor code actually be enforced."
College Freshman,1,"Chatham's athletes are not great at sports, or at their academics for that matter. Chatham's sports are at a level where none of the athletes receive a scholarship for playing at the college level but many had no choice but to attend Chatham due to their substandard playing and academic abilities. Each semester Chatham places posters throughout campus rewarding athletes who have been placed on the athletes honor roll. Sometimes the athletes are rewarded for a 3.6 and above, while some receive recognition for obtaining a 3.0 GPA or above. Many of the academic students who do well at Chatham are not happy about the posters because Dean's List GPA requirement is a 3.5 and the athletes are simply rewarded for a 3.0 GPA. Chatham places more emphasis on the athletes than on any other sector of Chatham even though the teams barely win."
College Freshman,1,"A student can receive a scholarship if she attends the World Ready Women Scholarship event. All she has to do is a write a substandard essay and Chatham will literally throw money at her! Students don't have to worry about their financial aid being taken away if they are on academic probation because the Chatham administration rarely, if at all, enforces the honor code or any sort of standards relating to academic conduct. Girls have been on academic probation for several semesters and still receive financial aid from the University because the administration is afraid of losing student enrollment."
College Freshman,1,"Completely Random – Weather in Pittsburgh is extremely random! One moment it will be nice, sunny, and warm then it will be pouring down rain and extremely cold. Bring an umbrella plus different types of clothing to be prepared for the extreme weather changes!"
College Freshman,1,"Food Options Are Not So Great! Anderson Dining Hall offers the same food every day: pasta, pizza, eggs, chicken, and the salad bar. It seems as if every day when I sit down for dinner I am eating the same meal as the day before. Luckily there are other options such as the Weathervane and Cafe Rachel. Weathervane is not your typical snack bar as it does not offer unhealthy food options. If you want to eat unhealthy, eat at Cafe Rachel or Anderson Dining Hall."

Freshman,5,I personally believe that the University of Nebraska at Omaha is a amazing place to go to college. Although times have been rough with COVID and everything going on my teachers have been really helpful and understanding. I will say that they can use a little more training when it comes to teaching online. Other then that last comment I truly believe that UNO are trying there hardest to make us freshman that are online as welcomed as possible. Personally I have some debt that I have to pay back to uno and I really need the help with that. I understand if you don’t pick me because so many kids are struggling just as much as I am. If you pick me you will not regret it and I will be greatly appreciate the kindness for the rest of my life. God knows we could all use a little kindness at the moment. May whoever read this be blessed with happiness.
Freshman,5,My online experience was pretty rocky at first because I was confused on where to go and where to look. But I found my way as every freshman will. The teachers need a little training on how to teach online but other than that my classes are okay. I’m hoping to be on campus next year for hopefully COVID will be gone by then.
Freshman,5,I take all my Courses through online except the biology lab which I understand. my professors make the effort to make the classes go as smoothly as possible and less stressful.
Alum,5,"Only took about maybe two online classes, but the professors who taught them kinda spaced off the online students."
Freshman,5,"Overall the University of Nebraska at Omaha is a really great school. The campus is beautiful with GREAT dorms. No other school's dorms that I have seen can compare to the dorms at UNO. It is very centrally located in Omaha which makes it easy to leave campus and do things. My class experience was mostly online, but no complaints there!"
Niche User,5,"I think that the program that the university uses ""Canvas"" is pretty easy to use it just depends on the teacher and how they choose to use it. Everyone is a little different. Worse comes to worst tech support is always available. I think most anyone wouldn't have any trouble with online classes through UNO."
Junior,5,"I've had a great experience with the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I've been able to enjoy the ""college experience"" by getting involved with organizations and greek life on campus. With that, I still have the benefits of going to a smaller school. My class sizes are about 25-30 people, and my teachers all know us by name. The teachers at UNO are always willing to help students. In light of COVID-19, the university did an amazing job transitioning students to remote learning. I even did an internship across the country while still being enrolled at the university, and had an amazing experience working with my advisors and teachers while I was away. Living on campus at UNO is also perfect! All of the dorms here are apartment style, where you get our own bedroom and have a bathroom in the apartment!"
Junior,5,"I've taken quite a few classes online with UNO, and they've all been pretty easy! Most of them have been work-at-your-own-pace, while a few had weekly quizzes you couldn't miss. Overall, I've had a really easy time with online classes and definitely recommend them!"
Freshman,5,"I love everything about it! The teachers are great, the online class portal is easy to navigate, what else do you need?"
Freshman,5,So far with what I have seen with UNO is amazing student life and involvement of students in many activities. The professors are well trained and focuses on the student succeeding which is something a lot of other schools lack.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus set up and all the options that i have within the college.  A beautiful library, gym, food options, good parking options, sporting events, many clubs to join and I a can easily walk to all my classes.  I would recommend anyone to attend UNO."
Senior,5,"The campus is beautiful and provides many opportunities, both social and academic, to a diverse group of students!"
Niche User,5,"It is a very great campus! Friendly people and staff, dorms are amazing, and the atmosphere is friendly."
Senior,5,It is a great learning experience and I love the tough learning it sticks with you throughout the college term and beyond.
Freshman,5,"My experience at the University of Nebraska at Omaha is a pretty smooth ride. I love the diverse population of the university and the many opportunities it provides. This college is one of the or the best college in Nebraska to attend and study in.  There are many partnerships that UNO offers help with for the students like UNMC. If i had to change one thing about ""UNO"" is nothing. I loved the that they have a good acceptance rate and a good graduation rate . I am very proud to be a Maverick and will always be happy. I would also recommend it to many other people to do your research on to what classes you really like becuase University of Nebraska at Omaha offers a ton."
Niche User,5,Such a great place with an amazing atmosphere. It really feels like this place is alive! Great professors with real world experience to help me. achieve my goals. WOW!
Junior,5,Not really a lot going on for non traditional students but they do offer a lot of classes online so you are able to work while pursuing your degree.
Alum,5,"University of Nebraska at Omaha has a beautiful campus nested in the middle of a diverse metropolitan city. Its colleges have many majors from which to choose, intramural and collegiate sports, an honors program, music and arts specialties, and dozens of clubs and organizations."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at UNO is great! I like the teachers, each and every teacher is a different experience they are never the same and they can teach you different things. At UNO I would like to see nothing change, honestly I feel like the school does great with everything that I notice."
Freshman,5,"I like UNO, it is a very good school. Its not to expensive and its not to hard to get accepted. Everybody on campus is so cool and its plenty diversity all around. Plus they aren't on your back to heavy about grades and the classes aren't overwhelming either. The professors are very friendly and very helpful, they do all they can to help you be as successful as can be and reach your max potential."
Niche User,5,University of Nebraska at Omaha  is really welcoming college. I went to their summer scholar school there over the summer. I have a-lot experience in getting used to their college campus. Their college campus is really close to each other unlike another other college. So they make it easier to go from one campus to another campus on time without being late to class. I also get the experience on living on campus. Their dorm was really big that it make it feel like home because you can get a lot space. I really enjoy living on their campus because they provide really good food and care about you. I also learn how it will be like to be college  student. The college is also very close to my house so I can easily go to school.
Niche User,5,"I was there for summer program. I absolutely loved it there. The teachers are very cordial. They are willing to work with you. For what I could see it was very diverse as a University which is what attracted me the most.  The dorms are also very nice. You can share rooms with two people or four. For a dorm it was really big and very clean. I stayed in the dorms for a week and it felt like home. The food in the cafeteria is also amazing. There is so much variety in foods it is unbelievable. As a vegetarian it is really difficult to find option but there every day I was eating different food and it was amazing, genuinely one of the best in Omaha."
Niche User,5,Loved the modern campus and the involvement of students on and off campus who've embraced the whole experience.
Senior,5,"I had a phenomenal experience during my time at UNO. Overall, my professors were extremely helpful and very knowledgeable on the course material presented in class. I lived on campus for two years and have nothing but great things to say about the living-style at UNO. All dorms are created as suites, so you have your own room with a kitchen and living room. The campus is very friendly and inclusive and was a great place to call my second-home."
Niche User,5,"The University of Nebraska at Omaha is constanly expanding and updating their facilities to make for the best overall educational experience for its students. They are appealing to a broader range of students and accomodating to those living on campus, commuting to campus, or prefering an online class experience. There are many options in each college for majors and classes within each major specific study."
Junior,5,I enjoy the atmosphere on campus and the people I have met. The University is in a great location in Omaha. The professors I have had are inspiring and nice mentors.
Sophomore,5,"When I was battling with anxiety and depression I essentially dropped out of life and ended up failing all of my classes. I ending up being kicked out of UNO. However, I appealed and they wiped all of my grades clean and accepted me back with open arms. In addition to all of that they gave me a full refund for my tuition for the year. However, UNO isn’t great for socializing, because most people kind of stick to themselves. All in all UNO is a great school."
Niche User,5,I enjoyed my tour of UNO when i first visited. I was very excited for my future there. Everyone is nice and have very positive vibes.
Freshman,5,I haven’t been a student there but I love what I’m learning about the school and can’t wait to attend
Senior,5,"I really enjoy The University of Nebraska at Omaha. I came from a smaller college at first and realized that I needed to go to a bigger one. UNL was too big for me, so UNO was a perfect middle ground. The professors are great, I haven’t had any problems besides parking."
Alum,5,UNO goes above and beyond to make sure every student is reaching their full potential. Any time I had an issue it was taken care of promptly and the advisors were amazing to work with. This University makes it clear they want every student to succeed and set them up for success after graduation.
Junior,5,"Great programs, clubs, and resources! I feel safe here and I know that knowledge will be vested. My favorite part about UNO is it's role in the community, and even built a giant and gorgeous community center to honor Omaha."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Nebraska Omaha is a great college in the heart of Omaha. With apartment-like dorms (who doesn’t like having their own bedroom), weekly campus activities, and an overall inclusive feel, UNO is the best place to spend your college years. UNO offers a variety of majors and each class is taught by professors who truly care and want you to succeed. If you want to be apart of student activities, there are many clubs you can join that tailor to your interests. If you want to truly have the time of your life and look back on good times, I sincerely recommend attending the University of Nebraska Omaha."
Niche User,5,"The University of Nebraska has always been my dream college since I will be the first person to attend a University. I think that UNO will give me a strong foundation for my first few years in college and it will prepare me for a higher education. As well as that, it will challenge me to take on more tasks. Something I want UNO to change is their parking lots. I don't think it's neccessary to charge that the students that much for a parking space."
Freshman,5,This university has so many amazing professors that are so willing to help. The other students are also very nice and are always looking to meet new people. I never worry about feeling out of place here because everyone makes me feel right at home!
Sophomore,5,This school has done an amazing job at making me feel included and like I belong. The professors are very hands on and helpful and the students are very friendly.
Freshman,5,"I really love the diversity of the school it really makes it feel like everyone belongs there. The professors are amazing, you can tell they love their job, which makes it easier for the students to enjoy class as well."
Junior,5,The environment is great. Always willing to help around with everything and anything. The education system is great and I've had a great experience so far.
Sophomore,5,I wish they had individual housing on campus.  The apartment style is great but some people would like to live on campus and not have roommates.  the teachers are awesome and they really care about the students and try to help the students succeed.
Niche User,5,The University of Omaha has many opportunities and was a great place for me to choose and dual enroll with
Niche User,5,"UNO is has a great campus and everything I'm looking for in a college. Not very expensive, close to activities, not to big, and a friendly environment."
Freshman,5,Their distance education program is very efficient. Professors are knowledgeable and helpful. They have plenty of programs for every student to fit in and feel as if they are apart of something. Very informative orientation.
Niche User,5,"I may not be a student yet but I love the environment there, just a nice looking school. And very friendly people."
Freshman,5,This is my first time and I will be taking classes online. Do not know that much about this school yet.
Senior,5,"UNO has been one of the best decisions I have ever made in my career and personal life! The community, professors, residence halls and so much more has been so great since day one. I truly recommend UNO to young adults who are thinking about college. It's welcoming, safe and affordable! Overall, my experience at UNO has been significant!"
Senior,5,"I love University of Nebraska- Omaha, UNO. The campus has a great student section and they provide good spirit week the first week of school and throughout the school year. Advising could use some help with more skilled advisors or advisors that know the curriculum. Some classes have been cut because of funding, which makes signing up on time or graduating on time a bit more difficult. There are plenty of caring professors that make time to help you out."
Junior,5,The college is very diverse and is intent on making your expierience with them a great one. They have tutor centers and student centers that are devoted to assisting you in being the most successful student you can be during your time with them. The housing is nicely furnished and the cafeteria food is fantastic. Overall I’ve had a great expierience with UNO. Go Mavs!
Junior,5,That care soo much for their students and are willling to do anything to help them succeed. They have great staff and programs to help the students.
Junior,5,"University of Nebraska at Omaha has become a second home to me! There is a great sense of community on campus and so many groups and organizations that welcome any and everyone. Being a disabled student, I have been very grateful to the accessibilities department for helping me with transportation needs, as well as having professors that are willing to work with me to make sure that I can succeed!"
Sophomore,5,UNO is very diverse and has students from many different backgrounds and also have resource for them. Most of the professors are very helpful and caring. The campus is also has very nice scenery. The school is big but not overly crowded. UNO is also a safe campus.
Sophomore,5,"Great and amazing college, the staff seem friendly and helpful and the professors seem very passionate about what they are doing."
Graduate Student,5,It is a very good experience as a student of University of Nebraska Omaha. I worked here as a graduate teaching assistant in the department of mathrmatics staffs are excellent. My supervisor dr Mahbubul majumder is an excellent guy with his supervision.
Sophomore,5,"I love that this college is not intimidating! There's always someone on campus to help you find directions or answer and questions. 
I don't have much to say about what I don't like. But if I had to choose it'd be to have more food options."
Sophomore,5,"UNO's location is perfect! It is located in a city that is busy and gives you city vibe but doesn't have all the commotion and distractions of an actual big city. The professors are great and very helpful, they all  want to see you truly succeed. Dorm options are amazing compared to that of other colleges and within the diverse student body you are sure to find a crowd, group, club or team that you will fit right in with."
Niche User,5,"UNO is a great school that I can't wait to attend, the campus is beautiful and close to home. There are tons of opportunities and activities for me to be a part with an excellent high jump coach."
Freshman,5,"Having it be my first year here at the University of Nebraska Omaha it has been amazing. The professors are friendly and want you to succeed, that being said most of them will go out of their way to help you or provide you with information to get help. There are a lot of activities from social events to educational. Athletic events are fun as there are pregame parties with free food and gifts. During the game they have games that students get to participate and get a chance at winning another prize. The campus is very easy to navigate and there are a lot of restaurants near by as well as connivence and retail stores."
Junior,5,"The University of Nebraska at Omaha packs a poignant punch for the surprisingly underwhelming nature of the campus, compared to other State Universities around the country. The tuition costs are a life-saver, enabling students of all backgrounds the ability to gain an college education without racking up a crippling debt while doing so. The educators are generally friendly mid-westerners, raised and educated in similar economic and sociological situations as their students, who are eager to help in every way they can. The University offers plenty of immersive resources, which help prepare graduates for the real world after college, and allow for an easy transition into the career of his or her choice. I love UNO, and would recommend it to anyone who grew up in the surrounding area, and who wish to expand their world like I did."
Graduate Student,5,"I have loved my experience at UNO.  the campus is beautiful, The professors have time to visit with students.  I am a commuter, the parking situation is not ideal,  but other than that great experience"
Sophomore,5,UNO is a wonderful school. The professors care about the students and want to see them succeed. You will meet so many amazing people and there are always so many fun activities planned on campus. You can get involved in so many different ways through all of the clubs and organizations.
Freshman,5,"There are great opportunities and a huge community at UNO all year round, not just when class is in session. It's a great place to be."
Freshman,4,"The main thing i like is the diversity of the University. Coming from a very diverse background, I was able to connect with people very easily."
Freshman,4,This is my first year so I don't have much to compare it to. Covid has changed many things but so far my experience has been good
Graduate Student,4,I've had an amazing experience thus far and I love how engaging the teachers are..  I really feel like I'm getting an in class experience.
Graduate Student,4,I love the small University feeling and the character the University displays. Im a proud ungraduate and now working on my MA. The thing I would recommend is offering more classes on everyday issue and more available times for single parents
Junior,4,My online experience at UNO had always been a good one. Whether it was a science class or communications I felt my professors gave me the education I needed even without having the in person connection.
Junior,4,"I chose University of Nebraska at Omaha because they are dedicated to giving me an outstanding education for half the cost of other universities. Along with their affordable tuition their staff works above and beyond to make sure the university is an inclusive, fair, free and safe space for people of all walks of life. They are eager to help you get the education you need without leaving you drowning in debt and offer excellent programs."
Niche User,4,The University of Nebraska Omaha is the best Nebraska University. So many opportunities have been made available to me as a returning student seeking to become a teacher. The campus is becoming more and more diverse and inclusive and the library and facilities are amazing. If I had one critique it would be that the school is set up very much for the traditional right out of high school students. This was a real challenge as a non-traditional adult student. With that being said I think this is something that is being worked on and with the challenges presented by coronavirus I only see more opportunities for different types of learning to happen in the future.
Alum,4,I took a couple of classes online while attending UNO. Some were better than others but overall my experience as very good. One of my most memorable classes was a psychology class I took online. I usually would recommend an in person class but this one stood out.
Alum,4,I loved the campus and the easy access. My best part about the school was the weight room and facilities located around the weight room.
Senior,4,"Online course are easy to understand, yet will provide people with stimulating academic challenges. Despite the lack of in person interactions, the courses will still make a stun set want to learn each week and apply their knowledge."
Senior,4,"The school is a great academic institution and full of different things for students to do. There are many different majors that can be pursued, along with multiple academic facilities that can be used for these majors. Additionally, this school has facilities available for recreational activities that can be used at the students’ leisure. Overall, this school is a great one to attend and can provide very valuable educational opportunities."
Junior,4,"UNO has a large variety of degree programs, both on campus and online at very reasonable tuition rates.  The teachers and other staff are very helpful and student life is well balanced."
Freshman,4,"I love the fun and including environment that UNO has to offer. People here are always willing to help you out if need and that really show! A few things they could work on though is the parking on campus, as they are a commuter campus. There is not a lot of places to park which puts more stress on the student! Other than that it is a great school!"
Freshman,4,"This school is arguable one of the most diverse school in the region. I feel like I belong here matter what my race, social class, or my education background. There are a lot of assistance available for students who think college is too difficult for them or students who are struggling to speak english or just to communicate with others. Also, the professors are very nice and kind. They care more than I expected and I am so glad I chose this school."
Senior,4,A decent school. I attend online but there is still an ok sense of community. Sometimes I feel like communication is difficult. My application was initially mishandled and that resulted in not being able to register for the classes I wanted. But I want to finish college and UNO offers a way to do that.
Niche User,4,"UNO is a really great place to get a good education while staying close to family, especially if you live in Omaha. The teachers are amazing. It's a very diverse school where you can meet a lot of different people and get out of your comfort zone."
Sophomore,4,"I love that they offer a degree in a field of study completely online. I am an Omaha native, but I pay non-resident tuition. Where's the loyalty to your hometown online students who left to explore the world UNO?"
Sophomore,4,I like the diversity and and acceptance at the university. The professor to student ratio is small enough where students can really ask professors for help and the professors get to know the students by name.
Sophomore,4,The school is all around a very good institution. Class sizes range from 15 to 200 depending on your preferences. For the most part with few exceptions the professors are very helpful and respond to emails fairly quickly. Most classes have extra credit opportunities for grade bumps and also provide study guides along with study sessions. Through my two years that you know I have experienced very little problem in terms of needing assistance in my classes.
Sophomore,4,"I like the support of game development. I also like the dorms in University Village. However, I wish everything there was more affordable. The textbooks, classes, and dorms are all too expensive in my opinion."
Junior,4,The campus is very clean and pretty. The teachers in my program are very good at what they do and are very accessible. The advising team is always ready to help out when needed as well.
Niche User,4,UNO offers good facilities and great student life while being smaller and more homey than UNL. The school has wonderful campus life but is still good for commuters.
Niche User,4,UNO is my first choice I'm planning to tend. University of Nebraska Omaha is a place with opportunities. I love the campus and the people there are very friendly. I'm scared my college but that doesn't stop me from following my dreams.
Sophomore,4,"UNO is a very good school. Competitive classes, nice people, and great teachers. I just transferred here and we're almost halfway through the semester and I am very happy with my choice. LOVED Durango Days."
Sophomore,4,"I like the overall feel of the campus because it is big but it does not feel like it. Also, I personally like it because it is a commuter school and I can live from home. The professors there are willing to help and give extra practice if needed and their doors are always open."
Sophomore,4,It was a nice campus and very diverse. I love how students are helpful and nice. People are so friendly. Events at this campus are very fun and entertaining to join.
Senior,4,UNO is awesome about community engagement and real life experiences. I am studying to become an Early Childhood teacher and every semester in the College of Education you are placed in a practicum to gain experience. All of the professional staff that I have worked with are amazing and truly want to equip you to be the best educator you can be.
Freshman,4,Uno is a very good school. I enjoyed the campus life and different opportunities. The theater scene is amazing and I love the library. This was always my first choice school. Aside from some minor difficulties I'd say it is a very good school
Senior,4,"I love the atmosphere on campus, it's incredibly diverse for being in Midwest America and has a lot of international students. There are numerous clubs and organizations to join and fun events happening all the time! I feel very connected to the university and have learned a lot. My only critique is that it could be a lot more environmentally friendly by incorporating reusable meal trays at the dining halls or less single-use plastic in general. But that's like any university around the world, overall it's a great experience."
Freshman,4,I went to their campus and enjoyed the time I was there. The Milo Bail center was very helpful in guiding me to other colleges on campus and giving me information on UNO. The campus is quite large and has a nice community of students from an array of different races and backgrounds. I would like to see the campus expand more and make more parking spaces as every year more and more students are dedicated to pursue their career goals at UNO.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy my campus along with the resources available for students. I live on campus and they really make an effort to make us feel included. I have made use of the student center many times, I spend hours studying in the multicultural office surrounded by supportive peers and staff members and I also have gone to the student clinic when I felt sick or needed a counseling session. There are little things that have made me dislike UNO. The only one I can name is that a few of my professors have been harsh or disrespectful towards me. Otherwise, UNO is wonderful!"
Junior,4,"The school has many opportunities; as long as you actually know they exist. You can go an entire year lost in confusion, but after a while, the whole place becomes so much smaller and easy to manage."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of the campus and the environment. They have so many wonderful resources and opportunities to get involved. Some of the classes were challenging to pass with an A, even for a hard working student, but still okay. The parking situation could be a little better. Sometimes you have to walk all the way across campus from your classes just to park. And they fine you a lot for parking where you shouldn’t. I personally feel that if a student is paying so much money in tuition just to attend school there, fines shouldn’t be so heavy."
Junior,4,"My experiences at the University of Nebraska Omaha have been mostly positive. I have established wonderful connections with a number of my professors on campus who all genuinely care for their students. The campus itself has a great community atmosphere as it is condensed and often feels like a separate entity apart from the surrounding Omaha area, unlike some other more scattered campuses which are further integrated into the surrounding city."
Senior,4,"Very well rounded college. I am in the engineering program and have really enjoyed thus far. The teachers truly care about your success and that has really helped me personally. There are some slight downsides attending here, unfortunately. Parking is nonexistent and the dorms are quite expensive."
Graduate Student,4,"The campus is gorgeous, but parking is horrendous. While I still have some time left in my program, I know I made the right choice to attend UNO. In my first year alone, I already have four exciting professional events that I'm sure will help me grow my career."
Freshman,4,"Faculty and staff are all friendly and approachable. Buildings, new and old, are navigable and stately and at most a 15 minute walk in between."
Freshman,4,"UNO is a wonderful school full of opportunities. I would love to see more major specific scholarships offered at the university because I don't see to many for my major, biology. I think that the campus is very beautiful and I how close I live to it. It is located at the heart of Omaha and I could not think of a better school to go to."
Junior,4,The professors take the time to get to know their students and take an interest in them. They push them to be their best and present them with many opportunities to achieve their goals and dreams. They see the best in their students and work closely with them to make sure they are high achievers and don't settle for less than their best.
Freshman,4,I admire the work every professor and staff member puts in to creating a wonderful environment on campus and in the classroom.
Senior,4,"I'm attending the University of Nebraska at Omaha for Computer Science and Mathematics, so far it's been an excellent school in a great city. I really like the faculty and staff as well as the curriculum."
Niche User,4,I used to live in omaha and our school would have annual trips to the college. I also remember performing there for a dance class and I was infactuated with the envirnoment and atsmostphere in the area. I have always looked up to become a student there.
Senior,4,"I like that the University of Nebraska Omaha is affordable and has quality professors. This is not a party school, is mostly a commuter college, so it can get lonely if you live on campus."
Niche User,4,"I took a creative writing class here and had a blast! Everyone is willing to participate and have great, in depth conversations."
Senior,4,"There seems to always be a lot of construction which can kind of get in the way of making your way to class. The buildings I’m selves are all relatively new, and it seems like the teachers and professors really do care about what their students learn and take away from the classes."
Sophomore,4,"I love that UNO and the staff there that I have run into so far. They do a great job, in my opinion of taking care of students that are on campus. They have fairly decent food on campus (some better than others). Everything is always very clean and they try to keep ever building as updated as possible. I love UNO and when I have to go to Creighton to finish out my degree (because they do not have an Occupational Therapy program) I will really miss it!"
Junior,4,"I like how small of a school it is and how close all the buildings are. It makes walking from class to class easy. Also, the people are friendly. One thing I would like to see improve is a better sense of community within the college."
Sophomore,4,The University of Nebraska at Omaha is a terrific university to attend. It is a commuter school as well as a first choice for international students. I love the faculty and programs that the school has to offer.
Sophomore,4,"UNO is unique because it is primarily a commuter college so for me being from out of state I knew no one. However, living on campus I've found it to be a very tight knit welcoming community and although it is 15,000 students I always see the same people. Its the perfect mix of large university with a small campus feel. The dorms are awesome, basically having an apartment. You get your own bedroom with a full kitchen and living room area. There are always ways to get involved and have an awesome college experience."
Junior,4,"Great College to attend as its very diverse with most students coming from other countries. The professors generally are nice and authentic to your success. The food is a bit pricey for being average so if you can eat elsewhere do it. the surrounding area is near bookstores such as barnes and nobles, starbucks and fast food. The only thing I wish that would change is that advisors have too much control on classes that you would like to take and have to provide permission for certain classes."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, UNO is a good college, they should improve their shuttle system, and the library should stay open for longer. Professors are qualified and I enjoy going to class."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy my time at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. When I was picking a college to attend, I  instantly liked that the university had relatively small class sizes and had a small community feeling. The campus is a nice size. I love my dorm because of the apartment style rooms. The full kitchen is great so that my roommates and I can prepare our own food. I like that their is an option to pay for a meal plan and go to the food court if you do not want to cook. My dorm is at Scott Campus and the Aksarben area is wonderful to live next too. I can walk to the movie theater or the many restaurants in the area."
Freshman,4,Great if you don't sit around in your dorm. Join clubs and talk to people in your classes. Your networking skills will probably determine how much fun you have in college. Make sure to go hang out with people on the weekends. Lots of late nights and great memories. Also go to hockey and soccer games... Great atmosphere.
Freshman,4,"I like the academics and the professors are phenomenal here on campus. It is very small geographically, but has just about as many faces as you would see in a mid-sized town."
Freshman,4,"I have not been at the university for long but what I have been around for has been a great start, I work on campus and my co-workers are amazing and always supportive of each other"
Senior,4,"I think the faculty at the University are what really make it special. In my experience, they take the time to help you succeed that many other professors wouldn't. I would like to see more funding go to the arts rather than being spent on a hockey rink that we didn't need."
Freshman,4,Affordable University with knowledgable and nice faculty and staff members. Very diverse and welcoming environment. Campus is friendly and all buildings are easy to find.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Nebraska at Omaha has a great college setting. There are a lot of international students, which is very appealing so you can see hear the different world views and experiences of different people. Living in West Omaha my whole life, there were few minorities. Also, at my 99 percent white high school, when I got to college I was slightly shocked and definitely saw the vast color hues of different people. There are a lot of events that freshmen could take part in to meet lots of people. I would change the fact that it is very calm. There is NO party life- well, maybe there is a little but that is only is sororities and fraternities and who would even want to be a part of that?"
Freshman,4,"Its a great school to attend, I'm majoring in professional flight and love the opportunity UNO provides. The one thing that could be better is parking but i suppose its the same problem at all colleges"
Freshman,4,"The atmosphere at UNO is one you wouldn't assume to be a part of a college setting. Every professor and instructor is very down to Earth. I feel as though I can trust my professors more than if they weren't as human as they act. I feel more that they want to educate me rather than they have to educate me. However, my biggest problem at UNO is the parking. The University does not make very good accommodations for parking. Per semester, a surface lot pass is $147. However, you are not guaranteed a spot to park. You will spend $147 on gas waiting in your car to park in your $147 spot. It's ridiculous."
Freshman,2,All my classes are remote. You’re mostly left by yourself to figure out how everything works which sucks. UNO does nothing to help students with no access to technology.
Freshman,2,"University of Nebraska at Omaha has many opportunities for students and has impressive dorms. However, the university does not have a sense of community on campus and it is difficult to feel at home. UNO is still very much a commuter school."
College Junior,2,"Awful international roommates second semester. They burned inscents and were up all night chanting and singing and banging on doors.I feared for my safety and because I was a straight white female I was told if I have these concerns I ""would be better served off campus""."
Recent Alumnus,2,I have not lived on campus but this is what I have observed.
Recent Alumnus,2,The school is anti social and very stereo typical toward certain people .
College Freshman,2,There is virtually no greek life on campus.
College Freshman,2,"The courses at my school are very fair. The professors are nice, although some are very condescending, especially the stem instructors."
College Freshman,2,"So far, I have not enjoyed my school at all. I feel rejected by many of the students that go there."
College Freshman,2,Everyone goes home during the weekend.
College Freshman,2,Mostly on south campus with athletes.
College Freshman,2,Small but very secretive and very much a clique
College Freshman,2,Very unhelpful in finding scholarships or schools for ALL students. Does NOT prepare for higher education yet claims to. Most students will only go to community college level schools or not continue towards higher education.
College Freshman,2,"Most people are the same, which means if you're different, it's difficult to find people with like interests. Also, most people are already set into their friend groups, so coming in as a new student makes it hard to penetrate into the pre-existing friend bubbles."
College Freshman,2,Its a huge joke. SigEp is the only good greek organization at this school.
College Freshman,2,Security is great and is just there to keep people safe. Parking will give you a ticket at any possible chance. I had a friend in a drop off zone for 15 minutes over winter break at 9:30 PM and got a $30 ticket.
College Senior,2,"I am in the top of my class and desperately need scholarships in order to finish my degree, however, I have never been selected for a scholarship."
College Sophomore,2,THey are really nice and I like how they have great facilities for them
Recent Alumnus,2,Not many near the campus itself.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Compared to large schools, it was non-existent."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not much to choose from, not diverse at all."
College Sophomore,2,"Being a student and not too much of a party guy I rarely if at all would be partying. Besides, the small town of Omaha can have poor nightlife."
College Junior,2,"I have heard rumors of Greek life at UNO for a decade, but have never seen anything that suggests it actually exists."
College Student,2,Walking to class is a drag when its freezing outside.
College Sophomore,2,Campus security is ridiculousssss. They take themselves 300% too seriously ctfu
College Student,2,I have no knowledge of any off campus housing available and the school doesn't acknowledge any if there is
College Student,2,"It's hard to meet people when you don't live at the dorms, they have great social events but if you don't have any friends in the first place then you have no one. i've noticed those who live in the dorms have others to be with no matter what where as an outsider is well an outsider"
College Sophomore,2,"""On"" campus parking with a permit is close to the halls and easy to find. ""Off"" campus involves parking far away (blocks away) and there aren't any sidewalks leading to the campus. It fills relatively quickly."
College Senior,2,I transferred from UNL after one semester but my scholarships did not even though they were Nebraska University system scholarships. There really isn't any scholarship money for transfer students and very little for incoming freshman.
College Senior,2,"As a commuter school and a commuting student, I actually spend very little time with fellow students outside of class. Like me, most of them have jobs and many are non-traditional. I don't hear much about social life in the dorms being much more vibrant than for us commuters either."
College Junior,2,There's not enough parking and raise in tuition is NOT going into fixing this problem at all. 
College Junior,2,"There are not enough parking spots on campus for the amount of people that need to park. Permit costs are high, and ticket costs are higher than city parking tickets. There is virtually no off-campus parking. There is a strip mall about 6 blocks up the road from main campus that is free, or else you are stuck parking on the street, and many times that leads to a city parking ticket. The biggest parking lot on campus is across the main street and it is church parking lot that is lent to us. I understand that they may need to close that parking lot for funerals or masses during the week, and that is fine. But when they plan on closing that parking lot, the parking department does not post any warning on the website. They should warn students when they know they have to close it because that takes away a lot of parking spots. If I knew in advance, I would plan ahead and get there earlier to find a spot elsewhere. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"I felt there was a wide range of styles as far as apparrel. Students would wear things such as athletic apparell, casual dress attire, or even work uniforms. I feel there was quite a big of diversity in terms of the styles worn by the student population and that no subgroup, such as a preppy group, stood out over another."
Recent Alumnus,2,"While i was not an active participant in the daily campus activities, there were a variety of things to participate in. School sporting events were quite frequent and there was typically at least one event going on each day. "
Recent Alumnus,2,There are quite a few housing options for those wishing to live off-campus. Students can find many houses for rent nearby as well as a wide range of apartment buildings. The amount of space available heavily depends on the budget though. 
Recent Alumnus,2,"The downtown area of Omaha offers a lot of shops and restaurants to visit. There are quite a few venues for musicians to frequent as well. However, you can also easily access forests and parks too. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Living in Nebraska means that we experience different weather based on the season. In the winter, we will have days where you will have snow to walk through and ice to scrape off your car. The fall and spring months have periods of rainfall as well as days of clear blue skys. Depending on the season, you may have to prepare to leave your house or dorm a little early in order to get to class on time. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"I lived off campus so I was not exposed directly to my peers use of drugs or alcohol. However, based on in class discussions I know that students could access it and were partaking in the usage of alcohol and drugs. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"The cafeteria food is on average around $5 without a drink. It has your typical choices ranging from burgers, pizza, hot/cold sandwiches, and a salad bar. Along with that, they provide a convenient store which offers items such as chips, candy, soda pop, popcorn, and other items that would typically be found at a gas station. Their hours are more favorable for college students in comparison to the cafeteria."
Recent Alumnus,2,The shuttles on campus are fairly easy to board and take on average about 10 minutes. Their only downfall is that they only have a few pick-up locations.
College Sophomore,2,"Nebraska isn't known for a party town, but there are bars and clubs. The majority are pretty close by, but many of the nicer ones can be expensive. There are only two main gay clubs close. "
College Sophomore,2,"I have never had an internship, nor has UNO offered information on how to go about this."
College Junior,2,"I never was a huge fan of Greek life, but I think our campus has some of the most non-party related Greek life system."
College Freshman,2,"The most obvious and worst thing about this school is the parking. Even with a parking pass (which is expensive) it's still hard to find parking on campus. It's a pretty big campus, so walking probably won't help your promptness. I'd suggest using the shuttles to get from building to building."
College Senior,2,"Parking at UNO is the worst part about it.  The majority of the students live off campus and have to drive to school.  There are not enough parking spots for the students who have a normal parking pass.  The students that can afford to buy the most expensive parking pass (around $250 for the year) can use the garage and have no problem finding parking.  However, for us normal students, it is almost impossible to find a place to park.  The majority of the time, I have to get to school 30-45 minutes before my class starts to ensure that I get to class on time."
College Senior,2,"Choosing professors becomes a class within itself.  Pick the wrong teacher, and in the College Business, you have one of the two fails you are allowed before being blocked from a course.  Depending on the course structure, you may find yourself being told by everyone that you will fail your next semester because those are the only remaining classes and the only options you have without delaying your graduation."
College Junior,2,"Parking is not the best at UNO.  Currently I park in the student garage near the campus housing and it is fine.  It is always available, however it comes at a large cost.  Next year, I will not be living on camus and will rely on other parking options.  From word of mouth, I have discovered parking to be almost impossible if arriving for class at certain busy periods of the day.  A shuttle service is provided from local parking garages in the area, and I may choose to take that route, seeing as it is free.  The price is moderate for campus parking, however it is not readily available.  New parking facilities are being created, however, in the hopes of fixing the problem."
College Senior,2,terrible if you live off campus. the campus is located on a street that's always busy.
College Freshman,2,Greek life on the campus is not really a big deal. You are not looked down upon or left out if you are not apart of greek life. There are many social aspects that you can be apart of if you are not in the greek life as well. I think that the University does a great job in making the campus equal when it comes to greek life and non-greek life.
College Freshman,2,"They have good security that is always checking the cars in the lot and the permits do not cost that much. But the permits are only good for certain lots, if you park in wrong one or borrow a car and forget to move the permit tag to the one your driving they will ticket you. Finding a parking spot is nearly impossible if you come past 8 am. They do use a nearby parking garage from a mall that you can park at and take a shuttle bus to campus if you cant find a spot. That parking is free if you do not want to buy a permit."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The Omaha weather is typical of the Midwest.  It can get bitter cold and we get blizzards.  UNO rarely cancels classes.  It gets hot and humid in the summer.   The saying is, ""If you don't like the weather, wait 5 minutes.""  It changes that much."
College Senior,2,"All of the facilities are clean and fairly modern, but I havent noticed anything outstanding about any of the facilities."
College Freshman,2,There is very limited parking. The price to park in the lots is also very pricy. But theres room in the surrounding park area where you can usually park in. Just keep watch that you park correctly because a cop is always writing tickets. But you also can take shuttles around the campus which is a great service.
College Sophomore,2,"The food around campus is good, but the meal plans are ridiculous. Meal plans alone will run you around twelve to thirteen hundred a semester. You could easily pay less buying your own food and save yourself much needed book money. The food is decent, but I want steak and lobster every night for those prices! I can't understand why someone would pay that much for just a few meals a day."
College Sophomore,2,"The city by design is segregated. The main population is white and many still have underlying prejudices that they keep hidden. There's little discussion of politics at school as most are Democrats or non affiliated. We do have some people who are less accepting of others but on the outside seem to be accepting. There's a good atmosphere for most people, just not very accepting."
College Senior,2,"Parking here is awful and to get a decent spot will cost an arm and a leg. The shuttles are convenient, but you have to get there super early to catch them."
College Freshman,2,On campus parking is incredibly terrible. There are way too many students and far too few spots for people. I would suggest parking over at the parking garage at Crossroads and taking the shuttle over.
College Senior,2,"Not always available, college life style is extremely rambunctious. always on the move."
College Junior,2,"Lack of School Spirit – To quote the beach boys, I feel more students need to be ""True to your school""."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Security Hmm – Campus security is great at giving parking tickets but when car problems happen, even though at orientation they said they would come and jump a battery, this doesn't happen. I called for help and their response was to call a mecanic."
College Freshman,2,"Happiness Level – If I could do it over again, I wouldn't because of cost and quality of classes I have taken, so it wasn't for me but it could be different for other people. My career goals include becomming and elementary school teacher."
Alum,1,"UNO was a horrible experience. Throughout my four year college career I experienced, sexual harassment, academic misconduct and dishonesty from both professors and deans and had emotionally abusive advisors. It's just not worth your tuition in my opinion, or if you do decide to go keep your eyes open, your wits about you and just KNOW your rights. They swept the sexual abuse under the rug, and the guy I reported still kept harassing me and stalking me, saying he wanted to hog-tie me, etc. The dean Gail Baker actually encouraged me to drop out of college and unethically policed me on campus and with other professors. Professor Avery Mazor basically said I wouldn't show up to class before even taking his class when in reality my father was at home dying of cancer, yeah some days I wasn't gonna make it to class, left his office in tears. And WATCH the teaching assts./some professors grading!! Overall, a crappy university. Very shady and I guarantee my children will not never attend."
College Freshman,1,"I recently changed my major to studio art, and compared to my previous major, there are no employers for my preferred career path. I'm afraid that this school doesn't offer the best art degrees in the nation."
College Freshman,1,Parties here suck. I go to Lincoln almost every weekend.
College Freshman,1,"They throw a few parties, but they aren't a lot of fun. They're great for people who either don't make friends easily or anyone who really wants to join greek life. They're are few benefits from going greek at UNO."
College Freshman,1,"I don't own a car but I've heard the parking is pretty terrible. It's very expensive, the areas are often broken up so that even the most expensive parking pass doesn't grant you access everywhere, time frames are limited, and I've heard it's difficult to even find a spot if you do pay for it."
College Sophomore,1,lolll I don't know about maverick village but Scott campus dorm administration takes themselves wayyyyy too seriously. Like sorry but if I pay $500 a month to live in that dorm I'm gonna do whatever tf I want (within reason) and drinking is within reason like omg
Recent Alumnus,1,"Where as football tends to be a popular sporting event at most universities, our program did not attract an onverwhelming crowd. Instead, hockey seemed to be the main sporting event to attend."
College Sophomore,1,"Nebraska has the worst weather. It can snow overnight and be 90 by midday. Wind travels for miles and brings whatever weather it came from. You never know what to wear. But the school is used to that, so it never closes. Not the most fun place to live."
College Sophomore,1,Apartments near UNO are expensive and limited. Studios are $500+ and far from campus. And the school offers no assistance in finding these. Finding roommates is the best option for living off campus
College Sophomore,1,"Parking at UNO is a joke. It is outrageously priced and there is never spots available. It is free to park miles away and take the shuttle. But if you want to get to class on time, you need to show up an hour in advance and wait. You can also park at the park and walk, but you have to pay for that as well."
College Sophomore,1,There are lots you have to pay hundreds of dollars to park in or lots far away from campus that you have to walk from
College Junior,1,The campus is really laid back with most of the rules. Campus police drive around to intimidate mostly but I have yet to see them do anything to anybody. The housing rules are different in every house and their mostly concerned about being paid rather than anything else.
College Senior,1,"While transportation is available through MAT, you must live near an MAT stop.  If you do not live close enough you will be battling traffic.  Accidents are a daily nuisance along UNO's main road.  Once on campus, a lot of students do not know the basic rules of the road, thinking that stop signs are for everybody but them.  Parking is another thing entirely, but just as poor."
College Senior,1,"College of Business.  Plenty of teachers that students avoid like the plague.  No real direction, or push in the direction of my chosen major.  Advising is poor, due to being understaffed.  Classes range from boring and easy to overworked and hard.  Really nothing in between."
College Junior,1,"It's okay if you have a garage pass, but coming right off of Dodge street after 8 a.m. it is hard to find a surface lot spot without being late for class! Also with a garage pass, safety can be an issue with it being in such a remote corner after dark."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking costs way too much at our school. I feel as if it should be free, we already pay good money to go to school. Plus the options you have for parking are very limited. There is only one main lot and it is on the edge of campus, far away from a majority of classes. There seem to be just as many teacher parking lots as student lots, and the teachers lot is located right in the middle of campus."
College Senior,1,"The parking on this campus is hectic. There have been numerous times I have been late to classes or completely missed them due to no parking. You can take the shuttle from way down the street and walk for what seems like hours, or drive around aimlessly trying to catch that person just leaving classes. Good luck finding parking without paying a pretty penny."
College Freshman,1,"The difficulty all students have finding a parking space is ridiculous. When I lived off campus I would arrive an hour early just to circle campus for a spot, which was never guaranteed, and even then sometimes one never opened. They should have spent the money from the new and now useless football stadium on another student parking lot."
College Junior,1,"Drinking? Not for Me. I do not drink or stay out at night if I can avoid it.  I prefer staying at home.  I will take night classes if this the only time they are provided, but this the only reason I am out.  As for transportation, the shuttle  only runs for so long and if students drink they will have to depend on themselves or friends whom have not drunk alcohol bedverages.  This is not safe in my mind"
College Freshman,1,"Tough Luck – Uno is a campous that is quickly out growing itself it got so big that it is now split in half by a major street (dodge), which can be a hassle to get across. Parking on the main campous is nearly impossible but parking is abundant on the sub campous used for buiseness and engineering colleges"
College Senior,1,"There are many different races and religions that make up the UNO campus, but unfortunately for the most part there is a majority of white people. However, the age of students is much higher than the normal."
College Senior,1,"Awful Unless You Have Alot of Money – Parking on campus is awful. You pretty much have to buy all the passes for over $100 and drive around for 20 minutes to find a spot. However, there is a one way street about 2 blocks away that is open to park for students and it's free."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus IS a nightmare if you do not have a parking garage pass. The surface lots get filled up at eight in the morning and stay full all day. If you do not arrive to campus early, you will be late to your class. The school offers shuttle services, which many students utilize and that helps alleviate some traffic and parking issues. However, the shuttle only runs til 6PM, so if you have night class, you are out of luck or are stuck walking from where the shuttle picked you up. The garage normally always has spots open, but it is expensive, so get ready to dole out some money for a parking spot."
College Junior,1,There's almost no greek life at UNO. As far as I know only 1 of the frats have a frat house and none of the sororities have a sorority house.  I've only met one person at UNO who is in a frat and that frat is a co-ed frat for accounting and finance majors.
College Junior,1,UNO mostly has a lot of students that come from middle-class families.  There aren't vary many students that attend UNO who come from poverty and the majority of the students are white and come from small towns or the more developed part of Omaha.
College Student,1,"I think it's okay, not the best, it's kind of hard to find parking spots, and I think that the way the ticket and fine people is ridiculous. I think they charge way to much."
College Junior,1,"Parking at UNO is terrible.  There aren't enough spaces.  The best bet is to park at the neighboring Crossroads Mall parking lot, then take the free shuttle to campus."
College Freshman,1,"For paying 125 dollars for a parking pass, I always have a hard time finding a parking spot. They should have more parking!"
College Sophomore,1,"Snow Days – When it snows during the winter, they hate to close school.  All the high schools will be closed in the area and they will keep campus open.  Also they wait until the very last minute to decide if it is a snow day or not."
College Freshman,1,"Either Dorm or With Parents – It is really hard for a working adult to find an apartment at a reasonable price, imagine how hard it would be for a student.  Another point is that there are hardly any apartments around because the university is in a more of a commercial area.  The best options is living at the dorms, which are expensive to, or with their parents, which is the best way to save money."
College Freshman,1,If there is anything that the students here hate about college is the parking.  It is one of the most horrible things over here.  I had to just have someone drop me off and pick me up.  The best thing to deal with this is to park in Crossroads Mall and have the college's shuttles pick you up.
College Freshman,1,You pay almost 200dollars for a parking pass and your still not guarenteed a parking spot! Your best bet is parking by Elmwood park or at Crossroads mall and taking the bus to school.
College Junior,1,"Outrageous and Unreasonable – There are hardly ever any open spots.  I am an adult student with a family but I still arrive at least an hour before my classes begin just so that I can TRY to get a parking spot.  The cost of a parking permit is outrageous and unreasonable, especially for a student in my position with a family to support. I can by a night student parking permit which is SLIGHTLY cheaper, but when taking summer classes it severely limits me- because you can  get a 75.00 ticket if you park on-campus before 12:30 p.m.  There are paid parking lots- BUT- again... no paid parking before 12:30 p.m is allowed.  For crying out LOUD?!!!!! I'm considering taking my chances and parking 1/2 mile away at Elmwood park... but I'll still have to come early because those spaces fill up fast also. So I'll still have to plan to try and get there an hour before my first class starts.  Very disapointing.  I may stick with on-line classes in the fall because this is very ridiculous."
College Junior,1,A Mess – You pay about $200 and you may not be able to find a single space all year. Best bet is not buying a parking pass and park at Crossroads. 10-15 mins extra time but worth it.
College Sophomore,1,"Don't come here if you want a real college experience – I have lived in Omaha my whole life. I went to the biggest high school before coming to UNO. I lived in University Village my first year. My roommates were horrible. Two moved out at semester. No one talked or even made any sort of friendship. No one in the whole housing community was friendly. Everyone just went from class to their dorms and didn't come out. 
If you are coming here looking to make friends like I was, don't bother. I have yet to meet a single person from a class or anything. Everyone keeps their headphones in or just stairs at their phones while walking to class and waiting for class to start. 
School wise the professors are very good. I have had many classes I've really liked, especially in the arts and english departments. It's super easy, I have yet to have a final. I barely have any homework and most of my classes don't ever have tests. 
Socially, this school is failing. I came to this school alone although I knew of lots of people from high school coming to UNO, I never saw them and most of my other friends went out of state. I hate it there and I have been verbally bullied on campus, which is something I never thought would happen, super immature people. 
I'm transferring out of state in fall and I do not recommend this school to anyone unless you simply just want to go to class and go home and get an easy degree. "
College Student,1,"On Campus Living – On campus living is a joke. There are five different dorms on campus. But students go into their dorms and never come out after classes are over. Campus is it's own island in the middle of a big city. No greek houses or restaurants or bars are on campus. You have to leave campus to do anything fun. No one goes to sports events other than our D-1 hockey team which is played in downtown Omaha. We do have a really awesome gym facility in HPER. But a big thing is that I am Greek, and there are only two fraternities with houses. They are located 20-30 blocks away, and no sororities have houses. Everyone just goes to school and comes home. Don't expect to see many people hanging out around campus after 3 o'clock."
College Sophomore,1,"There is very little parking at UNO, and the little parking that is available is expensive. Although it is expensive it is totally worth the money, because parking off campus is never guaranteed and sometimes does not happen, and parking on campus can only be done in the morning or with extreme luck."
College Sophomore,1,"Dry Campus – The University of Nebraska at Omaha has very little housing to begin with because it is mostly a commuter school. In the housing that is available there is no drinking allowed and the University considers itself a ""dry campus"". Students that come to UNO are there to study and get there degree, if you want to go to college to party yo go to UNL. Campus Security is very tight almost to the point of harassment, and you can expect to get suspicious looks or even a bag check from security if you are walking on campus during the weekends."
College Sophomore,1,"Sports Are Ignored – Sports at UNO are ignored by a majority of the students. Football games have low attendance and most people have no idea how the teams are doing or even who they will be playing against in the next game. Despite the actual University sports, the brand new Health Physical Education and Recreation (HPER) facility is very busy. The access to a variety of different forms of exercise including a rock climbing wall, Olympic sized swimming pool, and two full sized weight rooms have drawn students to be more physically active."
College Junior,1,"On Campus Parking is very limited and you're not guaranteed a spot and the construction around campus just makes it harder. I've never bought a parking pass because they are a waste of money, instead UNO does allow students to park at the Crossroads mall parking garage and take a shuttle over to campus."

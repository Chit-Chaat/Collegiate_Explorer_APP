Junior,5,This is my first summer at pacific oaks college and I have to say that the enrollment counselors are awesome they make sure that you are on top of all classes and any documents that you need to turn in. they also call to check in with you.

Graduate Student,5,Great overall experience where academia meets real-life experiences. Professors are knowledgeable and work with students
Junior,5,What I like about Pacific Oaks is when you need help the Professors are very helpful and it is Diversity college.  Each student is taught to respect each other's  opinion  and can give there own opinion on a subject.  You learn from each other this way even through you might not agree with each other.  All the staff is also very helpful and want to see you  succeed  in all you do.
Senior,5,What I like about Pacific Oaks College is the friendly environment. Everyone there is willing to help and assist. They make me feel appreciated. I also enjoy not having to wait for an add date because my advisor adds my classes for me. This was always an issue for me because my add date was usually late and by the time I went to add the courses I needed it was full. Pacific Oaks is guiding me throughout my process of completing my degree in human development. The professors are well educated and I have learned from every single one of them. I am very satisfied with Pacific Oaks College.
Freshman,5,"I originally was trying to get into another online school. Honestly, I had gotten discouraged because no one wanted to help me. After talking to Martha at Pacific Oaks, she has made my enrollment so easy and comforting. So switching to Pacific Oaks was the best decision I could have made. This school has been awesome!!"
Graduate Student,5,"The professors are knowledgeable, and engaging . The relational approach truly preparapres you for your intern."
Graduate Student,5,"I’m a new student at Pacific Oaks and will start my classes in January, 2019. So far my experience with the staff has been amazing. They have been very helpful from my first interaction until the last second. I kept getting calls and txt messages to ensure I’m clear on all instructions and if I needed assistance they were ready to help. I hope once I start my academic year I will continue with this positive experience."
Junior,5,Admissions process was very streamlined and supportive. Diverse staff and student body with an emphasis on social justice and progressive thinking. Great online programs and the only school you can do both a bachelors and teaching credential at the same time.
Senior,5,"Pacific Oaks has been a place that is filled with nurturing and encouragement right from the start. Everyone wants to see you succeed and is always there when you need a guiding hand. There are so many resources that are provided to ensure that all students feel equipped as well as empowered to grow and learn. This is how all schools should be, place that allows others to be open and engage with open learning and dialog. It’s beautiful, being a part of a community that helps set you up with all that you might possible need to succeed. I would say 100% that anyone going into the education filed should check this school out."

Junior,5,"The college has online and ground classes making is very easy for working adults. Also, there is a helpful atmosphere rather than competitive. Something that cant happen in a larger school. I am enjoying my time at Pacific Oaks and feel the classes are preparing me to be competent in the field of my choice."

Junior,5,I started Pacific Oaks in 2015. I love the classes and the professors are very good at what they do. I have had some technical problems with my laptop and was always able to communicate with the professors and get assignments done.  This is the college for me.

College Junior,5,I have always felt safe at Pacific Oaks College. The security guards are always present and making contact with every person who walks through the campus' doors. I also love the badges that all students and faculty have to wear and scan in order to get into offices and classrooms. These procedures make me feel safe on campus.
College Junior,5,"This school is so valuable to each individual in helping them to find their calling and their authentic self. There is such a great emphasis on self reflection that it forces you to look inwardly and evaluate your life. This is such a wonderful component of the education you receive because we can not effectively help others until we help ourselves to become healthy and whole persons. I cannot say enough great things about this wonderful school, you must experience it for yourself!"
College Junior,5,Pacific Oaks College is a wonderfully authentic school. Everything that they do at the school is intentional. They have fully embraced the constructivists theory of learning and apply it in every classroom setting. I am so excited to begin writing and exploring my thesis in this wonderful academic environment.
Freshman,5,"I start Pacific Oaks in the Fall of 2016. So far my experience has been good. Everyone I have talked to has been very friendly and helpful. The one thing I would change is the fact that when I was applying, my advisor, or the person helping me fill out the application told me that I would be eligible for grants and other financial aid. I feel like that was a decoy because I am not. I still don't know how I'm going to pay for it."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone has been very helpful and welcoming so far.
College Senior,5,"Pacific Oaks Pasadena is a unique school, which provides an diversify atmosphere. I've been able to thrive in this environment, the support that is given by teacher and other staff members has helped me to achieve my educational goals.  I came to pacific oaks not as a strong writer, however the writing lab has provided the tools I need to prosper."
College Junior,5,We have security for protection and no concerns yet.
College Junior,5,"Pacific Oaks has a very easy process getting into the program. I applied online had contact with the admission counselor about 24 hours later and discuss areas I was interested in. Met with the admissions set deadlines for the documents needed to apply. Process was very easy and admissions counselor is always there to assit. When applying make sure to ask questions regarding financial aid, cohort, length of classes, teaching styles, and time frame of programs."
College Junior,5,"Pacific Oaks is a diverse college that accepts everyone no matter roce, ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation."

College Sophomore,5,"very different people , everyone I've incopuntered  has been pleasent , with the excaption of Prof. Jalanda Davis"
College Senior,5,Pasadena is a lovely city. Lots of activities for families with children. Night life is okay but not like it use to be.
College Sophomore,5,Pacific Oaks is a commuter school mainly located in 2 buildings if you take on ground classes. I have never seen drugs and have not met people who talk about drugs or doing them. I'm sure one could get creative if using drugs is a priority but it will be hard to go undetected unless one is using something without a smell or strange side effects. I feel safe on campus. I am not sure what the surrounding area is like about drug use though.
College Freshman,5,"As I stated in the previous question, Pacific Oaks is a beautiful campus.  The campus itself is set up for a positive learning experience.  Since the school caters to working professionals, there are plenty of services provided on the weekends.  There is a great student lounge with community coffee, clean couches, microwaves and a refrigerator.  Students are encourage to ""fill their tank"" in a nurturing manner."
College Freshman,5,"The facilities are really beautiful.  There is a lot of greenery and cute patio furniture outside.  There is also a cute place for smokers.
The school itself is based on the Quaker Philosphy of experiental learning.  This philosophy and the use of it at Pacific Oaks is quite effective."
College Freshman,5,Pacific Oaks is not at all a party school.  It is a school for working professionals.  The atmosphere of the school and classes is very fun and inviting.
College Senior,5,"The workload averages about 28 hours per week per class but most of this is reading and writing. The required reading is excellent and most books are very easy to find used, very cheaply. Most writing assignments focus on personal experience as related to the topic, so are very pertinent."
Graduate Student,4,"If you are looking into learning ciriculum coupled with a focus on diversity this is the place for you. I went from hearing very one sided conversations during undergrad at another university, to hearing how experiences vary for those of different backgrounds,"
Senior,4,"I'm in my last year of PO. I am not at the actual campus. Iam part of one of their coharts in San Diego. For the most part I've had a positive experience but there have been some bumps in the road. A lot has has to do with communication. Since we are so far from the actual campus, we don't get at time the same support."
Senior,4,"I like the classes based in an anti-bias approach to education. The courses online are fast paced and I feel that they are challenging but not to hard. There is often times difficulty in communicating with staff, often times it is a long time before anyone returns your calls or emails."
Senior,4,Studying at Pacific Oaks has giving me the opportunity to pursue my education goals while still being able to work. The online courses are fast pace but the support that is giving from the professors allows me to do my best on each of my courses.
Freshman,4,I will starting this school in the spring 2018. I will see for the first time how the campus and professor are and I hope I get the academics I need
Junior,4,I really enjoyed the environment and the students at Pacific Oaks. You feel welcomed and a part of something great. One thing I do wish to change is a little more communication from the departments.
Junior,4,The staff is very helpful and friendly. They answered all my enrollment questions and whenever I had doubts they eased my stress.
Graduate Student,4,The quality of the content and teaching is outstanding.  The clarity of the paperwork stream on the administration end needs improving.
Senior,4,I am Involved in a Cohort in the San Diego area. This Cohort was the first opened and so we sometimes had some issues with communication but everything got solved and they have done a great job.
Junior,4,This is a fast paced energetic college. Sharing is caring here and because if this a lot is learned and shared.  The experience has improved my life and teaching skills tremendously.
Senior,4,"I just started as a transfer student in Human Development for Fall 2016.  So far I'm loving the professors and the course curriculum.   It's a very comfortable environment, and the other students are so much fun.   This is a college based on experiential learning and regularly sharing in a roundtable style of classroom.   This is something that works best for me as an older adult student.  "
College Junior,4,There are a few things I don't like but the overall experience cancels out those few negative experiences. We are all dedicated and extremely focused on our education. Partying is not a priority and the only drug is used on campus are pain killers to help manage severe pain( prescribed and monitored by specialist- doctors).
College Junior,4,"Very Clean Campus, friendly staff and peers,I have had only a couple of negative experiences with this college in my first semester school. They accommodated me with my disabilities."

Sophomore,2,"I had a great experience in the beginning when they sugar-coated how the school was great during the open house. Once, I registered and got into class, that was the downfall of staff leaving (San Jose Campus, the original staff who handle my paperwork did not communicate with the new staff on my enrollment. I was on campus but I moved to online due to personal reason but that took a while to do. My friend refer to this school and she had a great experience but for me, it is not the same."
College Junior,2,There is one yoga class offered a week on the entire campus.
College Senior,2,There is no Nightlife other than classes taken at night. No hanging out at this school.
College Junior,1,It's a school with no buildings of it's own
College Senior,1,The cohort program does not have transportation and for some one like me who cant drive its hard. I would not be able to do the bay area cohort if wasn't at mission college. There's only regular vta buss.
College Senior,1,"Please don't waste your time and attend POC, It is ripoff, their teachers are all under-educated, they grading system is very unfair, they won't give you more than ""C"" so you not have a better grad to go to other colleges so you are stuck with them if you want to continue your education. Their assignments are very hard for private school. Don't even consider for a second to go to this ripoff school."

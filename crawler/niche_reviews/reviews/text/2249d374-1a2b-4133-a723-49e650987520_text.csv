Freshman,5,I love the small feel of the college and the availability of any resource you can think you'll need.
Niche User,5,Both times I visited Transylvania I felt that I belonged there. The staff was warm and welcoming and the students working in the admissions office were kind and helpful.
Senior,5,"I love Transy. I think there are two reasons for this. First of all, having a small college experience was really important to me. I got to know all of my professors, personally. I didn't belong to any cliques, I got along with just about everyone. I'm going to graduate in a few months and I can walk away knowing I had a college experience that no one else from my high school did. Second, Lexington is one of the coolest cities in America and I love living there."
Niche User,5,"I loved Transylvania, I have visited many other campus's but as soon as I set foot onto this campus it immediately felt like home. They are building a new student center which is extremely exciting. Another factor I liked was the community aspect all the dorms face inward in this area called the back circle. The acceptance rates into law and medical school are very reassuring. The only other thing I would change was the admissions counselor meeting the one I met with was very unwilling to be upfront about scholarships and the opportunities given he just told me to wait for FAFSA. Other than that I completely fell in love with the school."
Niche User,5,I went on a visit to Transy and it was an amazing experience. I felt very welcomed and could tell if I choose to go here every one is close and it is like one big family. The dorms are very nice and the school is beautiful. everyone that I talk to that has gone here loves it and recommends it to me. I believe that if I go here I will have a very good time and will be very happy with the decision I have made.
Freshman,5,"From my limited experience with Transy so far, everyone there seems to be very friendly and welcoming, which is great for both new students and returning students!! Also I love the opportunities they provide for students, such as May Term, when students can travel and more."
Junior,5,I love being in a big town but still having the small class size. The professors are so involved with the students and support us outside of the classroom.
Sophomore,5,I love it here. The atmosphere of being in a big city but still feeling like you matter and have a purpose. All the one on one help from your professors really helps you understand the material better.
Freshman,5,"the campus and dorms are the most modern, clean and spacious I have ever seen. very updated and nice"
Junior,5,"Academically challenging. Small classes allow professors to help you when needed. No need to make an advanced appointment, professors always have time to assist students. Students care about each other and everyone is extremely nice and welcoming. Lexington is a beautiful city, architecture and history make this city very special. Fun campus and community events are always available. Transy is A+
Definitely will recommend this University."
Senior,5,"Transylvania is a fantastic school! Transy combines the best features of a college; a small, inclusive campus surrounded by a thriving city full of opportunities. You'll never be short on people who will care about you and your academic and professional success."
Sophomore,5,"I’ve loved my experience at Transy!! The professors are so helpful and care about your success! I’ve been challenged in ways that I wouldn’t at a large university. I know I’ll be prepared after graduation!! I love the location, especially for the food and the opportunities for internships within walking distance.

I do wish that the food options were a little better, but they’ve improved some over the last year!"
Senior,5,I have absolutely loved my time here at Transy! We have all new dorms and new technology in the academic buildings. The professors are great and I love having the small community campus feel in an urban setting. I get the best of both worlds here at Transy!
Alum,5,I loved everything about this school. It had great diversity as well as many options for campus clubs and activities. The courses are challenging but enjoyable. The teachers are some of the most passionate people.
Junior,5,"The professors truly care and invest their time and energies into students. I receive eager one-on-one assistance in academics, and socially, Transylvania's faculty, staff, and students are some of the best people I've ever met."
Senior,5,Transy has turned me into a prepared well-rounded student. I have loved getting to know all the great professors and making relationships and professional connections. I always felt that the school was inviting and a great place to get an education. I couldn't imagine going to school anywhere else.
Works Here,5,"Students here are incredible, hardworking, and intelligent. Transy will push you academically. Faculty and staff bend over backwards to meet the needs of students. Lex is an amazing city - great dining & entertainment in just a 5-10 min walk of campus. New dorms are top-notch. While you should be smart when in certain areas, Lex is still significantly safer than any city I've worked. I never hesitate to be on or around campus day or night."
Niche User,5,Have an excellent outreach and community involvement along with fantastic communication. Every one is very compassionate and sincerely cares about preparing you for a successful future
Alum,5,"Small classes, personalized learning experiences, and numerous opportunities to enrich your university experience."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love this university. Many classes are discussion-based, making them very engaging. Campus is small & it only takes about 5 minutes to walk to class from most dorms. Lexington is a wonderful place to be, although pretty unsafe, which leads me to say that the safety on campus could improve, but that will likely happen soon as a result of an attack that occurred earlier this year. Dining locations on campus currently have unusual hours & sometimes students find that they want food when dining locations are closed, but Lexington as a whole has several nearby restaurants students can order from with their own money. Also, many cheaper housing options were closed down for next year so students will live in the brand-new dorms, which makes it harder for students to find affordable housing. Overall, though, I'd recommend this university to anyone who wants to go to a smaller school and/or live in a bigger city, and especially to artists because Lexington is a very artistic city."
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed the close knit community at Transylvania University. The class sizes were incredibly small, which enhanced the overall learning experience. I felt that the size of the classes truly benefited the students and contributed to a stronger learning environment."
Junior,5,Transylvania University has been the small close knit community that I needed to help focus on my education. The professors really care about how you do and will go out of their way to help you in anything. 
College Sophomore,5,"Transylvania truly is my ""home away from home."" I've never felt such a belonging and pride before as I do being a student here. The significantly small campus community size makes it easy to feel connected to every other student and the location could not be more ideal. If you want to enjoy the city, walk three blocks downtown, but if you feel like cruising the countryside, you're only a five minute drive from the ""horse capital of the world"" and gorgeous farmland. Transy is a little taste from every dish, and you only grow more attached to it with time."
College Sophomore,5,"I love Greek life at Transy. There's almost a 100% garrote you get into the chapter you desire, and it's nothing like at big state schools, as in there's no hazing at all. Greeks and non-Greeks get along - it doesn't matter if you're apart of Greek life or not."
College Sophomore,5,"Class size is usually pretty small.  I'm taking two classes this winter with less than 10 students registered, and my largest class has 17, if I'm remembering correctly.  The further you get into your program, the smaller the classes get and the more individual attention you are able to receive.

Transy is great about giving AP/IB credit, and I was able to start out as a sophomore--I'm no graduating early, because of what I chose to study, but I get to register for classes and pick housing before many of my peers, which is great.

The professors are pretty great at what they do, and they all want their students to succeed.  They are very understanding of extenuating circumstances, and are typically very easy to get in contact with.

Transy runs on a credit system, not credit/hours.  Full-time is considered 3-4.75 credits, which is 3-4 classes, with room to tack on extracurricular music or athletic programs, or less rigorous independent-study courses.  This system makes it very easy to manage your workload. For example, I was in four classes, on the academic team, in a sorority, and worked two jobs (one on and one off campus) last semester.  And I still had time to have a social life and watch too much Netflix.

Some major programs are more popular than others, such as psych, anthropology, biology, and Spanish.  These areas are somewhat hard to register for, but overall, it usually isn't too hard to get into classes you want and need, especially after freshman year.  The first couple of semesters, just make sure to have a couple of back-ups in case that GE you wanted filled up.  After freshman year, it is also fairly simple to ask a professor for a course-pass, especially if you need the class, and you need it *this* semester to keep on track with your four-year plan."
College Sophomore,5,"So Greek life at Transy might overshadow the non-Greek life on campus, but everyone seems to get along. I came to campus not even knowing what Greek life was and now I am in a sorority and attend events for all Greek organizations on campus. This is a friendly campus and most organizations get along with minimal negative interactions. With Greek life across the country being torn apart I think Transylvania Greek life still shows what it was originally about with our high standards."
College Junior,5,"Professors expect a lot, but are great"
College Junior,5,Many that know of this school really value a degree over other schools
College Junior,5,Majority of people are Greek. Great organizations.
College Junior,5,It's a great academic school
College Freshman,5,"Classes are small, and professors care about your learning. A few less than stellar experiences, but overall my professors have been extremely knowledgeable, helpful, and willing to help you during office hours if any problems arise."
College Freshman,5,"Transylvania has an amazing Greek life. While the Greek organizations do throw fun parties, they are overall respected as more than the stereotypical frat guys/sorority girls, and are not seen as snobby. The Greek organizations vary quite a bit, so everyone can find a place they fit in, and those who are not interested are still accepted just the same. The members of the Greek Community at Transylvania are leaders on campus, in clubs and sports unrelated to their affiliation."
College Freshman,5,"I am learning so much already, even in such a short time. Transylvania is academically rigorous, but in a way that will prepare you for further learning and future careers. Also, there are enough fun events and parties going on on campus and in the nearby area to cut loose and relax after hard work and studying."
College Sophomore,5,The institution os very dedicated to the health and safety of its students.
College Sophomore,5,The school is very  focused on its academic integrity.
College Sophomore,5,The institution is very focused on its academic integrity.
College Junior,5,close relationships between professor and student
College Freshman,5,24-hour visitation is a beautiful thing
College Freshman,5,"Not too many drugs, but a lot of whiskey"
College Sophomore,5,I love our on campus dinning options! The food is great and there's always a good variety to choose from. The only thing I'd change is the some of the open times and make them stay open a little bit later. 
College Sophomore,5,Transylvania's academics never cease to impress me. I am constantly challenged without feeling over worked and I actually enjoy everything I am presented with. Transy also strives to make sure that I am fully involved with my education. My opinion matters and the professors are always willing to work with me so that I can attain my full potential and reach all of my goals
College Freshman,5,"Transylvania is located in downtown Lexington, which is near countless malls, restaurants, and clubs! It's truly an amazing town!"
College Freshman,5,"Drinking is common because our dorms are wet. But, you only will encounter the students who are above 21 drinking (completely legal.) All other types of drugs aren't common -- rarely seen!"
College Junior,5,There is so much variety and all within walking distance. They offer student discounts and are very unique. There are also chain restaurants if you prefer that but they are less likely to be within walking distance.
College Senior,5,"Nightlife at Transylvania has something for everyone.  There's a good bar scene within walking distance downtown for those over 21, and every weekend there are bigger parties on the fraternity halls that many people go to.  Weeknights are normally more low key but you'll always be able to find people to chill with if you don't have much going on school-wise.  people are Transy are much more social drinkers and if you don't drink you can still have fun on the fraternity halls just hanging with friends, There's normally dancing and games and free drinks in different rooms on the halls, and there are frequent themed parties to go to as well.  There are also many other activities available downtown and around town like great shopping, cheap movie theaters, ice skating, bowling, etc."
College Sophomore,5,"First-years can bring their cars to Transylvania, unlike at many other universities. A student parking pass is $30 a year. Parking is accessible and easy to get to. Nothing to complain about here!"
College Sophomore,5,"I am so so happy with the WRC program here! It has exceeded all of my expectations. I hope to work for a non-profit after graduation, doing communications and PR work maybe. Professors have been great helping me choose classes in and out of their department and even finding internships. And I know other students have had similar experiences!"
College Sophomore,5,"I could go on and on about academics at Transylvania. Professors are wonderful. They are super helpful with registration. The workload is writing intensive, but there are all kinds of resources available to help students."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm majoring in Writing, Rhetoric and Communication at Transylvania. Even though its a relatively new major, it is an AWESOME program.  Our faculty are wonderful and really take an interest in students, inside and outside the classroom. They work well with students in their department to make sure their schedules work out. Even though I'm only a sophomore, one of my professors heard about an internship he thought I'd like and set up an interview with them. All I had to do was show up, and now I have an amazing paid, for-credit internship downtown doing exactly what I want to be doing after graduation,"
College Sophomore,5,"Lexington has all kinds of options! Some in every price range. Lots within walking distance, too!"
College Junior,5,Financial aid is very easy to come by at Transy if you simply go to the Financial Aid office and let them know your situation. They are always very helpful and will even assist you in looking for outside scholarships.
College Sophomore,5,"Transy offers high quality education at an affordable price. The financial aid there is great, and makes the hefty price tag much more achievable. The class sizes are also amazing if you want a personalized experience. The average class size is under 20 people, I have never been in a class with more than 30 people (which is less than the AVERAGE class size at my high school), and I've even seen classes that had 5 students. The atmosphere is laid back and professors are very knowledgeable in their fields, as well as eager to help their students. Most students there are friendly and successful."
College Sophomore,5,"I Wouldn't Change a Thing! When I entered Transylvania University, I was dead-set on becoming a biology major, going to med school, and becoming a doctor. I took one biology class and didn't enjoy myself one bit. I had always been into art and history and decided to combine the two and take an art history class. I ended up loving what I was studying and the rest was history! I would have been completely miserable if I had stuck with biology. I would do it all over again if I had the chance and I wouldn't change a thing. I would really like to work at a museum as a curator. That would be my dream job, but if that doesn't work out I would like to work for a magazine. I have some concerns about my field. There aren't many openings and it's kind of hard to get your foot in the door."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Fun & a Great Education – The experiences I had at Transylvania were like nothing else I had in my life.  With almost everyone living on campus, there's always something going on.  Pretty much everyone gets along, and even if they don't the conflicts are very small.  I had an amazing time living in the dorms 3 years and one in the Rosenthal complex.  I wouldn't trade the times for anything in the world.  Although it is a prestigious institution, the University realizes that college is also a place to make connections that last all throughout your lives."
College Freshman,5,"Its Very Difficult – Transylvania is a private liberal arts school, so its major focus is on grades. the school also has the hardest physics program in the state"
College Freshman,5,"It Is Difficult – The workload is heavy, but the curriculum is designed to make everyone successful, especially out of college."
College Junior,5,The academics here are outstanding. Professors get to know students on a personal level and offer more help than any student could ever need. Classes are extremely interesting and great discussions in class is very common. With the small class sizes classes are more like long conversations in which the professor is doing most of the explaining. I havent had a class in which the teacher had anything less than a PhD in the subject.
College Junior,5,5 Minute Walk Across Campus – You can get just about anywhere within 5 minutes. Classes are a maximum of 7 minutes away and the furthest thing is a 10 minute walk to the soccer field.
College Freshman,5,"We Love Oneanother – From the President down to the student there is this bond that holds everyone together, 'Love'. I have never been more loved. The professors are wonderful."
College Sophomore,5,DPS Is Great. I have experienced no problems with our campus police and think they do a fabulous job making students feel safe.
Sophomore,4,"Transylvania University is the best liberal arts college in this area of the country. It has everything a student could want from a liberal arts college in the middle of a great city. The majority of small schools are in the middle of nowhere but Transy is in the heart of downtown Lexington, which allows students to walk to restaurants, events downtown, and even their jobs or internships. The student life at Transy is amazing with over fifty clubs and sports for students to get involved with. All of the professors show interest in their students and work with them to make sure they succeed. 90% of graduates are either enrolled in a graduate program or employed within six months of graduation. I have never felt unsafe while on campus because of the amazing department of public safety. The only downside is there is a lack of diversity on campus because of the stigmas associated with the school."
Sophomore,4,"The small atmosphere is very helpful when you want extra help in classes. All professors are willing to take all the extra time you need to help you succeed. There are also a lot of other facilities that make succeeding in the future easier. This school is also a good place to make friends, everyone is open and inviting and make adapting to a new city easier."
Alum,4,"Transylvania University may seem unremarkable, being a small liberal arts university in a minor city in Kentucky, but its academic faculty and extracurricular involvement scene more than made up for any doubts I had about it going in. For every paper I wrote and for many of my comments during class discussions, my professors always pushed me to articulate my own ideas with more precision and nuance while opening doors to other interpretations of class material. As for Transylvania’s extracurricular opportunities, joining the Beta Mu chapter of the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity helped mold me into not only a better man, but a better version of myself. Liberal arts universities are known for their emphasis on critical reading and writing. What I feel makes Transylvania stand out is that it teaches the importance of never being satisfied with oneself, of not being afraid to make new circles of friends and study unfamiliar worldviews. While imperfect, it changed me in the best way possible."
Junior,4,"I love Transylvania University. The classes are challenging, but it definitely pays off when you graduate. One thing I think they could work on is dining options; there aren't a ton. However, they are building a brand new campus center, so maybe this will improve. The Transy community is very unique as well. There are only about 1,200 students, so unlike larger schools, I never walk to class without seeing several of my friends. The campus is beautiful, both the academic side and the residential side (the campus is split down the middle by a road). In addition, the social aspect here is good as well. There are lots of people to talk to and it is easy to make friends."
Niche User,4,"Extremely friendly and attentive admissions team, cozy campus, traditional education feel; the perfect place to build lifelong relationships, both personal and professional."
Junior,4,I like the small community feel of Transylvania even though it is in a big city. The professors are great and they are willing to help you any time that you need it. You can really tell that all of the faculty and staff care about the students and this Transy community.
Junior,4,"Academically, Transy will teach you things that you probably wouldn't learn anywhere else. The social life is different, the population is about less than half of the population of my old high school. Overall, it is a very nice experience."
College Sophomore,4,"We have a great Greek community at Transy, holding some of our campus' greatest leaders within them. Greek life at Transy is also a majority of the reason many of the activities on our campus get passed and function."
College Sophomore,4,"Facilities are new, updated and kept in good condition."
College Sophomore,4,The Career Center does a great job helping students prepare for grad school and job interviews. Everyone I've talked to says the practice interview Transy provides is way harder than the actual interview. The 100 Doors Mentoring Program provides a great opportunity for students to connect with a Transy grad in their desired field and get help with internships and information about the field.
College Sophomore,4,So far I am pleased with my classes and professors. They are personable and make the classes engaging. I feel comfortable asking questions and approaching them if I need extra help.
College Sophomore,4,"I think the safety of Transy is pretty adequate. If anything such as a sexual assault were to happen, I'd assume the suspect to be under the influence. Transy is really small, so if a student were to commit anything, word would get around pretty quickly."
College Sophomore,4,I like living on campus. It helps keep me close to everything I need (dining and classes) and being on campus ensures that I don't miss out on anything happening on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I love how small Transy is. Having a smaller class size helps students feel more comfortable contributing to discussion, which plays a major role in their grade. It also ensure that the professors get to know their students on not only an academic eve, but also a personal level. The way a typical schedule works gives each student plenty of time to get all of their work done in a timely manner."
College Freshman,4,I really love this school. It's really small and you just get used to it. The on;y complaint is august term and FYS
College Sophomore,4,"Kentucky is a medical amnesty state, and Transy makes absolutely sure that students are aware it's better to call DPS and 911 than risk a friends health/life.  It has a good alcohol and narcotics education program that students complete during freshman year, and are periodically repeated, especially concerning students in Greek Life. I personally know some people who slipped up some in regards to alcohol and narcotics, and they were greatly helped by the understanding of both DPS and the administration."
College Sophomore,4,"When I tell people I go to Transy most people congratulate me as they see the University as a pretty prestigious one. However, once you are enrolled it does not seem THAT great. Don't get me wrong, I love the school, but there are a lot of things we can still improve on. Class size is just about perfect, as is the quality of most of the professors, but scheduling is a complete pain in the butt."
College Sophomore,4,"I honestly love Transy and would not change too many things about it. Any school I could possibly attend would be sure to have a few flaws, so I do not think I could have chosen better. Since the university is small it means I have gotten to know a majority of students and professors on campus. Lexington as a whole is a very sweet and welcoming place to live as well. The combination of people and location means that I have made this school my new home."
College Junior,4,"It's good, not the best. Definitely not bad."
College Freshman,4,"Great career center, very helpful. Connections with alumni network through 100 Doors Program."
College Freshman,4,"Transylvania has been actively recruiting sports players, improving our teams. Intramurals are relatively popular, and enjoyable for those who participate."
College Freshman,4,"Transylvania legitimately provides an amazing opportunity to learn in an intimate environment while living in a big city with innumerable chances to get involved, network, and immerse yourself in different cultures. The only downsides to Transy would be its lack of diversity and a nerve-wracking tuition fee."
College Freshman,4,I am very satisfied with my choice of Transylvania University. I'm sure If I applied more places then I would have had more options but I enjoy the classes I am taking and feel like I am learning a lot to prepare myself for a future career.
College Freshman,4,"I am not Greek but many of my friends, over half of Transy students are affiliated, Greek life has a big campus presence but non-Greeks aren't ostricized and Greeks and non-Greeks live in harmony."
College Freshman,4,"Transy is right in downtown Lexington so there are a lot of options that are within walking distance, but a lot of variety can be found by driving just 10 or 15 minutes. Lexington has a variety of nice, good, and unique dining establishments, also the University of Kentucky is very close by so Transy students aren't too far of a drive from a lot of dining options available to UK students."
College Freshman,4,"The administration works to give the students as much freedom as possible. TUSGA acts as a student advocate to have campus (residential and academic) be what the students want it to be as much as possible, but students also have plenty of access and avenues to address issues on their own or to create a campus that they are happy with. The administration works with the students, the campus is widely student run."
College Freshman,4,"Transy is working hard to improve housing, as a sophomore I will get to move into a brand new residence hall with 2 more new residence halls being built right now. Freshman housing isn't bad and that's the worse it can get on campus. The campus community is so strong because a large number of students live on campus all 4 years. First year is community style, which is like living on a hallway with a bunch of friends. As a sophmore you move into suite-style and you have a bathroom of your own, junior year is a choice between suite-style and campus apartments - this provides a hightened level of independence. As a senior you have the option to move off campus (some people do this with their close friends), however if you choose to live on campus seniors recieve the best lottery numbers so they can live wherever they want. Living on campus is an important part of the Transy experience, there are late night eating options, or food can be delivered late into the night because of Transylvania's location in downtown Lexington. There is easy access to numerous study spaces as well, and when it is warm people will set up hammocks or hang out on the lawns of the dorm buildings."
College Sophomore,4,"Long story short, I got more/better scholarships from Transy than anywhere. It was cheaper for me to go to school here, and the private Liberal Arts university of my dreams, than to go to a state school (UK)."
College Sophomore,4,"Transy's part scene is different than a lot of schools, especially because of the way our Greeks are housed. However, a lot of people (both Greek and independant) live off campus and some of the best parties are there. The halls are still fun, but with the upcoming demolition of Clay and Davis those will not really be an option anymore."
College Sophomore,4,"Currently (March 2015) campus housing as a whole is not top notch. However, one new dorm is being built currently, and another one to two new dorms will be built next year. So, while on campus housing is tight next year, overall quality of housing is improving exponentially."
College Freshman,4,There are many restaurants within walking distance but majority are a little fancy. You have multiple places to choose from for delivery. There are lots of places that are a little further than walking distance but still not far and they are great!
College Freshman,4,Greek life is huge on this campus. This university has one of the top percentages of Greek students in the country. Greek students are leaders on campus and hundreds of students join Greek organizations every year. Greek life provides lots of opportunities for its members. There is little animosity between the majority of Greek and non-Greek students. Plenty of students choose to not go Greek and still have a great presence on campus. Non-Greek students are still invited to almost all Greek-sponsored activities.
College Freshman,4,"Lexington is a fun and exciting city. There are tons of concerts, college games (notably the UK wildcats right down the road), restaurants, and local businesses and places to check out. Students love the variety of things to do on the weekends in Lexington. Overall, it's a pretty cool city. Traffic is terrible at almost all times of the day though. It takes way too long to drive anywhere in town."
College Freshman,4,"Professors at Transy really care a lot about their students and encourage students to come to their office hours if they need any help. Courses vary in difficulty, but you are almost guaranteed to come out of a class with some sort of long-lasting knowledge. Class sizes vary from ~5 students to <30. Most are somewhere in the middle with about 15-20 students. Many classes focus on discussions and want students to give input during lectures."
College Freshman,4,I am very happy the Administration sets strict rules on those who consume alcohol and or are under he influence of drugs.
College Freshman,4,I'm guessing a lot of the parties are great because I always see people throwing up and telling me how great the parties were. I personally do not attend any parties.
College Freshman,4,"I'm not involved, but I see it as very cliquey."
College Junior,4,difficult and challenging; good combination
College Junior,4,some really nice athletic facilities
College Freshman,4,Wi-fi can be sketchy sometimes
College Freshman,4,"Not super healthy, but hey: it's college"
College Freshman,4,A lot of people on campus are involved
College Senior,4,"Lexington is a medium sized city, which has a growing arts culture and established night life when the local colleges are in session. The University of KY central campus is located a few miles away, providing both entertainment in the form of sporting events and free access to its extensive libraries. The downtown center, only a few blocks away is clean and safe; however, it is not recommended that students walk the other direction at night."
College Senior,4,Transy has recently pushed to get more students from different backgrounds
College Junior,4,Everything for campus is within an easy walking distance. The only issue with cars is that the parking with larger incoming classes gets to be more of a hassle.
College Sophomore,4,"Given that Transylvania is located in downtown Lexington, there are a lot of nearby options, ranging from cheap to expensive. There are many quality and fast food places within walking distance, and many, many more just a short drive away. There are a few that offer Transy discounts- and I need to say, going to Shakespeare & Co. is a must."
College Freshman,4,"Although single dorms aren't available to incoming freshmen, the dorms are quite nice. They retain tradition and offer a decent amount of space!"
College Freshman,4,"There are a wide variety of Psychology offerings at Transylvania University, and the faculty in this department is great. However, because of the large number of psych majors, getting into the right classes is sometimes difficult."
College Freshman,4,"Lexington is a vibrant city. There are plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance of my school, and there are always plenty of events going on in the city."
College Freshman,4,It was very easy to be integrated into the Transy theater community. I met some professors for my scholarship interviews so they knew me before I came to Transy-- they had my resume of experience.
College Freshman,4,"I'm a theater major and I have numerous opportunities to learn and be a part of a show. I am a first year and already have Stage Managed, scenic painted, and acted. If you have a specific interest, the professors in the program do their best to help you do something to help you get experience in that field."
College Junior,4,There is parking and I'm not sure how much a permit cost because I live off campus and can walk or ride a bike to school.  when I drive I usually can find a spot on the street.
College Junior,4,I have never felt unsafe.  However right outside of campus is not a very good part of town
College Junior,4,"Just like any college campus, there are students who drink on campus. However, I have never felt any pressure to join in and there are always other things to do on campus or downtown that you never feel like that's what ""everyone's doing."" For those students who are 21, we are close to downtown and local bars and there is a trolley that picks up students a block over from campus."
College Junior,4,"Transy is right next to downtown, so there are a million restuarants where you can eat- they range from expensive to McDonald's so whatever the occasion, or your craving there's always something you can grab."
College Junior,4,"There are 4 dining options on campus- the cafeteria, which is buffet style-they have a salad bar, chesseburger/frie line, pizza line, deli line, country/home food line, and international line. There is also a cafe on campus, Jazzman's, with muffins, coffee, cookies, scones, breakfast and lunch sandwiches and the niceset 2 workers in the WORLD! (Erica and Marsha). The last 2 dining options are the Raf and the 80. The raf has burgers, fries, chicken tenders and all things fried and then a subway type line. The 80 is a late dining option only open from 7-12pm and serves pizzas and sandwiches, chips and ice cream. Overall the food isn't as good as my mom's but I always find something tasty to eat. :)"
College Junior,4,"I received a decent amount of financial aid and once on campus there a lot of extra scholarship/stipends for doing different jobs on campus, for example being a tour guide, overnight host, residentsal advisor (RA), or a campus center manager."
College Senior,4,"I love my major, I love my professors, I love the classes that have been available to me. I love the facilities.
Having said all of that, the theater department is in need of more funding, refurbished facilities, and greater support (though that goes for the Fine Arts in general). Having said that, the arts are a priority at Transylvania, as seen by the Admissions team devoted exclusively to assisting fine arts students."
College Senior,4,"Transy is directly on several of the bus routes- there's a bus stop on every corner of campus. The public transit is easy to use, pretty reliable, and cheap. Downtown is literally 3 blocks away, so walking is a very viable option. 
Students are allowed to have cars on-campus, even as first-years, and parking permits are easily obtainable and pretty affordable.
I have never had a car on campus, and I have had very little difficulty getting where I needed to be."
College Senior,4,"Greek life is HUGE on campus. And it's really well-rated- we're one of the top schools in the country for Greek life.
Speaking as an indie (independent), Greek life is a pretty big part of campus BUT it's not the only part. It's totally possible to be very involved on-campus and never even think about rushing. 
For the most part, Greeks and indies have a good relationship. Most don't care if you're Greek or not, and indies are welcome on the halls."
College Sophomore,2,"To put it bluntly: people do not attend Transy for the athletics. We are a D3 school, and most of the attention is focused on academics. I currently live with three student athletes and while they all love their individual sports, school comes first. We all go out and support the teams, but unless it is a rival game, there will not be very many people in attendance. I am part of the Crimson Crazies (the school spirit organization) and people do not even show up to those meetings let alone the actual games, which just goes to show spirit is at a minimum. The facilities are nice, but to be honest not many people actually care, athletes included."
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall is sad looking and the food matches that. On the weekend nights you can only eat at the Raf which is very unfair, unhealthy, and gets old really quick. The hours for the caf are very poor."
College Freshman,2,"The school is right in the middle of some scary neighborhoods. The surrounding neighborhoods are not safe, and they are not somewhere that most students would want to live. The close off-campus housing is not expensive, but the cost of your safety is pretty high. I live off-campus, but I live 15+ minutes away, in a much safer area."
College Freshman,2,Safety is always a con simply because the area surounding Transy is not very safe.
College Freshman,2,"if you stay in downtown Lexington, you'll be fine, but I wouldn't suggest venturing too far away from Broadway, there is a lot of gang related activity on the outskirts."
College Freshman,2,"There's a pretty wide variety of people, however because there are so few people who go to Transylvania, there aren't many of one type. Which could be both good and bad, it can be difficult finding a large group of people with similar interests, but it can be worth it."
College Freshman,2,"The Greek life doesn't do very much aside from parties, almost all of which are based on drinking alcohol and just getting drunk. They do a few good things around campus, such as fundraisers and such. If you aren't in one, it isn't really a big deal because they aren't that prominent on campus."
College Freshman,2,I am actually very fond of the dorms and the lifestyle within them. I like how there is a community that you know you can get along with and talk to. The rooms are small and aren't in the best of shape and the bathrooms are pretty messy. There is one extreme problem with mold that will be getting fixed this summer hopefully.
College Freshman,2,"Living Off Campus Is Cheap – Its cheaper to stay off campus but when you do, you get cut off from the school's social life. i think staying on campus is the best."
College Junior,2,"There usually is not a lot of diversity at Transy but under new administration, new diversity policies and ideas are being discussed and more diverse students are being encouraged to come to TU."
College Junior,2,Financial aid is very easy to get but it is almost impossible to increase after freshman year even with highly improved grades. It seems unfair that several scholarships have the same GPA requirement even though their values differs several thousand dollars.
Freshman,1,This is not the place where I feel like I'm at home. I didn't like the feeling I had on campus and it was harder to be myself where I didn't fit in. Academically I didn't do as well and only two of my classes counted toward my gpa.
Niche User,1,"Accepting DACA students but allowing others to rally around and bully them in light of DACA being taken away? This university is garbage. If they can't stand up for their own students when they are preyed upon by other racist, hateful individuals, what kind of learning institute is this?"
College Freshman,1,"Transy gets 10 students from China and goes wild about it, never forgetting to mention it in any formal event. Really there is not a lot of true diversity. People are mostly from Kentucky, mostly white, mostly upper middle class or middle class. I haven't met anyone that's really interesting, people seem scared to be themselves or do something that people would think odd. This is understandable, possibly due to our small campus size, as rumors spread quickly as well as generalizations and prejudices. Though, recently they opened up a new department for ""diversity and inclusion,"" it aims at superficial means of obtaining diversity. If Transy really wanted diversity maybe they should assess essays on one's own experiences that make them individuals with their own developed thoughts that did not ask questions about race, gender, sexual orientation, religion. "
College Freshman,1,Everyone at Transy who isn't part of Greek life hates the Greeks. And every greek hates the Indy's. It's one big cycle of hate. Even within the greek community they all hate each other. Most KA's hate even their own KA's...Don't come here.
College Freshman,1,"Transy may have athletics, but they are in reality just a bunch of N.A.R.P.'s who think they are way better than life, or better than they really are at their sport. The soccer team is pretty good, the baseball team always sucks as well as the basketball team. No school spirit. Don't come here."

Freshman,5,"Briar Cliff is great.  Nice community, great professors. Great sports teams.  I feel like I'm at home when I'm at Briar Cliff."
Senior,5,Briar Cliff University is a Catholic Franciscan Liberal Arts University. I am currently a senior and have enjoyed the past four years at Briar Cliff from their performing art and diverse population and opportunities to their religious ceremonies. Briar Cliff students truly share all these variety of experiences with each other.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Briar Cliff has been nothing short of amazing, the professors have been extremely helpful and considerate. Sports are a huge part of campus life and that helps create a sense of family and it's really easy to connect with the student body."
Niche User,5,There is no changes needed to be made. I think this is a great college. I will be interested in the college.
Sophomore,5,I like the small college atmosphere. Feels like home. I would like to see improvements on the dorms and food service.
Niche User,5,"Briar Cliff is very welcoming. When I applied, they made the process stress-free and very easy. I will be attending Fall 2018."
Sophomore,5,"I have been at Briar Cliff University for just over a year and a half now. So far, it has been a fantastic experience for me. The best part about BC is the community you become apart of and the friends you make. I have been blessed with some amazing people in my life including: coaches, friends, professors, and teammates. If I had to choose a college again, I would go to Briar Cliff every time. There will be some things every university or college can improve upon, but I do not have much to complain about here. The most complained about things would be the athletic facilities and cafeteria food. I think they are adequate enough; however, it can be tough to get some recruits because rivaling schools have nicer facilities and equipment than we do here."
Niche User,5,"Briar Cliff is an amazing university that helps the student grow mentally, spiritually, and physically. It is a gorgeous campus and the students and faculty are extremely kind. Everyone there is very welcoming to any new faces they see and they make you feel at home."
Junior,5,Briar Cliff University has truly been my home away from home. The small classes really allow me to have a connection with my professors. The social work faculty is amazing! They will always take the time to get to know you and will take into consideration what is going on your day-to-day life. The professors have a great understanding over the material they teach and are well equipped to explain the material. There is a great diversity on campus and the majority of students are kind and friendly. I have switched from attending classes on campus to online and I am still receiving a great education.
College Freshman,5,"The programs at Briar Cliff University are accredited in the country by different bodies, also there is a high percentage of graduates who get jobs in their fields."
College Freshman,5,"Our school has a nurse and a nurse practitioner who care much about the students. Also, the security department works effectively."
College Freshman,5,"Briar Cliff University has the best athletics department where everybody puts his own effort to reach success. The athletes work hard every day, they have planned training times, have gym training using the school facilities and take their meals together. The performance of the teams is excellent. The department of athletics releases at every start of the year the sports schedule, our teams are M/W soccer, M/W volleyball, M/W golf, football, M cross country, M/W basketball, softball. We have also a fan club, where any fan can sign up to support our Chargers. The Briar Cliff University promotes greatly athletic activities."
College Sophomore,5,Can't wait to get started
College Sophomore,5,Love going to bcu football games
College Junior,5,As freshman you are provided with an iPad and there are quite a few computers available around campus.  I have never had an issue getting a computer.
College Junior,5,"The main thing to remember is deadlines, but there are so many financial aid options at my university that getting assistance was easy."
College Junior,5,There are no concerns about finding a job after graduation.  I also plan on continuing for my CRNA degree. If I had to choose it all over again I would make the same decision.
College Junior,5,They hold you to the honor code because they say the only thing you have is your word.  They want students who are serious about their career and future.
College Junior,5,Campus buildings are locked at a specific time and you need your student I'd to enter.  The crime rate is very low on campus.  Healthcare services are extremely convenient and helpful.  They are free and help avoid unnecessary trips to the doctor.
College Junior,5,"The clinical hours are very beneficial and have a huge advantage because when you go for jobs, the places you have been at know your working ethic and style.  The curriculum is challenging and rewarding because they are preparing you for your career."
Junior,4,I took classes online at the end of the semester and one class online throughout the year. I thought they navigated well and did a good job.
Freshman,4,"I came to Briar Cliff as a transfer from big college in another state during spring semester of my freshman year. My overall experience has been alright since professors are really here to help you academically to maintain a high GPA. Athletics are not the best nor the coaches and facilities, however, large portions of students here are athletes. Diversity here is really great since I have many friends that are literary from everywhere around the world including myself."
Sophomore,4,"Briar Cliff is a very  nice place in Sioux City, Iowa. There is so many things to do on and off campus. There is a wide variety of athletics that students can attend. We have floor events, where each floor can decide what they want to like going to see a movie or going bowling."
Alum,4,I loved the academics and professors at BCU. They really care about their students and do whatever they can to help you succeed.
Freshman,4,"There are many different choices as to why the university you want is the best for you but at Briar Cliff University, we offer many different aspects of the best university experience. You get to experience what you are interested in majoring along with learning the values of being a Franciscan. Briar Cliff also offers many clubs for students to get involved in including Women/Men of Color, Spanish Club, Art Club and many more. While getting involved in clubs you get to meet new friends. At the end of the four years, your are just not leaving with your degree but with new friends that you made along the way, a college experience, and new life skills that will help you all throughout your future career."
Junior,4,"I came to Briar Cliff as a single mother of two very young children. I remember feeling lost, without passion, without purpose, and weighed down by a history of addiction and domestic abuse. After three years, I have not only found my passion and purpose for life but have also discovered strength within myself that I had never experienced before. The professors, advisors, and students have guided me to success in my academic and career path while teaching me about life and everything that encompasses it. Beliefs, opinions, traditions, and cultures are expressed by students and faculty in a respectful and inspirational way, embracing everyone who comes on campus. Also, the campus is beautiful and shows off the hard work done by both faculty and the students."
Junior,4,"As a non-traditional, online student, Briar Cliff and my advisors have been extremely helpful in creating a path for my degree while taking into account that I am a Mom and work a full-time job. Briar Cliff is making it easy to feel comfortable and confident about returning to school."
Freshman,4,"My overall experience here was good. The academics, professors and staff really are here to help you. A bonus is that a large portion of the student population is athletes, so academics are very understanding and blend well if you stay on top of things. If you are looking for somewhere small to make close friends and benefit from a smaller class size, this is the place for you!"
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the small campus that briar Cliff provides. I also enjoy the people on the campus. Everyone here is so nice and welcoming. On the other hand, the food is not the best. But over all I really like being a part of BCU. Go Chargers!"
Freshman,4,The community of Briar Cliff University is astounding. People are very friendly and professors will help you with anything.
Junior,4,"Great, Great Community Feeling. The professors love to help you one on one. It is easy to get a hold of your professors out of class. You can speak to your professors on a personal level. The athletic events are always a good time."
Sophomore,4,"The application process was very easy, staff was very welcoming.  However, although they do know somewhat about the military and it’s funding for tuition assistance, they are not too military friendly with that part.  The do the GI bill but for the TA military gets per fiscal year is a different story with help to get the information in time. Army requires at least 2 months in advance for paperwork, they prepare it 2 weeks before school.  Other than that registering for classes and help with financial aide was easy.  Teachers there also emphasize asking them for help if you don’t quite understand the subject that you are learning."
Senior,4,"The teachers invest a lot in their students. They want their students to succeed in whatever field they choose. They are always willing to sit and discuss schoolwork and help you figure out your future. The rest of campus isn't so great. Well, the campus is nice, everything is located on one hill so there is no commute, but the dorms could be better kept, the food is nothing to write home about, and students are severely overcharged for what they get. Once again, the teachers and campus are amazing. If only the rest of the school followed that lead."
College Freshman,4,Courses are well given and professors help very much the students by providing all the required and necessary resources.
College Freshman,4,"At Briar Cliff University, Greek life helps new students to feel at home and help to develop someone's leadership skills."
College Freshman,4,"My school is unique because it has a great caring community, and I appreciated the way professors give advice to students in all their works. At my school, we have got new modern laboratories, a very good thing. We have much time to practice what we have learnt in classes. There are every week assignments and many exams, therefore I am sure that I will have a higher score, why not A's? Everything is possible."
College Sophomore,4,This my first year ..so ask me later
College Freshman,4,The professors are very helpful when you need help.
College Freshman,4,We are required to take short video courses on Health & Safety.
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at my school are a big part of student life because everyone gets together to go the games. Also I am a cheerleader and I have met some of my best friends during sports. Whenever we get bored on campus, we get a group together and go play sand volleyball or play a game of flag football."
College Freshman,4,It is different from big schools because the professors get to know you personally and I know everyone at the school.
College Sophomore,4,I feel very safe but do wish halls were cleaner
College Sophomore,4,Socially accepting and small individualized school homely
College Sophomore,4,Allow us to go to the local ymca helps a lot with resources
College Sophomore,4,"I thought I wasn't going to easily make friends and that I wouldn't be able to be as involved in activities at BCU like I was in HighSchool. With the dissolution of the theatre program, I don't have as much fun with extra curriculars, but writing club and honors and just little events the school holds are a good way to get students like me out there."
Recent Alumnus,4,I enjoy the convenience of online classes.  I am able to get help when needed.  Very flexible with my busy schedule.
College Freshman,4,Don't be afraid to ask questions.
College Student,4,athletics are big it lets the students let off some steam but the school looks at the classes are more important than the sports. Everything is new and upto date as far as the athletics goes and there are lots of opportunities for competing and having a good time.  The school as a good handle on whats important and know how to distinguish that to the students
College Student,4,the housing around campus is just like anywhere else.  The prices are not extremely high when you think of what you pay to live on campus compared to off campus it is about the same price or a little cheaper.  The landlords are like anywhere else you have the good ones and the ones that dont care as long as you are giving them money.  shopping and dining out is a walk away and to get any where in town it can take 10 minutes driving.
College Student,4,The campus is built on a hill so in the winter the students and families can go sleding.  When it isnt snowing but cold all the classes are inside and in one area so you dont have to so too much walking out doors and freeze. The town the college is in isnt small but not too large either there is plenty of things to do and see.
College Senior,4,There are many internship options you just have to be willing to look for one.
College Senior,4,My program is great. The advisors are always willing to answer questions and help you with career advice.
College Senior,4,The advisors are great and are willing to help you with any questions or concerns that you have!
College Sophomore,4,They use to have a IPAD program but not anymore
College Junior,4,"Here in Iowa we have a very cold winter,  however I am from this area so I am used to it.  Briar Cliff has all buildings within close range of each other so you are not outside very long getting to and from the student center or dorms to class.  "
College Junior,4,The professors at my school are very dedicated and care about your learning experience.  The have genuine feelings about the lives of each of their students and are willing to do what it takes to help you succeed.  Each class has its own lesson and sometimes you don't realize the lesson until the end but you always figure it out.  They allow you the ability to figure it out on your own.  
College Freshman,4,Just caught up with the world.
College Senior,4,Always Avaiable to Assist – The classes are small at Briar Cliff so if you ever have a question the professor is always avaiable to help.
College Junior,4,"I originally came to Briar Cliff University for the athletics, however, I stay for the English Department. I love all of my professors. They teach me about different areas of literature that really matter: women's studies, minority authors, and environmental literature. Registering for classes is super easy with your adviser, especially when you're an upperclassman. You get first pick that way. The newly-built atrium in Heelan Hall is a great place for anyone to study at all hours of the day or night."
College Freshman,4,The diversity on Campus varies from all over. Its a great envorinment and everyone on the campus is very open. There are a couple people who judge here and there but then again what campus doesnt.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on the campus of my school. It is small and pretty down to earth. They keep the doors locked at night and you have to have a certain key to get into your hall. Campus security likes tor uin the fun at times but sometimes they can pretty down to earth.
College Freshman,4,There is great technology here. When you first arrive you receive an iPad and the teachers are always using them in the classes. There is wifi all over the campus that is free for us to use.
College Sophomore,4,It is your typical iowa weather.  snowy in the winter and sunny and hot in the summer. But i am an iowan so i am used to it.
College Sophomore,4,"there is plenty of parking and if you dont have a car the bus goes right through campus.  Sometimes if you leave during the day it might be difficult to find a spot, but i have always found one."
College Sophomore,4,I have had plenty of help from the financial aid office in paying for school.  Email reminders are also sent out when there are new scholarships to apply for on the Library webpage.
College Junior,4,"Briar Cliff is excellent about providing scholarships and financial aid. Sometimes you may have to pull a few strings with the financial aid office because they will sometimes miss a few things that will lead to a better financial aid package. Overall, however, the scholarships and financial aid are very reasonable."
College Junior,4,"The Tyson Events Center ten minutes from campus has all of the best national concert tours. Nearby the Orpheum Theater also is host to local and national attractions, including Broadway plays and musicals and is also the home to the Sioux City Symphony Orchestra, a professional ensemble of the highest caliber. Sioux City is in a time of economical expansion, so new stores are constantly arriving in and around town. Briar Cliff students are highly respected throughout the community for their service both on and off campus."
College Freshman,4,I was happy that briar cliff had my major in engineering because it made it possible for me to wrestle and go to school for what I wanted to be. All the teachers I have have been easy to contact and helpful when it comes to class. It is nice having smaller classes because you get more of teachers assistance.
College Sophomore,4,Students on the dorm are mostly respectful of quiet hours with a few exceptions. If they do party it is still quiet. There are plenty of houses to party off campus with plenty of bars also.
College Junior,4,"Franscican Way of Life – Briar Cliff University separates itself from all other institutes with its mission statement and ideals it wishes to set into all of its students, faculty, and workers. This University brings the teachings of St. Francis into almost all of its courses in some way or another. This college influences its students to give back to the community in many ways and presents many opportunities to do so."
College Sophomore,4,Big City to Sioux City – Most of Briar Cliffs students come from California or big city areas and don't know much about a smaller town such as Sioux City but the boys are very good looking and very athletic. Briar Cliff is mostly filled with tall people who are tan and very good looking who wear designer clothes. Them not being from a city such as Sioux City gives people like me a good chance to connect with them since they will talk to anyone who is around.
College Junior,4,"The dining hall served a lot of vegetarian food on campus last semester for the 8 vegetarians we actually have on campus. Personally, I thought this was ridculous. They could serve vegetarian food, but not as a main dish, and if they do they should make it lasagna... not tofu. Other than that the dining hall does a pretty great job!"
College Sophomore,4,Student Teaching – The school will help me find a student teaching position.
College Sophomore,4,Fast Food – A lot of the off-campus dining consists of fast food restaurants. It is an easy and convenient way to get late night snacks but it would be nice to have more sit-down restaurants closer.
College Sophomore,4,Lots to Choose from – The cafe has a large selection of food that rotates regularly to try and avoid repetitviness. But there is also a coffee shop located in the library that also has snacks for between classes. Whenever the cafe is closed you won't starve because thats when the Fire Pit opens. Most students perfer to eat there since they will grill up what you want right there.
College Sophomore,4,"Always Something Going on – The school always has posters of activities for the week so that you can always have something to do. These activities aren't always limited to being on campus. There are times when there is free ice skating, bowling and sledding. You can also sign up for trips to the Omaha Zoo, the ski/snowboarding trip or volunteer for habitat for humanity.The school does a great job in ensuring that students don't get bored at the school."
College Freshman,4,"Atmospheric Wonderland – Briar Cliff University is in the downtown area of Sioux City, IA which is great for college students that do not have access to cars and provide a bus every hour for transportation. There are also maps and directions on how to get to the mall and other shopping stores as well as grocery stores. Briar Cliff University also provides many advertisements for community events such as concerts, ice skating, and movies. Students are also provided many on campus activities such as movies and sport activities. These activities give the students a chance to become closer together. That is the best part of Briar Cliff University. As the students come together the university becomes a closer community."
College Junior,4,"Excellent School Spirit – Pride in the athletics is one of the first things you will notice when visiting campus. Everyone works together in community involvement, and the community morally supports the students."
College Sophomore,4,"Small Car! I personally drive a large SUV so some of the parking lots are literally too small for my car, but I still never have an issue finding a space"
College Sophomore,4,"Just About Everything – The main street of Sioux City has almost every kind of food and restaurant you love, and everything is affordable for the poor college kid. The only think is not many places stay open late, so the night time hot spot is La Juanita, known on the cliff as LaJua's. It has some of the best mexican food I've ever had for dirt cheap"
Senior,2,"Just go to Morningside. Briar Cliff University just wants your money. There are some extremely shady business practices going on, and any positive review seems to mostly either be from students that were prompted to fill this out, or students that have not been here a while. 
If you are like me and don't really care about nightlife or things to do (or I guess even if you do, the city is pretty dead) avoid Briar Cliff. I'll break this down for you so you can also avoid wasting time and money:
Drug use is rampant on campus, not just the occasional cloud of weed either. 
You will watch your friends go to uni and wonder if you made a mistake
Should you have questions or concerns, best of luck.
I'm pretty pleased to say that the professors overall are great! They seem a little dead in side but they're extremely accommodating and kind.
Also be extremely aware of your graduation requirements. They make tons of money on super seniors."
College Freshman,2,Sometimes the noise gets way out of hand on a school night.
College Freshman,2,45 minutes to the dome. Not a good record.
College Freshman,2,All people seem to want to do is party. Im there for a education.
College Freshman,2,People get away with a lot. except parking. They will write lots of parking tickets.
College Freshman,2,A lot of racial fighting.
College Freshman,2,Just not a good area.
College Freshman,2,"The food is not of high quality, as well as bad service. Once you recieve the food it generally tastes ok but i would expect better honestly."
College Sophomore,2,There are plenty of computer options with labs in every building of Briar Cliff University. Some are very crowded and while others remain empty. The computer labs are very hot and there are multiple broken computers that have remained unfixed since the beginning of the year. We do have wifi for people that have their own computers but goes in and out and is hard to Acxess in dorms.
College Junior,2,"The finacial aid department is my least favorite department on campus. They do help, but they are the least friendly buch of people on campus. i think thats saying more about the rest of the schools staff than it is about the department. sthey are helpful and relativly friendly. well they dont bite"
College Junior,2,"Comuter School? Accessability is not the word i would use to discribe Briar Cliff University. If you dont have a car the transportation to school is non-existant. As someone who does not have a car, not having the option to house off campus is unfortunate. The food services are required, and yes it is typical college cafeteria food. Briar Cliff is not a commuter firendly school by any means."
College Junior,2,A huge selection but for the price students could just as well go to Hyvee grocery store not even a mile away and get groceries for less then half the price.
Niche User,1,"Very unprofessional staff from the business side. You will get no answers, because no one knows what they are doing and they don't seem to care. It is very disappointing considering they are a private Catholic institution, I would expect so much more. The only thing that saves this university is the professors."

Sophomore,1,"Not what I expected.  The academics are poor, faculty missing in action, no resources and ridiculos experience.  I came to get an education and play volleyball, but I'm forced to choose one or the other."
Sophomore,1,This is not a good university.  The buildings are run down the equipment is broken and the faculty are not very good.  My parents pay for this or Id would go somewhere else.  I just hope graduating from here won't prevent me from getting into graduate school.
Junior,1,"Terrible.  A place to avoid.  I cannot believe this place claims to be a college.  I learned more in high school from teachers who weren’t miserable.  They want your money but can’t give you a reasonable place to live or eat.  And sports are a joke.  Every coach thinks they are so much better than anyone ever.  They expect us to work, work work and don’t seem to even realize we are supposed to be in college.  I’m not going pro."
College Senior,1,We do not have Greek Life.
College Senior,1,Weather in Iowa is always up and down. One day it will be 50 degrees and the next day it will be snowing.
College Freshman,1,There is no off campus parking and on campus is a joke
College Senior,1,Sioux City is not the ideal place to live for college students. There are various things to do if you're over 21 but that can cost quite a bit of money over time. BCU does offer activities on weekends but they are sporadic and not enough to keep students busy every weekend.
College Senior,1,There is security on campus and they are there when you call but if it were ever a serious issue I believe they would not arrive on time. The main concern I have is when I'm am coming back to campus at night and having to walk through the parking lot to get to my dorm. There are no cameras and that worries me. I do worry on a regular basis of someone breaking into my car. There is no way a camera in the parking lot is a privacy issue when it could possibly save something as expensive as a car or someone's life.
College Freshman,1,"The school is small but the majority is Caucasian, with a slight amount of minorities sprinkled in there."
College Freshman,1,All Non-Greeks – Briar Cliff does not provide any sororities or frats.
College Junior,1,I do not like living on campus there is no heat in the dorm rooms and its like you can not breath during the summer and spring time. Not to mention the rooms are so small and very out of date

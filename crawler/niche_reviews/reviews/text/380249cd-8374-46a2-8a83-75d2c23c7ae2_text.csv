Junior,5,"Feather River College is a great community college! The classes are here are interesting and all of the staff are very helpful. We have a diverse amount of clubs from Black Student Union to an LGBTQ+ safe space club. The area it is located in is so pretty. If you are used to heat and want to experience something new the mountains are for you. Also, the campus itself is beautiful and continues to surprise me."
Sophomore,5,"The slogan of ""Small School, with mountains of opportunity"", really illustrates FRC. This school is amazing with great professors and a huge support system. The school truly cares about it's students. All of the sports programs are awesome as well. This school is absolutely amazing and would 100% recommend Feather River to everyone. Quincy is a great small town, that is filled with nothing but super sweet people that creates the unique community."
Sophomore,5,"The professors are so helpful, the environment is amazing! I am so glad I went here. The class sizes are small probably a 30:1 ratio in GE classes and in some major classes it’s like 15:1. I have learned a lot by my teachers. the student activities and involvement is crazy, everyone is nice to one another and wants to help eachother out. There is many programs to help you graduate whitin two years. There is even a 4 year bachelors program for equine and ranch management. they have many sports to offers and clubs. they have an outdoor rec program that can let you do just about everything in the outdoors. Even if you are not in the program you can go to these events!"
Sophomore,5,Feather River College has the best instructors. The students and instructors can communicate on and off campus about the courses.
College Junior,5,"This college is amazing. Gorgeous scenery, lots of trees, and tons of friendly people. There are many different sports that other colleges may not have. The teachers and staff are out of this world! I love this place!"
College Freshman,5,"The transfer center is so helpful in transferring to 4 year degrees, the counselors really help keep you on top of where you need to be each semester so you are right on track all the time and you can feel confident knowing you are right where you need to be to succeed."
College Freshman,5,My GE classes are perfect for my skill level and my equine classes teach me SO much!

College Junior,5,Feather River College is the most flexible school.
College Junior,5,"I am currently taking one online course and it is very user friendly. The book is attached to the website and I can use it as a reference along with my instructors notes, videos, and other media she has included in the class. The workload is very manageable, not to much and not to little. We learn what we need to, in order to pass the exams."
College Junior,5,Every professor at this school genuinely cares about you. They want you to succeed and will spend countless hours with you trying to help you understand the material.
College Junior,5,"The academics at this school teach you what you need to know for your major. Every course gets straight to the point, and includes lectures, lab, and study groups to succeed."

College Sophomore,5,Everyone here is fun to be around and they are all super into their majors.
Sophomore,4,Feather River is small but with this it turns into your family. I loved my time spent here. I have done so much learning in and out of the classroom and growing up here. This was the right step coming out of high school for me. The whole staff from academics to athletics is so committed to having everyone grow into the best adult they can become. The only downside is the limited classes available. I thought it was perfect I was able to get general classes out of the way in a small classroom size at an affordable cost. If someone was looking to start specific classes early on in their college career they might want to consider other options. Feather River really makes school feel like family.
Sophomore,4,"My years at Feather River College are years that I will always cherish. It is a small community college located in Quincy California, and the majority of the students that go there are athletes. The professors are very helpful and treat each student as an individual. The students are definitely more than a number.  In addition, the professors are very understanding. If you have trouble in the class, are missing a couple days due to sports, a family emergency, etc. The professors will do their best to make sure you do well. Feather River College is a great place to learn, meet new people, and make new memories."
Sophomore,4,"I love it here up in the mountains. It is a beautiful campus and your right outside with nature. Everyone is very nice, and the town is very supportive of all the programs"

Sophomore,4,My first year experience while attending Feather River College was very welcoming and great! The staff members and returning students was very helpful to show where classes were and how things worked around the area. The campus is very beautiful!
Freshman,4,"This school is full of new and interesting classes and tons of amazing hands on experiences. I myself have had a good and non overwhelming experience at feather river college, this is because of how classes are very straight forward. There are always tons of of help around the campus along with tutoring and being able to talk with your teachers during there office hours. I have learned a lot this past year here mostly from hands on class work."

College Freshman,4,"Dr. Bagley is an amazing professor!! It's because of him that math was my highest grade this past semester! And the equine teachers are so great at what they do, and they are only demanding because they have to be, it comes with the horse industry."
College Freshman,4,"We have already had two famous horsemen on campus teaching us, and if somebody were to make an impression on an employer, they would have no trouble finding a job."
College Junior,4,"After graduating, there are many doors opened for you to pursue your degree."
College Junior,4,"This is a small school in a small town, so there are some internships available, but not an abundance like other universities or community colleges."
College Junior,4,"Feather River College is very unique because it is so small, yet filled with dedicated students and staff. The school is in Quincy, CA with a population of 5,500. Everyone knows everyone and it is nice to see familiar faces everyday, where as a university is so large that you do not know too many people."
College Sophomore,4,It is pretty easy to pass classes at FRC
College Senior,4,The resources are fantastic for the smallest community college in california.
College Senior,4,"The community is great, easy to get along with most students."
College Senior,4,The teachers were relatively flexible with student athletes as we are on the road most of one semester.
College Sophomore,4,I'm new and it has been good
College Sophomore,4,The staff is very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,I just started so I am getting the feel of my lessons and teachers.
College Senior,4,I want to study health and fitness so there was a lot of job or volunteer opportunities from the athletic director.
College Senior,4,The financial aid office was there to assist me and made sure I was covered.
College Senior,4,The campus is nice. A lot of grass and shade.  athletic center is always there for you. Student center comes in handy for essay help. Library is peaceful always room to do homework.
College Senior,4,Computers were good. Fast and able to access anywhere.  Printing was a little expensive.
College Senior,4,Great school for athletes.  Classes were good and easy to understand.
College Sophomore,4,"Awesome friends, love Greek life"
College Sophomore,4,The wifi is fairly reliable and its relatively easy to get onto.
College Sophomore,4,the online courses here can be more difficult than the on campus classes.
College Sophomore,4,"I personally did not receive financial aid, but I do feel that the education here is worth the tuition."
College Sophomore,4,The academic flexibility is relatively good but it is hard to have a double major.
College Junior,4,"The environment is really good. Surround by nature, there are many things to do around campus and town, for those that like the outdoors"
College Junior,4,"Facilities  arent bad, but it could have some improvements, for example Student center, it could have better things"
College Senior,4,"I have been at Feather River College since Summer 2011 and I enjoyed the classes.  The professors are open to their students and they want to help the students succeed in the class.  I understand the curriculum.  If students need help in a class, they can go to the professor one on one during their office hours and discuss what they do not understand in the class."
College Junior,4,"There is free tutoring, and there is an easy access to your professors. As long as you attend the sessions, take notes and involve yourself in extra credit assignments you'll be fine."
College Junior,4,"I live in a very rural area and in order to take these classes on campus requires me to take a bus from a different town about 39 miles away. On-line classes make it much more easier for me. Especially in the winter when there is so much snow and the buses may not even be able to run. These buses only run three times a day so some times When I am on campus I may have to wait three hours for another bus. So in conclusion, I give on-line classes an A for convenience!"
College Senior,4,"Satisfied With Choice – I am very pleased with the FRC environment. At Feather River College, the instructors care about the students that are here to learn. I have instructors that have gone out of their way to keep me going in their class. I have six kids at home and I am the sole provider so when I have to miss class my instructors are understanding. After I have missed some classes my instructors make it a point to help me get caught up. There are not enough words of gratitude I feel for Feather River College and their staff."
College Junior,4,"Network Is Manageable – Logging on to my account at the college using the computers in the library and computer lab takes a good amount of time. I often have to wait a while to access my account, but that's the only problem. As far as printing on campus, the network speed, wireless access etc. Everything works great for me."
Alum,2,"Let me tell you, Feather River college is lowkey racist. No one participates in anything. I didnt feel safe being a African Amerian at FRC because of a student having a KKK flag in his dorm. I would also get dirty look for the color of my skin in FRC and out. The dorms are good for apmt style but it could us alot of work. There is a few nice and loving teachers that actually care about you, but other than that no. The wellness center and Trio would be the only great thing about FRC. The staff there have alot of attitude for no reason. Honestly not a good place to be if your African American."
College Sophomore,2,"It is only a two year school therefore there aren't many post-grad services at all. You can get help with transferring, but whether your credits will transfer or not depends on how much attention you paid to the admissions process since day 1."
College Sophomore,2,I don't know much about career prospects at my school. There are a few internship opportunities but they aren't well-known and they don't cover very many majors.
College Senior,2,I had a hard time getting into transferable classes.
College Junior,2,I dont have a lot of friends that graduated from feather river college. but the ones i know of. They have great jobs which now are working. they found a job right out of school. They are working for the bank. I dont know how hard it was for them to find a job.
Recent Alumnus,2,The experience at this school has been both good and bad. The good thing about it is playing football and socializing with friends during class. Football is a sport thati couldnt give up after High School. Even if i didnt recieve scholars after highschool i could never give up the sport. And then the socializing with friends is another one of my favorite things to do. The bad times are the classes with poor teachers who dont seem alive in their class.
College Junior,2,"I have had no interaction with this department, so I really cant comment on it."
College Sophomore,2,Needs Some Improvement – the speed of our network is reaal hit and miss. i ish we had more places that hook up to wireless.
College Junior,1,"Networking on campus is just a pain, very slow and inadequate."
College Junior,1,resources are available if students know how to use them because the administration hasn't a clue how to get anything properly done.
College Junior,1,"Over charging, harder on student to thrive and move on after finally down with school here. getting financial aid is a pain in the neck and often student have to wait longer than others due to a system malfunction.  Also its best to not challenge instructors or it could have a negative impact on your chances of getting it."
College Junior,1,Schooling here has had its good aspects but only outside the class room. Over all its just stressful trying to work with the school.
College Junior,1,"Ha flexibility at FRC that's actually funny, its very hard finding work here in a small community just being a college student alone but trying to balance both is near to impossible while being able to focus on both. "
College Junior,1,Everything about the registration system is over complicated and the administration doesn't understand how to fully use it. hard to get the right help when the help needs help to help you.
College Junior,1,"Really feels like I'm getting another high school education. Doesn't feel like we are actually going to a college. work load is ok. facilities are horrible always breaking or not adequate. I wont be majoring here, planing to transfer to somewhere more qualified."
College Junior,1,"The school doesn't have a good understanding of how to work any of the computers or the data base. They constantly mess up our paper work, i feel like I'm getting a high school level education. The school doesn't have any fun clubs or activities unless your in athletics. The food is over priced and the kitchen isn't up to sanitary standards. There are some good staff that are helpful to the best of their ability but can only do so much because the administration doesn't have a clue to what there doing. They have horrible dorm accommodations and the drug use on campus and among the students is foul. Student get passing grades for not going to class and or showing up high or hungover( mostly by the athletes). Athletes are favored over hard working students in multiple levels. Date rape is very common from the athletes which nothing is ever done about it. the school lies to out of state students to what they offer. Good and caring professors are next to nil. Students often are ostracized  for being themselves. "
College Freshman,1,Too Much Inconsistency – the administration changes the schedual for no appearent reason or simply decide not to offer a class.

Freshman,5,I have had nothing but a positive experience with Warren Wilson College. Everyone I have came in contact with have been positive. Any time I have had a problem it  has been dealt with quickly and very professionally.
Freshman,5,I have not taken any online courses at Warren Wilson College. I plan to attend most of my classes in seated environment.
Freshman,5,All of my professors were extremely helpful and understanding throughout our entire transition into online classes.
Freshman,5,"While I will say Warren Wilson won't be for everyone, it is a really unique college experience. I really love the farm and garden program, and have the opportunity to learn other workplace skills outside of classes through the work program."
Niche User,5,I really enjoy the sense of community and service/hands on based learning that gives better insight into the world and what place you stand in it. The school is deeply connected with nature and its surroundings making it a wonderful place to thrive and develop as a human being.
Sophomore,5,"Every student, in addition to taking classes and their volunteer hours, is on a work crew that helps the college. Payment for work is applied toward your room and board. The additional commitments are challenging, but also highly rewarding!"
Freshman,5,"The community of WWC is warm, motivating, and reaching as far as its arms can go to welcome in anyone who has a passion to make the world a better place. The teachers are mentors, the students are hard workers, and the encouragement to do better is everywhere."
Freshman,5,"It's such an open school, I really feel comfortable there. It is a beautiful place and you really get a lot of exercise going up and down all of the many, many hills."
Senior,5,"Warren Wilson College is a unique, intellectual, and rigorous institution. WWC goes above and beyond to make the college experience one that is well-rounded and immersive. As a current senior,  I find myself a more prepared undergrad because of WWC's work and service program. Going into a job/internship/grad school interview with a four year background in work and service definitely differentiates you from other applicants and shows that as a student and professional you value a well-rounded and challenging experience. WWC provides space and support for anyone to flourish. The institution provides various outlets in academics, work, and service for students to find their niche. The community is very egalitarian, liberal, and intellectual. The professors are top-notch, many of them embody social justice ideals and it shows in the classroom. As a student in the humanities, I am continuously challenged to hone perspectives that are globally, ethically, and social justice conscious."
Sophomore,5,"Wilson is an amazing college. It's on a beautiful campus, the academics can be quite rigorous, and the social atmosphere is lovely. I came here because this is a place where you can work one on one with the head of a department and get your work published as a sophomore. At other colleges, publishing is for the grad students and professors, and any help you put into their research and work, you won't get the credit. Here at Wilson, you do. Last year, Wilson helped me score an internship at the United Nations doing work on human rights and next semester they're letting me be a research assistant. I'm super excited. But you have to want this stuff. You have to want to put the work in and be engaged and ambitious."
Alum,5,"Wilson is a very unique place that isn't for everyone, most people strongly advise one to visit before committing. That being said, I didn't visit and attending Wilson was one of the best decisions I've made in my life. The student body and faculty and staff is a community like no other. The triad gives you experiences you don't have elsewhere. If you don't have a strong sense of responsibility  you can easily cultivate it here, very few make it out without some sense of responsibility. You have the chance to make the most out of any possible college experience. The area is very rich culturally and allows you to take your education in whatever direction you choose. The staff work with you to help you do exactly what you want to do."
College Freshman,5,"Honestly, a lot of people who come here think that because we require 15 hours of work a week and 25 hours of service a year, that it's like a summer camp and academics are not so big. It's a college. Academics here are still the most important part of the triad. They are rigorous and challenging, and you will find yourself cramming for deadlines and exams like everyone else. The professors are kind and considerate, but they don't take bs. Be prepared to give it your all, because that's what college is supposed to demand of you."
College Freshman,5,"In regards to gender diversity, women are a majority here. The campus is very accepting of trans and non-binary individuals. Same goes for sexual orientation: my partner and I walk around campus every day and not once since I came to this school have I heard an anti-gay remark. Admittedly, we have an issue with racial diversity but the administration put it as a top priority. Hopefully we'll see results soon."
College Freshman,5,"As a male, I can only speak to my own experiences. I've never felt unsafe on campus. I walk around campus at 2am and feel completely safe. Public Safety is very kind and relaxed. They don't unwarrantedly stop students or search them. In regards to sexual assault, the school takes it VERY seriously. Every incoming student must go through a consent education session."
College Freshman,5,"The college really does a lot in terms of employment. Every year the career development program gives out $2,000 stipends for students to have summer internships. They help you find internships, prep you for your interviews, and review your resumes and cover letters. They also make sure that you secure a job before graduating."
College Freshman,5,"Wilson is a pretty special place. Everyone here knows you and you're not a number. There's open dialogue between students, faculty, and staff. They're all happy to help with anything you have an issue with, from tutoring and courses to just making friends and feeling supported. The campus itself is beautiful. We're in a valley so whichever way you look there are gorgeous mountains, and we own hundreds of acres of them so they're completely available to hike, sunbathe, explore, etc. The school has pretty lenient policies. Lots of students have pets (I have two rats). Larger pets like dogs and cats must be either emotional support animals (which you need a medical note for) or service animals. The public safety officers here are pretty chill too. They don't stop students for no reason, they don't search students, and they don't violate anyone's civil liberties. As far as safety goes, I haven't for a moment felt unsafe on campus. That said, I'm also a male so I can't speak to how safe women feel. The school takes sexual assault EXTREMELY seriously though and every incoming student must go through a consent education session. It's a safe place for queer and trans students here, too. My partner and I met on campus and have always felt supported here. I haven't once heard any anti-gay remarks since I first came here so that's really incredible. The school prides itself in its efforts to be an inclusive community."
College Freshman,5,"For a small school, the gym is pretty big and nice. There's a weight room, a new cardio room, and a court. There's variety in machines and it's never too crowded or intimidating. They're open pretty late, too, which is great. It's not overrun by ""dude bros"" so it's a very inviting atmosphere."
College Freshman,5,"Warren Wilson is an amazing place. They trust their students like the adults they are. Public safety is kind, they're lenient and understanding, and students have a great deal of overall freedom. The administration often comes to student meetings to discuss accomplishments, changes, and challenges that the college is having. They try to be as transparent as they can. Classes are nice and small, though I wish there was a greater variety within them and more departments. Teachers know your name and reach out to you if they are concerned. It is a pretty tight knit community."
College Freshman,5,WWC is literally on 1200 acres of forest and farm land- no ones here but us!
College Sophomore,5,"This school is unique. There's no other school that offers the opportunities that Wilson can. The thing that took me a bit to realize is that my experience at school here is what I make it. I was originally worried that I had made a mistake coming to this school but since taking advantage of everything this school has to offer, I feel confident that this education and experience will change my life and lead me down the path I want to be on."
College Senior,5,"It's Asheville.  This city lives for food and beer, simple as that."
College Senior,5,"The best thing about the party scene at Wilson is that it is entirely up to what you are looking for.  YOu don't have to go to big dance parties if that's not your thing.  You don't have to sit around campfires playing music if that isn't your thing.  You don't have to drink, smoke, do any drugs if those arent your thing. It's definitely a choose your own adventure kind of party scene.  But, if you are into any of those kind of things, you can do them here with pretty awesome people."
College Senior,5,"Relative to what college food tends to be, we have an awesome array of dining choices.  People consistently push our food provider to be better and more sustainable which is awesome."
College Junior,5,Asheville is awesome. And it's only about 15 minutes from campus.
College Junior,5,I always feel very safe on campus. I have never once felt uneasy or threatened.
College Freshman,5,"Who wouldn't want to walk to class every morning with a view of the mountains? My favorite time is when there is a little bit of morning fog and the mountains are obscured partially or completely. It feels like Wilson is the only piece of land on earth. There is also tons of awesome landscaping and beautiful stuff here. Plus, we have swings! This school is the best on earth."
College Freshman,5,"Asheville is amazing. Their is always something going on their with plenty of good places to eat and shop. Swannanoa isn't the best, but there's an Ingles that gets the job done when you really want something to eat."
College Senior,5,"Wilson has been life-defining for me. For all it's faults, Wilson is a once-in-a-lifetime experience I would never take back. I have learned so much about the world through my classes, my friends, and my work. I have been given leadership opportunities and taken on roles I never would have anticipated. The people I work with are absolutely amazing and give me hope for the world. Life at Wilson can sometimes be stressful, frustrating, or isolating, but it's ultimately worth it. One big things has been the support of professors and supervisors. They have really invested in me and pushed me to be my best."
College Senior,5,"It's not difficult to get into any major at Wilson, as long as you have decent enough grades."
College Senior,5,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE the Sociology/Anthropology major and my professors. I could rave about them all day. Not gonna lie, I hero-worship them a little bit. My advisor is Christey Carwile, who specializes in West Africa, gender studies, and also happens to be really into dance and brings this interest into her classes - she even teaches a class on dance and culture. Laura Vance's classes are difficult but really invigorating, and she's so deeply engaging as a professor. Ben Feinberg is a quirky guy with a lot of interesting experiences that he draws upon, and once you get used to his general disorganization/syle of teaching, you will want to take more of his classes. Siti Kusujiarti is one of the sweetest people and has her classes over for dinner sometimes. 

Getting to know your professors can help open up some serious opportunities. Last year, Christey helped me pull some strings to get funding for an internship to Ghana. Additionally, I think the thesis track puts Wilson students at an advantage when applying to grad schools. I did my thesis a year early, the process of going from an idea for research to presenting my research in a panel was so gratifying and awesome. The Soc/Anth major has a lot of opportunities for interesting research."
College Freshman,5,This school is tailored for my education.
College Freshman,5,Its different than home but still very nice.
College Freshman,5,Dining in Asheville is great!  There are plenty of options to choose from and although some might be a little pricey it is not hard to find a place that is good that fits in your budget as well.
College Sophomore,5,we strive to be accepting and accomodating to everyone no matter what their beliefs/sexual orientation/race
College Sophomore,5,"many, many, many local restaurants to check out. With a lot of variety and very accomodating to dietary needs."
College Sophomore,5,"The unique thing about warren Wilson College is that it is a work-study college this means that academics is not the only thing that the college has to offer. It is a school that you have the opportunity to come away with a whole new skill set that you never imagined whether that is setting up resumes or knowing how to rewire a house. There is so much emphasis on experiential learning that it is hard to come away from the school not learning something. also it is a place that holds so many diverse ideas that you could be failing academically but you still will be having conversations with friends and faculty that teach you about yourself and others. My school is unique because students, faculty, and staff all understand that sitting is not the only way to learn and everyone helps facilitate education whether it is through service, sitting in a classroom, or going to work. If you are struggling someone is always there to help. Another unique part about my school is because of the emphasis on learning outside the classroom, the work boss's want to hear students ideas on how to improve the work setting or how they accomplish their goals and the bosses are, for the most part, supportive"
College Freshman,5,"Asheville area has great weather, warm summers and cool winters with many beautiful days in between. Gotta love it. "
College Sophomore,5,"I think that drug use is generally conducted in a safe, reasonable manner. Marijuana is common. It's not unusual to see someone tripping around campus, but rarely is anybody having a bad time. Addictive drugs like cocaine and heroin are extremely rare. Many people also do not do drugs and most everyone seems to get along just fine that way. Smoking around campus does run the risk of being caught by public safety."
College Freshman,5,"It snows rarely, and it's all nice and cool and mountain-breezy in the fall. Even in December, the sun comes out and you can sit in it and stay warm. It does rain occasionally, but not too often."
College Sophomore,5,You can get a license on campus to drive vehicles and golf carts. The bus runs regularly and your id acts as your bus pass
Sophomore,4,"I applied this summer and because the campus was closed, I thought it would be too difficult and impersonal. My experience so far has been just the opposite! I had phone calls and a zoom meeting with my admissions rep. She walked me through the process of applying, and helped me fill out financial aid application information. I'm accepted and on my way this fall. My mom just sent her a list of questions, because we're still sorting out the details of moving and choosing classes. But I know I'm in a good place and will get all the help I need as I move forward with my education."
Senior,4,"I fell in love with Warren Wilson because of the low student-to-teacher ratio, small student body, small campus, location in the Blue Ridge Mountains, strong focus on environmentalism and sustainability, and community engagement in service-learning opportunities."
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful and the small class sizes mean you get a great connection with the teachers and many of the classes are hands-on. That said, there is very little work done by the administration to make the campus more accessible to POC."
Junior,4,"I have not taken any of the fully-online classes here, they do offer some online classes over the summer but the only experience I have had was in the transition to online classes during the Covid pandemic."
Junior,4,"Warren Wilson is a beautiful college with a unique learning/working program. Being a small college, students are all part of a tight-knit community, which has its ups and downs. The food could be better and issues with money aren't always handled in the best way, but the outstanding professors and work crew supervisors made it worth staying."
Sophomore,4,warren Wilson college is a unique place for your studies. The best thing about warren Wilson the community engagement and work study program. Also the teachers interact with the students and help them through their college path.
Junior,4,"It's a small community that grants space for individual attention and helpful resources. As a triad school, students spend time focusing on their education as well as community engagement and work. Work is done on a ""crew"" on campus, allowing students to get a feel for trades they may be interested in as well as being a member of a working community that gives back. The location is a big part of the school's charm and fairytale environment."
Alum,4,I loved going to college at Warren Wilson. The Campus is beautiful. The work program was amazing. Asheville is a really cool town. Professors were knowledgable and helpful. The friends I made were great people. The surrounding area of the campus is incredibly beautiful.
Freshman,4,I love the small college experience and values of community engagement and creating an environment where the students are expected to work together to build a better experience. Where the school lacks is in a budget for the natural science labs with outdated and spotty instruments.
Junior,4,"I love the academics and work program! Cafeterias are very accommodating. Student research is highly encouraged here. Housing is not very good and ResLife is going downhill (very stressful to be an RA lately). The library's selection is amazing! And the professors are great and always accommodating as well. Also, the campus is absolutely GORGEOUS!!!!"
Alum,4,"Warren Wilson College is a very special place. Their educational program of academics, work and community engagement is distinct in higher education. This educational program engages students in learning in and beyond the classroom, providing them with real and meaningful work and community engagement. Students graduate ready to change the world because they've been doing it through their education at Warren Wilson College."
Junior,4,"Very work based, community orientated college, and I'm very happy to have applied. Have good professors want to help, the community around the school is great, and the scenery around the college is breath-taking. A must come if interested in studies of natural science, writing, biology, and social sciences (etc.). School is not so big, but there is much to do and see. Great college!"
Freshman,4,"Not a lot of diversity, there are males, non-binary, & trans folk, but the student body is mostly comprised of female identifying people. & there is not a lot of POC on campus. 
No real communication between administration, faculty, and students.
Campus is beautiful. 
Inaccessible to people who are in a wheelchair or using crutches. 
Food isn't as good as they make it out to be but it's relatively better than other schools. 
There are some amazing teachers, then there are some teachers who don't talk about intersectionality when it matters. 
Dorms are kinda gross(moldy), there definitely needs to be some renovations."
Freshman,4,"The good: hiking trails, the work program, service, the river, my classes, vegan food, local food, downtown asheville is just a short drive away (if you have a car or a friend with a car), nice people, community is very accepting of all backgrounds and all identities. The bad: no community feel living in Sunderland, no shuttles or buses from campus to downtown or black mountain or even grocery store, some weekends there is not much going on party wise, no vegan pizza in Glad, expensive tuition, very small student body compared to most colleges."
College Freshman,4,"Honestly,  it's very easy to avoid drugs here. The culture here doesn't promote peer pressure and if you say you're not into it, people will respect you just the same. You won't see empty beer bottles on the lawn or anything like that. Also, there are literally hundreds of acres here, if folks need to smoke anywhere, they'll do it away from residential spaces."
College Freshman,4,"It's great if you live in freshman housing (Sunderland) because you're right next to the humanities building where classes are and you have Owl's Nest on the ground floor. Same with Sage, you have Sage Cafe on their ground floor. Many of the buildings are suite style, which is great once you have an established friend group and can move in together. Many of the bathrooms are brand new and really nice, and there are new filtered water stations everywhere."
College Freshman,4,Ive done extremely well academically here but socially there are some issues- its definitely a utopia and hardly anyone is in touch with the real world. professors are great though and the service and work programs are the whole reason I am here
College Freshman,4,I love how close to everything I am- literally in the middle of campus
College Freshman,4,"This is a small campus, and public safety is always nearby"
College Freshman,4,The people are friendly and my roommate seems cool.
College Sophomore,4,"I was a bit overwhelmed by the newness of the whole experience and didn't take part in many activities, but I still enjoyed myself.  The students and teachers are all warm and friendly, and everything was generally at least pleasant.  I would chose this school but I would definitely do more in regards to financial aid."
College Senior,4,"The community here is incredibly tight nit and the administration plays a role in that.  The rules are in place with safety in mind, and most public safety officers and RAs enforce them with safety as their goal.  Sometimes an RA or RD gets a little power hungry, but mostly they're pretty reasonable since they're your peers."
College Senior,4,"You have to be persistent with them, but the financial aid office really does want to make it possible for as many people to come as possible."
College Senior,4,"All of the buildings are maintained by students so there is a certain charm to them that comes with that.  The buildings themselves are homey and beautiful, sometimes they could just be a bit cleaner..."
College Junior,4,Asheville offers some of the best drinking and dining options around.
College Freshman,4,There are many places in Asheville and Black Mountain that have great waitstaff and are people that I like to go see on weekends. The costs are reasonable and there is a lot of variety too
College Freshman,4,"I was able to receive a fair amount of scholarship money but I still needed a couple loans which I was not allowed to take out with the school, that was a pain in the butt"
College Junior,4,"The food is Asheville is great, although it can get pretty pricey."
College Junior,4,"As long as you are 21 and drinking in your room, there's no problem. Pub Safe is strict about alcohol at parties and anywhere outside of student rooms."
College Junior,4,Don't live in Dorland. That's all I have to say.
College Freshman,4,"I'm biased because I adore this school, but I think it's pretty freaking awesome!"
College Freshman,4,"I'm an ENS major and although the entry level pre-req classes are really basic and boring, once you get past them the classes are AWESOME. This is a great place to study ENS/ biology in general because of the region we are in. I hear about new internship/research opportunities every day and our teachers are really cool and helpful. The AC in the science buildings is really spotty, but that's life here. The labs are also pretty decent and the library has an amazing science section."
College Freshman,4,"I didn't really have to input any effort in order to get significant scholarship dumped into my lap. I needed to work hard for my outside sources, but Wilson basically did all of the work for me."
College Freshman,4,"If you want off-campus dining, you pretty much have to go into Asheville. Swannanoa basically just has pizza and McDonald's, but in downtown Asheville there's something for everyone."
College Freshman,4,"The admin, as a whole, are very lenient with the students. Obviously, if we are blatantly violating the rules, we are going to get in trouble because they are obligated to do something, but nobody really wants to call us out and if we go about our rule-breaking quietly, it's fine."
College Freshman,4,"I've never had any issues with safety, although we do get the occasional black bear walking around."
College Senior,4,"There's a lot of variety in housing, ranging from very old and cinderblock-y to new, spacious, and clean, to housing co-ops, and it's not hard to get into the dorm you want to after a semester or two. One great thing is that once you get a room you're happy with, you can continue to reclaim it until you leave."
College Senior,4,"Wilson students are known for not making a lot of money after they graduate, but it's not because they are not equipped to, it's because it's not a priority for them. Wilson students seek out careers that are meaningful to them and aren't concerned with the typical definition of success. Personally, I feel very equipped for jobs in the non-profit fields and for graduate school, eventually. My resume is absolutely packed after my time at Wilson."
College Senior,4,"Swannanoa has a lot of chain restaurants. Most of the cooler restaurants are in Black Mountain or Asheville, neither of which are far. My favorite restaurants are Louise's, which is in a renovated house in Black Mountain and where you can eat breakfast on a wrap-around porch, and Mela, an Indian restaurant downtown. Cookout is a favorite for 2am insanely cheap milkshakes, and there are a few pizza places that deliver to the school. Though it's not a restaurant, Hopey Co. (formerly Amazing Savings) is a local grocery story that sells really cheap healthy and organic foods."
College Senior,4,"There aren't a lot of nightclubs, but there are a lot of great bars in Asheville, also known as Beer City, USA."
College Senior,4,"I can't complain too much about dining. The only problem I face is that Cowpie, which offers healthy, vegetarian and vegan food, often doesn't serve enough food (they fill a plate for you) and Gladfelter, which is a typical self-serve cafeteria, has lower quality food but more of it. The limited hours are annoying, but you get used to it. Also all of the dorms have a kitchen, which is nice."
College Senior,4,"Swannanowhere doesn't feature much for your entertainment, but Asheville is great and only 10 minutes away! It's really adorable and there's always a lot going on there in terms of concerts, theatre, delicious food, etc. The area in general is fantastic for outdoor adventures, certainly, no matter what you're into. Although you might hear the occasional comment about potheads, Wilson is viewed mostly positively by people in the area because of our dedication to local community service."
College Senior,4,"I love the general aesthetic of campus. While some buildings are lagging in modernity, there's a very rustic, comfortable, home-y feeling that all the buildings have on campus. Landscaping crew only plants native plants, so there's a much more natural feeling than the college campuses with perfectly manicured shrubs and golf-course-like quads. Most buildings have a lot of natural light, and the science buildings are especially nice."
College Senior,4,"We have some decent Div II basketball teams, and we excel at some unusual sports like paddling and mountain biking. Soccer's also a thing. Wilson rallies around its teams, especially when they're doing well, but overall the campus culture is not sports focused."
Recent Alumnus,4,The campus has a wide variety of dorms and the newer buildings are great.
Recent Alumnus,4,Warren Wilson is a fairly relaxed place.
Recent Alumnus,4,Asheville has an amazing music scene.
Recent Alumnus,4,Warren Wilson is a very safe place.
Recent Alumnus,4,Asheville is an amazing city.
College Freshman,4,The facilities are great for everyone.
College Freshman,4,The sports facilities are great.
College Freshman,4,The rooms are very nice
College Freshman,4,I don't participate in it too much but there's always something going on.
College Freshman,4,A very nice artsy town.
College Freshman,4,"Very diverse, almost to an extreme."
College Sophomore,4,The bus route comes trough campus and stops in front of the library. This route/line will take you to the nearest town and also to downtown Asheville. It's free with your campus ID. Convenient times and availability.
College Sophomore,4,"If you're a picky eater or have special dietary needs then it can be difficult to find a variety of healthy food options. While there is a Vegan/Vegetarian cafe that serves lunch and dinner it's not opened during the weekends, school breaks, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"Off-campus dining can be the best adventure for students, specially if they have a car and are willing to do a bit of driving. You can find anything from local cafes to ethnic restaurants within the reach of downtown (accessible through the bus route than comes through campus, which is free with your student ID). If you drive out you can find great pizzerias, fancy restaurants, and even a vegetarian food drive-through."
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of places on campus that will help you to find internships that relate in your field and also most majors require to obtain an internship in your field at least some time before you graduate so it is not all that difficult to obtain help into getting one.
College Freshman,4,"My school runs on a triad program which means that it incorporates work, service, and academics into your overall education here.  Graduates of Warren Wilson get to leave with a well rounded resume which will put them ahead of other graduates when it comes to securing a job after graduation.  The campus is placed in the center of the mountains and the amount of ""green"" you see here is way more than the amount of concrete.  We practice Eco friendly living here and it makes the students that go here really appreciate the environment way more than they would at another school."
College Freshman,2,A lot of the buildings seem to have problems with mold or have various things broken in them
College Freshman,2,The parties here do not look like the average colleges parties. We are a dry campus with party contracts so hardly anyone is willing to risk throwing a party incase people drink to much or damage is done. The party scene doesn't make an impact on the students.
College Freshman,2,"The school claims that they try their hardest to provide the students with local food options, but we the food is run through Sodexo... what? 

The salad bar is usually wilted and brown.

Owl's nest is pretty cool though and the staff in there is great."
College Freshman,2,"The drug scene here isn't that noticeable to people that are just visiting or do not go here, but since this is such a small school once you start going here you become familiar with all the drugs that are available and where to find them.  Going here makes it difficult to not notice the drug scene and for some it makes it hard to say no to it since it is everywhere around you."
College Freshman,2,There are not a lot of places where computers are available on campus compared to how many students actually go here.  Normally students will do their homework at night since that's really the only time they have free to do it so the library will be extremely crowded taking up all the computers and the other computer labs on campus close at a certain time so really the library is your only option.
College Sophomore,2,no one except the athlete's friends and family attend the sports events. There is not much school spirit because our teams don't win often.
College Sophomore,2,"Sports are around but it is not emphasized on campus. Friends of the players usually attend the games but no one other than that really does. The teams are ok, but not fantastic and there are so many away games that it is hard to get team spirit and unification behind the sports teams. This school is full of weird, quirky people who were not apart of the popular athletes in high school so many of us have a sour spot for athletes"
College Freshman,2,"Great drug scene, in certain circles people will want to smoke all the time and trip every weekend, others not, just depends who u end up around...it's all pretty safe since there's so little anonymity and u can pretty much trust stuff which is nice"
College Freshman,2,"I mean pubsafe is hard on freshman. Don't smoke too close to the road or where everyone is being super loud and bright. Keep it lowkey... after freshman year anything goes.. smoking in dorms, general consensual wildness... unless you're hardcore dealing the police will never get involved."
College Sophomore,2,"While WWC offers and has students all over the world and there are many different cultures represented, the campus remains predominately white"
College Sophomore,2,"Back-Woods Campus – We only have a couple computer labs and the WIFI just got installed this month, so I have yet to see whether it is campus-wide as they say it is. It's easy enough to find a printer, but I am glad to have my laptop."
College Student,2,"Unless you have a car, there isn't much to do on campus. The students try and organize events and activities to take part in but most students would rather be partying and so you'll find the events to be rather lackluster with few attendants."
College Sophomore,2,Sad Buses – It is free to ride some of the buses thats the only good thing. The bad thing is that most of the year the bus runs on metro-time which means the bus will be 15mins to an hour late on any given day. There are also times when buses will skip over whole routes.
Niche User,2,"Not For Me – The food is far too heavy. It really depends on what kind of eater you are, but if you like to have meals that are on the lighter side then you will be disappointed. Everything in Gladfelter is heavy and sauce covered. The food is much too rich and if you eat lunch and dinner in the cafeteria it's like you are eating two dinners a day. Not so great for avoiding the freshman 15. "
College Freshman,2,"Reefer Madness – Wilson is known for its ""open-minded""-ness. There is a lot of pot smoking and on top of that hard drug use is on the rise. Students here will be offered pot but it is never forced. If you don't want it people will still treat you the same. Substance-free housing is made available."
College Sophomore,1,"There are mice in Sage.

We have a mold problem. 

Pipes burst and ruin everything at least once a year. 

Dirty.

Costs too much."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life does not exist on campus. If you even say ""Greek life"" people will attack you with why Greek life is awful."
College Sophomore,1,"Athletes are treated very ""other"" since they do not fit into the main population of hippies."
College Freshman,1,Theres hardly any ability for legitimate internships unless it counts as work time
College Junior,1,There are no real parties here. Only occasionally they will have a Preston punk show. That's the most fun you'll find on campus.
College Junior,1,"I can't get any aid because of the amount of money my dad makes. But they don't take into account that I have 3 little siblings, and they all have to go to college too, and my parents can't pay for all of it."
College Sophomore,1,"The weather can never be predictable. One day it's sunny, then next it's storming, and two days later it snows."
College Freshman,1,The weather is horrible only because you never know what to expect or how to dress.  It will be hot one day and snowing the very next day.
College Freshman,1,"There is very little cultural diversity on Warren Wilson's campus.  Though the students have had very interesting experiences, most are white and upper/middle class.  However, I found the campus to be extremely accepting to people of all ethnic backgrounds and sexual orientations.  But, not much cultural diversity is found on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Public transit does not come by the college that often. Instead, you have to go into town often with a friend who owns a carrier. Public transit is not convenient at all."
College Junior,1,"Sports arent a thing here, one only goes to the games if they have friends on the team or something"
College Student,1,"No Enforcement – Drinking and drug use is prohibited on campus, yet oftentimes you will find many students walking around stumbling after a party, or glazed over. RA's and RD's for the most part have no backbone in enforcing rules and decorum."
College Freshman,1,Drug Rage – There will be a large number of Freshman who do a certain drug all together on the same night and Everyone will be talking about it. There is no real enforcement and the dealers come right onto campus to deal out their stuff at the nearest smoking hut. There is no peer pressure to do it but there is definatly a whole support group if you want to do it that will make sure you have a good time...
College Freshman,1,"What They Tell You Isn't True. I am not cynical. This is really what the guides don't tell you:

-The academics here aren't challenging, and kids aren't motivated to do much other than smoke pot or make hemp necklaces.
-Many people don't shower, so bring your gas mask.
-If you aren't the most environmentally conscious person ever, people here will look down on you--hippies are just as pretentious as WASPs.
-The music and theater programs here are lackluster.
-Fun activities are few and far between."
College Freshman,1,"The buses that go around WWC are completely unreliable. Freshman aren't able to have cars, and most upperclassmen don't have them either. Generally, transportation is an obstacle."
College Freshman,1,"My experience at WWC has been okay. However, I am transferring after one semester. I realized that I was not a hippie, and that I wanted to be in a place where people challenged themselves academically and cared about their surroundings and personal hygiene. Come here if you want to learn an outdoor skill, to learn how to get away with not showering, to learn how to do tons of drugs, and become an environmental science major. Otherwise, it's not the place for you."
College Freshman,1,"WWC has little diversity. Most of the people here are white kids who want to not shower and aspire to work on a farm. There are some very friendly international students, but the ratio of African American students to Caucasians is about 50:1."
Niche User,1,"None Whatsoever – This school is horrible when it comes to diversity. There are very, very few minorities. It can be a little alienating at first because there is this huge emphasis put on the fact that you are a minority here and anytime someone mentions anything dealing with your racial/ethnic group everyones head turns to stare at you. "
Niche User,1,"No. During orientation our peer group leader basically told us we could get away with anything as long as it wasn't smoking inside the dorm room. People go out on the trails or by the river or to the picnic table 10 FT FROM THE RDs house and smoke pot. During orientation when the campus was basically 99% first year students a huge party was held with copious amounts of alcohol and loud music. No one got in trouble for anything, even though a party like that should have been a huge red flag because it could not have been that size without a considerable number of underaged kids drinking. "
Niche User,1,This is not the place to come to do serious learning. Most of the students seem to not care and the atmopshere is way too casual. It's as if the staff and everyone know the students aren't taking it seriously so they aren't either.

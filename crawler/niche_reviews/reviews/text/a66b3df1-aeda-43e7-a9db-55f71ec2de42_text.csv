Freshman,5,great teachers and they expect you to be able to think and learn. small classes. senior project. no majors.
Senior,5,"As a senior who is about to graduate from Marlboro College, I think that going here is one of the best decisions I have ever made. It gave me the opportunity to study abroad thanks to grants and scholarships, something I never thought possible. It is a small community but I have made long-lasting friendships and unforgettable memories.
 My main complaint is that as a Mexican-American student I wish there were more students of color, but those of us who are on campus have a very close bond which has been very helpful. It is challenging, too, to be in a rural setting so much of the time with not many other people around. But for me, an introvert who loves nature, it was perfect and ideal for focusing on my academics.
 I've also developed a close bond with my professors thanks to small class sizes, and they have helped me write a two-hundred page undergraduate thesis that I can really feel proud of. Marlboro may not be for everyone, but for me it has been perfect."
Niche User,5,Marlboro is a one-of-a-kind school. It's nestled in the mountains of Vermont and has a very comfortable campus that feels like a home. The course of study is completely customizable and financial aid opportunities are abundant. The people are open-minded and there is no judgement.
Freshman,5,Marlboro is great because you have a lot of control on your experience. If there's not a class you want to take you can talk to a professor and make a personalized tutorial. Town meeting makes it possible for you to get involved and make institutional changes. We just voted to remove the Coca Cola soda machine because Coke has many human rights violations and environmental issues. All the professors are great at teaching and very decent human beings. The only issue with having so much control over your school experience is that you can easily waste your time if you don't hold yourself to a certain amount of accountability. The Outdoor Program has hikes and trips every week and makes it very easy to check out equipment for virtually no price. Overall it's very good if you are self driven.
College Junior,5,"The Kitchen Staff is incredible. They are friendly, approachable, and always looking for suggestions. They directly respond to the needs and wants of the community. Unfortunately, they can only work with what the administration provides them, but they absolutely do their best, and they consistently provide delicious food.

The Coffee Shop is really hit-or-miss. It's all student workers, and they vary greatly in skill level. It has been slowly increasing in overall quality, though."
College Junior,5,"Marlboro is a cozy little county of ~700 people that the students actually have little to no interaction with. When people say ""Town"" they are referring to Brattleboro 99% of the time (though Wilmington is a couple miles closer).

Brattleboro is really where all the local attractions are. Restaurants, stores, galleries, and the like. Many students live in Brattleboro. In fact, is is VERY difficult to make a trip to downtown Brattleboro without running into at least one Marlboro student, and seeing a couple others from afar.

It is a deceptively large place. Brattleboro is technically home to 12,000 people, though it feels MUCH smaller. Most students only hang around the downtown area, where the attractions are pretty conveniently located. It has a very warm and creative atmosphere. An overall pleasant and quiet place."
College Junior,5,"The academic program is very unique. There are no core requirements, so you're never forced to take a shitty class that you don't like just to get some bullshit credits. You last two years are spent working on a Plan of Concentration, which is a large-scale Senior project (somewhere around 100 pages worth of very high-quality essays, though it can be more or less depending on what other independent projects you include, such as a computer program, or a dance performance, or something similar). Classes are tiny; almost always 5-15 people, and that's not even counting Tutorials, which are typically just you and your professor 1-on-1.

The social scene is interesting. The school is small enough that you will know pretty much everybody on a first-name basis. There are still distinct social groups (cliques, you might call them), but these groups tend to blend, bleed, and overlap to a pretty large degree.

The location is stellar. If you are a lazy shut-in, the cold Vermont winter will give you a perfect excuse to stay inside all day and relax. If you are an adventurous, outdoorsy-type, then you'll have access to miles of trails and beautiful mountain views."
College Junior,5,"The campus buildings are all very nice in their own ways. Many are repurposed barns or farmhouses. Some buildings are new and sexy. They are all within walking distance of eachother (MAXIMUM ten minutes between the two farthest buildings, and that's if you're really slow). The campus is very charming and cozy in general.

Most places are open 24/7, and you can pretty much always find hanging out in every building at any time of day or night. People pull all-nighters and sit around in their common rooms, the library, the campus center, the dining hall, the science building, etc.

Every building is painted white."
College Freshman,5,Fantastic and dedicated staff provides stellar meals with an emphasis on vegan/veggie folks. We just signed the Real Food Challenge - google that.
College Freshman,5,We live in the woods.
College Freshman,5,Simply stellar. We have the best professors in the country (check Princeton Review) and a passionate bunch of students. It's why I (and many other students) came here in the first place.
College Freshman,5,"If you're into small town living, where you know your farmers, get lost in the woods, have bonfires for parties, and enjoy really liberal politics, Windham Co. is the best. We're remote, but there's really strong community here if you look for it."
College Freshman,5,I love it because it's what I want to study - no requirements! Just my passion with similarly-passionate profs.
College Junior,5,"The academics are intense at MArlboro. They are challenging and exciting, but you get to study what you are interested and passion towards and that freedom allows amazing work to happen. The professors expect a lot from students, but it pays off and is enjoyable."
College Junior,5,"Literature students are spoiled at Marlboro. All the writing and Literature professors are the most brilliant people to work with who care deeply about their students. You will not get a better understanding of Literature, nearly any kind, at another school."
College Junior,5,"I love Marlboro. I have great friends, classes, and professors. I am learning more than I could have ever imagined here and love this place. Marlboro is my home, and I don't think I'd have liked going to any other school. It has its ups and downs, but the community, although sometimes frustrating, is really interesting and offers amazing support while the academics are the most challenging out there."
College Junior,5,"Academics are Marlboro are amazing. The relationship you build with your professors is astoundingly close and on a level of a colleague. Working on Plan is very trying and difficult, but for students who want a more independent and self-directed approach, Marlboro, within reason, allows you to study what you want and how you want."
College Junior,5,"Each student's curriculum is entirely self-created. We have no required classes. Students must submit 20 pages of quality, ""clear"" writing within the first year and a half of study. Portfolios are read and judged by at least two writing professors. But the Clear Writing requirement is the extent of Marlboro's curriculum hand-holding. This gives students a ton of room to be creative and follow their passions."
College Junior,5,"Our Outdoor Program (OP) is really cool. Randy, the back-woodsy but fatherly OP director, organizes a soccer and (forthcoming) a basketball team as well as the winter-spectacle, Broomball, as well as a million trips over the north-east."
College Junior,5,"I am an economics major at Marlboro, but I am studying the Austrian school of economics, which is quite a different science (more of a philosophy) than what my professor is experienced with teaching. I end up researching a lot on my own without much direction. But I came here aware that I would be creating my own education plan, and so far my professor has been extremely supportive and helpful."
Junior,4,"Marlboro is a great school if you find the right people. I think it's really a hit or miss. I found my people and because of them, I love it there."
College Freshman,4,"Freshmen aren't allowed to choose their dorms, like at most other colleges, but after that, you're free to choose whichever dorm you'd like! Dorms at Marlboro aren't fancy, but they're homey and spacious compared to the average college dorm. 

The best options for housing on campus, arguably, are Hendricks and Out of the Way a.k.a. Hilton House. Hendricks is basically a two-story, house. Yes, a house! Not your average dorm experience. There's a true sense of community in this dorm and almost a family-like quality to it. Additionally, it's right by the dining hall which is convenient on those gelid, snowy days. I was lucky enough to be placed in this dorm my freshman year and it's been a wonderful experience. Just keep in mind that it is a chem-free dorm usually, so drugs and alcohol are not allowed inside. However, whatever you choose to do outside of your dorm is up to you. Hilton House, on the other hand, is a modern building and the most recent addition to campus housing. The common space is huge for both dorms."
College Freshman,4,"While Marlboro is a very white school, there is tons of geographic diversity here being that over 70% of students are from out-of-state. Also, regardless of one's economic background, Marlboro has the potential to be very affordable. The school boasts two different full-tuition scholarships (Beautiful Minds and the Renaissance Scholarship). Only one can be earned obviously, but the fact of the matter is that there's ample opportunities to attend without the burden of financial struggle. The latter scholarship is looking to expand next year to attract more international students, so diversity is definitely on the rise as the school has taken great strides to improve on this. Moreover, because of its rural location, it's easier to be frugal with one's money -- a big bonus considering the budget of the average college attendee. 

There's also tons of diversity in terms of sexual orientation and gender at Marlboro. I know of at least three transgender freshman students who go here, which is quite a lot for a freshman class considering how tiny of a school we are. This year's incoming class is roughly 65 students, so that definitely says something. Politically, Marlboro is mainly liberal but the great thing is that many people are libertarian here and not necessarily Democrat. 

Marlboro is a very welcoming community full of warm, interesting people... who just so happen to live in a snowy hamlet on top of a hill. But the rewards are worth the social isolation. Being here really teaches you self-resilience, how to form close relationships, and much more."
College Sophomore,4,The courses are very interesting. There is a class called staging the apocalypse offered every few semesters. I want to take it.
College Sophomore,4,"We have 1 or 2 cases of assault a year on average, which sounds huge on a small campus, but look at larger campuses. They usually result from partying and stupidity following alcohol/drugs. The school is working hard to prevent this, all incoming students have to attend seminars on a variety of campus safety/health issue, with a highlight on what consent is. Personally, I'm a female-bodied, female-identifying student who is totally comfortable walking from my car to my dorm (maybe a 5 min. walk) at 2 am with headphones in."
College Sophomore,4,"There are no normal courses here! Or normal professors for that matter. The smaller sizes of classes (10 or less usually) are amazing, but do sometimes make it hard to have class when half are missing (2 people not there) and you're the only student. Luckily, that doesn't happen often."
College Sophomore,4,"The rooms are pretty big in general, and even if you have a triple, you usually will only have two people living in the room."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm about to complete my second year here on the hill. Sure, it was harder than I anticipated, but my professors have been there behind me every step of the way, and were always there to help pick me up. They are all super understanding and do their best to make sure that everyone gets the education they deserve."
College Senior,4,"Considering the ease with which drugs can be acquired and consumed around here, it's a pretty safe school. There is little to no peer pressure to consume drugs. It's really easy to avoid if you stay away from common party spaces. The presence of authority figures is scant, which in my opinion actually lowers the rate of binge drug use. People mostly just smoke a lot of Weed and Cigarettes. 

That being said, there is also a substantial sober populace and specialized housing to accommodate them."
College Senior,4,"People dig on campus housing a lot, but the truth is it's almost perfect. The dorms, which are admittedly a little run down, are spacious and architecturally interesting except for Marlboro Gardens, which is actually just a double-wide trailer. Everything is pretty close together. A long walk to class would be anything over 3 minutes here. Social atmosphere ranges from 'quiet, but genial' to 'downright raucous' depending on the dorm. Residents are a mixed bag. Some are great and also clean, but there are also quite a few spoiled kids who don't know how to clean up after themselves. As a result of that, some of the dorms are exceedingly dingy. The cottages and houses upperclassmen may live in are great except for their incredibly thin walls."
College Junior,4,"Only actual teams are basketball and soccer, HOWEVER we have a 24 hour gym and weight room and an Outdoor Program department that lends equipment for free including tents, sleeping bags, and skis, etc. There further is a boxing gym, a full basketball court, a fencing club, an indoor rock wall, and in winter broomball is popular. Soccer games are infrequent but a major event and rather rowdy."
College Junior,4,"Full of nerds very into their subject/field. Socially and geographically isolated. Look forward to close friends and small, sometimes way-too-intimate parties. Don't look forward to the absurd snow and ice in winter."
College Junior,4,"Most people leave their doors unlocked. Violent crime is pretty much non-existent on campus, and theft is a very rare occurrence. People will routinely leave their laptops, smartphones, etc. laying around in a public space for days at a time, completely unattended, with no ill results.

Sexual assault does happen. It's not the ""stranger jumps out from a dark alley"" kind of sexual assault (which is not a very common type to begin with). It will happen at a party when people have had a lot to drink and cannot properly consent. It is not a very frequent occurrence, but when it does happen, it is EXTREMELY poorly handled by the college's administration. We have recently hired several new staff members and taken many steps towards improving how we handle it as a community, though.

Overall, the Marlboro campus itself is very safe. The only people up here are students and college employees.

Brattleboro can be a little seedy in places."
College Junior,4,"The style and quality of the program you're in depends a lot on your advisor (later your ""Plan Sponsor""). Because we're very small, we typically have only one faculty member for each degree field (bar writing). For example, if you are studying Psychology, you will be working with Tom Toleno, and that's pretty much your only option. If you are studying Philosophy, you will be working with William Edelglass, and that's pretty much your only option. How much you enjoy the program really depends on how well you jive with that particular professor."
College Freshman,4,"Only had a year here, but I love it. Come visit and seek out students - they'll tell you that Marlboro is about learning and growing and having a good time doing it."
College Freshman,4,"Plenty if you're willing to drive to Brattleboro, Wilmington, or elsewhere."
College Freshman,4,"I walk into our dining hall with beer as a 19 year old and have a beer with dinner if I want to, any night of the week. It's great and trusting."
College Freshman,4,"Winters are frigid and long, but there's plenty of good skiing and boarding. Fall and spring are ASTOUNDING and summer is fantastic. Hard to beat Vermont in this category."
College Freshman,4,"Beautiful people here, but everyone will know if…"
College Junior,4,The media lap is open 24/7 and I've never been unable to get on a computer.
College Junior,4,"The Kitchen does a great job of making sure to respond to community feedback on the food. They make meals that appeal to anyone who is a meat-eater, vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, has allergies, etc. They are so lovely to talk with and truly are a part of our community. They work hard to make sure that everyone is satisfied and take criticism well when a meal isn't very good. They have dramatically changed for the better in recent years."
College Junior,4,Most students at Marlboro are offered some sort of aid.
College Junior,4,"It's easy to find a place to live in town and the price is manageable, especially when renting a place with other local students."
College Junior,4,"I would say that the guys as a whole are more attractive.   Nobody shaves, everybody wears greys/dark brown but the style is cool and fresh most of the time.  DOn't come here expecting a good dating scene."
College Senior,4,Students at Marlboro are interested in and participating in a wide variety of things. They can party but it is not the main event. People are focused on their education.
College Senior,4,"Very safe. Anyone not belonging on campus would be noticed immediately, it's such a small place. It's rare to have to call the town cops. Low key security and student safety personnel are all that's necessary for safety which is usually related to after hours health issues."
College Junior,4,"Marlboro's facilities are excellent. Many of the buildings were designed by very prominent architects. Campus has that traditional New England look of old, white farm buildings. But the traditional look is broken up by a few very modern-looking buildings like our library, the dance studio, ""Out of the Way"" residential housing."
College Junior,4,"Housing in the town of Marlboro is quite good, but you really need a car if you're living off campus, no matter how close the college is to the rental. Brattleboro housing is much less convenient, and students living there feel isolated from campus at times, especially the 6 months of winter! But those living in Bratt all really enjoy the life and culture of ""the city life."""
College Senior,4,"Marlboro provides semi-independent housing for its residents. This means we have one dorm that's a little further from campus that has apartment-style units with kitchens. Further, we have six cottages/cabins a little ways down the road, and two houses in the area dubbed ""Whittimore House"" and ""Red House."" Anyone living in these spaces can be off-meal plan."
College Freshman,4,"Here on the Hill. After having completed my first year here, I can say I'm really happy with my choice. My absolute favorite part about Marlboro is the academics - I've been a bookworm my whole life, and Marlboro is a paradise for bookworms. Because of the structure and size of the school you get to foster really close working relationships with your professors. The classes are all super amazing, but they do require a lot of work. I've also met some amazing people here who've made me feel welcomed and appreciated. Some people find the Marlboro experience ""claustrophobic,"" but the thing to remember is that a Marlboro education is what you make of it. If you make an effort to take your studies seriously and are enthused by an actively democratic community, Marlboro is awesome."
College Freshman,4,"Whatever Crowd You Prefer. Peer pressure doesn't really exist at Marlboro, so don't ever expect to be pressured into doing drugs/alcohol here. There are no Greek groups on campus as well, so alcohol fueled shenanigans are kept to a minimum. Like most liberal arts colleges in the country, drugs are present on campus. That being said, if you want to stay away from drugs/alcohol there is a strong Chem-free community here."
College Sophomore,4,"Nice Computer Lab – The computer lab has nice computers and a great new printer.  There is WiFi everywhere on campus, and the connection is generally fast.  Laptops are useful both for entertainment purposes and for academics, but it's certainly possible to make do without."
College Freshman,4,"The college is located near the town of Marlboro, a tiny place with a wildlife museum, post office, and fire department. A (free) 20-minute drive away is Brattleboro, a small artsy city with some pretty nice thrift stores, restaurants, tea and coffee lounges, a great natural food co-op, and a really awesome art-deco movie theater. There are many opportunities for all kinds of outdoor sports in the area, and I've never felt unsafe walking alone at night. Everyone here is pretty friendly."
College Freshman,4,Very Challenging – Classes are hard and you will be worked extremely hard but the education you receive is incredible.
College Freshman,4,"Good for a Private School – Most students complain about student debt, but then-again who doesn't. Marlboro is pretty generous with their financial aid packages and this leads to a large diversity in economic background. Work study jobs are also abundant but few pay more than minimum wage. But when it comes down to it, Marlboro is far from a public school and if finances are tight, you may work during the summers to cover the extra costs."
College Freshman,4,"Diverse in Excentricity – If you're into the average American Kid, you're not gonna find them here. Even the ""normal kids"" have their quirks and love them. What is common about both guys and girls is that they are going to be different and strong-willed. 
The unavoidable part of Marlboro is that the pool is small. Therefore you'll know anyone you hook-up with."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Small Dorm Life – The dorms at Marlboro are pretty small, around 20 or so to a dorm. Not every dorm has a common room, but this is a good thing. With so few people, it's better that they congregate in fewer spaces. A quick breakdown - Happy Valley- the common room has the only indoor smoking space, Happy Valley throws a lot of parties and drinks a lot. Howland- Two dorms smashed together with a large shared common room. Howland's bathrooms are shared. (but you could walk for 30 seconds and find a single) Random North- no common room, nothing to talk about. Random South- smells funny. Schrader is cooler than the Trailer, and Half-Way doesnt seem to do much. Pretty much every dorm is 2 minutes away from everything so really pick any dorm but Random South"
Recent Alumnus,4,"Parking is free in one of the three lots that are adjacent to campus, but if you're lazy enough to try to park on campus you may get a ticket, that you probably wont have to pay."
Recent Alumnus,4,"South Road or Brattleboro – The nearest town to Marlboro is Brattleboro, and its about half an hour away down Route 9 which has pretty much nothing on it. To get to Route 9 you take South Road from campus, which is lined with little houses in the woods, many of which are occupied by students. If you live in these houses, which can be cheap, you have to worry about having a car, or skis, because there is so much snow so much of the time. Getting to campus can be a real pain sometimes, and you may find that you're not as much a part of the social scene. For those who are willing to go even farther, very adult accomodations can be found in Brattleboro. One of the most popular being the ""ballroom"", an old converted ballroom that has always served as the unofficial flop house of Marlboro students caught in town overnight. Its huge, and cheap. You'll be lucky if you get to live there."
College Sophomore,4,"well is supper safe, we are on a mountain. accidents do happy when people are intoxicated, and it seems like it is much more of a big deal then it is because of the small amount of students hear. every one keeps there doors unlocked, and things don't get stolen. you can also just leave your things around and its fine. sometimes there will be petty theft, but everyone gets very angry about it and it ends shortly after it begins."
Freshman,2,"Dorms are super bad, spacious compared to other schools and the lack of students means more singles, but the mold is so bad especially over winter when its cold outside and warm inside, the mold grows like crazy in your windows. Lots of students developed sleeping and breathing issues because of it. The power goes out pretty often during big rain or snow storms and the dorms don't have generators to keep the heat going. Party life is pretty nonexistent, there's never more than like 10 people at a party at a time. The people are pretty hit or miss, some are super exclusive and not interested in you, some are really welcoming and inclusive but none of them are really people that will come up and talk to you. I feel like the only thing saving this school is the academics. Classes are really cool and unique and different all the time. (most) Professors are really chill and nice and actually care about you. There are really good study abroad options!"
College Sophomore,2,"We're in a very white state. I mean VERY white. We joke about the one black person in Bratt, but it really is a problem. It isn't that we don't want a more diverse campus, and we're super accepting. But when a poc comes to this very white campus, I can see why they might think twice. I know we're actively working on trying to fix this though."
College Sophomore,2,We don't sports. We play broomball. That means we get a bunch of people drunk and go onto the frozen ice of the Fire Pond and wack dodgeballs with various stick-like object. Blood is inevitable. But its fun?
College Senior,2,"It's a very white school in a very white state. Despite that, I think those people of color who do go here would consider racism pretty rare. It's also rare to find someone who is anti-LGBTQ, though they do spring up more frequently than racist folk. Overall, the political standpoint is pretty progressive, but there are some radical conservatives and closed-minded, identarian liberals sprinkled in to liven things up."
College Junior,2,there should not be an active fear of assault; incidents have been isolated and often the fault of alcohol/drug use. the policy used to be much more lenient on offenders which was awful but since they have been more closely followed things still have not improved in terms of health services/prevention
College Freshman,2,There isn't really anywhere to eat that isn't 30 min away.
College Freshman,2,I am not a fan of the parties at Marlboro.  There aren't really enough people to make it entertaining and the same few songs get played at every one.
College Junior,2,"The community is almost exclusively white, upper-classes people from suburbs in New England, who in their late teens and early twenties.

I could count the number of nonwhite students off the top of my head. It's absolutely not that more diversity is unwelcome; in fact, the community has been trying to brainstorm ways to increase diversity. It just doesn't seem to be happening.

When it comes to sexual orientation on campus, being queer is completely fine, normal, and perhaps even expected. However, the college is only recently dealing with issues of gender identity, and several trans* students have expressed that they felt uncomfortable with the college's atmosphere at times."
College Freshman,2,"While sexual orientation and gender issues provide a lot of diversity, socioeconomic/racial diversity are pretty poor. Students do come from all over the country. Coming from the south does not make me feel like an outlier, but rather an appreciated member of the community with a different background.

It's tough to transition to all the whiteness coming from a 75% black high school. VT is really white, unfortunately."
College Junior,2,"We don't have a huge level of diversity, as our location, cost, and atmosphere is very white. We are a small school, so there is also a lower number of students of different color, but there is a wide range of students with different sexual orientation or gender identity."
Niche User,2,"Dorms at Marlboro are a mixed bag. Out of the Way, for example, is really beautiful and spacious (and reserved for upperclassmen). Hendricks is also new and pretty. The cottages offer a measure of independence, while still being on campus (although there are issues with maintenance). Other dorms such as the Randoms, Howland, and Happy Valley are getting a bit decrepit looking, although almost all of the rooms are larger than at the average college."
College Junior,2,"Everyone is white and middle/upper class.  Recently things have gotten better--more international students in the past few classes, but not as good as it could be."
College Junior,2,The parking problem is bad. They should let us park. We are free.
College Senior,2,"I only give this a ""C"" because I think a lot of people would find it hard to live here. We have pretty intense weather from October on, and last year we actually had a snowstorm in October. We have ice storms, tons of snow, mud season, and weird apocalyptic winds. However, when spring is here, it is absolutely beautiful. If you like cold weather like me, you'll love it here all year round."
College Sophomore,2,"It's Ok – It's ok.  That's really kind of it.  If you want to take a class, chances are, as long as you're a junior or senior, they'll design a tutorial.  You'll have to work really hard, but you'll definitely learn lots.  There's not much variety here, though.  Everyone acts very individual and like themselves, but we all kind of tend to be similar selfs.  There can be tons of drama, especially if it snows and everyone's trapped on campus.  It's a small campus, with a small student-body.  Everyone on campus either loves or hates Marlboro, so it's kind of difficult to have the 'it's ok' opinion.  

One thing that is fantastic is that you WILL be accepted for whatever you are, and you'll be loved for it.  So long as you put yourself out there, others will take you in and be fantastic friends.  It's all about being yourself in the truest sense of that, not in some who-can-be-weirdest kind of way.  It gives you a great way of looking at the world.

One not-so-fantastic thing is that it is very difficult to actually see the world from inside Marlboro.  It's extremely isolated, and it's difficult to get away.  there's a different mindset that happens on campus, where cabin fever is definitely present and drama is thick in the air and something of a competition is taking place.  You will hear everyone's drama, and many people seem to forget that there is a whole wide world outside of this school and, well, themselves.  It's the kind of isolated place that forces you to reflect on yourself.  Constantly."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Really Existent – Unless you want to go down to Brattleboro, which you can really only do with a car unless you want to stay for odd hours (either five hours or about half an hour for walking around town- those are the times the vans allow).  If you do get into Brat, it has a few fair places to get food.  Coffee shops and bakeries are your best bet, and if you have the money, Fireworks is AMAZING.  

If you can't get a ride, there is no off-campus dining.  There is literally no where you could feasibly walk off campus that would give you food."
College Sophomore,2,Not Much – If you're into athletics you shouldn't come here. You can start any kind of club you want but there is no competition.
College Sophomore,2,"Unreliable and Irritating – I can't begin to express how many times internet goes down per week and how infuriating it is. Apparently the problem is solved if you use the Ethernet port, but most people have laptops. It's hard to do anything with out a personal computer, but I do know some people who have been able to get by. Also, the internet speed is erratic; sometimes it's decent, sometimes you will wait and wait. There is one computer lab on campus and it has 15-25 Macs. There's also a free b/w printer there for anyone to use unlimitedly, which is awesome."
Freshman,1,"Went here for about a year. It was bad. I got shunned because I didnt have the same values as everyone else and frankly, the education wasn't that great. I dont feel like I was learning anything. Just doing busy work. It was a huge waste of money and I was glad to transfer out of this shit hole. Also there's like 85 million cigarette butts everywhere and a lot of sexual assaults that go unreported. The professors are alright, but if you disagree with them they get snippy. There are other schools out there that are better, more professional and dont suffer from a hive mind."
Niche User,1,"I enjoyed the education that I got at Marlboro. The professors were very well educated and had a lot of passion for the subjects that they taught. That being said, the student body is lacking in a lot of areas. Namely, the diversity of the students: the majority of students come from upper middle class families where Mom and Dad are paying the tuition in cash, usually out of pocket. As is to be expected this creates an environment of unaware, self entitled children, who have no idea how the real world works. I found this environment to be extremely unhealthy and after my second year I transferred to a much larger, more well known institution. 

After leaving, I was able to compare salaries between my new schools degree and a Marlboro degree. I found that my salaries and offerings were higher coming from a bigger, more well known school then a small, private college in Southern Vermont that has cigarette butts all over campus, despite the no smoking laws."
College Freshman,1,Res Life tries to set all these rules but has no way to uphold them.
College Junior,1,"Dating at Marlboro is hard. Some people find a good match, but there isn't a wide variety of options, gossip travels fast, and often people are too busy for a real committed relationship. There are options in terms of hooking up, but its rare to find Marlboro relationships really work out long term. There are some great exceptions, but generally the dating scene isn't students main focus, so it isn't the greatest."
College Freshman,1,"No Peer Pressure, but It's There If You Want It – At Marlboro College, no one is going to force you to do anything you don't want to do. However, if you want to get high, drunk, or alter your state of mind in some other way, the options are totally available to you. There are some people on campus that are completely chem-free, and there is chem-free housing, and then there are other people who love Adderall. It's really not a big deal either way."
College Freshman,1,Food Sucks – The worst thing about Marlboro is the food.  About once a week there will be a great meal but usually it's awful.  There is a place to get food in the campus center but it's overpriced and the hours aren't concrete.
College Sophomore,1,"Snow Snow Snow – there is so much snow. all the time. and ice. falling is something you get use to. sometimes you cant leave campus for days because you are to scared of the rode. it makes it harder for the fire department to send people, or ambulances. in 2010 there was what we called the apocalypse, where it was raining freezing rain, when we woke up everything had a thick cover of ice (tree branches, grass, electric weirs, everything!), we ended up getting evacuated because we had no electricity, phone lines, hot water, and in most buildings heat. the cooks couldn't make it to campus so the dean had to make food for all of us. very hectic and not fun!"
College Sophomore,1,"The diversity is almost none. There are like 310 kids here, and maybe six are black, three are Asian, and 12 are gay. Mostly everyone is straight, white, and middle- to upper-middle class."

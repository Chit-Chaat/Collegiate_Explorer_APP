Junior,5,"I love going to Aquinas because of how much individual help I can get from the teachers. Because we're a small college, classes for my Major generally consist of 8 students, making it possible for me to get loads of one-on-one help. My professors are all Doctorate level, and they all take the time to help me perform the best I can. 

Aquinas also has a wonderful Writing Center, where we are able to help our fellow students. I've found a home for myself there over the years, and I've discovered many opportunities for growth. I am in my Junior year and already taking my Senior capstone. I believe that I am being prepared well for life after college, whether that means going to a graduate school or finding a job right away."
Junior,5,"From the beginning of my journey, I wanted to go for an English Literature degree. I was able to find a place for myself in the Writing Center from my orientation day, when I got to pick my first classes. From there, I have taken as many of the English writing/literature classes as I could, up until this point. I feel confident that I have a broad enough understanding of English and writing to fit in at most writing-focused jobs, editing, teaching, or otherwise. I have already had experience in writing the online protocol for the Writing Center, and I have leadership experience from being president of our AQ Writers Guild."
Freshman,5,"Aquinas College has a beautiful and historical campus. They are surrounded by woods so there are many trails to walk through and just relax after studying for long hours. They have small class sizes, which makes it a lot easier for the professor to get to know and help everyone. Everyone is so friendly here. They make it feel like home. The campus is also right near downtown Grand Rapids on top of many other big towns. There is always somewhere to go and something to do. Grand Rapids is beautiful and fun."
Freshman,5,"The professors did a great job with teaching online. They took many steps to ensure you understood the information they were giving you. They did FaceTime calls and linked videos for you to watch. Overall, online classes at Aquinas College are great and pretty easy."
Freshman,5,nothing that what makes the college special it as a character and vibe that makes you want to stay there
Niche User,5,"I enjoyed the campus a lot. Even though it’s down town, the trees make the campus feel secluded like you’re in the country. I live in the country so it reminds me of home."
Freshman,5,I really like how small the school is. the classes are intimate and it is easy to get help if you need it.
Sophomore,5,"The school has a small student to faculty ratio. Overall classes are very good. Dorms are not the greatest, very outdated. After the freshman year, students have a good chance of getting out of the dorms and moving into an on campus house."
Sophomore,5,The campus is beautiful and the community is amazing. Everyone is so friendly and there is so much to do. There are also many opportunities for class help.
Niche User,5,"AQ is an awesome place to be. The campus is gorgeous, the professors genuinely care about their students, and it’s one of the friendliest campuses I’ve ever been on."
Sophomore,5,I love aquinas so much! It is a great atmosphere for me because there is always something to do and always someone to talk to. I am apart of a few of the many clubs offered here at aquinas. I go to on campus events and there is usually at least one held every other day. The  night life in Grand Rapids is very nice and leaves a lot of room to do something at most hours. I love the location because there are so many opportunity's that can come from living so close to GR. I wouldn't chose any other college to gain my degree.
Junior,5,Aquinas College has a great atmosphere. AQ has a loving community that welcomes all people. Not only that but faculty of Aquinas College are always willing to help their students and go out of their way to make sure that everyone is understanding the material.
Niche User,5,Small faculty to student ratio. Great community service opportunities. Good opportunities for continuing education students like myself.
Graduate Student,5,The professors and admitting staff are so accessible and helpful.  They are very knowledgeable in their fields and always willing to answer questions.
Niche User,5,Everyone is so friendly and very willing to help with any questions you have. Administrations answered every question I had and really helped me with financial aid packaging and scholarships and grants. The campus is beautiful but slightly dated which really adds character to the atmosphere.
Sophomore,5,"I am an upcoming sophomore at Aquinas College. The pros of the college are the beautiful campus located close to downtown Grand Rapids, the kind and helpful dynamic of the student body and faculty, and the resources that are constantly put forth in order to help students to succeed. These include tutors, mentors, counseling, campus ministry, academic advising, job and career help, and even escorts form campus safety. Many scholarships are available and achievable. Students take initiative and are leaders in class and in the community. The cons are rising tuition costs of around $5,000 per student that are going toward the new science building even for non-science majors, poor quality of the food in the main cafeteria, cramped freshman dorm rooms that need new furniture and carpets, unreliable wifi, slowness of campus safety in responding to requests for escorts, and too few perks for honors students."
Freshman,5,"From the moment I set foot on campus, it felt like a second home. The staff were extremely helpful and welcoming, as well as the other students. The classroom environment is incredible, I feel as if I learn something new every day. If I had one complaint, it would be food and scheduling. Scheduling is a mess, and many things conflict. The food is sometimes poor quality, with not a lot of options."
Freshman,5,Great campus located in its own little area with the downtown reach of the city right there! Fell in love with the campus and location as soon as I arrived!
Junior,5,"Aquinas College is a small school, where most of the students are athletes as well. I completely love how professors and faculty members take care of the athletes and all the students as individuals.  Academic and Athletic programs are very successful here, and there is all types of environment to be as good of a student-athlete as possible."
Junior,5,"The campus is beautiful and so is the learning experience! The support that is offered even to a returning colleges student is outstanding. There are a few professors that are a bit outdated in their thinking but it is all and all a wonderful school. The department I am in is amazing and I would highly suggest anyone looking for a higher education to consider Aquinas, even those that are not Catholic."
Alum,5,"A small school that's not for everyone, but the education is unparalleled. As an alum that now works at a Tier 1 research school...AQ offers a much better education for workplace preparedness. The presentation skills alone were worth it! In addition, the professors actually know your name and care enough to work with you and help you individually with your barriers and struggles."
Sophomore,5,I love how friendly everyone on campus is to one another. The professors are excellent and get to know their students. They care about you and will do whatever it takes to help you succeed. The class sizes are small so it makes it easier to learn. This campus is beautiful and everything is within walking distance.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus and the people in it. Everyone is here to support and accept one another. Each of the professors that I have had want to see you succeed and will put in extra time to see you pass. Also, for athletics the coaches and staff understand that you are a student athlete. While they want you to do the best you can in a sport they understand that you are here for an education. I believe that Aquinas is an amazing college full of great people."
Junior,5,Aquinas has great professors. You really get to know them and they do not let you fall behind in your studies. The campus is beautiful and the students are friendly and welcoming.
Junior,5,When deciding on a college my senior year of high school I knew I wanted to attend a smaller school. That is exactly what Aquinas College is. Since it is such a small campus the amount of students in a class is usually around 18. This is very convenient because that means professors know each student by name and it also allows student more one on one time with their professors if help is needed. Professors always respond to student's questions in a timely manner. Not only are academics great at this school but also the campus and city that it is in. There is never a dull moment in Grand Rapids and you can always find something to do.
Sophomore,5,"I am a sophomore at Aquinas College and I absolutely love it. The campus is beautiful and feels like home as you wonder through it. The classes are small so can ask many questions and have the opportunity to become close with your teachers and peers. There is also always help for anything you need. From tutoring, to help writing a paper, to career counseling, if you have questions there is always an answer. I could not imagine a better college to call home than Aquinas. Go Saints!"
College Junior,5,Our professors are caring and help students to the best of their ability to help them succeed. Something I did not experience when I took a summer class at Grand Rapids Community College this summer. Aquinas College professors are wonderful.
College Junior,5,"This accredited school is held with a very high respect when employers are looking at a degree From Aquinas. Jobs/Interviews love to see a degree from Aquinas, as well as a department on campus dedicated to finding internships for Aquinas Students."
College Junior,5,"I believe that living on campus is a wonderful experience. Not only do you get to stay with the community for long periods of time with this added feature, but you get to live with your friends and classmates, creating bigger bonds of friendship."
College Junior,5,"I would choose this school again in a heartbeat! Everyone knows each other, and everyone is very nice and friendly to each other. It is like one big family, Teachers and Staff included."
College Sophomore,5,"The campus safety office may be small and old, but the people who run it are the best. They will get you on parking tickets frequently, but are always there if you need help. They will even walk you back from the library if you don't feel safe."
College Freshman,5,I am only a freshman so I have only taken General Education classes so far but they have been good. I really enjoy my professors and the people on campus. I was able to get a job at the school easily and feel very welcomed and happy here. The different clubs and volunteer opportunities are great as well.
College Freshman,5,"I have never had one doubt about finding a job after i graduated from this school. The career center is so enthusiastic about helping students achieve. Our alumni love current AQ students and other alumni so we have a big, strong network for possible employment opportunities. There are an insane amount of internship opportunities that we are notified of and highly encouraged to go after."
College Freshman,5,"Classes are extremely small, which i love. I believe it really enhances efficiency and effectiveness in academics. All Aquinas professors are absolute experts in their fields, they love what they do and it shows. Our faculty is so kind, passionate, and dedicated to student success. We have a very wide variety of courses, majors, and minors."
College Freshman,5,"Our on-campus housing is welcoming, unique, and fun! We have the coolest RA's and Campus Life gives us SO many activity opportunities."
College Freshman,5,"Our students love it here so school spirit is second-nature. We may not be a D-1 school, but we appreciate our teams and cheer them on enthusiastically."
College Freshman,5,"I love everything about Aquinas. The faculty and the students take care of each other, we want everyone to succeed. Our campus is absolutely gorgeous and there is always something to do at AQ!"
College Freshman,5,"Aquinas College is in the best sense my new home away from home. I chose to go here last minute, and only because it was the easiest option available. My hometown is about 30 minutes away from campus, and I had desperately wanted to move far away for college, potentially even out of state. Even though my attendance at AQ sort of fell into place and was never a conscious decision, I am forever thankful that it worked out this way. In all honesty, I hated the first few months that I was here. I live on campus, and even though I have friends from high school attending college here too, I always felt alone and out of place. That seems to be a common theme for many people no matter what college they go to though; the initial transition is generally going to be pretty rough. With time I met better friends who I genuinely like and appreciate, and classes became more routine and less stressful. Aquinas is one of those schools where either you love it or you hate it, and I have an even greater appreciation for the life I've made here thanks to the fact that I've experienced both ends of the spectrum."
College Freshman,5,Our campus safety is very professional and always look out for the benefit of their students. They work long after hours to make sure our campus is safe.
College Freshman,5,"I run Women's Cross Country and Track and Field. Our athletic facility is amazing and really helps in our training. We have top notch athletics in some sports, but others are mediocre."
College Freshman,5,I thinkAQ students host some of the best and most unique parties in West Michigan.
College Freshman,5,We know how to find fun and clean entertainment.
College Sophomore,5,Our campus safety are well trained and prepared to respond to any situation. Sexual assault is not an issue at Aquinas College because of our staff and students ardent stance against such heinous acts of abuse.
College Sophomore,5,The classes are intimate and the professors are personable. It's easy to get to know your professor and learn what their realistic expectations are of you as a student.
College Sophomore,5,The orientation days were unforgettable. The people you meet and networks you establish will set you up for a happy and meaningful undergraduate college experience.
College Freshman,5,"Aquinas College is a great school, very supportive. Best by far"
College Sophomore,5,"From the moment of my first visit I felt very welcomed here. All the students and faculty are very kind and helpful. Another great thing about the school is how all the professors actually know your name and care about you. They are all willing to provide extra help if necessary, and are open to helping you with others topics that may not be school related."
College Sophomore,5,Aquinas College is one of the best Liberal Arts Colleges in the country. It offers countless majors and degree programs. The campus is beautiful and the faculty is outstanding.
College Freshman,5,"Being a college freshman I have learned how to time manage my running, school work, and my social life. I grew up near the corners of Aquinas College and from talking to future professors I learned how to be a stong, independant, and curious future student. Since I am interested in becoming a Physcian Assistant, Aquinas College is giving me the resources of a cadaver lab, and a strong biology department to prepare me for graduate school. Aquinas has advised me to familiarize myself with the science department by being involved in a research and certified nursing assistant class. Because of this school, I am well prepared to enter into the world of independance and adulthood in my upcoming college career."
College Freshman,5,Aquinas offers a small private liberal arts college.  It is located in an area that offers the benefits of being close to a large city but far enough away from downtown that it is secluded and peaceful.  The tuition and scholarships is very competitive with state schools. That is exactly what I was searching for and found.
College Sophomore,5,I am a student-athlete at Aquinas and love it! The facilities are great and all very new. A lot of the population of my students at my school are athletes. Some athletic events are more popular than others and it sometimes depends on whether the sport teams are doing well or not in their season. A majority of the students that attend the athletic events are athletes of another sport. The sport teams at Aquinas are bonded by being students athletes and supporting each other. It's great to have a big support system the way we do.
College Senior,5,"GR has a bus system and near by schools: GRCC (some students take summer classes here), GVSU (which some students interact with) and a couple of other Christian colleges. GR is a bigger city than the surrounding ones so nightlife, dining and entertainment are constant. Top breweries in the nation, a variety of clubs: country, hip hop, jazz..we have the Deltaplex and the Van Andel Arena where sporting events, concerts and other entertainment occur. Plenty of museums where they give student discounts and if you're an art student free admission to Meijer Gardens. Art Prize is another nationally recognized event GR has (and the color run!!)."
College Sophomore,5,"I stated before how the department was smaller, but that is what I expected and I wanted. I am better able to establish personal relationship with each professor which opens the possibility for references and recommendations, along with networking."
College Sophomore,5,"The program I am in allows for the most leeway when it comes to adding minors and/or another major because the total required credits is one of the lowest. The department is smaller, but that is what you expect at a private college. After my first semester I already had established a relationship with each professor in the mathematics department. I truly value this. This was one of my big reasons for choosing a small school."
College Junior,5,"I love the apartments provided they have everything including stoves,fridges,wash and drying internet and heating and cooling."
College Senior,5,"We are quite modern in our facilities. The one place that needs major updating is the science building INSIDE. outside looks great, its too old inside. The academic building has a nice touch to it being so old so that doesn't need to be necessarily ""UPDATED"""
College Senior,5,"We might not be the best teams out there, but we have a great gym, a great work-out facility, and we are now getting an indoor track field."
College Senior,5,Grand Rapids has a huge craft beer scene all over the city. You can go to any of the hundreds of hipster bars around the city and get tasty craft beer for relatively cheap prices!
College Senior,5,Our counseling and security centers take sexual assault very seriously and our sexual assault rates are extremely low. We have 24/7 counseling services if needed.
College Sophomore,5,The recycling program is epic!! Nothing goes to waste. By next year the school has a goal of producing no waste campus wide!
Junior,4,"The school has handled the transition to online better than I could've expected, but online classes are incredibly different and difficult."
Freshman,4,I took 2 fully online courses and 1 hybrid course. Professors do a fantastic job teaching online and their online office hours are readily available.
Freshman,4,"I love the campus of Aquinas College, it is in the middle of the city of Grand Rapids, yet feels like you are in a peaceful forest."
Junior,4,"I do enjoy Aquinas College a decent amount! it is located in an amazing area of Easttown and is so close to downtown Grand Rapids which is awesome for fun activities. classes are small and so is the school, I graduated from a high school class double the size I am going to from Aquinas. If you like a small school then you will like it here."
Senior,4,My online experience with Aquinas is not much different from my overall experience.  Where possible I try to stick to in-person classes because that is how I learn the best.
Senior,4,Overall I would say that Aquinas College is a very good school to attend.  They are very supportive of their students and do their level best to help them succeed during and after college which I think is important.  All the staff and faculty are more than willing to help students with whatever problem they might be having whether school-related or otherwise.  My biggest criticism is that for a Catholic College they do not uphold the Catholic tradition as well as I would hope.
Junior,4,"Following a campus tour, I realized the beauty that Aquinas had to offer and how it was a great fit for me as I wanted a more intimate education compared to a large university. Aquinas college is home to great student life and engagement. I was chosen to be apart of next year’s E-board fulfilling the role of treasurer for lxsa, to continue to promote the college's mission statement and becoming a voice to reach out to Prospective Latinx students to success and graduation. I found a great community and a sense of welcome from my engagement and academic life at Aquinas."
Junior,4,Aquinas is a smaller campus yet has all of the amenities of a much larger college. The number of students to professor ratio allows students to get the extra support needed for success.
Niche User,4,I love how everyone is a community and everyone supports each other. Even the sports teams go to each others games and cheer everyone on. It doesn't really even matter your religion your cared for every way
Freshman,4,"I am a second semester freshman who resides off-campus. I enjoy the overall environment of the campus, and the professors are dedicated in their subjects, focusing on learning and thorough understanding rather than grades."
Junior,4,"I like Aquinas' small environment. You get really close with the professors and other students. However, the school does feel too small at times."
Niche User,4,The atmosphere was very calming and they answered all of my questions.They were very kind to us while they took us on a campus tour.I don't feel like they should change anything.
Freshman,4,I've really enjoyed Aquinas so far. It's a great little community with ton of ways to get involved. All of the staff members and professors are very intellent and nice.
Freshman,4,"I've only been here for 3 weeks, but it's been great overall!  The teachers are friendly, it's easy going, and it's much more fun than high school!  The only reason for 4 star is because the food isnt great and neither are the dorms."
Senior,4,"One of the best things about this college is the professors. Almost all of them truly care about your education and are willing to help you in any way they can. Every professor has to have at least 2 office hours a week where you can drop by and talk to them about anything. There is an incredible network of people to help with every aspect of your education. The only problems are the price tag, and the very old buildings. But they give out a lot of scholarships and are working on renovating the buildings."
Freshman,4,"The professors care about you and help you when you have questions! The campus is located near the city, but you feel like you are in your own village in the woods and don't realize the city is so close. The only downfall at the college is the food and the dorms. The wifi used to be an issue, but it is currently being updated and is a lot better. There are so many different things to do on campus and many things to do off campus. Grand Rapids is only a short walk away. Even though the campus isn't as big as some university's, you are always meeting new people and good friends. The sport teams at Aquinas are very good and a lot of fun to watch. While I have been at school there have been a lot of varsity teams that have made it to nationals. If you are looking to be a well rounded individual  aquinas provides that for you because it is a Liberal arts college."
Niche User,4,"While AQ is great for more timid students, it is a very small school and doens't have the same opportunities as the larger schools in the area. That being said, students do get a lot of one-on-one attention."
Alum,4,Aquinas is a hidden gem in the middle of Grand Rapids. Just a short Uber to downtown or a quick walk to East town.
Senior,4,I have been at Aquinas for three years now and have loved every second of it! Everyone is so welcoming and friendly and the relationships that I have created with the professors and people here are strong and last lasting.
Freshman,4,"Both the students and staff here are very helpful and will jump at any opportunity to help you. This made me feel very loved and important. I'm a fan of smaller schools- which is why I wanted to come here! It's close to my house and it's a small school that's perfect for me. I'm also a fan of their Track and Field program and I know a few people that are on the team. Overall Aquinas College, is exactly what I was looking for and I will never have anything bad to say about this university."
Freshman,4,"The small, urban setting of Aquinas gives me the scenery I love while being just 10 minutes away from downtown. Besides the location, the professors and all of the other employees at Aquinas are helpful and want you to succeed to the best of your ability while attending their college. I have enjoyed my first year so far and am excited for the next three!"
Sophomore,4,The professors are great! They really care about your education and your mental health as well. They do their best to try and help students out whenever possible.
Niche User,4,"I plan on going to Aquinas this up coming fall. I have been on two visits and have loved it every time! people are very, nice proffers contacted me directly when I applied and I LOVE the campus and location."
Junior,4,"I love my experience here at Aquinas. It is such a unique school and I love being in a big city. It is the perfect size for me and the campus is beautiful. Not very diverse, but great academic support and clubs."
Junior,4,I love it here at Aquinas! The campus is beautiful and while not far from the city you feel like you are still in the country. While some trees are being removed for campus additions such as a new chapel and an add on to the science wing it is still very beautiful. Everyone is friendly as well and teachers can give you one on one time if you need help.
Freshman,4,Aquinas is great if you love a close knit community. The professors really care about your success. The people are very friendly and the surronding area is great. Aquinas offers lots of non academic events that are for just about everybody. The courses are challenging but rewarding and really prepare you for your future career
Sophomore,4,"It is a small school which is great for some people, not so great for others. Most of the professors genuinely care about you. The campus is impossible to beat."
Sophomore,4,"Aquinas College is very small, which allows for you to easily connect with peers and professors. Class sizes are generally small as well and professors are required to have weekly office hours. Very close to downtown Grand Rapids and generally very safe."
Freshman,4,"The transition to college was rough,  but I found a sense of genuine community at Aquinas. They have great professors; furthermore,  they have a plethora of services to meet your academic, spiritual,  and physical needs."
Freshman,4,"I loved the community I found in my areas of study (English and Women's Studies), and made some good connections going forward in my college career. I am looking forward to continuing my education here."
Freshman,4,"At Aquinas College, I am able to join many clubs and organizations, the food has a great variety, the dorms are a bit old, the professors I've taken so far are very welcoming, and the other students are kind."
Junior,4,I love how the staff are very nice and welcoming. I feel that the professors actually care about my education and want me to succeed. The oreintation students help freshman move in and feel comfortable. The class sizes are small. The campus is beautiful. Also they provide many scholarships to cover tuition costs.
Junior,4,"There are so many different trees on campus; it makes every season so much more beautiful. With just that, it make school there a little bit more bearable. You feel secluded from the rest of the world even though you're just 10 minutes away from downtown Grand Rapids. It's so amazing."
Freshman,4,"I really like the size of the school, I feel very at home there. You get to know a lot of faces and figure out where people study and hangout because of how small it is. The campus itself is absolutely gorgeous, there are so many trees everywhere. It has been frustrating in regards to the fact that it is a Catholic School by name, but I don't find it to really hold to that identity. I believe Aquinas tries too hard to accommodate everyone, causing the loss of the Catholic identity, which is frustrating for someone attending a Catholic College in part due to the religious affiliation. In terms of professors, i've had really great professors so far who really seem to care about my success. "
College Junior,4,"When the college is in a sketchy area of Grand Rapids, the school can only do so much. I believe that with the area that we have the school, Our campus is extremely safe. The many lock-downs we have had I believe are due to the area, and are handled wonderful."
College Junior,4,"Our Athletics are good! Not the part that our school is known for, but still a good part of campus!"
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone I've talked to who is an alumni to AQ has gotten a job, and the school is very willing to help you find a internship."
College Freshman,4,"There are lots of interesting less known sports at Aquinas, like womens hockey and bowling, but the school only seems to focus on boys LAX and soccer."
College Junior,4,"For the most part, campus is relatively safe, Campus safety overall does good job"
College Junior,4,"Most athletic teams are fairly competitive, school rallies behind and supports most of them"
College Junior,4,"Do not regret coming to this school at all, ended up being one of the best choices of my life"
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy Aquinas, I'm truly glad they renovated and rejuvenated the economics department or I would have transferred. I love that any student can find their niche and there is a club/department for almost every interest."
College Freshman,4,"I feel like the academic side of Aquinas is great.  However, I think that the cost to live in the dorms is way too high and I dislike how difficult it is to get exempt off campus even if you live somewhat close to school."
College Freshman,4,"I have liked most of my professors so far.  I like the studying abroad options that are offered.  I wish I didn't have to take some of the required classes, but it isn't too much of an inconvenience.  Registering for classes is somewhat stressful.  My workload is heavy but not unmanageable."
College Freshman,4,"I feel pretty safe at my school.  The text message and email alerts are a very nice and easy heads-up to anything that is happening around or on campus.  I have never gotten an escort from campus safety, but I love knowing that it is an option.  There has been some crime around campus lately that is a little unsettling, but I do feel safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"I think that the theatre department will do a good job preparing me for the future.  It seems professional and full of talented people, so I am very excited to work more with AQ Theatre."
College Freshman,4,"The courses fulfill the objectives that they are supposed to.  I like most of my professors.  I enjoy the smaller class sizes, and I like how the courses are set up and taught.  There is a pretty good variety of courses as well."
College Freshman,4,"I like that it is a somewhat small school; I think I would have been overwhelmed somewhere that was large.  Everybody seems pretty friendly, and there is a sense of community.  The theatre department is amazing, and I am very excited to continue working with those wonderful people.  I'm very excited for my future at my school."
College Freshman,4,I personally feel very safe on campus even though we are so close to the city. If you ever feel unsafe you can just call Campus Safety and they will drive you where you need to go. I walk around campus at night and feel safe.
College Freshman,4,As far as I know and have heard Aquinas works very well with helping one get internships and jobs after graduation. Alumni are very involved and proud to be a Saint as well.
College Freshman,4,"Although Aquinas does not have a football team, the other sports are very popular such as soccer, hockey, and lacrosse. There is a lot of school spirit for these sports and many people from campus go to the games. The indoor track is new and very nice."
College Freshman,4,"I love all the school has to offer including a variety of clubs, classes, and volunteer opportunities. I also really enjoy the small school atmosphere and how friendly everyone is at Aquinas. The school gives out a lot of helpful scholarships and the school staff is always helpful and considerate."
College Freshman,4,"Campus safety works hard to make sure that everyone is safe on campus.  Personally, I feel quite safe living here at Aquinas.  The campus is relatively secluded, so the outside world has limited access to our school grounds."
College Freshman,4,"Aquinas offers a huge variety of courses.  I have found that a liberal arts education makes these kinds of things available to me and we are constantly encouraged to take classes out of our comfort zone.  Professors are always very kind and accommodating, and willing to help you when you need it."
College Freshman,4,"From the statistics I have seen, Aquinas is very good at helping out its students with their lives after graduation.  There are many people who help when it comes to job/internship prospects."
College Freshman,4,"Aquinas is great, of course there are some things that could be changed, but that is to be expected at any school.  Overall, I think I made the right decision in choosing Aquinas."
College Freshman,4,"I feel extremely safe on campus. I can walk the entire campus in about 8 minutes. After it gets dark, Campus Safety will pick you up if you feel unsafe walking home. Campus Safety is helpful and cooperative with students, they definitely have our back. We have emergency phones and buttons across campus to press if needed. All of the resident halls require I.D. card access and a key, they are quite secure. We have security cameras in all of our buildings. Aquinas is in East Grand Rapids which is a very safe, wealthy, and family based community. I'm not worried about crime, on campus and off."
College Freshman,4,"Since Aquinas is such a small college, it often feels like its one of the safest places on earth. The campus is covered in trees, and they just work to kind of block out the rest of the world. Sometimes if there is a robbery near AQ we'll have a lockdown, but due to the safety measures there isn't a large threat. The area surrounding Aquinas seems to be perfectly safe during the day, but at night there are places that students just don't go and there is an unspoken rule about travelling in packs off campus. I always feel very safe on campus, and I'll walk by myself regardless of what time it is at night, which may not be the smartest. I haven't heard of anyone having trouble, but that doesn't mean there isn't potential for something bad to happen."
College Freshman,4,"School is kind of just school. A lot of whether or not you like a course or a professor will probably rely on how interested you are in the topic. Class sizes, professors, and class variety are all great. Every once in a while I've come across a professor or class that is just hard to work with, but its never anything that I can't handle. Basically education is just going to class and trying hard. If students don't put in the effort professors and advisers will try their best to help them, but at the college level you have to make yourself do the work."
College Freshman,4,"It seems that at Aquinas a large percentage of the student population participates in some sport, after all it is a private college and athletic scholarships make a huge difference for tuition. That being said, I don't participate in athletics and it hasn't made a huge difference. For the athletes themselves, a large portion of their social aspect is defined by their team; they eat, practice, workout, and play together. There isn't a huge amount of fan support for the teams, but those who do attend games are typically the same people every time. Sporting events are a great way to spend time with friends and give a little love back to the school and its students. Aquinas tends to feel like one tight-knit community, and athletics are definitely one aspect that pulls it closer together."
Niche User,2,"This school claims to be Catholic, however is very anti-Catholic, the academics are average, however the students engage in highly immoral behavior and the school does nothing to preserve church teaching witching campus boundaries."
Senior,2,The major departments are very small so there are no choices in teachers if they are poor. The parties are not worth attending. They won’t let me take a minor within the same major. If I did it again I would not go back.
Niche User,2,"My experience at AQ was not as good as anticipated. I moved into a dorm right away.The campus life was not stimulating and most of the time I was cooped up in my dorm eating and watching TV.I felt that the adjunct profs were more passionate and educated than some of the permanent faculty.Many courses were not liberal in study.For example my sociology course was founded in an obscure area of study from one point of view,not what I would call an intro. course.I withdrew from AQ partway through my sophomore year.I was struggling with personal issues and I was not finding help with AQ despite my many attempts.My advisor was rude,unkind,and had no time for students.I found this out through her attitude in email,after class,and scheduling appointments.I came to her when I was struggling and instead of providing academic or personal counseling she reminded me how poorly I was doing in other classes.This was a true turning point for me and contributed for my loss of hope at this college."
Freshman,2,"Besides drinking, there's little to do on campus during the week or on the weekends. I do really like my professors but some classes seem to be easier than they should be for a college class. The food here is mediocre. Dinner and Lunch options revolve around how many different ways they can prepare chicken."
College Freshman,2,I do not live on campus but from what I have seen from classmates who do live on campus it is way to expensive for the amount of space there is and signal as well as everything else. Due to how old the buildings are it makes me think that is why it can be very pricey.
College Freshman,2,I feel like I should have gone to a different school. I also feel like I am throwing away a lot of money.
College Freshman,2,Don't know anything about the Greek life here.
College Senior,2,It's a very liberal school and students aren't listened to unless they fit into the school's box of approval.
College Freshman,2,I didn't realize what small schools were like and it is not what I wanted for my college experience
College Sophomore,2,The food in Wege is almost always under-par.
College Freshman,2,The food needs large improvements
College Freshman,2,"Wege breakfast is killer, but everything else sucks. Quinoa cake? Edamame cake? They have very odd options and it's nice they try, but if they stuck with the classics they would be good. Pasta and pizza are always a safe bet. Salad option is subpar"
College Freshman,2,"The sport houses have parties, but parties get busted very fast around here and the parties are never big or very loud and fun"
College Freshman,2,the rooms are tiny and my room is smaller than the average room. It's very hard for us to move our furniture around and I would not suggest lofting your bed if you don't want to hit your head multiple times.
College Senior,2,"If you ever eat in Wege, it's not a great experience afterwards. If you eat at The Corner Café it is much much better."
College Senior,2,"It's hard to find the house you are looking for with the right amenities and for the right price. The school does not help at all with finding off-campus places, even though they ""try""."
College Senior,2,"I live off campus, so this doesn't really affect me but it is a catholic school so the rules are pretty strict compared to a normal, public institution. With that in mind, however, compared to other catholic schools, we are seen as very lenient. Campus is on a fast track to become completely smoke free. Right now we have various designated smoking areas. Our campus is small so parking is very limited and visitor parking is almost non-existent. We are not a dry campus, so if you're 21, you can drink on campus and at on campus events. There are relatively harsh punishments for underage drinking and if you are caught with drugs on campus, the police will almost definitely be involved."
College Junior,2,There are not a lot of parking spots.  Often times students must park on the opposite side of campus from where they live and cannot easily get a new parking spot if they move from one semester to the next. There is very little visitor parking and people who are just staying for a couple of minutes do not want to fill out the guest parking app and paying the fee.
College Sophomore,2,"The student population at Aquinas College is roughly two-thirds female and one-third male. The overwhelming majority of students are white, presenting a noticeable contrast to the surrounding community, which has a much higher percentage of black people than the college. Other minority races at the college are even less common, but are still present."
College Sophomore,2,"Drug use seems to be about average when compared to other schools.  The widespread nature of it is concealed fairly well by students who us.  Alcohol consumption is more common than drug use, but typically does not happen on campus.  Peer pressure isn't very high for either factor and the school's policies are strictly enforced whenever someone is caught in either case."
Niche User,1,"I feel terrible bad for this school and failed to raise up a girl named Lauren who is so careless about her information online and is racist towards the black community about #blacklivesmatter, such ignorance. Shame on her"
Alum,1,This college is about the same as Grand Rapids community college in terms of practical studies. I went to both cc and aq and they are the same quality.  Aquinas college is extremely overpriced and cares little about being catholic or job placement. Job placement is a joke.
Sophomore,1,"This college DOES NOT CARE about you as a student. They will lure you in with all sorts of great food, offers, and LIES. I haven't eaten a decent meal since I've gone here, and my parents pay a ton of money for this place. The professors do not care about you, and the academic advisers will NOT help you. Forget trying to get an internship.. they will tell you to visit Grand Valley to get one. Do not go here if you want to be at a place that will help you succeed. The credit hours they force  you to take in order to ""graduate on time"" is ridiculous, and they only offer a very limited amount of each class. This means, GOOD LUCK getting the classes you NEED to continue on with your education. Overall, this college experience has been so terrible, and I wish no one would ever go here."
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you are a biology major, RUN!!! Don't walk. The professors make the courses purposely hard. I studied so much more at AQ then I did attending Michigan State. I got much better grades at State. Biology professors only look out for the students that have parents that are doctors, educators, and engineers. The favorites get special treatment, the laboratory technician jobs. The don't care about you as a person. 

I understand that it is a higher learning environment, but if you need a job do not go here. Whereas if you are apart of some kind of sport they bend over backwards for you. Also if your parents are blue collar workers consider yourself as a space filler. 

Don't get me started on adviser! Basically mine is the biggest D*** ever! I had to schedule my advising appointments around his availability and he didn't put his advising appointment sign up sheet until the week of advising! 

I have never lived on campus and to be honest the dorms look disgusting. Campus is near a shoddy part of the city and you never see any campus safety. There is not near enough light to make you feel safe if you have a night class and need to walk back to you car. The food from the dinning hall smells horrible. Every year the cost for attendance has risen, so if you have to pay for school yourself good luck!

Also the classroom equipment was most likely new in the 1970's (GRCC has much better lab equipment then us). In the science building there is no air conditioning, some of the laboratory electrical outlets do not work, and even the burners. 


So long story short- if you want a updated class rooms and updated equipment don't attend here. If you want bias professors do attend.

AQ has really nice grounds around the campus, but is it really worth almost $40,000?"
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life at Aquinas although there are Living Learning Community houses that are similar and focus on helping the community or putting on events for the campus.
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life.
College Freshman,1,Very little diversity. Mostly white students and teachers
College Freshman,1,We don't have greek life
College Senior,1,We don't have any fraternities or sororities on campus at all.
College Senior,1,"The Wege cafeteria has horrible food and their staff is all angry, mean, and not helpful."
College Senior,1,They give you one nice big scholarship at the beginning of each semester but compared to their tuition prices it is nothing.
College Junior,1,"There is absolutely NO where to park. Everyone seems to have a car, so if you're from out of state it's ridiculous. On top of all this, the cost for a permit increased from $50 for the entire year to $100 the first semester and $150 for the second semester - NOT OKAY! It puts me at an inconvenience and now Is forcing me to park off campus, and I'm from out of state"
College Sophomore,1,sucks. i got stupid tickets. I heard campus safety makes a game out of who can get rid of their ticket slips first. (meaning trying to give more tickets than one another.) and its stupid theyre 50$ after 3.
College Freshman,1,"While Aquinas is very accepting there is not much diversity besides sexual orienatation. Seeing as the schools tuition is on the higher side most students come from a similar economic background and the majority of the students are white. It is a catholic school, but that does not mean everyone is catholic, the school contains students with a variety of religious beliefs."
College Senior,1,Greek life does not exists at Aquinas. There are no sororities or fraternities on campus
College Sophomore,1,The nightlife in downtown Grand Rapids is very popular and fun but the night activities around campus are activities that college students really wouldnt be interested in.

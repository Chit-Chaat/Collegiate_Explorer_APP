Senior,5,It has hands down been the most wonderful experience for a college. The professors are so involved with their students and made me feel so welcomes and wanted in class. They really give you a sense of home away from home with their caring hearts for each child.
Niche User,5,I see they have mountain biking as a sport and I would like too do it and it sounds like a great school to go too but it’s not affordable for me
Junior,5,"Gunnison is a great place to be. I love the small town and the small school. Classes are small and the professors really care about each of there students. Western is a great school for those who love to be outside. They have everything. You can hike, bike, camp, ski, snowshoe, paddle board, rock climb to name a few. The ski resort is close and has a free bus going up every hour. Its great to be able to ski on a school day and still have time to get school work done."
Freshman,5,"Western is set in one of the most beautiful places on earth. the education I am receiving and the space to grow is amazing. just 200 miles from Denver. I would change the amount of diversity, that is all. Gunnison is a great and quiet little town. if you are focused on yourself and your education this is the place."
Sophomore,5,The atmosphere is amazing on campus! Everyone is extremely nice and welcoming. The keep campus fun and exciting for the students but continue to keep academics a priority. Western want you to succeed.
Freshman,5,"I have grown to love the small city of Gunnison, it is so small you can walk anywhere. The only reason you wouldn't do that is because of the cold, during the winter Gunnison is super cold. The lunch food gets old quick, but they try to switch it up. But the food altogether is average. The diversity is also not that great either, the main place you'll see diversity is in the sports."
Niche User,5,Western state is a great college. I would recommend going to this college the campus is great the athletics is awesome. The local area is great to be around lots to do outside of school.
Niche User,5,Every experience I have ever had with them has been positive. They have a beautiful campus that is well taken care of and friendly staff. They always go out of their way for me.
Junior,5,The small class sizes are wonderful if you enjoy the relationships with professors and classmates. The campus is small and you can easily get around without a car. I haven't had a car my entire time here and I can easily walk to stores in town and to class. I've loved my time at western and there is something to do here for anyone!
Freshman,5,Smaller classes than the main state schools allow for teachers to be responsive to requests in person or email even at off times like weekends or evenings.
Senior,5,"WSCU is a small school where the students feel welcome. I know that I can go to any teacher on campus for advice or support. Because it is a small school, the teachers know all their students by name and are genuinely concerned for the well-being of each one of them. The classes are fun and have a great atmosphere for learning."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing school, low cost, amazing location in Rocky Mountains with tons to do. Great professors and student-professor ratio. If you do Biology, Ecology, outdoor education, or Environmental Studies, there aren't many schools like it."
Freshman,5,"I am loving it here. The professors are great and I am receiving an amazing education. Oh, and the mountains are pretty nice too."
Senior,5,This is a great school for people who want small class sizes and want to be challenged outside the classroom as much as inside.
Junior,5,"Western is a fantastic college. I am stunned with how this university is not going to break the bank after four years.
I have gotten to know a ton of my classmates and all of my professors know me by name. Students here can catch their professor on the ski hill at Crested Butte or on the trails riding at Hartman Rocks. 
Western State Colorado University is a fantastic fit for any outdoor enthusiast who also wants a nice small town feel."
Freshman,5,What I really enjoyed about attending Western State Colorado University was how small the campus and the classes were. I felt more connected with my professors and my peers and getting the help I needed when I needed it. What I would change about the school is making it cheaper for the students. There's so many opportunities in Denver for me to go to school that I could afford but I love Western State so much I would do anything to go here again.
Freshman,5,"the access to outdoors is unbeatable, the mountain sports team is one of the best. the only thing I would change is I wish there was better food"
Junior,5,"Western State Colorado University is a great school if you want something that it not too big, has amazing professors that are always around to help, small class sizes, and all of the resources you could ever need on campus. I have enjoyed every minute of school at Western, and learned so much information that will help me to be successful once I graduate. I would highly recommend attending."
Freshman,5,"Western is Colorado's best kept secret. Even though Gunnison is a small town, it has so much potential for growth and has a true small town feel- where everyone smiles and says hello no matter where you go. Classes are engaging and challenging and professors are personable and helpful. There isn't anywhere else I would rather be honestly!"
Freshman,5,"After spending a year at Western, I have experienced more than I could have ever imagined.  While working with the School of Business and the entrepreneurial community in Gunnison, I have learned how to solve problems, brainstorm innovative solutions, and work with others to develop new products.  I have been involved with putting on school events like the Presidential Pumpkin Launch, and the Campus Rail-Jam.  I was given the opportunity to participate in Telluride Start-up Weekend, and represent Western in an entrepreneurial competition.  I also spent a weekend in Denver at the Western Roadshow promoting the awesome opportunities that Western State has to offer.  This school has provided me the chance to better both myself & my community, and I look forward to continuing grow while I’m here.  Western has so much to offer for many types of people, and provides an extremely welcoming atmosphere to be apart of."
College Freshman,5,It is my home away from home
College Freshman,5,Safety is key on campus
College Freshman,5,People are very welcoming is the vibe received
College Freshman,5,The Gym and facility are the best in the state
College Freshman,5,Western State in Colorado is a great school
College Sophomore,5,I love the atmosphere of the campus. The teachers are all fantastic and are here for the students and are very helpful at all times.
College Sophomore,5,The class sizes are a great thing about this school because it's a more intimate feel due to their smaller sizes.  The faculty and professors really care about each student and want to see them succeed and it's obvious in their teaching.  The courses provided are very hands on and interactive which helps the learning process.
College Sophomore,5,"I live in the newest dorms on campus and they are very nice! They are apartment style with a full kitchen, two bathrooms, 4 rooms and 5 people live in the apartment together. These dorms are a great distance from class and are an absolute dream to live in!"
College Junior,5,"Western recently opened the Mountaineer Field House and Fitness Center, and it is simply amazing. With three full size basketball courts inside of the 200m track, there is a ton of room for multiple activities. There are also three activity rooms and a fitness center with plenty of equipment for the amount of students who are there at any given time. The two story rock wall is also a huge bonus, and I rarely, if ever see it empty! The Field House was a fantastic addition to student life here at Western and definitely helps those of us who didn't come here to ski or snowboard stay active in the winter!"
College Freshman,5,"Western State is great. There are a lot of ways to get involved with extracurriculars, class sizes are small, and they took all of my AP credits which knocked a semester off of my time here. Most professors have PhDs and help is always accessible if you need it."
College Freshman,5,Western State fits great with my major in Biology! A lot of things are hands on and learn so much in the field you are studying in!
College Freshman,5,"Ute is the best. It is spacious with freshly finished bathrooms. My roommate is great also, and we were put together at random."
College Student,5,The academic programs seem to be great. I am pleased with my major and there are several unique majors related to being at such a high altitude.
College Student,5,I have felt safe on campus and the girls I know have as well.
College Student,5,I feel confident I will have high recommendations and opportunities following graduation.
College Student,5,"There are very few schools I could have gone to as a Music Education major and be performing in 5 top ensembles as a freshmen, several with my professors. This was a great choice for me."
College Sophomore,5,"I am having such a great time at this school; I'm being challenged, but not too much, I enjoy my classes, my teachers are excellent and love what they do, and I've made great friends."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love it. Everyone is so helpful and the campus is a perfect size. I feel at home here. And I definitely feel like I am going to succeed. Small class sizes are really helpful when it comes to understanding the material. I would definitely recommend this school to high school students to look into!
College Freshman,5,I am an athlete and love it here.
College Freshman,5,Very hands in and professors get to know you well.
College Freshman,5,It is very nice and welcoming.
College Senior,5,Small class sizes and caring professors make for a great academic curriculum.
College Freshman,5,I am so excited to be in the exercise and sports science program. The classes are great and I know that this is what i was made to do.
College Freshman,5,The food off campus is pretty good. It's a majority of family run restaurants unique to Gunnison. It is all very good high quality food
College Freshman,5,Parking is free and there are usually plenty of spots
College Freshman,5,"It's outdoors all around you are surrounded by wildlife and open lands, easy access to the mountains and many great fishing spots"
College Freshman,5,I attend a very small college where there is no need for campus transportation however the school does have a free shuttle that runs from Gunnison to Denver at a very reasonable sand low price as well as a free shuttle to crested butte
College Freshman,5,Though they seem nonexistent around campus there have not been many incidents and when there are incidents the campus security is present to deal with it.
College Junior,5,This place will love you if you love it back
College Junior,5,"I absolutely love my school. While the town is quite limiting, if you love the outdoors then you are in the perfect place. You have to make the most of your experience here because the outdoors are literally at your fingertips as well as campus events. We have a great skiing/snowboarding community here in the winter. Great hiking, biking, kayaking, rafting, climbing, etc. here. I love having personal relationships with my professors because they provide great insight to my success and I feel like I am paying a reasonable amount of money for all the perks that WSCU offers. I would choose my school again in a heartbeat."
College Junior,5,I love the parking at my school. Usually dorm/library parking is very filled up because it is a tight space but other than that there are always parking spots available. Off-campus parking spots are free and gives you two hours from 8AM-5PM Monday through Friday. If you are found over those times the enforcement gives you a $10 ticket which is extremely reasonable. There are no permits needed for keeping your car on campus!
College Sophomore,5,The students are allowed to carry guns. I feel very safe in the hands of my hunting peers.
College Sophomore,5,It is way cheaper to live off campus then to live on campus. Plus it's not dictated by the school.
College Sophomore,5,Gunnison is possibly the best small town city I have ever had the pleasure to live in. All around it is a wonderful place to be.
College Sophomore,5,The best things in life are free and here if you're too drunk to walk then safe ride will take you anywhere.
College Sophomore,5,I would do it over in a heart beat. I want to be a teacher and so far this experience has been the best I have ever had.
College Sophomore,5,Education here is the best major the advisor is a bit lost in how to direct students but the other kids in your major always know what up.
College Sophomore,5,"Usually they aren't open very late but everything in town is within a five minute walk, it's always fun too!"
College Sophomore,5,We have the best food here in Gunnison. There are not many choices but the ones that we do have are wonderful!
Recent Alumnus,5,Great access to computer labs with excellent computers.
Niche User,4,I did not take any classes online. I am a former student prior to Covid-19 and did not need to quarantine.
Senior,4,I am currently taking classes online with Western and did in the spring with the whole pandemic shut down. I think that the professors keep you at the same accountability as they do in person with your classes.
Niche User,4,I haven’t done it yet but it was not a good idea to do online it is much harder and you really don’t learn anything but I would like to go
Freshman,4,I live the community at western and the culture. There is I much to do and western embarks our natural resources located within the valley.
Niche User,4,Western was very opening and helpful in my search to choose a college that would work for me. The only issue I've ever had is that the school was not at all understanding about my sister's mental disability.
Freshman,4,"I like the small classes but I wish that professors would, if they notice that a student is struggling they would reach out to them. I like the atmosphere and that you know a lot of people walking around campus."
Sophomore,4,So far this seems to be one of the best returns on investments out there. Competency based curriculum is a great way for working adults to get their degree.
Freshman,4,"It is a well rounded school but the academics could definitely be better. More specific education than general education is a must. The facilities are top of the line, but they are putting more money into growth of the campus than the success of their students."
Sophomore,4,"The school is pretty good, but the area and the people who live here are what really makes this school so great. I am absolutely loving it here."
Senior,4,"This will be my fourth year here and had nothing short of a great time. You will meet great people if you are laid back and have a good attitude. Hike, ski, fish, etc., whatever you want to do outside it is accessible thru Wilderness Pursuits for free or for cheap gear rentals. The business program goes above and beyond setting their students up with good contacts, I have had multiple friends get internships and jobs from professor recommendations. My biggest tip, get involved. You will find your niche if you just try. Check out Western I.C.E. (innovation, creativity, entrepreneurship) Club, great people that throw sweet events."
Sophomore,4,Beautiful school in the mountains with small classrooms. Enjoy the area around it and love the long winters. Teacher and staff are always willing to help and tuition is affordable.
Junior,4,All of the instructors at Western have the highest degree they can  receive in their field of study. This make the classes more exciting and informative for students. I would recommend many more students to come here
Freshman,4,"I love the small campus, I find myself constantly thinking about how hard it must be for all my friends who went to a large campus and how they can spend 15 minutes walking and still might not be at their class. The location is great as well."
Junior,4,"I really like attending western. I found a sanse of belonging here that I didn't have when attending Northestern. I love the small school setting, I am able to recover help from my professor anytime and also create a personal connection with my professors. I have made as lot different friends with different bacclgrounds and I think everyone here is friendly and out going."
Niche User,4,"Right out of High School My first Year I chose to go to Western State Colo. Love the Campus, Staff and Coaches!  The only downside is the small town, which had not much for entertainment. Great town though, nice people"
Sophomore,4,"Great professors, a few too many required courses. As a double major, I don't have time for gen ed classes."
College Sophomore,4,"I am on the club swim team. We were a first year team, and the support that we got from students and teachers alike was amazing. Everyone loves to support the sports programs here. It is a very fun and social interaction for everyone involved."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe on this campus. I have no reason not to feel safe. There are several different ways that the school has provided to help with safety on this campus.  There are nightly security guards that will walk you to and from anywhere on campus. There's a free ride system called ""safe ride"" that will take you anywhere for free."
College Sophomore,4,"From personal experiences, my professors have given us multiple ways to look for job opportunities as well as given us information on job opportunities that appear locally."
College Sophomore,4,"From being an athlete, it's an amazing experience! The only thing that is lacking is the amount of money that the school receives to give to their teams. We don't have enough money to get the best gear or equipment, that is the only thing that is lacking"
College Junior,4,"A majority of my professors--okay, all but one--have been amazing. They all really care about what they're teaching, and really know what they're talking about, because they all have previous experience in their fields. Beyond that, they also care for the students, whether it's about grades or their personal lives. (The one professor that wasn't so great had a mess of a lesson plan, mostly yelled at us, and talked about wine almost every day)"
College Junior,4,"My absolute favorite thing about going to Western is the small class sizes. Not only is it more likely that the teacher knows your name by the second week of classes, but they care about you too. At Western, students have the unique experience of getting to learn from amazing professors, as well as connecting with them on a personal level, which is incredibly important."
College Freshman,4,"Western students and staff are very health-conscious. There is a lot of emphasis on sustainability here at Western because our Environment & Sustainability (Environmental Studies) program is the fifth best in the nation. This leads to a lot of health initiatives in the cafeteria (such as use of organic, campus garden grown, and local food). Also, the surrounding Rockies are a playground for mountain bikers, skiers, snowboarders, etc. The most dangerous part about campus is probably the ice patches in the winter. The most common crime in Gunnison is bike theft, after all. On top of that, the community offers a shuttle for drunks on weekend nights to prevent drunk driving."
College Freshman,4,"The business school has a specific department for job placement and has monthly visits from employers such as Dell, Crested Butte tourism companies, and even the Kansas City Fed."
College Freshman,4,There are great resources when I'm struggling. I can reap the rewards of my hard work. The curriculum doesn't ever feel impossible.
College Freshman,4,Our football team isn't great but they still draw a lot of support. Alumni and students love Western so they always come out to support their team. Sporting events are usually advertised. The field house is super nice and never overly crowded. There are separate weight rooms for athletes and non-athletes.
College Freshman,4,Very safe! I have not witnessed sexual assault
College Freshman,4,Everyone Is very nice and the professors are very knowledgeable about what they are teaching you.
College Freshman,4,They try their hardest to get you the job you want.
College Freshman,4,"Always have activities to do and try because of the location, and field house."
College Freshman,4,I've seen seniors go on and get jobs that they really want.
College Freshman,4,The facilities are amazing and up to date. Some sports win and some don't.
College Freshman,4,The education I'm receiving is top notch. The community and culture however is strongly influenced by substances.
College Freshman,4,"The security on campus is amazing, the administrators are incredibly concerned with the well-being of their students and as such, do a very impressive job taking the required measures to ensure the safety of the student body."
College Freshman,4,Western is amazing in the fact that the student body is so small which means the class sizes are small so the professors have time to get to know their students and help them when they are falling behind or not understanding the material.
College Freshman,4,"There are many options for on campus jobs such as the pool, the field house, Mad Jacks, etc. There are also many small businesses that are willing to hire and they all have very flexible shift schedules to work around the students' schedules."
College Freshman,4,"The building is older so there are many issues that come from that, but most are very well and effectively taken care of. The Mears Complex is perfectly located for easy access to the majority of  campus."
College Freshman,4,"The athletic facilities on campus are absolutely amazing, and offered to all students. The varsity sports teams are a big thing on campus, every day many students can be seen wearing some form of Western gear, from t-shirts to scarves to hats, everyone supports the teams and the school."
College Freshman,4,"Western is the highest college in the world and as such, there are many exciting opportunities that are offered, the class sizes are small and the professors usually know their students by name and approach them if there is an issue. The location is amazing as well as the classes and activities offered."
College Junior,4,Workload in the grad program is intense.
College Junior,4,Personalized attention and interesting subjects.
College Junior,4,It seems very safe and no reports of violence.
College Junior,4,The ability to work from a distance is good.
College Student,4,The professors in my major are amazing. The general ed teachers are good.
College Student,4,I live in a co-ed Honors Dorm. It is great for me.
College Student,4,"I don't participate in sports, however, I do play in the Varsity Band. All varsity sporting events seem to be well attended and supported and the facilities are great for athletes and non-athletes, and all are welcome."
College Freshman,4,"This school is great! there is a ton of outdoor and recreational activities to do, not only around campus, but also around town and even in nearby towns. If i could go back, I would probably make the same choice and stick with Western."
College Freshman,4,Very beautiful with all the scenery.
College Freshman,4,"I had no trouble, I love it!"
College Freshman,4,I can get help and treatment whenever I need it.
College Senior,4,"A lot of work and presentations. Because of the small class sizes, there is usually a grade based on attendance and presentations"
College Senior,4,"I'm getting over $3,500 over my tuition costs every semester due to financial aid, grants, scholarships, and loans"
College Senior,4,Everything is pretty affordable. There are a lot of different place to eat. Check out Powerstop!
College Senior,4,There are parties constantly. The only issue is getting there when it's freezing out and Safe Ride isn't running.
College Student,4,"Its great to me because , they havfe really awesome sports teams, everyone's dedicated to what they do"
College Student,4,the envoirnment in my opinion is excellent scenerie and all
College Freshman,4,All schools have rules and western isn't apart from that. They do follow through with most of the rules made.
College Freshman,4,I didn't encounter any difficulties. Western State is very accommodating and are find it very important to help the students any way needed.
College Freshman,4,Exercise sports science is a very popular major at my school. The work load isn't to bad definitely doable.
College Freshman,4,Western State Colorado University just built a whole new facility. Its fantastic! has everything anybody would want to do.
Niche User,2,This is really only a school for those interested in going into outdoor recreation or emergency management programs. There other programs really aren't great and make it hard to get acquainted. This is not a real deal school. If you're not getting a good scholarship here or paying cheap tuition then I definitely would not recommend it. I'd say the one redeeming factor at this school is their collegiate search and rescue team (a great opportunity if you're considering emergency management) and then also the location (although that should never be your main reason for choosing a school).
Freshman,2,"The only good thing about this school is the teachers. Everything else is awful. Worst experience of my life. The school has a high acceptance rate so keep that in mind. Most students are immensely disrespectful and obnoxious, quiet hours aren't enforced and due to this paired with the fact that most students here don't care at all about graduating and are only here to please their parents, they won't care at all if it's 4 a.m. and you have a class at 8 the next morning."
College Junior,2,I have no idea about this.
College Freshman,2,The building has not been updated and their is no were for a group of people to hang out.
College Freshman,2,"It is beautiful here and I'm glad I went to Colorado, but this school just isn't the place for me. I'm just always so bored."
College Freshman,2,"I was more challenged in my high school classes. Class sizes are great however, small and personal. I have class discussions every day."
College Freshman,2,"My dorm hall sucks but I guess the others are slightly more entertaining. Do not get Mary Virginia as your RA. I promise you, you will regret it."
College Freshman,2,"I feel that I am paying way too much for this school. I had more of a ""college experience"" last year than I am here and the classes are not that challenging or impressive."
College Freshman,2,"Getting into western is a very easy process. However, you notice what that means as far as student quality once you get here."
College Freshman,2,"If you are not an avid snowboarder or skiier, don't even bother. That is the social scene here and since winter takes up practically the whole school year if you don't love winter activities you can say goodbye to any chance of a social life. If you do love it, and I mean LOVE it, give western a try... keep in mind winter means -20 degrees daily here."
College Freshman,2,"Campus life feels like high school round 2. Athletic events are not worth going to as we are a d3 school and school spirit is nonexistent. Campus is very tiny, be prepared to walk to town if you need anything. There are no restaurants, convenience stores, or other conveniences on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The food can either be okay(edible),great,or absolutely Horrible! its luck of the draw and as most students have the meal plan the price for the meals is already added into your total year cost. The do normally have a few normal things every night(example is hamburgers/grilled cheese/salad)."
Recent Alumnus,2,"For Being such a small school we do have a noticeable amount of diversity, but students of different races and ethnicities tend to be in athletics. Everyone seems to get along well though. Outside of racial diversity, Western does have an extremely diverse student background with about 35% of the student population being from out of state! with most, if not all 50 states being represented."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Drugs and alcohol seem to be extremely visible and accessible. If you name a major drug I could probably name at least one person who has tried it or uses it regularly. Marihuana and alcohol are also extremely prevalent throughout the campus and student population. However, it is still possible and easy to avoid such activities of that is your personal choice."
College Sophomore,2,The variety is very slim. Marios pizza is usually a favorite. Many like to travel 25 minutes to Crested Butte to eat too.
College Sophomore,2,i had Ute Hall and it was TERRIBLE it was the oldest dorm and it was given to freshmen
College Freshman,2,"This school is notorious for being very stingy about their scholarships. The majority of scholarships they offer are to students from the Gunnison Valley or the western slope of Colorado. So, if this doesn't apply to you, don't rely too heavily on applying for scholarships offered by the school. The application due date was mentioned on both the school's website and the application itself, but they never mentioned that the office closed at 5 pm sharp. I happened to be out of town that whole weekend and didn't make it back into town until 6:30 pm. When I went into the office to explain the situation I was told that they will consider my application if no one else applied for the scholarships. Most of the other offices on campus are very supportive and understanding of these kinds of situations, but the guy running financial aid is very grumpy. Don't get your hopes up for scholarships from this school."
College Sophomore,2,"If you hang out with the people that partake in the drug scene then this grade will increase. Pot use on campus is really high (ha!), but nothing to extreme that puts students at risk. Alcohol use is the same if you want to take part you know where to find it and who to talk to. Peer pressure is relatively lower than it was in high school. Policy and enforcement especially in on campus housing is very strict! Don't do it! Be smart about your decisions. Students who partake in these acts are not usually noticeable on  campus, but do their own thing."
College Freshman,2,"Since being in the state of Colorado, many Western students partake in the regular use of Marijuana and alcohol.  Being in a small, remote location, students are able to obtain these substances very easily, even being underage.  The campus enforces drug/substance abuse laws in the dorms and on campus, but many cases go unnoticed."
College Freshman,2,The internet access in my dorm is not very reliable.  Access is very slow and does not always connect.
Alum,1,"I most vividly recall an online summer class where I literally had to do nothing but click ""forward"" on a powerpoint the entire class. I feel I did not get taught, nor did I learn much, yet I paid my tuition for these credits."
Junior,1,"TERRIBLE SCHOOL.  If you enjoyed High School and want to do another 4 years this is the school for you.  I'm so glad I transferred I am so much happier.  This place is a glorified high school.  You are better off choosing a community college than this place.  I will give it credit the skiing was prime along with other outdoor stuff but thats it.  Gunnison is one of the most boring towns I have been to.  They don't have a movie theater, bowling alley, or anything fun to do at night.  Everyone at this school is mean and immature I did not enjoy my time here.  If you like small boring towns that are isolated, immature kids stuck in high school, and outdoor stuff only western is the place for you."
College Freshman,1,Gunnison does not allow greek life of any sort on campus
College Freshman,1,The only good part is Mad Jacks. Rare has caused me to have multplie food posioning and sometimes they do not have enough food.
College Freshman,1,I've never been to a town so dead at night.
College Freshman,1,The town is so tiny and low key that there really is no transportation. Most people just walk which can be a hassle in the freezing cold and snow.
College Freshman,1,There is very little diversity here. Teachers will even joke about our lack of diversity in classes. All the students are outdoorsy laid back adventurous white kids who spend their weekends snowboarding and nothing else. If you don't fit this you will most definitely be a minority here.
College Freshman,1,Consider 5 degree highs a nice day.
College Freshman,1,"Our athletic teams are an ongoing joke among other students, athletes and non-athletes alike."
College Freshman,1,I've never been in a more boring town. It is absolutely beautiful... But you can only stare out at it for so many moths before you need to get back into civilization.
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek life. Similarly, do not expect frat level parties... Or anywhere close"
College Sophomore,1,The on campus food is the worst! Off campus is where you have to eat if you don't want to be sick. Very poor quality.
College Junior,1,"We have a diverse community but most of the students are white. There are some amazing international athletes and other international students. Political and economic beliefs can be diverse and are usually accepted. I hang out with a bunch of christian students who have a heart for God, but I am not sure of any other people and their religious beliefs."
College Sophomore,1,The drug scene at Western state is not seen but heard of in every class. On how there going out and partying and there underage. With drugs you can smell it in the hall ways and bathrooms it is very distrubing. At least sense i have been here there has been two emergency where two underage students had to go to the hosipal because of alchohol poison and i am just a freshman.
College Freshman,1,"Drugs are a big part of Western. While it is mainly Marijuana, it is still very popular at Western. Drugs and drinking are common popular activities at Western."
College Freshman,1,"Its super cold, we get excited when its 0 degrees outside"
College Freshman,1,"Party Lifestyle – The nightlife here is pretty awful. There are strict laws against partying in your dorm. Regardless students decide to and make a lot of noise when your trying to do your work. We have weird days to party such as ""Wasted Wednesday"" and when you have an early morning class its pretty awful. As a freshman going to house parties could either be good or bad since you don't know the people there. So yeah, not a lot of places to party in this small town."
College Freshman,1,"No Strictness – There really isn't much campus stictness at Western. The cops are very chill and relax. If they bust a party, they just tell everyone to leave and to pour their drinks, then everyone just walks to the next party. Cops mainly only bust people who are pasted out or stumbling everywhere. They will crack down on drugs and alcohol in the dorms though. Also, if students drive under the influence."

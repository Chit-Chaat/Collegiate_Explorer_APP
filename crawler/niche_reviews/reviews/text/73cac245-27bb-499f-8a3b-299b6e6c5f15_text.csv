Junior,5,Very personal/intimate college experience unlike going to a big school. ECU is inclusive and they care about their students.
Junior,5,"Using blackboard is weird at first, but becomes easier. Moved online for Covid and professors were so accomodating."
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and full of opportunities. Im so fortunate to be allowed to visit this campus.
Freshman,5,"It has been weird. but through Blackboard, it has made so much more sense, than I was afraid that it would be terribly weird."
Freshman,5,I'm taking online class due to COVID by they are not  hard but also not to easy. I'm learning more how to be online. I come from a small town and the internet there is not the best. Now in college I'm learning how to navigate a computer.
Senior,5,"I love the set up of the campus.. maybe update the old apartments. But the love the atmosphere and vibe of the people there. How could you not like the place, Blake Shelton is from Ada."
Graduate Student,5,My entire Masters degree is hosted online. I love that ECU offers an online option  for my particular content area. I have had a very positive experience with my online courses through ECU. Open communication with the professors who are all very helpful.
Graduate Student,5,Excellent communication with the professors. All of them are extremely helpful.  I am receiving my masters degree online. Enrollment was very simple and all of my courses have been easy to navigate. I have thoroughly enjoyed each class that I have taken thus far. All of the content is useful and the professors are knowledgeable in their content area.
Junior,5,I have loved coming to ECU! The people are so caring and friendly. The community is involved with the students providing entertainment and opportunities to make connections. The possibilities from going to ECU are huge! The have a wide variety of degree options and the ability to get you into grad schools if you choose.
Junior,5,The program I am enrolled in is 100% online.  I just started my second semester and the professors have been great to work with so far.  The online platform is easy to navigate and it has been a great fit for my busy schedule. Communicating with my professors has been easy and they are always willing to answer my questions and offer suggestions if needed.

Graduate Student,5,ECU is a great school! I earned a Bachelors Degree in Kinesiology there and had the best experience I could ask for!
Sophomore,5,"I love ecu! I couldn’t imagine going anywhere else. its my home away from home, class sizes are small and the professors really care about you and your education. The school has a very good greek society and sports teams. overall the. best school I’ve ever been to!"
Freshman,5,"Very good school. Great music dept, fantastic language dept., honors is pretty good, most professors are very kind. Great opportunities for every major. Very cheap, too."
Niche User,5,"The minute I decided to look into this school everyone was extremely helpful. I talked someone over the phone, and got great and information and resources. I set up a tour of the campus which was gorgeous and easy to find my way through. The tour guide was cheerful as well as question ready. She answered all the questions she could, and the ones she couldn't gave detailed contacts to get the answers we seek. Overall my experience was wonderful, and knowledgeable of the school."
Sophomore,5,East central is a fun and safe environment for college students who are attending. One minor thing I would change is to update the student break rooms and Horace man building.
Freshman,5,"East central university is a good school, has a conducive environment for learning. I’m not a fan of big campuses as I get distracted easily so East central university is for me. The professors are so good and they put in their best to pass knowledge to the students. Food; it can’t be perfect at all times so I’d say the food is on an average level. The dorms are quiet too. Trust me East central university is a place to be."
Senior,5,My experience here has been great!  They offer many classes online.  They also offer several classes through different remote sites.  The advisors are very helpful.
Freshman,5,I love East Central University because it isn’t a huge campus. I have made the best of friends my first semester. I also joined Greek life and I couldn’t imagine not being in a sorority. East Central is home to me.
Freshman,5,My first semester as a freshman turned out to be an amazing experience. The professors were very helpful and I'm thankful for the opportunity to attend this small yet caring campus.
Junior,5,The campus is very easy to get around on as well as you see friendly faces everywhere you go on campus. The Professors are great and always there to help you when you need it.
Senior,5,"I like how they are willing to find any way possible to help you solve a problem. The instructors are especially great in helping you out. One thing that I think could be improved is financial aid rewards with books, so that it does not take too long or get confusing."
Junior,5,I love ECU! Everyone is so nice. I have made so many lifelong friends. The teachers are always willing to reach out and help when needed.
Freshman,5,"As a First semester Freshman at ECU it has been an amazing experience. It is such a nice atmosphere from staff, teachers, and other students. Students are super friendly, and are easy to approach walking throughout campus. My teachers this semester have been super helpful, and are unbelievably knowledgeable about their field."
Freshman,5,"It is a small town, but there are still fun things to go do while obtaining your education. Most of the facilities are nice, however, some buildings could be updated. The sporting events are very fun to attend. Classes are challenging, and help to advance knowledge very well."
Freshman,5,Just enjoying myself needs to be more class choices that's all wish the food is great my favorite is the Starbucks coffee the donuts and the breakfast MENU and also the pasta bar excellent to perfection
Junior,5,"I loved everything about ECU. From professors to resources offered, it's awesome! I always loved eating in the cafeteria because there was always a wide variety of food to choose from. There was a variety of nationalities on campus so you're always meeting someone new and learning about new cultures which is always fun and interesting."
Junior,5,"It has enough people that you will never be bored, but is also small enough for you to not be overwhelmed."
Junior,5,"East Central University is the perfect place for people who want the full experience of college without having a ton of people  there to overcrowd the campus. Parking is the only issue, but there is plenty of room for everyone once the new dormitory is built in the fall of 2018."
Senior,5,"ECU is a great school! I've had lots of help here from staff members/professors around the school. I'm thankful to be a student in such a caring environment.

The cost of attending ECU is surprisingly low too, which is very nice."
Freshman,5,"I have LOVED attending ECU! I am a freshman in the ECU marching band and Wind Ensemble. Everyone on campus, whether you have them in class or not are friendly. You will often see the President walking around campus, and she is always eager to say hello! Our football team isn’t very good, but hopefully that will change. I Love ECU and can’t wait to continue going here for five more years!"
Freshman,5,Great University to continue your academic career after high school. I've enjoyed and reaped benefits from attending classes here.
Sophomore,5,"East Central is a good size college which makes finding classrooms a breeze, and if you're lost, people are friendly enough to point the way or take you. Also, you might see a tea-cup sized pig following one student along the way. The teachers are down to earth and so are the students, making it easy to get along with anyone. Also, the faculty staff is very friendly and will help you with your problems if they occur. Not to mention, their mascot is a tiger. Come on! Oh, and there is a park surrounding a pond nearby and two coffee shops just off of main street. So if you need a quick caffeine fix, the campus is just small enough to walk there and get to class."
Freshman,5,I love this college and wouldn't go anywhere else. The only problem is the teachers in the music department are taken away a lot.
College Sophomore,5,The professors are easy to communicate with
College Freshman,5,"Overall, I would say all of the policies and their enforcement at the college is pretty fair."
College Freshman,5,It's probably a good thing keep everything under control
College Freshman,5,"Campus police stops everything, and the medical staff is amazing"
College Freshman,5,I know a lot of the campus police personally. They are so helpful whenever they are needed.
College Freshman,5,I have had many professor that I have enjoyed through my year. Sometimes it is overwhelming at times but that is because I have 100 different things going at once.
College Freshman,5,A lot of people are athletes on campus and I think it is wonderful. They are not praised for it or treated any differently. Our facilities are wonderful.
College Sophomore,5,"Campus police patrols the campus day and night. If you a re on campus late at night, we have emergency boxes. If you feel like you are in trouble, just push the button and the system will make siren noises and start flashing. We had multiple car break ins last year and anyone who was caught late at night was followed by the campus police all the way to their dorm building to make sure no harm came to you."
College Sophomore,5,"It's fairly difficult, but I like it. It pushes you to your limits to show you how much you can do. As the year goes on, your limits get higher and higher. You become better than you ever thought you could be."
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone shows so much pride into the sports. The team works together very well in all aspects, most are above average students, and help around campus. The spirit that is shown throughout the year is incredible."
College Sophomore,5,"I was recruited by my choir director to attend ECU. He puts so much passion into his work, he shows you how a choir director should be."
College Sophomore,5,"The parties are to get everyone together, make new friends, new memories, and have a good time. It shows you that college can be fun outside the classrooms."
College Freshman,5,I haven't had to enter the major yet still a freshman doing gen ed classes
College Sophomore,5,I have never seen anyone doing drugs.
College Sophomore,5,"I love off campus housing. It is nice to have a place to cook, set your own curfew, and peace and quiet when you need it."
College Freshman,5,The strictness at my school is very strict towards grades and attending classes.
College Freshman,5,"My campus accepts anyone of any race, as long as they have the grades and stuff that they need."
College Freshman,5,Fan support at my school is outrageous. So many of the students show up to support the teams. 
College Freshman,5,I would chose my school again if I had to because I think there is where I will get the best college experience. I have my friends there. 
College Freshman,5,The computers at my school are the best. I can always find a computer open in the computer labs and also at the library. They are always fast and I can print all the papers that I need.
College Sophomore,5,FROM WHAT I SEE I DONT SEE MUCH OF IT. THOUGH I AM A COMMUTER.
College Freshman,5,to get into my program you have to get your prerex done first
College Freshman,5,the weather here is very nice so im having a great inexpert
College Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love the food places offered on and around campus. There aren't any fast food places on campus, but there are plenty within walking distance. The cafeteria has great choices and a variety of types of foods. Everything is pretty decent price wise."
College Junior,5,I love the program here at my school because they take it seriously and I feel like I'm going to be more than prepared for the real world when I graduate.
College Freshman,5,"The drug scene on campus is not noticeable at all, and there is no peer pressure to drink, and the campus is pretty strict on the smoking on campus rule."
Alum,4,It's a very good college. Big enough to feel like you're in college but small enough you don't get lost. The professors are also very helpful.
Freshman,4,"I like that its not to big and everyone at the school is very helpful. With COVID-19 going around the world I think the school has made good change to protect its students, staff and faculty."
Junior,4,"ECU has some very good professors, who take time to teach and if you are struggling work with you on the subject. They truly care about the individual more then just another student in the classroom."
Senior,4,"East Central University has great education opportunities. The location is great, not too far from Oklahoma City and has great food options for students."
Freshman,4,"East Central University has a very beautiful campus. The buildings are all very nice and well-taken care of. The overall environment is also good. There are many different clubs there, so it's easy to be involved. The teachers are intelligent and kind, and will go out of their way to help a struggling student. The staff are hardworking and dedicated to keeping the college maintained and safe. There aren't any things I can think of that I don't like about East Central."
Freshman,4,So far East Central University is pretty fun some of the dorm buildings are in very poor condition and need to be better. But so far so good
Freshman,4,I love East Central I've been here a few weeks and its changed my life. I have met so many new people. it was definitely inviting and welcoming. I'm very happy I chose this college.
Freshman,4,All the faculty are so nice and helpful! I just wish that the campus was more modern. Some of the lecture rooms do not even have clocks.
Freshman,4,"I am Stanford Tetteh Obu. I had a very good experience my first semester. My first time in Oklahoma and the people are very interesting. They are very friendly and students and professors in at Ecu are also very nice . I enjoyed the experience of campus life,campus football ,basketball and many more. I am a big fan of sports especially soccer so I was a little disappointed when I realized we don’t have any soccer team. My academic experience went very well also. Tuitiors and assistant are ever ready to help us do well and pass our test and final . There is not much activity in terms of campus fair or parties. So campus is very dull when it comes to programs or shows for student get together and fun . I think a better job can be done in the area of school experience . Overall I think I had a good experience not too satisfactory but not too bad also. I hope to have a better experience the next semester and the ones head"
Junior,4,"I love that the campus is so centrally located in the city. I love the availability of online courses during summer and intersession, however I wish there were more options of courses available. I also wish there were more offerings for on campus classes multiple times a year."
Sophomore,4,"East Central University has a very ""home"" feel to me. Smaller campus with a teacher to student ratio of about 1 to 30. Very nice and helpful staff that seem to care about their students and their school. I enjoyed this college but is limited on majors, mainly Business, Nursing and Education majors mostly."
Junior,4,What I like about ECU is that it close to home and it also has taught me a lot being in class from my professor. They have good library hours in case you you don’t have internet and need to get homework done.
Alum,4,"Great campus community 
Professors are committed to students
Lots of free on-campus activities 
Located in a good area"
Niche User,4,...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No...No
Sophomore,4,"This campus is very beautiful, the people that attend are very nice and helpful. I was a transfer student so I learning where the classes and buildings were at was a little confusing, I asked a couple of kids, and they helped me out very friendly."
Senior,4,East Central University is great school with a lot cultural diversity. The teachers care about your education. The school program is challenging.
Freshman,4,This is my first year in college and I love East Central. The staff and students are generous. The library is my favorite part to be! Amazing staff they will help you with anything that you need! The campus is well maintained. So far a wonderful experience.
Junior,4,"I'd like to see a wider variety of teachers instead of one professor teaching 3 of my different classes. Other than that, the school and campus are nice."
Niche User,4,it was an amazing experience . i really enjoyed being able to go to east central university. the professors and student body makes it ten times better and i would highly recommend students to go.
Senior,4,I've enjoyed my time at East Central. Most of my professors have been very knowledgeable. My one complaint is when a professor uses a website or application to run their course. It takes away the direct contact between students and professors.
Freshman,4,Small campus with extremely friendly students.  As a concurrent student faculty was helpful to walk ne through the learning process of enrollment and the transition from high school to college.
Freshman,4,"I'm a freshman here at ECU. My girlfriend is a sophomore and my mother attended here as well as many of my friends. Its a great small school and I've lived in the town for most of my life. What I want to see change is to show us what to do. As freshmen we are required to take a 5 week course to help us know people and get around but who shows us how to get through the lunch lines? Who shows us how to fill out a nurse form? Who explains how to get where you need to go or which dorm halls are known for /extra/ rowdy boys? They don't teach us this and unless you luck out and bring a friend to school with you, or you're even luckier and make some new friends, no one shows you the ropes. And you get in trouble for not knowing. It's intimidating, overwhelming, and a tad ridiculous."
Sophomore,4,"Coming from a small town in Oklahoma, East Central University felt very comfortable. It's a small campus, but not too small. You can make friends and still not know everyone there. It's a good place for someone who doesn't like big campuses."
Junior,4,east central university is a wonderful school to attend. i have been here for three years and have loved the experience and all of the great teachers i have had. there are many campus activities to get involved in which makes the experience very enjoyable.
Senior,4,East Central University has been a really great school to attend. There is tremendous diversity here. The school tries to help each student feel like its a new home while they are there. The teachers here are great and really know their stuff. If there is something I'd like to see changed for the university it would be that there are more student resources as far as things to do at school.
College Sophomore,4,"I will be starting my sophomore year at East Central University, and I can actually say that I love it. I love how it's a small town vibe and everyone can get along. I recommend coming here!"
College Sophomore,4,The professors seem to really want the student to succeed.
College Sophomore,4,We got internship programs for us to get ready.
College Sophomore,4,Very neat and helpful in studying
College Sophomore,4,"Some schools wanted me, but I chose what is the best school where I can learn."
College Senior,4,"My overall experience at East Central University has been nothing short of great. It has a small town atmosphere but with big opportunities. The professors know me by name, and are willing to always lend a hand. The student life is a blast. The dorms and several buildings are outdated, but they are slowly working on changing that."
College Sophomore,4,"To get into any of the dorms you need to use your student ID, and your ID only unlocks the doors to YOUR dorm. There is also campus security that strolls around and the campus is across the street from the police department. I also believe the sheriff or one of the officers lives a few blocks away from the school."
College Sophomore,4,At East Central University it depends which Dorms you live in. I live in Briles and it's definitely one of the best dorms to live at out of four.
College Sophomore,4,"ECU in small town Ada, Oklahoma is a small and quiet University. Relating the educated teachings with friends at bigger universities such as OU and OSU, ECU isn't any different. I do like this school very much and the price is amazing compared to other universities."
College Freshman,4,Our campus officials work hard to provide addict safely measures for the students and to bring awareness to the possible safety concerns.
College Freshman,4,May alumni talk very highly about the opportunities our school provided for their future careers.
College Freshman,4,There are a large verity of classes offered and the class sizes very depending on teacher availability and the number of student.
College Freshman,4,"I really enjoy my housing options as a freshmen but, I'm excited for living off-campus next year."
College Freshman,4,It's a place where everyone can feel like they are a part of a community.
College Sophomore,4,I have loved being at East Central University. It is small enough that you really get to know and love your professors and classmates.
College Sophomore,4,"I love that my classes are small and my professors set aside time in their daily schedules when students can come to them for help. Every professor I've had has been a doctor. We have students from over 100 countries, making the student body very diverse. I love being part of the Honors program because we go on field trips to museums and theater performances and are exposed to a variety of cultural events."
College Freshman,4,i have had nothing but an awesome experience so far. my new band family has accepted me into their group and I feel right at home.
College Junior,4,"Living on campus was great. Small class numbers, so it was easy to get to know everyone. The dorms are in great shape."
College Freshman,4,"My landlord is great, I am within walking distance to all my classes, and the house is actually pretty nice. It is a little on the expensive side."
College Freshman,4,I like that they let us have freedom as long as we stay out of trouble.
College Freshman,4,Everything about being my major at ECU is good. The workload isn't too much but its enough to make sure you know what you're doing. They have plenty of internship opportunities for you and the curriculum is good.
College Freshman,4,The registration is east. The professors are very goods and there is many study areas on the campus.
College Freshman,4,For Greek housing there is a place called Greek Village that is a set of apartments where all the Greeks can live if they want but there isn't enough for everyone that is involved in Greek life. Greeks are very involved on campus and all the non greeks are friends with the Greeks.
College Freshman,4,"I am only a freshman at this time.  I hope to find an internship in my area when the time is right.  I chose Social Work with a minor in Counseling, partly due to my volunteer work as a Jr. Counselor at my church's children's camp during the summers and as a tutor at the elementary school I attended."
College Freshman,4,"I don't live on campus.  I go to class and take care of business.  I don't really hang around campus unless one of my classes is cancelled.  If that happens, I may drive to the park or go to the student union to grab a snack or to study.  All of my professors, thus far, have expected us to be in class and some give quizzes to help with that.  There are strict parking rules, and signs are posted everywhere."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoyed all of my classes.  My professors were all knowledgeable about their area and willing to provide help if needed.  The class size averages about 20.  After talking to my friends who attend other colleges, I feel that my school has a nice variety of courses.  I made a great choice."
College Freshman,4,"It's a very friendly town.  The businesses seem grateful for my business.  The park area has a walking trail around a lake.  There is also a swimming pool and playground equipment.  If the weather is nice, it is usually full of people.  I have gone there if one of my classes is cancelled and I have to wait around for the next to begin.  I like to sit on a bench and read or do some of my assignments. I know there are a couple of clubs that college students and locals go to but I have never been."
College Student,4,"I love all of my classes! my professors are very down to earth and supportive, they actually care about what you learn, not just cramming information into a certain amount of time."
College Freshman,4,"All I had to do was apply, get accepted, fill out a lot of paperwork and send it back, then come to enroll and attend my classes! My advisor was absent during enrollment, so I was advised by someone who mislead me and chose the incorrect major, but I fixed it once school started. There is nothing weird about the application process really, just make sure you bring your official/final college transcript if you were concurrently enrolled in high school!"
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy my program, it is few in workload right now but will drastically increase later!"
College Freshman,4,"The safety is top notch, and availability is pretty awesome if you apply for housing when you are supposed to. The only bad thing about living on campus is that you have to buy a meal plan, which is extremely costly! All of the dorms are located close together and pretty close to the main campus buildings, but walking up the huge hill to get to classes is exhausting! Also, help can literally be found anywhere here!"
College Freshman,4,"ECU's specialty is in science, so my Biology major is a great thing here! There are not that many job opportunities available because they are constantly taken, but the school workload is usually pretty light but still has great curriculum! The facilities here are pretty high-tech and up-to-date, so no complaints there! Also, the dorms are good too even though some like to complain about them."
College Freshman,4,"There is a lot of diversity on our small campus! People from all countries come here to go to school, and they are accepted by the other students, no questions asked. Since the people are from all over, there are many different races with their own religions, but no one acts differently toward either of those. It is pretty widely accepted that some people here have different sexual orientations than normal, and nobody i am around really talks about politics, but the economic background is definitely varied but causes no issues or challenges."
College Freshman,4,"Everything is taken seriously, few crimes, I always feel safe"
College Freshman,4,Has the best science program around for our class. Great and understanding teachers. Never overloaded with homework. The library is the best place for studying
Freshman,2,"I liked how the professors knew you and wanted to help you, but everything else about the school wasn’t that good. The living conditions of the dorms were awful bugs and mold everywhere and the campus buildings themselves were in poor condition. The school hardly ever had anything for students to be involved in going on and all clubs were secluded and wouldn’t let you join. The town has a high crime rate also."
College Sophomore,2,The frats are really annoying and think they are the best
College Senior,2,"The dorms are very poor in maintenance quality and cleanliness, but it is a great atmosphere and is where I met most of my friends."
College Freshman,2,Showers are always cold. Kind of run down- needs updates.
College Freshman,2,"Cost way too much, and good luck finding one"
College Freshman,2,"There is not much to do here in Ada, the closet big town is Norman and I go there which is a hour away to shop and have a good time."
College Sophomore,2,too expensive and campus is not helping
College Sophomore,2,"poor technology,infrastructure and communication but developing at a slow rate"
College Freshman,2,The cost of living off campus is outrageous. Landlords raise the prices because they don't want a ton of college students tearing up the place.
College Sophomore,2,"While some are in decent shape and reasonably priced, others are horrible and over priced. The landlords will tell you if it's bad, but also they will not do anything about it because it's a waste of their money. The assume all tenants are the same. If they have bad tenants, anyone who moves into a house they own are bad tenants. My Government class and I held an event for Affordable Housing in Ada, OK. We had landlords come and speak about what they think of tenants and why they charge rent so high to unsuitable homes. We also had previous tenants come speak about terrible landlords and the bad communication between landlords and tenants. After the debate was over, several students (including myself) spent the night in boxes to show awareness to everyone."
College Junior,2,The town just makes the school awful the people are rude and it doesn't cater to college kids at all!
College Junior,2,Pigskins is the only good place in Ada hands down one of the best BBQ places I have eaten at.
College Junior,2,We have one dining hall and if you don't like fried food you will starve. The quality of the food is horrendous you will never have a solid poop while you are there.
College Sophomore,2,There is really not much of a night life do to it being a small town and not a lot of activities.
College Sophomore,2,I am not aware of any campus transportation other than a private vehicle and ride sharing. 
College Sophomore,2,There is basically not anywhere for late night variety and places to use flex dollars. 
College Senior,2,"The food is good as far as most people are concerned, but I am vegan and there is little on the menu that I wish to consume."
College Sophomore,2,Pretty average. We have a lot stuff opening up near campus.
College Freshman,2,"Well, I have my own transportation, so I have never worried about the options the school has. But I also did not know that ECU had any options either. So, I gave the school a C- just because of the fact that I have never been informed, and for all I know the transportation here could be an amazing! But I was never informed of the options so, I'll never know."
College Sophomore,2,Forms get lost a lot in between offices. People are always being sent back and forth between offices. It can take up to a few weeks to get everything sorted out.
College Junior,1,Meal plans are too expensive for the low quality of food.
College Student,1,"The process was ridiculous, everytime I was told I had everything I would wait three days and then be told there was something else, and so on."
College Junior,1,"There is absolutely nothing to do around the campus, besides hanging out at Walmart."
College Junior,1,Everything shuts down at 5 in this town. The only places that are open are Walmart and McDonalds. That's our night life its sad.
College Junior,1,"There is no school spirit at this school. No body participates in any type of school event, except for a few rare people."
College Senior,1,"This is in regard to the school policies.  ECU policy is to prepare the RN student to pass the NCLEX exam after graduation.  Their attitude is ""We want to keep our high NCLEX passing rate intact, so we will do anyone (that isn't brilliant) a favor and fail you now, so you will not have to endure failure when you take the NCLEX"". I had two classes last semester one good and one bad, in the bad class this policy was accomplished by giving the student the books with the instruction to learn everything in the books. This is impossible when you are covering 200-300 pages per class per week, so the student is left with the problem of deciding what information is most important.  I agree that the teacher should not give the test question to the student, but emphasizing the important areas for study in a chapter is a good teaching method.  A student that studies irrelevant, unnecessary information is wasting time.  My major complaint is that I paid to be taught (after all if I didn't need to be taught I wouldn't be there) and in one class the teachers felt no obligation to do any teaching."
College Senior,1,currently the only scholarships are for full time students.  I am enrolled in the required courses for nursing as a junior which totals 9 units so I am considered a part time student and as such I do not qualify for any of the scholarships.  It sucks
College Senior,1,The teachers get paid but they don't want to teach.
College Sophomore,1,The landlords are complete slums. They are drastically over priced peices of crap busting at the seams. Over priced animal deposits also.
College Freshman,1,"You must have a car to get places, this is a small town campus.  Everything is a few miles away. So make sure you have money to fuel your car or to give money to the person driving and make friends who go to Oklahoma City a lot so they can drive you to the airport if you live out of state."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is horrible and they keep removing parking options and replacing the parking lots with building or making them for staff only. If you have to commute, I'd reccommend arriving at least 30 minutes prior to class. If you live in town, I'd definitely recommend walking or riding a bike to class."
College Senior,1,The amount of financial aid I've received is great but the process was horrendous. I've been selected for review every semester and the financial aid office had me jumping through additional hoops and the receptionist lacked people skills.
College Junior,1,Most commuter parking has been turned into faculty parking. Which the faculty does not use very much because there isn't enough of them to fill it.
College Junior,1,"Oklahoma weather. Too hot, too dry, too wet, too cold. Extreme. Never temperate."
College Junior,1,There are not enough good parking spots on this campus. This campus could benefit greatly from a multilevel parking garage. The distance you have to cover on foot is horrendous if the weather is bad. Part of the college is on the side of the steep hill and it's a nightmare trying to go uphill. AAAGHH!!!
College Sophomore,1,Not that great of a reputation here. More like just a hobby in my opinion.
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus isn't the best thing if your a student that resides on campus. This is because most of the parking on campus is for faculty and commuters. Permits for students are free, all you have to do is register your car. You can get tickets on campus for parking almost anywhere and the fines for that are thirty-five days."
College Senior,1,"Even though the parking lots aren't very far from campus they are SO small and limited. They are building a new facility in the biggest parking lot we had so now people are having to park in the alleys and streets. If you get on campus 10 minutes early be prepared to be late. The parking officer is a stickler, even if it's pouring down rain he will slip your ticket in a plastic baggy."
College Junior,1,"ECU is located in a pretty small town and has very poor nightlife. The options for clubbing/bar is zero to zone and there are very few places to hangout in the town. However, there are several house parties if you are into that style of party. If you are underage however, party at your own risk."
College Freshman,1,"No Space! There is never enough space. With campus slowly expanding parking lots, are becoming buildings and most of the parking lots are over crowded and a walk from the classes."

Senior,5,My online experience is great. It works great for me because I am a visual learner so most professors do that. They are very quick with responding if I need help as well.
Senior,5,My experience there is very good. There is also something to do on campus. The professors are very helpful and the resources are great.
Sophomore,5,The professors I had last semester were great with online teaching. My friends on the other hand had sub par experiences.
Niche User,5,My overall experience at Penn State Abington was amazing. I'm so grateful for the professors I had and the friendships that I was able to have. Penn changed my life for the better and the only words I can put together are Thank you to my Penn State family.
Niche User,5,My online experience has been good. The professors have been very helpful throughout everything. I very much recommend online classes at Penn State Abington.
Sophomore,5,Very diverse and welcoming school. Great for transitioning to Penn State Main campus. Very clean and environmentally friendly. Professors and staff are very accommodating and understanding.
Sophomore,5,It was good during  the whole pandemic and teachers really did try their best for us to keep learning. They were very supportive and just wanted us to pass all of our classes.
Sophomore,5,"I wouldnâ€™t change a thing being a student at PSUA! The very first day, everyone was welcoming and very easy to make friends. I love That our classes are small and the professors really care about you."
Niche User,5,"Convenient to drive to, beautiful campus, teachers that work with you, and my friends are all attending this college. Close to the city yet in the suburbs."
Niche User,5,The online learning was perfect and a smooth transition with PSU. no glitches and no missing out on important classes.
Freshman,5,"Penn state Abington is a very lovely campus. There are adequate facilities. The teachers are extremely prepared for the classroom. The preparation and skills of my teachers are excellent, well organized that the student are motivated to assist and learn.Organised notebook with required paperwork are easy to find. The teacher's supervisors are easy to talk to and listens to the concerns that were expressed about the teacher. There is a good communication between the student and teacher. The student are more likely to strive and reach their full potential because the learning environment meet their individual needs."
Freshman,5,"My online experience has been interesting and are a convenience for me. They allow me to take additional classes that would not have fit into my schedule otherwise. I have learned just as much online as I would have in a class . I do not have the interactions with the teachers and the classmates, but I can email my teacher or my classmates at anytime. The online class  have a discussion board where my classmates and I can exchange comments and Ideas about our papers online. I do not feel as though I am missing out on anything by taking online classes. Actually, I am gaining much more than I am losing. My experience with online classes has been a rewarding learning experience."
Sophomore,5,Even though the campus is small there is a lot of things to do and enjoy as well as join.  Everyone aroun the campus is friendly.
Senior,5,"The campus is a little bit smaller than most, however that is what I love about! It is nice to feel that people know you and you are part of a community. The campus itself is so nice and has many areas to relax and feel the nice breeze when the weather is good!"
Senior,5,"The campus took care of things so great! Once everything was announced that everything was closing down, teachers really made it possible in such short notice to adapt to the new way of learning!"
Niche User,5,I like the campus and also on my first visit I meet with penn state students they are so pleasureable.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love it here. The teachers genuinely care about your well being, and I feel like I can actually succeed."
Freshman,5,Abington is completely diverse. You meet different types of people and become friends with others that you didn't think you would be friends with. It's an amazing experience and the campus is small but it's better than being at a bigger campus being lost and not interacting with your teachers as much as you want to.
Freshman,5,"So far, my experience with Penn State Abington has been quite limited as I am just a freshman here.  That does not mean however, that I have not been fully immersed in this school's culture and seen how its overall atmosphere and classes operate on campus."
Freshman,5,"One of the many things I like about Penn State Abington is the small, intimate campus. I also really enjoy the environment with the lake and the trees. Besides the campus aspect, all of the professors I have had so far have been very welcoming and easygoing which has allowed me to smoothly transition into the college scene. If there was one thing I could just about the campus it would not be the academics or involvement, it would be the parking. Although there are off-campus areas we are able to park at it would be more convenient to park closes to my classes."
Freshman,5,"I am almost finished with my first year here at Penn State Abington and I couldn't love it any better.  I was accepted into Harvard, Yale, and Johns Hopkins, but I definitely made the right choice attending here.  If you are a student considering applying, please do!  It is Amazing!"
Sophomore,5,I love being at Abington. the environment is peaceful and small. the professors are hardworking and caring. you have plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus. you also have plenty of opportunities to work with your professors on research projects. there are also study abroad options and scholarship options that you would not find at a larger campus.
Junior,5,I absolutely love Penn State Abington. I encourage people to come to Penn State. I am a general engineer at this school. I am thankful for all the opportunities and connections I've gotten at this school. For the staff members as well.
Senior,5,"took a tour of penn state abington. Like the fact it had the same reputation as University Park. small class, teacher to student ratio"
Senior,5,Penn state Abington has given me a very calm environment to continue my higher education. The campus is beautiful and the staff have been very helpful through the years that I have attended this  university.
Senior,5,I love this university.  Everyone seems so nice and teachers are willing to help if you try your best.
Freshman,5,"Penn State Abington is the most diverse campus compared to the other PSU campuses! I essentially get to meet everyone from around the globe. I moved from California to attend Penn State Abington. The Pennsylvania State University value that college is what you make it and this is your journey! There are a variety of clubs to get involved with and there is always something going on on campus. Students have many opportunities to get involved and make friends. The academics are great! I am a Biology major and the Science department has helped me thrive and strengthen my passion for studies! I love the campus because my classes are not huge and I get to have the opportunity to get to know my professors on a one on one basis. Penn State Abington has an amazing staff, student body, and academics! Students who are motivated, passionate, and hard working, would be great assets to the campus!!!"
Sophomore,5,"Penn State Abington deserves so much more than just a B. It has a giant number of breathtaking facts. It has a historically classical campus, atmosphere of a brilliant academic excellence, professors are really thinking for their students, every cent you pay worths more than any other branch campus of Penn State. The weaker side of this branch campus of PSU is its athletics and campus food. But essentially, this is absolutely the most exquisite branch campus with full of opportunities and proximity to Philadelphia. WE ARE!!!"
Sophomore,5,"It is a wonderful school with many great teachers, a few bad, but mainly great.   campus is a bit hilly and parking is horrible because everyone drives to school and no one uses the shuttles."
Sophomore,5,"Great experience, campus life is amazing. Professors are understanding and helpful. Students are kind, and always willing to assist."
Freshman,5,"As a current student attending Penn State Abington, I can say that this school is extremely welcoming. Staff, faculty and the students here are kind and helpful. I couldn't have chosen a better university to attend. The campus is stunning and finding the location to the different buildings is easy with signs and directions to the building. The shuttle buses are so useful for students, I know from personal experience. There's so much more at Abington that I still have yet to discover."
Sophomore,5,The people there are really nice. The types of groups and classes in this school are great. The sport teams are good.
Freshman,5,"Penn State Abington is located in a very high neighborhood, beautiful environment, surrounded by trees and hills. It is the perfect place to relax, think and just breathe fresh air. As they say ""you can never be unfit in Abington as walking to classes alone is all the  exercise you need"". Penn State Abington has the nicest students, the most diverse group with students from all seven continents and more than  21 different countries. Penn State Abington offers the courses I need with down to earth and easy enough to talk to professors. WE ARE PENN STATE (ROAR)"
Junior,5,"The school is not for everyone, but if you're looking for a home away from home and a quiet space, you've found the right place. Abington offers many opportunities, even though sometimes they're hard to make note or notice of. Not everything is said on the announcement sheet of every bathroom stall. 
The majority of teachers here are so dedicated to being here and teaching you. They actually care about you and what grade you get. If you don't, it's usually all down to how you studied, did you put effort, did you care at all, and did you ask them for help? I've had many teachers stay after class just to tutor me in subjects I only had to take once but needed to pass. Occasionally, you'll find a minority of teachers that aren't helpful. If that's the case, drop them, and take the class with someone else. Don't waste your time or your money when you could be learning from the best"
Freshman,5,"I am only a freshman at Penn State Abington but i am truly looking forward to spending my next 4 years here. I have been connected to Penn state since my eldest brother attended, and I've loved it every since. This school has so much passion and dedication. We Are..... PENN STATE."
Junior,5,The Penn State cafeteria foods aren't as good. I would want to see more options as well as the quality of the food.
Sophomore,5,I love the environment and the diversity of my college. The advisors could be better but other than that it is truly my second home. If you are looking for a place to call your home away from home Penn State is the place to go.
College Freshman,5,My campus safety and security for the campus and victims is excellent. They provide classes and workshops for all and they require all students to acquire knowledge on the area.
College Sophomore,5,Penn State Abington is one of the best schools where you get the best education and continuous helps from every professors.
College Sophomore,5,Professors are very knowledgeable about their subjects and teach effectively. Class sizes are fairly small for a university setting. A large variety of courses are available.
Junior,4,"My experience with Penn State Abington has been well. Because itâ€™s smaller than main campus where I started off, I feel like staff have the ability to be more personable"
Junior,4,Online learning is okay. Some professors do a really good job to make the best of the situation. I do feel like thereâ€™s way more work involved compared to in classroom learning.
Sophomore,4,Class sizes are smaller but that's good if you have trouble learning is larger environments. Very diverse campus but professors them are a hit or miss.
Sophomore,4,Professors were definitely not ready to transition to online schooling but for the situation at hand Penn State tried to make everyone happy and satisfied.
Alum,4,"Loved the diversity of the students and the beautiful campus. The smaller campus makes it so much easier to get to know the people around you and the professors. The campus continues to grow and improve every single year. From the time I started to the time I left I recognized a drastic great change in the facilities, academics, and location."
Alum,4,"I had only a few online classes and experiences, but overall they were positive experiences. I experienced very few technical errors on campus and it seemed like IT was responsive and always willing to help"
Sophomore,4,It as kind of tough from time to time but not overall. Had to tranition from person to person to online all of a sudden so everything changed drastically dirim hth COVOS-19.
Freshman,4,"Penn State Abington is the most beautiful and diverse Penn State campus. Since it is a smaller campus, the classroom sizes allow for the student to connect with their professor and not just be a face in the crowd. This campus has a lot of events to show off how proud we are for being so diverse."
Freshman,4,"I like the campus the small campus and small class size.  This way, I feel that it is easier for me to connect with my teachers and go to their office hours frequently.  Something that needs to be improved is parking.  Students and teachers has to get there really early if they want to get spots.  On top of that, the parking spaces are far too narrow."
Freshman,4,"There is sadly a lot of open drug use on and around campus. The students really bring down the quality of the earning environment because of that. Other than that, the campus is beautiful and the teachers and curriculum are well rounded and all together great!"
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at penn state Abington. I believe that the smaller sized classes and availability of the professors allows for the students to have a better chance of succeeding academically, rather than at a larger campus. The party scene may not be as fun as other schools, but it is academically beneficial."
Freshman,4,"I like that Penn State Abington is easily accessible to all potential students including older students, international students, and diverse students. I think it could be improved with on campus-housing and more buildings on campus, though there are a decent amount of activities on campus daily."
Freshman,4,"The friendships here are good, so are the clubs and the organizations. The professors are very good and they understand if you need help and will offer the extra credit."
Freshman,4,"Great professors. Diverse campus. Easy to navigate. Only downside would be the hills on campus, but you will be getting your steps and cardio in for sure."
Senior,4,"Penn State Abington is a great college for students that want to save money. It is an alternative of Penn State Main Campus, whether you spend all 4 years or do 2 years and transfer, it's up to you! I feel safe and relaxed on campus. BUT with 3 years of experience they do need to hire better Professors in the IT department."
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Abington is a small college part of the big Pennsylvania State University. Abington is located in a woods area with the only transportation being school shuttles, septa buses, cars, bikes, and uber/lyft. Although the campus is small, the environment is great with a good scenery. Walking around campus will give you sore legs but you'll make it in the end."
Freshman,4,"The process for applying and getting scheduled for my upcoming courses was smooth.

Faculty, Professors and all staff as well as students are extremely friendly and eager to help in any way possible"
Sophomore,4,I like that the teachers are friendly and can connect with easily. It's a good campus. You can come here to relax or exercise as the campus has activites and a good all big around park.
Sophomore,4,I like the convenient location and the friendly staff. The hours for student resources need to be extended.
Freshman,4,"Hello! I will be a Freshman at Penn State Abington this year. This campus is beautiful and the people working there are all extremely nice and helpful. They have plenty of diversity as people from all over the world are attending this school with their program for international students. The housing is very nice, as you have a full kitchen, living room, wifi, heating, and other amenities at your disposal. However, you must by your own groceries and cook for yourself because they do not offer meal plans at this campus. This would be my only complaint. Hope I helped!"
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Abington has an excellent 4-year degree program. The campus is peaceful, with a beautiful scenery. The students, faculty, and organizations are always friendly and helpful."
Freshman,4,The Penn State Abington campus is what ultimately made me come here. It is a quiet and safe environment. I love that the campus is small and that is not filled with thousands and thousands and thousands of students. The campus is also very active and there are always events going on everyday. My professors and classes are all great as well.
Freshman,4,"So far, the staff and environment is really nice. I have nothing to worry about while I am there and I always feel safe."
Freshman,4,"Great campus and involves many students in school activities. Nothing much I could change but the school food, might have to buy breakfast and lunch elsewhere."
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Abington is a small campus perfect for students who perform better in a ""small class""environment where an avg class has anywhere from 15-30 students, instead of 100-200 compared to big universities."
Senior,4,"I love Penn state Abington, because it is a commuter campus. It is easy to navigate. easy to make friends. Smaller campus with fewer students so it is easier to get in contact with professors and easier to enroll in the classes that you need."
Senior,4,"Penn State Abington is a great campus for students who are nontraditional and for transferring students. You get the college experience without having to go to the main campus. I enjoy all of the events every week to help students become more involved. What I don't like about the campus is  the parking situation, there are more students then parking spots. One must drive in circles waiting until another student comes out. My overall experience is at Penn State Abington is very good."
Freshman,4,"It's a great college with a lot of things going on. Because of it's small size, it is very easy to interact with staff, professors, and even department heads, where sometimes you can walk in to speak with them with no prior appointment being set. Everyone is very nice and supportive, and there are a wide range of opportunities to take advantage of (such as a 1 week embedded study abroad to Japan I just returned from)."
Freshman,4,"Penn State Abington is great because you get high quality education at an affordable rate. Most students are awarded financial aid and can commute to save money. At PSU Ab, you get a large institution education at a small campus. It is great because you are so near Philadelphia whereas University Park is in the middle of nowhere. Classes are smaller and if UPark is too big for you, Abington is a great choice."
Junior,4,"Penn State Abington is a very small campus in comparison to University Park. The student body is very diverse, so its easy to find other students you can fit in with. However,  student engagement has declined since I was a freshman, although I personally believe its one of the best ways to enjoy your college experience."
Freshman,4,"Penn state Abington is a very diversity campus. Students are from different parts of universes. We often have lots of opprotunities that opens up to students such as internships, jobs, etc. The environment is mostly green and fresh that creates benefits to the health."
Junior,4,"This is my first year at Penn State Abington, I completed my first two years at Penn State Schuylkill. And the atmosphere of the two campuses are completely different. However, I enjoy the Abington campus better. There are many more resources and actvites on campus since, the student body is large. One of the few changes I would make to the school, is some of the staff that works there. At times they can be rude."
Sophomore,4,i like penn state abington because of the selections of majors for a small school. they have many support systems and many activities to relieve stress outside of the classroom.
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Abington is very Laidback . It is kinda diverse depending on what diverse is to you. The education is great , good school for the Pen State title but not into all the extra stuff. Parking could be better. Party Scene horrible, the Area is really nothing."
Freshman,4,"Penn State Abington is a great place for education. In my case, it's close to home, I get the experience of one on one with teachers and a very hostile and friendly environment. Im playing a soccer on the schools team and it's teaching me a lot and keeping me in shape.  A lot of help and support is provided from stuff and all around campus. We Are Penn State."
Freshman,4,"The campus is very small, something most people that go there enjoy. If you're like me, however, I suggest going straight up to main."
Senior,4,I have a great experience at this college. The professors are always there if you need their help. There are various of clubs that you can join and the students there are really helpful and attentive.
Sophomore,4,"Well, this is my third semester at Penn State Abington and so far it has been a great journey. It is a small campus filled with diversity."
Freshman,4,"The area it is in is quiet. It's a smaller community that isn't that diverse, but that doesn't hinder your studies. You want to stay focus as much as possible, and since there isn't much to do around there, you don't have extra distractions. There are things you can find to do to pass the time, but usually I went back into the city to find the most success with that. Other than that, you still have a school community that is willing to help you succeed in everything that you do and are willing to help you when needed."
Graduate Student,4,"More class options/times would have been nice, but overall, the professors were great and I could get my four-year degree without transferring to main campus."
Sophomore,4,"The office hours are very helpful and beneficial, so make sure you go to your professors office hours for help. The professors are very kind and always willing to help students. Campus wise very beautiful with many activities and events to join."
Junior,4,"Penn State Abington is a great campus, with great food, great professors, great learning environment, and great people to interact with."
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Abington is a nice, small campus if you are looking for a cheap option to be a part of the Penn State family. Student Life on campus isn't lively, but there are clubs which try to get students involved, however since it is a commuter campus it can die down at night. Also Parking can be rough at certain parts of the day."
College Freshman,4,My professors are friendly and be willing to help. They always suggest you come to office hours if you need help.
College Freshman,4,Penn state offers alumni program for students that allows them to network and gain potential jobs/careers and internship.
College Freshman,4,"I love how diverse my school is and if you need help, there are so many resources available to you."
College Freshman,4,Professors are always helping students with any problems that they are dealing with. The students are very friendly to other students as well.
College Freshman,4,After I get my degree from Penn State I will be very educated in my major and I will find a job in my major.
College Freshman,4,Nothing bad happens on campus. We have a great staff and security.
College Freshman,4,"Campus is really fun, we always have different things to particpate in. There are many groups and clubs to join."
College Freshman,4,The teama players help and encourage each other everyday. They also are determine when they deal with their school work.
College Freshman,4,This school is so unique because of how diverse it is. The people and staff really are dedicated to become successful and help others do that as well.
Freshman,4,I enjoy it so far. Its a great school and Penn State has great programs to offer. Abington is a good commuter campus with a solid faculty and staff. I am excited to transfer up to University Park and live at State College in two years.
College Freshman,4,I'm not involved but there are a lot of Nittany fans.
College Sophomore,4,I am not an athletic person but yes our athletic teams are great.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I've had an good experience at Penn State. I'm just looking for better years apart of the Penn State Family."
College Sophomore,4,Every semester there is a job fair held to help graduates and students still enrolled to find jobs. The alumni are always excited to hire Penn State students.
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are secondary to academics at PSU Abington. Students who are involved in sports are very involved, but those of us who are not on a sports team don't pay much attention to them."
College Sophomore,4,PSU Abington has plenty of places to hang out with friends on and off campus. Student organizations and on campus events allow relationships to develop and makes it easier for people to make friends.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoyed some of my professors this past year. They had office hours that usually worked around my schedule or they would schedule a day that I could meet them if their office hours didn't work for me. One of my professors stayed an extra hour to help me study for a test which I really appreciated that she took time out of her day to help me. The class sizes were good depending on the subject of the class. My smallest class was 20 students and my biggest class was 90 students. There is  a good variety of courses to choose from but some classes that are needed for your major might be at a different branch campus or at the main campus.
Niche User,2,"I spent part of my first semester here and I wish I could take it back and just have started somewhere else. If you live at Lionsgate and have friends going in you'll probably have a good time, otherwise you probably won't. It's racially diverse, sure, but most people either travel in cliques or look like they're rushing to get out.  If you have to stay over lunch there really aren't many edible options on campus, but you can drive and find some over in Jenkintown. The teachers I had were really nice and personable, but that was overshadowed by academics that were just too simple. The parking lots are awful.  And what the hell is up with that awful smelling elevator in the Woodland building? It smells like sticking your face in a gym locker. Anyway, unless you and your best friend just put a deposit down on a Lionsgate apartment or you're perfectly fine with all of the above, just go to Bucks or MontCo, at least you'll save your money."
College Sophomore,2,"Beautiful, but not great for technical majors."
College Junior,2,"It's a commuter campus, so there's not much of a party scene."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Do not know much from my personal experience but there is no ""off campus"" on apartments that are not really mandated by the school and I heard they're pretty bad."
College Freshman,2,there is only one fraternity and one sorority
College Freshman,2,Financial Aid didn't give me what I needed and it was a long process.
College Junior,2,Need to come early for parking spot
College Freshman,2,"The spring semester, expect to lose at least 2 or 3 full weeks of school."
College Freshman,2,It's hard but you have to just try your best.
College Freshman,2,We had a lot of snow this year so we had a lot of cancelations.
College Sophomore,2,Abington is an expensive area to live in and there is no on-campus living.
College Sophomore,2,Snow always affects whether the campus will close
College Junior,2,I have to pay every two months and its killing me
College Junior,2,I never seen a police officer
College Junior,2,"Every time i get there, there are no spots to park"
College Junior,2,All the apartment complexes in the area are either really expensive or far
College Sophomore,2,"There's not much going on around this campus. No local places to hangout, or local activities where a lot of us college students can go to. It's located in the suburbs in a pretty dry town. Closest place for entertainment is Philadelphia."
College Sophomore,2,"Commuter campus so the weather affects me a lot. When it snows, class gets cancelled. When it rains it just makes walking from classes and driving to the school an annoying task."
College Freshman,2,Abington does not really have a lot of places to dine off campus. You will have to find transportation to find some place to eat. The prices are fair and not outrageous.
College Junior,2,"It's a commuter campus so there is really no night-life per se. Some clubs organize somethings after 6:00pm but that doesn't count as night-life in my book. For students who live close to campus, they go over to Temple University to party or all the way to the city. Transportation is easy, shuttle buses run from the school to bus-stops and train stops. Parking is also free."
College Sophomore,1,My campus does not have Greek Life.
Recent Alumnus,1,"""Off campus"" would be the local shopping center so it is not anything special."
Recent Alumnus,1,Since it is mostly a commuter school there basically is no night life.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life because it is a commuter campus
College Sophomore,1,"We dont have greek life on our campus, and if we do im not aware of it even though it's a fairly small campus."
College Freshman,1,"Fininacial aid is nearly impossible to get, at least a helpful amount"
College Junior,1,Nothing is happening at night
College Sophomore,1,"Looking for a nightlife at Abington? Nope, non-existent. Abington is alive during the day when students are at school. However, as the sun goes down, so does the hype. Abington is a commuting school with no dorms so you can imagine why the place is abandoned at night. There are the frequent events that Abington or clubs at Abington throw at night, but no crazy parties or bar/club scenes."
College Freshman,1,Abington doesn't have a campus or dorms . You have to commute to school
Recent Alumnus,1,Penn State Abington does not have dormitories and living in the area is very pricy.
College Freshman,1,Greek life appears to not exist at Penn State Abington. There is no housing and I barley see any Greeks.
College Freshman,1,"If you like going out at night, partying, or having a good time.. DON""T COME TO THIS SCHOOL!! The party scene here is terrible, there is literally nothing to do at Abington during the daytime or at night. Don't go to this school, it sucks, you will regret it."
College Sophomore,1,No Night Life Really â€“ It's a commute campus so there really is no night life unless you meet people who have apartments.
College Sophomore,1,"Majors Filling up Too Fast â€“ The major that I would like to study is nursing. However my application to become a nursing major was not accepted due to the major being full. Because of this, I had to choose undecided as my major and now I must transfer to a new college in order to become a nurse. I would love to stay at Abington but unfortunately this is not possible and it is slightly upsetting."
College Sophomore,1,If You Loved Your Life at High School â€“ Penn State Abington is just like going to high school. Everyone lives at home with their parents and the school is filled with immature people that are not quite ready to leave the nest. I moved here from far away looking forward to a real college experience. Safe to say you will get disappointed if that's what you're looking for. This school is embarrassing for Penn State
College Sophomore,1,"Don't Go Here â€“ It's the most boring school you can imagine. No school spirit, nothing going on, and lame people"
College Sophomore,1,There is no nightlife associated with school what so ever. You will be bored out of your mind
College Student,1,"its hard to get accepted by groups as most of them already formed from their various high schools,so as new students getting them to accept you involuntarily is hard"
College Junior,1,"Night Life Doesn't Exist â€“ I just transferred here from another school. There is no housing on campus yet, so everyone commutes, so there really is no night life on campus. There are bars you can go to, but if you don't live close its pointless to come around."

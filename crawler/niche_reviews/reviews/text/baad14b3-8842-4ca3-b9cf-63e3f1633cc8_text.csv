Freshman,5,I am currently taking my classes online due to COVID and I find the online learning to be very instructive. It can be difficult to focus sometimes due to the lack of  the classroom setting
Freshman,5,I love doing the online classes they're super easy to get done and it's honestly nice getting to stay home
Freshman,5,Super easy to do online despite the pandemic. Good classes and nice teachers. I'm only writing this to apply for a scholarship lol
Freshman,5,"Phenomenal staff! Super helpful and competent even throughout the pandemic. Thanks, WCC. Can't wait to start in the Fall!"
Freshman,5,"So far everything has been very easy to access and the schedules are very flexible, so I can schedule work around school."
Junior,5,Before Covid happened the online learning was very good. although now you will find some teachers who don't know what their doing.
Junior,5,"Whatcom is way better than my High School was, I barely learned anything in HS but Whatcom made me feel like I wasn't a complete idiot."
Alum,5,"Overall, I loved my experience at Whatcom CC. I'm glad I chose this school to get my associate's degree at, instead of going to a 4 year university and wasting my time and money when I wasn't sure what I wanted to do for sure. Being able to take classes and work toward an associate's degree helped me figure out what I want to do in life. If there is one main thing I would recommend, it's to go to ratemyprofessor.com and make sure to read about the professors you are going to have. I definitely would recommend this school."
Alum,5,"My online experience at WCC was a great one. I was hesitant to take online courses, but I was prepared to give my all at them and as long as you put in the work, it will pay off. I did a lot of discussion boards and writing essays, however I grew so much as a person and the online professors I had were extremely helpful and quick to respond when I had a question or needed clarification on something. These classes are nice to take during the summer time if you don't want to be commuting to campus all of the time. I would definitely recommend taking Whatcom's online classes."
Sophomore,5,Very straightforward and easy to understand. The teachers still reach out and are involved in the studies.
Sophomore,5,"All the teachers are very nice and helpful, the atmosphere is great. There is a lot of diversity in the students."
Sophomore,5,"I love that even though it's a smaller educational facility and a community college, WCC the same high quality training and advising that any major university or trade school does. They are an extremely welcoming and open campus and are passionate about equality amongst their students and always do right by the student body when discriminatory issues occur."
Senior,5,"As someone who waited many years to return to school and attempt an Associate's Degree, Whatcom is a great environment for me. There was a sense of community and inclusion throughout the school. I only wish my own schedule at home allowed me to go to all the wonderful events hosted on campus. I was nervous returning to school after such a long time, getting married and having kids, but going to Whatcom made for a comfortable learning environment."
Senior,5,"Small class sizes, tons of support from teachers and services, student job opportunities, beautiful campus, and great teachers"
Alum,5,"I had an amazing experience at Whatcom. The amount of resources that were available to me such as AIM and BFET were immensely helpful and crucial to my success as a student there. The instructors were all people who I got a long with, and while not all teaching styles worked for me, there were some instructors whose techniques and teachings have impacted my life and will certainly continued to be used throughout the rest of my life."
Sophomore,5,Whatcom is a really good in between school. It's cheaper to go to rather than go right to a 4 year school. I highly recommend it.
Freshman,5,The staff and community are incredible. You get the feeling people really care about your existence. Professors are understanding and willing to work with you if you have things going on in your life that might interfere with your schooling.
Sophomore,5,"Whatcom was great for what it is. Small class sizes, some really great professors. It's what you make of it, you have to put in the work to do well."
Senior,5,"I attended WCC as a full-time Running Start student for two years, the student resources that were made available were very useful especially the library's silent room and the learning center. As a student of color, the intercultural center was also a great place to be in regards to the sense of community created there amongst other students of color as well and was a very welcoming space. Professors were sometimes hit or miss but when they hit, they were extremely knowledgable and likable people who had passion for what they taught and really wanted to students to learn rather than just pursue a grade."
Sophomore,5,"Whatcom Community College contributes to the vitality of its communities by providing quality education in academic transfer, professional-technical and life-long learning, preparing students for active citizenship in a global society. Whatcom is a Gem that anyone should consider."
Niche User,5,"Though I am relatively new to WCC, I have to rate it as excellent because of the accessibility of educational opportunities for returning, non-traditional, and fully employed students. The course offerings and education options are available for those that can only attend at night, they have increasing offerings for distance learning, and their non-credit courses are enriching."
Alum,5,"Attending Whatcom Community College was one of the best decesions I have ever made. I graduated from Whatcom this past year and I could not be happier of receiving my Associates degree from here. The school always wants the best for students and is easy to ask for help when you need it. Professors truly care about you, and what you to succeed, which is exactly what I did."
Freshman,5,"Whatcom Community College encourages student involvement, student leadership, student lead conferences, diversity, and self expression. They have fantastic teachers, who respond to emails efficiently and are always welcoming. The environment on campus and in classes is very safe. Teachers  try to engage students rather than lecture all of the time. Teachers are always encouraging discussions. The campus has great resources for students like tutoring, bus passes, computer labs, lots of studying areas, smoking areas, counseling, and lots transfer or job fairs. They have a lot of fun events as well as informational events held on campus. It's just a fantastic school."
Sophomore,5,"Whatcom Community College has treated me very well.  The quality of academics has been high, and if you take the time to look for good professors, you can find some very good ones.  I'm a transfer student who will be getting my AA as a direct transfer degree, which means my credits will all transfer as a package to the university in Oregon I will be attending.  I'm a big fan of transferring from a community college to a university if you want to save money on a college education.  Whatcom definitely delivers in that respect, with a worthwhile education at a much lower cost than two years at a university.  If you live in Northwest Washington, or are interested in a quality community college that is located in the same city as a university (Western Washington University), then this could be the school for you."
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed my year at Whatcom Community College. Their admissions process was a breeze and they seem to have an efficient system running. All of the teachers I had were great and scheduling classes was very simple. I really appreciated the templates they had available online to help students plan their degrees and it makes it so that students can easily see if they have met all of their degree requirements. Their academic advisers were also a great help to me and truly know what they are doing Overall this is a great school.
Sophomore,5,Whatcom Community College is a great place to thrive because of the caring faculty members. They truly try their best to help you if you are struggling. Whatcom also offers Math and  English learning centers where you can drop in at anytime and get help from tutors on any assignment. The only thing I would like to see change is the weather! It is always so rainy in the Pacific Northwest.
Graduate Student,5,"My experience at Whatcom Community College was really good, I graduated with an Associate degree and now I am back to get my transfer degree and I am more than happy to do so at this college, because I had all the resources and help I needed to graduate the first time and now I also have a lot of support from the counselors and instructors that work at this college. Great place to meet new people from many different cultures, and has a diversity of clubs and groups support students."
Sophomore,5,"Whatcom Community College is a very good 2-year school.  It offers excellent academics that transfer very well to most any 4-year institutions and the campus is attractive and well organized.  The city of Bellingham is a great place to live and work and the surrounding environment provides ocean, lakes, and mountains with all the outdoor experiences a person could want."
Sophomore,5,The teachers in my experience have all been phenomenal. They all care deeply about the success of their students. The campus is also beautiful. I would stay longer if I could.
Junior,5,"The teachers are all very educated and knowledgeable at Whatcom. The classes are small and personal, I get to interact with other students and teachers with ease. The campus is convenient and quite comfortable."
Alum,5,Whatcom is exactly what you would want in a community college. Not only is it cheap it is also high quality. there are plenty of students that come down from western Washington university in order to take classes at the community college because of the attention you can get from the teacher with smaller class sizes.
Sophomore,5,I feel Like I am Part of a great community. Any time I have had a personal or life issue come up I have people to turn to who really listen and care. I feel Safe on my campus. Diversity is important and this is a diverse campus.
Freshman,5,"I've taken classes at a few different colleges, and the support from Whatcom is incredible. You are not alone trying to figure out location or your classes, you have a team online and in person randomly checking in and they respond quickly to questions and concerns."
Sophomore,5,Whatcom Community College is hands down the best 2-year school in the United States of America.  The Visual Communications Program is top-notch and as good as one in a 4 year university.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the instructors at WCC and all the additional help that is available across campus. I felt very supported at this school.
Sophomore,5,"I loved the comfortable atmosphere and inclusion in the school community. The quality of education is good and for the most part the professors teach you a lot about your desired subject. However, the food on campus is far too expensive and there isn't many other options nearby. I highly recommend having a car if you want to go to school here."
Niche User,5,"I started running start my senior year at Whatcom Community College, it is a welcome and very friendly place to learn. I was scared my first day but soon I realized that I had nothing to worry about the classes are flexible which makes it easy to choose from."
Niche User,5,I have been attending Whatcom Community College since 2012. I absolutely love the campus and the academics.
Senior,5,"Whatcom Community College is a welcoming academic establishment where students feel they are receiving a priceless education. Class sizes remain below thirty students, allowing for students and teachers to receive one-on-one learning experiences. Teachers care for each of their students, as students make an effort to learn and engage in the content they are being taught."
Junior,5,"Great college! Great diversity, fun times with convincing reasons to succeed in life. This college has been a blessing and showed me that I can achieve many things. One thing I like from this college is that you can graduate in a variety of topics and transfer out into another 4 year university. "
College Senior,5,The instructors that I have had so far have all been really passionate about what they are teaching. Some are also working on their masters degree.
College Sophomore,5,Transferring credits was a hassle free experience.
College Sophomore,5,"Due to class sizes being smaller, student to professor relationship is excellent"
College Sophomore,5,"Job prospects are great, the career center helps a lot."
College Sophomore,5,"Classes are semi small, great student to teacher ratio. Programs offered meant my expectations"
College Sophomore,5,Career center has great resources to get information you need.
College Sophomore,5,"My school is excellent, it's sitting on a beautiful campus and provides many fields for students to stay active outdoors."
College Sophomore,5,"Whatcom Community College has provide me a suitable educational experience and a community that understands the needs of the individual. Professors and students alike attempt to explore personalised approach whilst attaining an educational experience to examine new ways to learn, grow, and process. My courses, right now, has been primarily of an exploring period as I continue to address fields of interest in which I can prosper in. But in my current exploration state, the professors and staffs have offered a variety of choices and guidelines that I've orientated to recently and matched my wild schedules and learning preferences whether they be online or traditional methods. Although resources are limited, the content of my experiences have been dominant as to provide me, so far, an ubiquitous content of relations, interactive learning methods, and styles suitable for my individual needs. Community-wise, I've experienced a great deal of sense of belonging and the school have enlightened me in new gateways as I continue to explore pathways for my future."
College Sophomore,5,"The college's student body values more so towards what they want to do and how should they approach it. Exploring one's field of orientation seems to dominate the minds of fellow peers as the community college serves the gateway for higher universities such as the University of Washington and Western Washington University. The gateway school offers a more exploration-based approach and has a variety of opportunities in which students can gravitate towards such as job and internship programmes within the city and community. Services and employers of the school personalise the students in their own way with many forming interactive bonds and community-like relations. But unfortunately, the school lacks a strong alumni network considering the school does not gravitate towards those fields. Nevertheless, the community environment from students and staffs alike placate the network through many approaches and links."
College Sophomore,5,"The schools is not only an insitutition for academic success, but a community of the small town of Bellingham. Its curriculum is manageable and fast-paced, but with the teacher's flexibility, one can assure themselves that they have a right to respectable right to ask for aid in regards to acquiring knowledge. Educational programmes are diverse in teaching with different styles, combinations, and approaches to attempt to understand the most efficient way to personalise and aid the students in their successes. With the digitisation of the school, the workload have been quite manageable as modern conveniences can be synthesised with school work and activities and accommodate and personalise the students' workloads. Although the facilities are small, the ones that are present are efficient enough to distribute resources amongst the students and faculty members and educate the students to their personal needs. Opportunities for jobs, volunteers, sports, clubs, and other activities have been prioritised to apply for community and individual necessities with much of those based within the community itself such as internships to the Spark Museum in Bellingham's city centre. Education-wise, the school offers quite a commutative approach to settling students towards academic achievements."
College Sophomore,5,Makes you feel at home and if you're lost or don't understand something the faculty is always there to help!
Recent Alumnus,5,Beautiful School with wonderful professors and classes
College Senior,5,"My school is great. My professors are easy to follow along and enjoy answering questions that other students have as they go. Also, the campus is a beautiful site and the activities available are numerous."
College Junior,5,"Going back to school was the best choice I could have made. I am extremely pleased with Whatcom Community College overall, and the support which is available."
College Senior,5,I loved the athletic community and was able to be friends with all the athletes. We became close together and it was easy to make friends. I wouldn't change my school because it is one amazing campus with great people who care about their education and some even sports.
College Senior,5,I love that classes are really small and that the professor can work and interact with his students on a personal level.
College Senior,5,"They are so many different types of people in the student body at my school that it is pretty awesome that there is so much diversity. We have awesome speakers, and even presentations about diversity."
College Junior,5,The library is great and the student advising is very accommodating.
College Junior,5,"Whatcom Community College faculty are passionate teachers, helpful receptionists, sweet librarians, and friendly counselors."
College Senior,5,"This is my first year in college but i have been enjoying myself immensely, getting to know these awesome people.  Some are acquaintances that i see on occasion and others have become dear friends that i have gone on camping trips with and excitedly debated the content of courses we may be sharing at the time.  The general student body is diverse culturally, people from many backgrounds.  i get to hear at least 3-4 different foreign languages in a given week there; Chinese, Japanese, Punjabi, Spanish, German, and so on.  There are students AND staff that make sure that we are a very accepting group of people--  no matter racial or political background, no matter sexual orientation or economic status, all are welcome and any conglomeration of students is welcome.  It is good, going to college in the 21st century in the Pacific NW, and this school is a fine example!"
Freshman,4,I find WCC to be very student-oriented. I enjoy being a student here. The campus is very easy to navigate and the teachers are very engaging.
Alum,4,"Whatcom has a wonderful staff and is in a nice area for those looking for the college experience without the bulk of Seattle. Theres many good places for food with in walking distance and plenty of night time activities in the city. The professors were all enthusiastic about teaching and accommodating of those needing help. The math department was the only department that left much to be desired, but I only had two teachers for the whole department and don’t want to lessen my opinion for a mediocre course. Advisors are all helpful at helping you achieve your goals and the staff are friendly. I would definitely recommend this college and am sad to be leaving."
Sophomore,4,"I had a great time at Whatcom Community College. The staff, faculty, instructors are very nice and friendly. They helped us the best within their ability. I met a lot friends here. Also, we had many campus events held for students to get involved and have fun."
Sophomore,4,I like Whatcom Community College because they worked well with me to create a cooperative extension credit to create the kind of community change that I really care about. They also have a Intercultural Center which is a safe place for me on campus.
Junior,4,I love Whatcom Community College. I am doing running start right now and this is my second year and so far its been great. the teachers are very friendly and know that you're still high school students and try to make it a fun environment for younger kids. There are lots of student helping centers that I have had to use and they are great in helping you with essays and math problems.
Graduate Student,4,Whatcom was a very relaxed atmosphere. The buildings were well layed out according to academics and the professors were for the most part very good and more relational than your typical college professors.
Freshman,4,Whatcom is very opening with new activities and clubs! Campus is beautiful and I love watching it expand and grow in the community.
Freshman,4,Whatcom Community College has been great so far. After attending classes during my senior year (as part of the Running Start program) I was eager to come back and decide on a transfer degree. This school appears to be well known for bringing it's community together and specializes in cyber security. I am prepared to start my journey in the computer science program and see where it takes me!
Alum,4,The college is very nice and has a lot of services. Some of the teachers were problematic when I went there but they seemed to get removed pretty quickly when they got reported. Community is fantastic!
Senior,4,"Welcoming school with a variety of teaching styles, clubs, and activities on campus. Almost every professor I've had here has been very kind and willing to take questions regarding readings and assignments."
Niche User,4,"Whatcom Community College is a friendly, and open community. We have many events for students and all faculty that i have met have been kind and informative to me. They are currently building a new building and trying to extend themselves to more four year degrees which makes going there a bit hectic at the moment. Despite this, their doors are always open to anyone and they make sure you know they want to support you in all aspects of your life whether you need help with school or even finding food (check out the Orca Pantry). They are inclusive and have made my experience memorable."
Freshman,4,I think WCC is a good school that offers a wide variety of classes and has a nice campus. I think on of the best things is all the resources available in forms of tutoring as well as advising. I cant really think of anything I'd want to change.
Sophomore,4,Whatcom cc works hard to guarantee your success as a student. There are lots of available resources to help guide you through college. I would like to see Whatcom cc become a more diverse college and more accepting/understanding of peoples diversity.
Sophomore,4,Whatcom has been a great college for my transfer degree endeavors. The faculty has been very kind and helpful and the students have been great classmates as well. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my classes and look forward to finishing this last year there.
Sophomore,4,My experience at Whatcom has been pretty good. The professors are really nice and you get to know them a bit more personally.
Sophomore,4,"During the time I have been studying at Whatcom Community College, I really enjoy the excellent professors, advisors, and staffs who have helped me to deal with my academic lessons, student life as an international student, and my transferring plan to a four-year university. The campus and environment around campus are safe and peaceful even though the city is small and does not have a lot of fun places to go to. However, food in the cafeteria is expensive and not very tasty, which makes me never try to buy something there. Last but not least, the school does not have any dorm, so it hires local apartment for students to rent, which is more expensive than home-stays they offers for international students. That is why I am still living with a host family after two years starting to study here."
Freshman,4,"I loved Whatcom Community College, but getting involved was somewhat difficult. There didn't seem to be very many options."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are there for your success. The library is the place on campus to do all your studies. In the next year or two, there will also be a new student center made specifically for students."
Freshman,4,"The teachers are amazing, they really care about the students and their education. The surrounding area around the campus is very exciting and lots of cool scenery to see while you are not at school. They have very good resources if you are struggling with classes."
Junior,4,"The atmosphere and professors are great, however there is not too much extra curricular involvement and better deli selection would be great."
Sophomore,4,Whatcom community college has a small but beautiful campus and is right in the heart of beautiful bellingham Washington. Whatcom offers a good variety of classes with great professors who are very available to help you. There are small class sizes and a lot of student activities. The building are all well kept and the athletic building is almost brand new. There is a variety of sports teams and clubs. Overall a very good school.
Sophomore,4,Whatcom Community College has a great faculty that enables their student body to be successful while challenging us academically. Most of the teachers go out of their way to respond to emails and make sure that your quarter is going successfully. The advisers at Whatcom Community College are always ready to help you out with any questions that you might have!
Graduate Student,4,I liked their library and their nursing program. The instructors truly work with you and help you succeed. I wish the library was open until midnight.
Sophomore,4,Whatcom Community College is a fun and engaging school to be a part of. The campus is beautiful and the professors actually care about their students. Classes do a great job in covering their material and the school does an excellent job when it comes to social and cultural equality.
Junior,4,I have been at WCC for three years and it has been a great experience for me. Whatcom is a great diverse place with amazing student activities. There is a huge diversity of students. We have the best cyber security program in the country and the highest percentage of international students in the country as well.
Freshman,4,"It has been a great school. Very affordable, and easy to schedule around work so that I can work and go to school at the same time."
College Junior,4,"Since Whatcom is a community college, it gives everyone a great tipping point, go out and find a job, or transfer to another school and contunue your education. Which is great for me because I plan on transfering to Western Washington University and I'll have half of my studies done already!"
College Senior,4,"I enjoy being able to have online classes. They are convenient when you are sick and can't make it into class, you can turn in assignments online."
College Senior,4,I am going for the Hospitality & Tourism Management certificate so that can give me prospects of transferring or going into a job in a hotel.
College Senior,4,"There are aspects that I can use in the way of internships, but I haven't used them yet."
College Senior,4,"It depends on the instructor on the workload, but it hasn't been fairly large."
College Senior,4,I have been able to enjoy my class and instructors. The school is small so you can easily find classes.
College Sophomore,4,"The school campus offers a diverse range of student activity centres and services that bring the individual self towards communities and cultures of the area. These student activities are often encouraged by staffs as a way for students to get involve in a community and feel a sense of exploring new fields for students to engage in. The communal atmosphere influences greatly in the quality of the work as many fields orientated towards community-based platforms and individual connections with others. Although the campus lacks a strong alumni network, the content of the student programmes, initiated by many dedicated staffs, have placated its absence and provided a much broader approach of community-student relations."
College Sophomore,4,"In most levels, Whatcom Community College has offered a wide degree of flexibility in placating to the needs of the individual whether they be family-related, work-related, or otherwise. The community-like environment has influenced greatly in dealing with personal concerns with schedules, work, and other relative circumstances. Because of the strong community sense amongst many, a sense of understanding towards other concerns have manifested along with a liberal sense of compassion and community. Schedules can run from eight hundred to as late as twenty hundred (8:00-20:00) in traditional classrooms which offers a very large amount of flexibility. Autonomy in course shifts and hassles has also been evident amongst course choosing and guides and aids have been quite helpful to the student body in enlightening a variety of heteromorphic platforms for their futures."
College Sophomore,4,"Although, I have not experienced these post-grad services myself, I have heard that Whatcom Community College had a prosperous career centre that aims to bring students towards the community and enlighten many to different and diverse fields in which one can orientate to. The lack of a strong alumni network can placate with job offers, volunteer initiatives, and programmes that gravitate students to explore different fields based on their persona, psyche, and individual fancies. With the community environment, most services offer quality choices within the community itself with friendly overtones and a sense of belonging amongst many faces."
College Sophomore,4,"Whatcom Community College offers a variety of courses that stimulate one's personal schedule, taste, style, and orientation towards one field to another. Class sizes, of course, can be expanded in regards to the cozy settings in which students have to engage in, but nevertheless, the educators make use of the class size with more content, stimulating education, and personalise approaches. The school's educators are mostly creative to express certain ways to teach and individualise learning styles knowing that students must be equip, not as a group, but as an individual."
College Sophomore,4,"Whatcom Community College is quite surreal to experience and have flexible activities to manage between classes, sports, clubs, and other opportunities. My experience within its campus is currently manageable to a degree with quite a lot of area to shift classes or schedules. The teachers are mostly flexible when addressing personal situations that may mar my and other students' education. Fortunately, the students are also communal in addressing problems amongst their fellow peers as well as engaging in civil contact with both the teachers and the community as a whole. Because of its smaller frame, the school has a communal feel that addresses each individual for who they are within its confines. The community certainly expresses concerns whenever a person struggles to achieve their priorities."
College Sophomore,4,Profs are very attentive and interested in your learning. Friendly and approachable make it easy to come to them with a question about the course or material.
College Sophomore,4,Classes are fast paced and have regular homework.
College Sophomore,4,"Nice campus, good profs, brand new rec center."
College Junior,4,I would highly recommend getting involved in Student Government. Whatcom has a great program that focuses on student development. It is a good way to build your resume and get some tuition help.
College Senior,4,"I am a student athlete at this school and being a student athlete sounds stressful already. However, thanks to my coaches, athletic directors, counselors, and all of my teachers together, balancing school, work, and play was no problem! The only struggle was the first few days of intense practice and then having a test the next morning! Oh well, that just shows you that you were making progress! Plus, exercise is good for the brain so I probably aced those tests!"
College Junior,4,The professors are very knowledgeable about the subjects that they teach and are very willing to help a student if they are struggling.
College Senior,4,"I was able to have really great times for my classes and my flexibility was really good. I am having a lot issues with transferring, but I will be able to."
College Senior,4,The career center helps students adjust get their foot in the door to the new jobs and are very helpful.
College Senior,4,Many of the professors know what they are doing and I love the type of curriculum that they have. There are so many options at the community college that I wouldn't expect that we would have this many programs.
College Senior,4,What I like is the programs with massaging they offer free massages because students at the community college are trying to gain more experience.
College Junior,4,"It's made very clear from the beginning that this program is time-consuming and hard.  There are no options for class times; it is what it is.  There were no surprises though, as the admin/faculty make this fact known about the nursing program."
College Junior,4,"The program is tough and the standards are high.  I've worked exceptionally hard and, with the help of my professors, I'm heading in the direction that I planned on when I applied to this school/program.  It hasn't been easy but I'm happy with my progress at this school/program."
College Junior,4,Absolutely no complaints.  I'm grateful to be attending this school.
College Junior,4,"The program that I'm in (nursing) is extremely competitive and the level of education is superb.  The pass rate for the NCLEX exam to become an RN after graduating from the program is exceptional.  Last year, the pass rate was 100%."
College Junior,4,"I took a hybrid online class.  It worked out great for me to work on my own for the lecture material and attend in-person labs.  The professor was attentive and helpful.  It was a good experience and if I could, I would definitely take more classes online."
College Junior,4,"From what I've seen, there is a lot of diversity on campus.  People are very accepting of this and I would say that the school works hard to promote safe and comfortable campus for everyone."
College Junior,4,"It's been an easy, straightforward process."
College Junior,4,"The workload is intense but overall, it's a great program and I'm grateful to be a part of it.  The facilities are amazing, however, I would like to see more study areas that allow students to have study groups within the facility."
College Junior,4,The professors are great.  They're very helpful and knowledgeable.  I never feel intimidated to ask questions.
College Junior,4,"Overall, I've been very satisfied with the resources available on campus.  I am disappointed that the gym is currently unavailable, however I appreciate that it's being upgraded and will utilize it next year when it's complete."
College Junior,4,classes offered at many times
College Junior,4,"close to home, reasonable costs, beautiful area, meets all my needs"
College Junior,4,This school provides excellent direction in order to transfer and pursue my degree.
College Junior,2,Each advisor I have spoken to tells me something different.
College Sophomore,2,I have yet to see a job fair as this is a community college but there are plenty of transfer fairs and a well staffed career center.
College Junior,2,I think it is the best community college here in whatcom but that not good
College Junior,2,"Fin aid wants to cut me off when I am almost done. Because I had one bad quarter, which I did every thing they had asked of me"
College Junior,2,Financial aid is so frustrating. I couldn't even file last year because the school kept needing more and more from me
College Student,2,The WiFi doesn't work very well.  Pages take a long time to load.
College Student,2,"You really have to ""Look"" to find people like you at Whatcom."
College Senior,2,At the moment I'm attending a Community College and will soon be transferring to SPU (I've already been accepted). The diversity between the two schools are are two different levels. At WCC it seems that the teachers and even the students are very liberal. Which is opposite from me. I'm conservative.
College Junior,2,"I find this school flexible to running start students and day students, but I used to work full time during the day and wanted to go to school full time as well. It was nearly impossible to find the classes I needed in the evening as well as online to pertain to my degree"
Recent Alumnus,2,The college does not have a creative problem solving approach; they pretty much go by the book.
College Junior,2,"not too special, it was honestly kind of a dull but it was ok im not complaining."
College Junior,2,the way financial aid works at whatcom community college isnt as much as expected and the small increments process is honestly frustrating.
College Junior,2,"the computer network at my school sometimes can be a problem, it does not necessarily work all the time and sometimes gives the faculty and students a troubleshoot. also, there aren’t that many computer labs unless you’re in the library or a lab class. many students have to walk from one building to the library just to use a computer. the network can be reliable most of the time, but when needed for other important times it doesn’t pull through. the speed on the other hand is in some good shape, but just as long as the network goes through. there aren’t as many computers as I thought there would be and would like to see more, but the most we have are in our library."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Though I have met some great people at Whatcom and gained alot of valuable knowledge, I'd have to say overall I've been a bit surprised by the - to put it mildly - lack of professionalism exhibited by some of the staff and faculty. It's been quite surprising at times."
College Junior,2,"I thought online courses would be great so I enrolled in Astronomy online.  This was one of the most confusing and horrific experiences of my academic career.  I finally had to drop the class when I realized that there were a bunch of missed quizzes in a folder of the site that I had never even had brought to my attention!  The site is impossible to navigate, my teacher lived in Olympia, and my questions were never answered.  You don't realize how nice teachers explaining things to you are until they are gone!"
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid process is horrible!  They do not have enough staff on hand to effectively help students.  They will not return e-mails or phone calls in a timely manner.  They do not help enough students.  Their goal needs to be to help the students of the college, but it seems that is not their intent at all."
College Sophomore,2,Online Classes Are Not for Me – I have only attempted to take one online course and ended up dropping it because it didn't fit my type of learning. I enrolled in a three credit technical writing class that should have been at least five credits with the amount of work required for it. One problem i had was getting on to the live chats and having everything work smoothly. It was also hard to get one on one time with the teacher in person. Overall I came to the conclusion that online classes are not for me.
College Sophomore,2,"Computer Labs on Campus – The computer labs on campus are always packed full of people and there is no time limit on any of the computers, which makes it hard to get time on one because some people sit there for hours, without thinking twice about giving someone else a turn. Also, the online ""Oasis"" system isn't very efficient. I frequently get a ""system busy"" message when trying to access my information."
College Junior,2,In my school there is a large range of people. Going from very young to people who are looking to further their carrer. Student interaction seems to be mostly just in school. There is not much more other than that.
College Junior,1,My professor lived on another state. He was slow to respond and get grades in. I still hadn't received a grade back for my rough draft before my final paper was due.
College Junior,1,the career center works along with worksource. Do not keep the job postings up to date
College Junior,1,the schools computers and networks are the slowest
College Senior,1,"I never use the computers available on campus because the are outdated, slow, and the log-in process is a little more complicated than necessary.  It is also difficult to connect to wi-fi on campus."
College Junior,1,"I only say this based most from the FAFSA not the school. I have never relied on my parents yet their income makes it so I receive no financial aid. I work full time and go to school full time, its already hard for me to live and I am racking up thousands in debt. I just wish there was more options as far as aid and more flexibility."
College Sophomore,1,"My first quarter's worth of classes have nothing whatsoever to do with my major. I understand that there are certain requirements I have to achieve no matter what in order to ultimately receive my bachelor's degree, but there are some classes that honestly are just a waste of my time and money."
Recent Alumnus,1,The Administration and Staff Are All Total Liars and Don't Even Give the Right Information – I kept getting the run around and they said they recognized my voice and that's how they knew to give me the run around.  I asked if they had caller id and they said no it's your high pitched voice.  The Vice President said that she was going to kick me out of the school because I asked too many questions and that I couldn't go to my classes so that I didn't get very good grades that quarter.  Now I'm looking for a lawyer.  She also commented on my facial expressions in the intimidation/interrogation room and said she thought I could do something good not great like she had already sized me up yet I'd nevr met her before.  She also told me I mix things up in my head and that she went around and asked the whole staff about me so when I walk around the school everyone stares at me and I'm not supppose to talk to anyone or call.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I called the library and asked for some math books and the libraian said the books were there and she would help when I came in.  I came in soaking wet and couldn't find parking for 20 mins and drove all the way to the school the libraian hid behind the counter of four other libraians and said she couldn't leave the counter yet she was just standing there and lied and said she would over the phone.  I said you told me you would and she walked upstairs for the books and laughed and said o we don't have them in and I asked her what was so great and funny what her big smile was about she said maybe I'm just a happy person.  Then I said o your happy when other people aren't.  She complained to the administration about me that my tone of voice wasn't following the student responsibility of speaking.

Another libraian there looks at people up and down and her friends say the students give the dirty looks if they give her the same look back then they complain to the administration that the student is disrespectful."
Recent Alumnus,1,American Literature – Was the worst online class.  The only traditional class I have taken the teacher basically said it's like you don't get anything I say and she couldn't answer my questions and she also lied to me about the registration and how they wouldn't let her give me the grade she wanted to give me yet they gave me an e-mail saying she could give me any grade I needed.

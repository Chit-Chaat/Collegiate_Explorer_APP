Sophomore,5,"I totally recommend the University of Dubuque the school is very diverse, the teachers are amazing and very helpful in trying to help you become successful."
Freshman,5,"A perfect University if you are looking for a small campus. When attending the University of Dubuque, you are not just a number, your professors know your name and it's a warm and welcoming environment!"
Freshman,5,"At the University of Dubuque I have been getting great teachers, classes, and coaches. Overall, I have not had any issues with staff and my surroundings at the university."
Freshman,5,The university is a very updated and feels at home. The school is very welcoming and full of character. It is a school I recommend especially for nursing.
Niche User,5,What an amazing and excellent University.  The people and the atmosphere are warm and welcoming.  Midwestern kindness surrounds the campus.
Freshman,5,"This has been my first year at UD, and boy am I impressed. I have had a great chance to meet new friends and live in a beautiful part of Iowa. I also have been studying hard for my classes and got help when I needed from my instructors."
Freshman,5,I love this place and I'm glad that I picked the University of Dubuque. It offers me the courses that I need and the support system is great for the students.
Sophomore,5,This place is beautiful. It is small quite. You really have a chance to get to know your professors and have a chance to talk about your standing in the class.
Senior,5,"I went into the University of Dubuque as a transfer student and I loved the atmosphere of the school and how welcoming and friendly everybody was. It really made my first year at Dubuque great! I really don't have anything negative to say about the school because the professors were great, athletics, and the campus itself was amazing."
Senior,5,"Diverse, friendly environment. The professors make you feel very welcomed and that they truly enjoy teaching."
Sophomore,5,I really fell in love with the University of Dubuque. The only thing I didn't enjoy was dorms and housing on campus.
Freshman,5,I love the campus. The layout is great. It is very clean. There are several new buildings. The admission staff is awesome. They are quick to respond to questions and very helpful. They have made attending the University of Dubuque affordable for me and my family. They made registration easy and full of useful content. I am super excited to get into the nursing program.
Junior,5,Professors and staff are very kind and helpful. Theyâ€™re all very straight to the point and do not waste your time. The food is awesome and the campus is beautiful!
Sophomore,5,The University of Dubuque is a great school that is very committed to your education. I absolutely love the school and its size. It is a small school with a big city feel to it. I have yet to have a professor that I feel doesn't care about me or my education. The student life here is very good and all the students are very outgoing and caring of others. I have loved every second that I have been enrolled at this school and highly recommend it to everyone looking for a great small college that isn't in the middle of no where.
Senior,5,The University of Dubuque offers something for everybody and if it doesn't something can be created. Professors are understanding of athletic schedules and they'll also attend your events. UD is one of the leading schools in diversity which also works to educate everyone on cultural differences.
Junior,5,"Since transferring from another school, I have been very impressed with the faculty of the department I am in. They have helped me set my courses for the next 2 years so I can graduate on time. I like the size of the school; all of my professors/teachers know me; I am not just a number."
Freshman,5,"I am so exited to attend University of Dubuque . The overall experience as a freshmen has pass my expectation. I am part of the football team witch treats me and all the other players as a family,I couldn't have ask more especially being away from home.Let me tell you about the food in cafeteria,it's great. Being an athlete this is so important especially that you can grab a bite any time of the day on so many location.Teachers and staff is always there for me if there is a questions to be answers or any other help I needed with my work. As I have just finished with my first semester with a GPA 4.0 and 3 majors of study I am so exited to continue with next semester and new challenges that are upon me. I would recommend everyone to at least visit the University of Dubuque before they make any final decision in their college to be ."
Sophomore,5,Super friendly school and staff and very clean campus. Classes are fun and educational. they offer a multi-diverse of graduate and undergraduate programs.
Freshman,5,"The faculty makes it feel like you are at home, and the Coaches are some of the best. Academics is valued very highly and they help all students as much as they can. When it comes to resources facilities, the University of Dubuque has some of the best."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the University of Dubuque. It has a small campus which allows you to get to know just about everybody personally. The professors are great and willing to work one on one and get to know you personally. Overall it is a great school and would choose it all over again given the opportunity.
Junior,5,The advisors in the business department are absolutely wonderful (specifically the accounting department)! I came to UD with no idea what I wanted to do and they helped get me on track by setting me up for 150 credits in only three years. Everything about UD feels like home and I love it!
College Sophomore,5,"The school is just the right choice for me.  The staff no matter the ranking is polite, friendly, helpful and everyone tries to know everyone by name.  The President of the school will eat lunch with the students and also knows us by name.  The teachers in my field of studies are very knowledgeable and makes the lessons interesting to keep your attention and want to learn.  I actually left the school my first semester for family reasons but contacted the school and went right back the Spring semester.  This is the school I want to be at and glad I came back."
College Junior,5,"I was in a varsity sport for some of my time here. I came to this school because it had my major and to a lesser extent, because all of the facilities, sport related or not, were very modern and up to date. The indoor track and gym is very modern and has all of the lifting machines and weights one could want. This school is also one of the few division three schools in the country to have an indoor turf field. Even those that don't compete in varsity sports are able to use the indoor turf field."
College Freshman,5,I have never had a problem with my safety on campus.
College Freshman,5,I believe that our school really puts in effort making sure the athletes are happy with being on the team and being at that school.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone gets involved in some way
College Sophomore,5,The school has received several donations in the last few years. They have taken that money and built first class buildings.
College Sophomore,5,The athletics are good and they have put money into giving good facilities to help improve the athletics.
College Sophomore,5,Security is always are watching making sure the campus is safe
College Sophomore,5,The classes are very modern and the class sizes small which I really like
College Sophomore,5,Career Services are very helpful and the alumni are always coming to help other students
College Sophomore,5,The buildings are very nice inside and very well kept. But I wish there was more to do inside
College Freshman,5,The career center goes out of their way to help you. They search for people in the career field you're interested in and have them come in and set up interviews for them.
College Freshman,5,It is great how the professors get to know you and talk to you one on one in class or any where on campus.
College Freshman,5,"Everything for athletics is updated and new, very beautiful facilities."
College Sophomore,5,Our security does a wonderful job of taking care of anything wrong on campus; there is next to no crime what so ever. They take cae of anything they need to more ofen than any other place I have seen.
College Freshman,5,"Small class sizes, academics are actually pretty good. Just do your work and you won't have any problems"
College Junior,5,I have never felt unsafe on campus!
College Junior,5,I love UD it has an amazing science program. I get to do my own research project under a professor. I get so much experience here in the lab that I would never get at a big school. It is my dream to go to PA school or medical school and UD is preparing me well!
College Freshman,5,"The campus security is really good here at the University of Dubuque. Granted, you don't hear much about anything really happening here, but you have to keep in mind that the security plays a part of that. I feel safe on campus and I also know that there are girls that say the same thing. I don't feel threatened in any way shape or form when I am on campus."
College Freshman,5,I love people and experiencing new things and that's simply what college is all about. You get to meet people that have been raised on a farm to people who are army brats and have lived in multiple countries. It's really interesting to get to know what other people have been through and how they've been raised.
College Sophomore,5,That's all I can say...GOOOODDD!!!
College Freshman,5,"lots of dining, shopping options, a few bars downtown. great area to live in"
College Freshman,5,"We have an actual nursing unit they can be used if there was a major public issue that cause injury to all of our community. feel very safe walking around campus, even at night"
College Freshman,5,best college I could have chosen
College Freshman,5,"great meal plans, awesome food"
College Freshman,5,The local bus is free for anyone will college id
College Freshman,5,We have great athletic teams
College Freshman,5,"Lots of apartments for rent in the area, growing community, lots of new business' coming in."
College Freshman,5,"other students are really cool, only a few dumb ones, the food is awesome, the staff is friendly. best school ever!"
College Freshman,5,"The school is spotless, the class are great, and most teachers truly care about their students success "
College Freshman,5,"HUGE ATHLETIC SCHOOL, GREAT FACILITIES AND A LOT OF SUPPORT FOR STUDENT ATHLETES."
Recent Alumnus,5,"This really is a lovely place, with a lot of friendly people. My favorite event is in the spring, when they have a huge, week-long anti-slavery rally (fair trade fashion shows, panels, guest speakers); seeing all of the students willingly come together for a cause is a wonderful experience. These guys do not mess around - once the week is over, they still carry their values with them. Amazing!"
Recent Alumnus,5,"Super cute! It's a decent-sized town with a big-town/city mentality, but still very suburban. Everyone is very helpful and friendly, and the area never looks like a ""ghost town."""
College Freshman,5,We have a dry campus and the policy is not to even come back on campus if you've been using drugs
College Sophomore,5,"I came to UD because they offered the program I wanted to study. When I compared UD to other schools that had an Aviation Program, I realized that it was the most reasonable one."
College Sophomore,5,Park Village is the way to go if you're an Upperclassmen.
Recent Alumnus,5,They have a place in the library that will help you
College Sophomore,5,"It Takes Time + Dedication â€“ They tell us that we have to earn our degrees here at UD, because no one is going to do the work for us."
Sophomore,4,It was very challenging at first coming from a face to face class to online but after a few weeks things started to become easier. The only problem with the online class you have to wait for an email back from your professor.
Alum,4,The University of Dubuque has a charming and clean campus. All of the faculty is absolutely wonderful and truly care about you as an individual.
Sophomore,4,I like the diversity and the welcome feeling you get from the staff and personal .The campus is smaller which allows getting to and from classes easy . The food could improve but most kids eat off campus .
Sophomore,4,"A great school that makes you feel like more than just an account number. Over time, people will begin to learn your name and you will recognize the happy faces that help you on the daily."
Senior,4,"My experiences with the school have been a good one because it is a small school and is easy to meet people. However, sometimes you would get a teacher that is bad at teaching a specific subject or bad overall. Although this happens sometimes, the other teachers within the school make up for the bad ones and actually makes the class more enjoyable."
Graduate Student,4,"Currently attending the LIFE graduate program.  I like the 5 week classes.  Fast paced, but learn a lot.  Didn't like online courses, so this is perfect...1 night a week for 3 hours.  Works well with my family and work schedules"
Junior,4,"The small size of the college really creates an excellent atmosphere. People are nice, the teachers care about you, and the everyone wants you to succeed."
Junior,4,I love how close everyone is here. I feel like I am part of a family when I walk on campus. The small student population and the student to professor ratio is perfect for me and my learning needs. I feel like a person here instead of just a number. The professors are really good at making connections with you and getting to know you as a person.
Sophomore,4,I really enjoyed my first year at the University of Dubuque! Everyone on campus was so friendly and they really helped make UD my home! The class sizes are perfect because you are able to connect with not only your peers but your professors as well! Also the campus is growing and beautiful!
Senior,4,The University of Dubuque is a unique place. It has all the recreation and athletic facilities of a division 1 or 2 school but itâ€™s small. The newer facilities are what first attracted me to campus. Once I got there and started meeting professors and other students it really felt like home. Because itâ€™s a smaller college the professors get to know you on a personal level. Once you get into your program you have classes with the same students so you become very close. The city of Dubuque is very beautiful as well. There is so much to do and see. Since itâ€™s on the Mississippi River you get very pretty views all throughout the year.
Freshman,4,"Overall my first year experience with the University of Dubuque has been quite positive. I choose this school mainly because its an aviation school close enough to my home and family. I realized quickly over my many visits last year that this school has a great community oriented culture of respect, integrity and dedication to academics. Through attending classes I met some amazing professors and flight instructors who really do care about the students as individuals and encourage the learning process. I don't as of now know whether it will be a great return on investment or not this being my first year and all."
Freshman,4,"My University of Dubuque experience has been great, Within just four months of being here I learned more about  myself and others. I also learned that paying for college is not easy, this school is great on diversity and helping out their students. Attending university of Dubuque was a great choice for me because I was able to get out of Chicago. Till this day This school is still the right choice for me, but paying for it has been hard but I know now how to budget my money earned and put it towards paying for tutiton."
Sophomore,4,"I have only been attending the University of Dubuque for about a year now, going into my sophomore semester. Thus far, I really enjoy the environment and community that I am around. The city is surrounded with good and very kind people, specifically at our university. The facilities are amazing and to top that there is actually some pretty good food. Although not the largest school, I feel at home and feel welcome. Overall, a great university to attend."
Sophomore,4,"I think that the University of Dubuque is a great school, as long as you are fine with being in a smaller city. There are many scenic things to do; like camping, hiking, and photography. But if you are looking for a party scene, then it is not for you. The staff and professors are for the most part helpful and understanding. Most classes are very small so you can get more help from them. Everyone is very friendly and easy to talk to."
Junior,4,My junior year at the University of dubuque was very inspiring to continuing my major in sports marketing and management. Along with continuing my education I was also a part of the men's basketball team.
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone at school is great, friendly and supportive.  The classes are small and you have access to individual help when needed."
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very knowledgeable in there careers and offer help to keep you on track to meet all requirements to obtain your career goals.
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe at school and so far have has no issues.
College Sophomore,4,Housing is good.  There are many different types of people learning to live together and at time it is a struggle but everyone works together to make it work.
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at school are great.  There is something for every sport and there is a gym that is available to anyone.  There is usually many pick up basketball games to play and all the players are great.
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are great, and long as you try in class, you should get an A."
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy all of the professors at UD. Many of them are very nice and helpful and will make time for you whenever you need it. I had one teacher give the classroom six or seven different ways to contact him. I have event had a dinner at one of my professors houses before. All in all, I like all of the professors at UD."
College Junior,4,"University of Dubuque makes it very clear that there is a problem on college campuses regarding sexual assaults. There are many different things that the colleges do regarding this. Many of my classes have discussed this issue, which I'm certain is the norm for UD. The other thing they do is require everyone to take an online course regarding sexual assaults. the course is time consuming and they threaten to take away certain things if not completed which I personally don't like."
College Junior,4,"I was nervous to come to college as most kids are. Fortunately, every professor I had was extremely helpful and friendly. I finished the first semester absolutely loving my school. Professors made my courses easy to perform well in and also showed interest in every one of their students."
College Freshman,4,The Greek Orgs are small but great! You have to put in a solid effort to get into an org but it's worth it. Hazing is not a big thing here at all. Don't worry about anyone forcing you to do anything if you don't want to.
College Sophomore,4,I liked living in the dorms
College Sophomore,4,Everyone gets to know each other
College Freshman,4,Security does regular patrols around campus and they are a friendly presence around the university but there have been a couple of things that have happened that question how seriously students take security on campus.
College Freshman,4,The professors are some of the best I have ever seen.  It's not very often that somebody can say that they have coffee with their professor before class most days but I have done just that.  They are dedicated to their work and their students and look forward to each day.
College Freshman,4,All of the professors on campus have had some kind of experience with the field they are teaching and thus have a plethora of contacts and have used them to create pipeline programs throughout the course and the university.
College Freshman,4,As a freshman I get it pretty good.  The three freshmen dorms are right up in the heart of campus which makes dorm-to-class time 5 minutes or less.  Upperclassmen have it a little harder as it is about a quarter mile walk from their living facilities to class but there is a shuttle from that part of campus up to the north side of campus which is very helpful.
College Freshman,4,The facilities for athletes and people that want to work out are top notch and that is coming from a person that spent two summers at a D1 school for a summer program.  The sports are highly supported on campus and around the city.
College Freshman,4,"Coming in as an Aviation major the phrase ""Trial by fire"" was the main topic of the whole first semester.  However, the professors were more than accommodating and are always there to help with anything from being stressed to needing that extra cup of coffee to finish the day.  I see that every day in not just my major but others as well.  the community here is unmatched anywhere that I have seen."
College Sophomore,4,The school has a lot to offer and is willing to help you out in any situation. There is a good family vibe here and everyone is very close to each other.
Recent Alumnus,4,Every parking lot has multiple emergency poles and security cameras to ensure campus safety. Security is available 24/7.
Recent Alumnus,4,"From what I have seen, most professors are very willing to work with you to make sure you have everything you need to succeed. I like the smaller class sizes and the professors I work with."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have never lived in the freshman dorms, on campus, however the sophomore dorms are very nice inside and out. Free cleaning services come in and out multiple times a day to reassure cleanliness. The rooms are big enough to fit 2 people and still have some extra room."
College Sophomore,4,It's a nice small campus. All the stuff will know you very well and there all very helpful
College Freshman,4,"It is a safe school, not much to worry about."
College Freshman,4,"At first I was skeptical, then I learned more people and hung around the school more and talked to the teachers more, and got a better relationship with them and now I like the school, just really expensive to attend."
College Sophomore,4,"University of Dubuque has given me the opportunity to be extremely involved on campus.  I was involved in a lot coming from a smaller high school, so going to a smaller college gave me the same chance.  Almost all of the professors I have had have a passion for the coursework and care for each and every student who shows effort.  Through honors courses I feel like I am challenged enough.  Between multiple jobs, a sport, involvement in groups and organizations, and the people I've met here, I never feel like I'm not getting the most out of my college experience."
College Senior,4,I had a very good overall experience at UD. The professors and other students were nice and easy to talk to. As a transfer student it was difficult to meet new people at times. The small class sizes were extremely helpful in understanding and learning the material.
College Junior,4,"teachers, classes, and living arrangements are great but there is not much to do outside of school."
College Freshman,4,"They work with your situation. Yes, it takes some work to receive the aid, but the school will give you grants if you describe your issues. They gave me a lot of money!"
College Freshman,4,"We have great food available. Yes, they don't have a ton of options, but they do have decent food. I've never had a bad meal at Heritage. Our cafe isn't the greatest for lunch and dinner, but we have a great breakfast and brunch!"
College Freshman,4,I plan on having an internship. I heard UD is very good at setting that up.
College Freshman,4,There are a ton of people in this school. They are many different kinds of people if you actually go out to go meet new people.
College Freshman,4,"The recruiters are always in your business. They call, email, call your parents... They basically stalk you. They make you feel like you're wanted. We have a special service at our school called Career Services and they do a great job in making you feel like you are going to have a successful job somewhere after attending UD."
College Freshman,4,"We have three colleges total in Dubuque, so it's nice to meet other students from other colleges. Also, there are usually parties every weekend. You need to have connections with people, but those connections are pretty easy to get."
College Sophomore,4,"Dubuque is a great place to raise a family; it has low crime rates, many activities, and just a beautiful area. And it is cheap!"
College Sophomore,4,I have really learned a lot since high school and it really helped me realize more responsibilities. So many friendly people and a beautiful place all around.
College Sophomore,4,"They do a wondeful hob when it comes to preparing students for the after college life. They hold many events such as mock interviews, etiquiette dinners, and life prep courses."
College Sophomore,4,Students within this campus are very kind and close to all of them exercise consistantly. And basically all of them take care of themselves.
College Sophomore,4,The Greek life on campus does a great job when it comes to fundraisers and making events for students to participate in. Everyone appreciates what they do for our community.
College Sophomore,4,We have a beautiful sports complex; and out sports teams are getting better every year. Fan support is always great and fair; we share a lot of sportsmenship.
College Junior,4,"Options are great because they offer varieties, however, it's the same old stuff everyday, and I don't like the closing times"
College Freshman,4,"It's great, I cannot wait to live off-campus myself as living on campus is only worth the first year experience."
College Sophomore,4,"There about every option you can think of when it comes to off-campus, weather it is Mcdonalds or fancy."
College Sophomore,4,"I attend the University of Dubuque as a Sophomore and my major is Human Health Science. Living here on campus in our brand new dorms are beautiful, spacious, but the only downfall is that it is a little costly."
College Sophomore,4,Getting aid/ scholarships here was relatively easy for me so not complaints from me.
College Freshman,2,We have a non existing greek life on our campus. To me that is sad.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life in general is usually just a joke. They say will help you in the long run by the really doesn't.
College Freshman,2,"They don't care if you show up. If you hit the max and you don't show up, that's against your grade. They will work with you if you miss assignments though. The library is the place where kids will study. It gets hectic towards finals!"
College Freshman,2,"Dubuque is an old town, so their isn't much going on ever. It's easy to go downtown and see things by the Mississippi River though. The safety is okay. I rarely see cops unless it is a Friday or Saturday night."
College Freshman,2,"I never see anything that our greek life does. I never hear about anything that they do either. None of the groups have a house, but they have small little areas that they meet up in. Most people say that being in this Greek Life is a joke. I believe that this is a lie. These groups do amazing things, but they don't get any more of a social status."
College Freshman,2,"UD doesn't have a lot of rules that they follow. They tell you that it is against the rules, but they never really act upon it. You won't have any issues if you are respectful to others though. Also, if you stay in your dorm room and aren't super loud or obnoxious, you can drink. I can't tell you how many weekends freshman stay in and drink in their dorm rooms. It's ridiculous. They say it's a ""dry"" campus, but they won't come barging into your room and writing a write up."
College Freshman,2,"First off i don't go out to party, but there is never anyting on campus or close by, its alwasy away at other campus which makes it a hassel becasue i have to drive and find some place to crash there."
College Freshman,2,There's hardly any party scene unless you make a 30+ minute drive someplace else.
College Freshman,2,Seriously just look up the history of Dubuque if you are black.
College Freshman,2,All the girls have boyfriends back home. The ones that don't talk to every boy who compliments them
College Freshman,2,There are not many places to choose from to live off campus
College Freshman,2,Its a dry campus so no good parties happen on campus. The parties that happen off campus are usually really weak with people just standing around looking stupid. The bars are the best place to go if your looking for a party or neighboring schools in the state.
College Sophomore,2,"It is way over priced.  The Park Village apartments cost nearly $1,000 per month per person, so they are getting $5,000 per apartment which is outrageous.  Park Village is also far from classes and the shuttle times are very inconvenient this year forcing most students to walk in bad weather.  Other than that Park Village is a nice place to live.  Cassatt, Donnell, and Aitchison dorms are very old and have no heating.  They are old and run down and not nice.  Aitchison had a very bad ant and cockroach problem which was extremely disgusting.  Any campus housing you have, you must pay $80 for a parking pass.  The parking lot for the freshmen dorms is very far away.  The Park Village lot is often full from parents attending sporting events and using the lot to park."
College Sophomore,2,Most people leave campus for the weekends to go party at other schools.
College Freshman,2,"This school is very expensive. Very expensive. Also the school doesn't offer a lot of scholarships, so you'd have to find some outside money and scholarships to help and pay for the school."
College Sophomore,2,"If you don't have a car, you gonna have a hard time moving on campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,There are not any 18 clubs so its mostly for 1 and older.
Recent Alumnus,2,Just like any where else in the country. Some good some bad.
Recent Alumnus,2,Professors were really good....student services did a poor job of counseling people.
College Sophomore,2,We need more parking spaces and they need to reinforce the whole parking ticket system.
Niche User,1,Transfered out after realizing that no one really took anything seriously. I regret deciding to attempt UD. It's not worth the money at all.
Niche User,1,Professors were very unhelpful and graded papers extremely late. Contacting them was nearly impossible at times. I had to teach myself every thing.
Alum,1,"A Christian school with morals, tuition and loans that make your life a living Hell. The focus is on athletics, which are sub par. The school buildings and dorms are run down, with the exception of a new building or two. All of the tech equipment is incredibly outdated. The school has zero interest in helping its students succeed in life. If you run out of money, youâ€™re pretty much dead to them, unless you threaten to sue. Iâ€™ve steered so many aviation students away from this college. If you have dreams, donâ€™t go to Dubuque Iowa, or the University of Dubuque."
Freshman,1,"This school is terrible . I am from chicago and there is nothing to do in the area. The parties are small, the safety is bad. Someone broke into my car and stole money from me and took 40 dollars out of my wallet while i was sleeping. I really want to go home and transfer i wouldn't reccommend anyone to attend this school."
College Freshman,1,The freshmen dorms are absolutely disgusting. I never walked around anywhere without shows on my feet.
College Freshman,1,the parties at the University of Dubuque are nonexistent
College Freshman,1,you don't have to sign anyone in or out of the dorms. its pointless to even have visitation hours. security doesn't care if you have alcohol or if you drink in your rooms. and there was constantly people smoking pot in their rooms in Donnell and no one did anything about it. the only thing they were interested in was giving you parking tickets so you could pay the University even more than what you were paying them in the first place.
College Freshman,1,its literally the same food every day for the whole entire year.
College Freshman,1,"Quiet hours were never enforced, there was a parking lot outside of our dorms that we couldn't use because it was  ""faculty only"" and we had to park a mile away from our dorms, and thats not an exaggeration either. security is horrible and takes forever to get to you, there are barely any of those blue security lights on the walk to or from your car thats in a parking lot forever away. the dorms were disgusting, there were bugs and spiders everywhere, and the floors were never clean."
College Freshman,1,"The general food area or cafe, the food is really bad but its all you can eat. The Heritage center has the same food everyday and even that quality isn't up to par. The overall quality of food here is extremely bad"
College Junior,1,"Barely any national fraternities or sororities, not very active."
College Freshman,1,"The police are VERY strict about underage drinking and drug use. It's pretty serious if you get caught. From an under age standpoint, it's best to take turns being DD and make sure you are discreet. Bring your best track shoes because you will run from cops if you plan to stay in the party scene."
College Freshman,1,"The only thing about parking on camus is the distance, and when it comes to winter it may be one of the worst things on campus. The UD campus security is very strict when it comes to parking and who goes where, etc. and it has its flaws. I am just glad I have not heard about any break-ins."
College Sophomore,1,"At the University of Dubuque, there isn't much of a nightlife. There are the movies, a few clubs, and your friends houses if they have any off campus. Usually here, a lot of people just go home for the weekends or once their done with classes for the week. There isn't much of a nightlife unless you do something with a few friends and build up from there."
College Sophomore,1,Very Small â€“ There is not much greek life on campus.  Most of the sororities are based in the basements off the dorms.  I do not hear much about what the Greek life is up to on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"As parking goes, you might want to get to campus at least half hour before your class actually begins just because you might end up having the park a block away and walk. In order to be able to park in the lots, you are needed to have a parking permit for that specific lot and if you park there without a permit then you risk receiving a ticket."
College Freshman,1,Meet the Greek â€“ There are very few soroities and frats. WE rely on the Greeks o throw parties most of the time.  Most of the ones here are local. Greek life isn't the biggest thing at Dubuque.
College Freshman,1,Party Life...What's That? There are absolutely no parties in aroung the unviersity. The only fun places around are bars and you obviously have to be 21. The best thing to do is find friends at more exciting schools and part with them on the weekends
College Freshman,1,"Dry Campus â€“ Don't drink on campus!!! If your caught on campus and depending on your major, it is a one way ticket to being expelled.

College Junior,1,"If You Are Seminary, Then You're Fine â€“ There are no scholarships for anyone in the CGIM program.  There are very few scholarships for regular students.  However, if you are in the seminary program, there are many scholarships for you.  There is one scholarship for normal students, but you have to complete essays and homework that the scholarship program gives you, which is a lot!"

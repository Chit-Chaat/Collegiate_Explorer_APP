Graduate Student,5,I am online student only i have never been to campus. But everyone online has been great and very helpful.
Graduate Student,5,So far my experience has been great they have all been willing to assist if I need to call them. I am new to the online experience and they have guided me through this process very well
Sophomore,5,"When I was in high school, OPSU was second to last to the school I wanted to go to, but the choir director there begged me to go, so I eventually caved in. Now, 2 years in, I don't ever want to leave. Sadly, I changed my major to music therapy, yet another thing my director convinced me to do. OPSU doesn't have this major, so I have to transfer. This school has done so much for me, like improve my mental health, show me what true friends are like, and introduce me to a staff who truly cares about your education and improvement. This school is truly amazing."
Junior,5,"Great school, Cheap and affordable. In rural oklahoma and doesn't have much to do so lacking off gets hard because there isn't much you can do after a while."
Sophomore,5,OPSU is a very small University.  It has a great choir department.  The best part of OPSU is the Art Department.  They are wonder
Junior,5,My experience here at Panhandle has been nothing but positive. The professors are diligent and have exceeded my expectations. Although as a criminal justice student I don't have many opportunities to engage within like many other departments do. So I'd like to see a change in that.
Freshman,5,"I love the small town feel of the university, and the professors are much more willing to help on an individual basis"
Niche User,5,OPSU is a great school for being in such a small town. The campus is excellent. It is very diverse. The professors are very good. The food is great for being a school. The area is kind of small with not much to do but the school makes up for it all.
Junior,5,"I've enjoyed OPSU because it's like being a member of a little community.  I feel like I know everyone on campus, there are many  opportunities to be involved, and the professors know students by name.  The class sizes are smaller but the material is still challenging.  I highly recommend Oklahoma Panhandle State University!"
Freshman,5,"This is a great university, since I enrolled and started school everyone has been very friendly and nice, the professors are really great as well they explain the material just fine."
College Freshman,5,Being at this school has made me want to go so far in life. I didn't know that a school would want a student to succeed so much more than the student itself.
College Freshman,5,Partying in the panhandle is really safe. Nobody really takes advantage of anyone and everybody is out just to have a good time.
College Sophomore,5,this is one school where you can meet so many different types o people. No two people are the same
College Sophomore,5,we have people from everywhere !
College Sophomore,5,JUST ASK QUESTIONS TO YOUR ADVISOR
College Sophomore,5,The Ag and Science department are the best departments on campus and the teachers are amazing
College Sophomore,5,The teacher actually care how your doing and if your sick or something is going on they always work with you
College Sophomore,5,This school has been more than I could have ever wanted for a college life. I have been able to do so much here and learn so much and I would keep on choosing this school no matter how many times over I had a chance to choose.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Just go to the office building, get an adviser, and go talk to him/her. Tell your adviser what you want to do, and if the classes you want are available, they will get you taken care of."
College Sophomore,5,There is a huge lack in parking for students. Even if you arrive on campus 20 or 30 minutes before your class you still aren't insured a decent parking spot. Everything however is of walking distance and conviniently located.
Sophomore,4,At OPSU it is good to see that the professors  know you by your first name and not just as another student that is in the class. Really like that it has a small community feel within the college and everyone knows everyone.
Sophomore,4,Great campus I came to a school where I knew people. Great meeting new people as well. Also getting to play ball in a new environment with people who actually want to see you do good.
Junior,4,I have attended OPSU for the last year. It is a small university in the heart of the Oklahoma Panhandle. I enjoy the fact that class sizes are small and diverse.
Sophomore,4,"Oklahoma Panhandle State University lies in the small town called Guymon. Lots of People are complaining that there is nothing to do and that the town is empty. However, that is exactly what I like about it. The campus is nice and paceful, people are extremely nice and friendly and my overall experience is positive. Plus If you do not know what time it is, the train that goes around every hour will tell you the time very reliably."
Freshman,4,"The admission process was really easy and fast.The admissions office was really helpful through out the whole process, they took time to listen to my difficulties and questions and always had useful information for me in return"
Junior,4,"Here at OPSU the teachers are great and get to know everyone on a first name basis. They actually care about your well-being and are concerned for student progress. Class size is relatively small which is great so that your questions are more likely to get answered. We have great agriculture, art, and computer information systems programs here. The people that attend here are outgoing, friendly, and courteous. It is easy to find friends here. We have a great set of apartments and our dorms are actually getting redone this year so they will be real nice as well. The only downside to coming here is that there is not really much to do besides hang out and go watch movies. There are not any restaurants in this town and the nearest place to get groceries is ten miles away. So definitely keep that in mind if you plan on coming here but do not let that stand in the way of your decision."
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe all the time on campus I'm never worried about anything while I'm on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"They have different companies come to the ag building a lot, that always are offering jobs or internships."
College Sophomore,4,"There's a ton of variety of courses, class size is small, professors know your name. Its a great experience."
College Sophomore,4,They take sports seriously and are always working to improve them.
College Sophomore,4,My professors are all great. It was easy to get a job on campus that is flexible with everything else going on in my life. OPSU is great.
College Senior,4,"The school accepts and treats  all students the same, I have not noticed any type of discrimination."
College Senior,4,"I love OPSU, I have not experienced any problems with registration or getting into a class."
College Senior,4,the professors are very knowledgeable.
College Senior,4,"I have enjoyed all the classes, the instructors are always willing to help with any problems/questions."
College Freshman,4,It is pretty strict. You cannot come into the dorms without checking you visitor in. Nobody really gets parking tickets but that is because we respect the rules on campus and park how we are supposed to. The teachers are very supportive and if you are not in class without a reason they will approach you about it.
College Freshman,4,My financial aid process was a lot more complicated than most because I had such a financial wreck going on. The financial ladies helped me through it and worked out all of my complications so that I could get the best financial help that I possibly could have.
College Freshman,4,It has a very friendly atmoshpere. The facilities are very clean and it is really easy to get into housing. The only thing I dislike is that we get fined for every little thing. If over the weekend the bathrooms accumulate too much trash we will all get fined $25 so that is a big downfall. Overall I love it.
College Sophomore,4,I find the small places here always interesting to eat at. Its a bit repetitive but it serves its purpose
College Sophomore,4,I love my apartment !
Recent Alumnus,4,people are very friendly and excepting to all people no matter who they are or what they believe in.
Recent Alumnus,4,computers were very convenient and printing was reasonable.
Recent Alumnus,4,I learned a lot form the classes I took and I n=know it will prepare me for my career as a marriage and family therapist.
Recent Alumnus,4,I learned a lot from being here. it is a small campus but I got close to a lot of people and made good friends. the small campus helped me stay focused on my academics.
Recent Alumnus,4,"visitation rights are strict, what time things close are strict. it might affect some people because they feel they don't have freedom but I know they are looking out for our well being."
Recent Alumnus,4,it does not cost which is the best thing.
Recent Alumnus,4,living on campus is nice because you learn from people and experience being on your own. sharing showers is not always great.
Recent Alumnus,4,professors are great they want you to be successful and look out for your well being. you can get help when you need it. registering is a hassle not always fun.
Recent Alumnus,4,it feels great to finally be able to study exactly what I want to do in my life. the work will be hard but I  know I will get through it because it is for my career.
College Sophomore,4,Pre Vet and I enjoy it and the teachers here really help me out
College Sophomore,4,There are many clubs to join on campus and there sports never over showdown them they are all pretty equal and people attend all activities on campus pretty equal
College Sophomore,4,"Printing for school related things is free as long as it is not in color and there are laptops you can check out and there is many computers in the library, in carter hall, the dorm lobby, and even the rec. place has a computer lab. There are plenty of places to find a computer."
College Sophomore,4,The people here are all friendly and are always helping each other out. It is a small town at its best. The college and the town try to put on a lot of activities and then you also have Guymon Oklahoma only ten miles away and there is always some type of activity going on there. The people and the teachers here are all caring. The teachers really want you to succeed and they really try to be part of your life here.
College Sophomore,4,I didn't really have a problem with my financial aid. I just did my part and they did theirs.
College Freshman,4,Classes are small so teachers and advisors are very hands on with each student. If you put in an effort they will help with just about anything.
College Junior,4,The agronomy program at OPSU started out very small and limiting but since I have attended school there it has grown and there are many learning tools available to students. The instructors are very concerned with the well being of their students as well as how they are preforming in their classes.  I have had a positive learning experience from attending college here.
College Freshman,4,This is a university that has great focus on agriculture and that is the field that I am studing
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are people here from every background, culture, ethnicity, religion, etc. From across the U.S. east to west coast and international students a few I know from Brazil and Argentina. Along with this there are African Americans, Hispanics, caucasions, oriental. There are more males than females though as a good portion are here on sport scholarships mainly football and rodeo. And religion is amazingly diverse including Catholic, Methodist, Baptist, Pentecostal, etc. And I am sure there is Muslims, Jews, and other beliefs here too."
Recent Alumnus,4,Great Help – The professors are in their offices at certain hours to help you. There are also tutors on campus available to help you. Some professors even give a number to get a hold of them by if there is too much trouble. The workload isn't bad at all.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Good for the Most Part – Personally, I received very little financial aid from OPSU. However, I know of several people did receive a good amount. If one is in sports financial aid is very easy to get. There are a few scholarships for college students of all grades available. You must have a high enough GPA, just as you do in most colleges. I suggest applying for several scholarships on the internet if you do not get enough from OPSU."
Sophomore,2,Taking an online class is not the best option for me.  I need a more interactive class. I have only had to take an online class because of corona and because I took a summer class while in quarantine.
Sophomore,2,I like that there isn't much so you can focus on school but I don't like that there  isn't a lot to do and it is very small and rustic. Too much for me.
Freshman,2,"Before coming here I lived in a big city where I had things to do if I got bored. Being out here I cant do anything but go to class, practice, and back to my room. I'm not big on partying but I never hear of party's out here so I have yet to actually live life like a college freshman. I would like to see the school change simply by getting stuff out here for students so they wont be bored."
College Freshman,2,There are literally no places to eat. If you want to eat you must drive 10 miles to Guymon to eat.
College Freshman,2,"When i first came here i thought that it was going to be pretty good until i found out that i was being taught be someone who hardly knows anything in this certain subject. i am supposed to be here for an education where i learn what is right, im not here to listen to a teacher who teaches us the wrong things and changes it the last minute to the right thing and wants us to remember what he said... nooo i wanted to transfer because i feel that this school is just taking my money and laughing in my face."
College Freshman,2,"yeahhhhhhh there is nothing like that here, the school wont even give you a job if you're not eligible for work study."
College Freshman,2,"I'm sure that at most colleges the strictness is pretty strong, but defiantly not here. There are always underage drinkers, people smoking weed and doing other illegal things. The RA's don't do their jobs. we are supposed to have quiet time from 11 to 11 but we never do. And they are never around to help someone if they are having trouble with someone on their floor. Alcohol can be seen all around campus, especially after the weekend. Multiple times there has been full beer cans in the parking lot and nothing has been said or enforced."
College Freshman,2,There is not much to do here and most buildings are in serious need of renovations. 
Recent Alumnus,2,Police are always on watch but health is a problem the doctors  in the area are not as expierienced
Recent Alumnus,2,There are few places to dine but they are really good
College Freshman,2,"Not much, this is an average school at a semi-affordable price"
College Freshman,2,Goodwell is a small town and within this small town is a small college. There is not much diversity in the activities that can be taken. although being in a small school professors notice you more and you get more done having nothing to do.
College Senior,2,The athletic at the school are good. They practice alot to become better.
Recent Alumnus,2,"It hardly ever rains, and its not very green. The temperature is  alright, but it gets pretty cold in January. It doesn't snow very much, and the wind is always blowing."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Everyone is social. For the girls, there are a few good looking guys. They are pretty cool. For the guys, there aren't very many girls. They are often times taken if they are good looking and have a great personality."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Housing Is Limited – There aren't many places to live off-campus. Unless a person was to live in Guymon, Oklhoma, ten miles away. If you want a trailer to stay in you best start looking for one way ahead of time. The landlords and people around town are nice. As for prices, I'd say they are close to average."
College Senior,2,Was told I make to much to get any type of assistance.
College Student,2,The Inside Scoop – Our school gets involved with many activities. The teacher's do care about the students. Many of the programs are worth getting into.
College Student,2,"The computer are good for anything you need to do on them. Just depending on where you are and what you are doing depends on the whole printing part, so places will charge you if it's not school related."
College Sophomore,2,Not Many Options – There aren't really any transportation options at this small college.  What helps me is being able to car pool with friends and classmates.
College Student,1,I just don't like anything to do with sports. They drive me crazy.
College Sophomore,1,There is no Greek life here its a very small university.
College Freshman,1,"Oh the food, where to even start. It is soo not cool to have spaghetti three days in a row... So we have the cafeteria and the grill (which isnt to bad). Im surprised that the cafeteria food hasn't killed anyone yet..."
College Freshman,1,"There are always underage drunk people in the dorms. People are always going to parties and take nothing serious. There is always alcohol on the grounds, unopened... The cops are always at the dorms whether it be checking on the drunk people or dealing with drugs or stolen property. Its awful around here."
Recent Alumnus,1,"No attractions, activities that are really interesting, there are cultural events but not what i am used to, it is safe for the most part since no one resides there, there are no shopping places with in the radius, and there are no real sports recreational centers other than on the campus and the attitude is the only wonderful thing its very positive, Oklahoma is not very exciting D-"
College Freshman,1,"There is Nothing unique about this school. I have been at this school for half a year and i still feel like i am in high school, but with less hours in class."
College Freshman,1,"There is only one campus cop, but he does his job and is always roaming the streets. Since Goodwell is such a small town there is rarely any underage drinking around campus. Most students are discreet and go to the town that is 10 miles away. One cop cant stop everyone although everything is peaceful around here."
Recent Alumnus,1,Sports Are Terrible Here – It isn't too hard to make the team. Sports aren't a very big deal here. The only big thing is rodeo.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Many Options – Oklahoma Panhandle State University is located in Goodwell, Oklahoma, which is a very small town. You can't get a bus in Goodwell. If you can get a ride from a friend to Guymon, ten miles away, you can get a bus there. It can take you long distances."
College Senior,1,"Weather if very bipolar.. harsh winters, bad thunderstorms.. really cold"

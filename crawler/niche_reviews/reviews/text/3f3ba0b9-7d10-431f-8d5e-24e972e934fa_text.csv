Senior,5,I love how caring the professors and advisors is. They are doing everything in their power to make sure students are using all resources provided to graduate. Switching to online was pretty hard got a lot of students including myself
Senior,5,Online this semester was a little bit different due to covid-19. I just needed to make some adjustments considering that I’ve always took on campus classes. But I’m getting the hang of it
Freshman,5,Wayne State is a very affordable college. They are also very small campus and everyone there is very friendly. They offer a wide variety of things for students to do on campus. As a student they provide free tutors and a writing help desk. All the teachers have their office hours posted too! I would highly recommend you check out Wayne State!
Freshman,5,I haven't had the opportunity to even experience any online classes yet. I look forward to taking some of them after I graduate when I work towards my masters degree.
Junior,5,I absolutely love the environment of the beautiful small campus! I found professors very willing to help do whatever they can to help you succeed not only at Wayne State but in your life as a whole. There are tons of resources on campus to help you achieve your degree as well as taking care of yourself mentally and physically.
Sophomore,5,Wayne has a beautiful campus and helpful faculty members. The on-campus organizations are wonderful.
Sophomore,5,"Wayne State College feels very home-like. Everyone at the college, and even in the entire town, is very welcoming and open. I like the size of it personally, its not too small but it's not huge. It only takes like 5 minutes to get from one side of the campus to the other, which I think is awesome. I also chose to go to Wayne State to play softball for their school. The coaches are very friendly and seem to care about their plays and team very much. I would recommend this college to anyone and I don't regret going there one bit."
Niche User,5,I went on a college visit to Wayne and my guide was amazing.  He showed me everything I needed to know about Wayne.  The new press box where we began our tour is gorgeous and the girls in there that talked about Wayne had nothing but good things to say about Wayne and she wasn't lying.  The dorms are nice. They are a decent size except the one without AC... only disadvantage of living in that dorm because the rest of campus is beautiful except that hall.  The library is a a great place and looks newly renovated.  The campus food wasn't to bad.  Everyday there is a new food so it isn't that same food everyday.  The student place where students hang out is nice.  I like the fact that at Wayne their is a good diversity of people.  Wayne has lovely sports stuff and their sports are pretty decent.
Freshman,5,"Very helpful hands on hands help with qork.. Food is great! high graduating numbers! Close to home. Offer every opportunity that fits my needs! try to accommodate, with financial needs."
Niche User,5,I love this college! I love the campus and the friendly faces. I can't wait to start my college life here.
Niche User,5,"Awesome friendly college...has alot of classes to choose from...great teachers and small hometown college...great dorms,great clubs to belong to,sports team are good...nice cafeteria...always adding new majors and minors...great state college"
Junior,5,"I love that it’s a small enough campus to know most students, but big enough where you can meet new people all the time as well. They offer a wide variety of classes and are very student-oriented."
Freshman,5,"I'm a Brazilian majoring in Graphic Design. This is my first year here and it's been pretty good so far. The staff is so friendly and helpful. I made a lot of friends and the community is nice. It's a small town, but they have a lot of fun activities on campus. Great experience!"
Alum,5,I loved the small town atmosphere. The professors were all really nice and very helpful! My only wish is that the dorms were updated but other than that it was a great school!
Freshman,5,"Professors are amazing, particularly in the business department. They are talented professionals and willing to help outside of the classroom."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a Sophomore at Wayne State College. The campus is very small and sociable, you can get anywhere on campus in 5-7 minutes and catch a lot of smiles and hellos on the way. Class sizes are very small and professors take the time to know you on a first name basis which personally, I feel creates a better learning environment. I lived on campus my first year and I will be my second year as well, living on campus you are in the know about everything and you become very close with other students quickly. The campus staff is very good at letting you know what is going on with sports and activities, our tech team can fix almost any tech problem- I had to contact them a couple times for laptop troubles, was always ready to help and even came to help me in the dorms when I was trying to do finals homework. All around Wayne State College is an incredible choice if you want a middle sized school with an at home feel."
Junior,5,I have attended here two semesters after transferring and I love it. My professors are more than helpful and really know how to help us learn. I would definitely tell someone to go here to be a Physical Education teacher!
Freshman,5,I love Wayne State College! The atmosphere is great and very welcoming. The teachers are here to help you they are wonderful and help out us students in so many ways!
Freshman,5,This Campus is just so safe. I love this campus! Can't wait for the Fall. The staff works well with the students and the students themselves are always so helpful. Great education at a low price. Love It!
Sophomore,5,"Wayne State is the perfect college for students who want a four year education at a college with a relatively small amount of students. Class sizes are 30 students at max, and the professors know who you are.  Everybody is friendly and willing to help you when needed!"
Freshman,5,Wayne State College is a great place to continue your education. The professors are very open about giving extra help and create a great learning environment for the students. Lots of activities are offered to the students so their time here doesn't just evolve around education but making relationships. Wayne State College has open resources around campus to ensure your success in and out of college. This has been home away from home for me and many other students and I couldn't have picked a better place to continue my education. It's always a great day to be a wildcat
Niche User,5,I have not went to Wayne yet but I wish to be an upcoming freshmen Wildcat.! I am looking forward to my future and I think Wayne could be a great fit for me.
Alum,5,"Wayne State College  was an enjoyable experience for me.  I was expecting a small-town atmosphere and that's what I received.  I came from a nearby town so it helped to be familiar with the area.  The campus is very up-to-date and actually are constantly renovating.  I always felt safe and at ease when on campus.  I could get anywhere I wanted to be in 5 minutes or less.  What I didn't like is the size of my dorm.  It was kind of cramped.  Overall, I had a great experience and got a well-rounded education while I was there."
Junior,5,I really like the music program and the math program at Wayne State. I couldn't have found a better college than Wayne.
Sophomore,5,Wayne State College has been a wonderful experience! The atmosphere is great and is the perfect size for a college! The professors take their time to get to know you as an individual and not just a number. The campus is safe. Everyone in the town and the staff at the campus is welcoming and friendly!
Freshman,5,I really like Wayne. The campus is really nice. There is a lot to do on and off the campus. There are also lots of opportunity to get a job.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Wayne State College has been very well so far! I love the small size of campus, I can get where I need to be in less than five minutes! The class sizes are also perfect for someone coming from a small town & being used to getting one-on-one attention when necessary!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the small classes and the professors are very helpful. Campus is easy to get around, everyone is friendly, its affordable. "
College Freshman,5,My current situation is absolutely fantastic. A wife variety of help and resources available to me and my peers.
College Sophomore,5,"I walk around at night and I feel safe, I see security around often"
College Sophomore,5,The teachers are always happy to help you when you need them.
College Freshman,5,I love Wayne State. Best decision I ever made.
College Student,5,My college has the second biggest college marching band in the state of Nebraska. The music department is very close to being the biggest music department in the state. My college is considered a teachers college. It has all of the classes that you need to take to become a teacher.
College Freshman,5,"Wayne is a very safe and secure campus. I feel perfectly safe to walk to the library at midnight, which is across campus, if I needed to. Sexual assault is very rare and silm to none here at Wayne State College. I've never heard of fights, confrontation, sexual assault, or any other kind of danger. I think the small town gives into this safer feeling most people have on campus and in Wayne Nebraska."
College Junior,5,This is a top rated school with a lot to offer every student. The pre-req classes allow for students to explore while the program classes are tailored to the specific career or degree.
College Freshman,5,"Wayne is a small nit community full of fun and good times. I have yet to have a dull moment outside the classroom at Wayne. As a female soccer player for WSC I meet a lot of students who chose Wayne for the simple, yet college atmosphere Wayne has to offer. There are always things going on, and people to meet."
College Freshman,5,"I have lived in this area my whole life, the restaurants are amazing."
College Freshman,5,I have had no problems with them.
College Freshman,5,The upper cafeteria was one of the deciding factors in my choice to come here. The lower cafeteria is a little expensive. The food in both is amazing. And the people who work there are wonderful.
College Freshman,5,"Its a great school, and love the kids that go here and make new friends every day."
College Junior,5,"I am in Graphic Design, and I had no trouble at all getting into the art program. My application for college was average. It is a state college, so their wasn't much competition or difficulty getting in."
College Freshman,5,The local atmosphere is very involving.
College Freshman,5,Criminal Justice is an excellent field for me.
College Freshman,5,Campus is overall a welcoming place.
College Freshman,5,People on campus are very approachable.
College Freshman,5,Campus students have diverse backgrounds.
College Freshman,5,Campus treats all of its issues with fairness.
College Freshman,5,The facilities on campus fulfill all student needs.
College Freshman,5,Computer software on campus is both easily accessible and high-functioning.
College Freshman,5,Off-campus housing is in excellent condition.
College Freshman,5,There are plenty of transit options on campus.
College Freshman,5,There is no drug problem on Wayne State's campus.
College Freshman,5,"I love the small campus, you can be very active."
Recent Alumnus,5,"The classes are convenient, low stress, and pretty easy if you work hard. The projects can sneak up on you if you let it. If you are well organized, you can work 50 hours + per week and still maintain more than a 3.0. I think I have a 3.65."
College Freshman,5,The main reason I chose Wayne state was because they were one of the 3 colleges that had a major in economics.  We are mainly a teaching and business school.  We have a fee pre-pharmacy or pre-vet majors but the main two majors are teaching and business.  I would defiantly recommend coming here and going to the business school.  The teachers are very helpful.  The class size is not big at all which is good for teacher student interaction.  The teachers will know you by name after a week of being in their classes.
College Freshman,5,"I have not had an internship yet, but I know that Wayne's professors and advisers will help you choose the right one to fit your goals in the job world.  There is also many options to choose from."
College Freshman,5,"Have had no problems so far with the internet, or having labs available."
College Freshman,5,"Especially with the experience of being on a sports team, it's been amazing"
College Junior,5,The Education department has great success and prepares one very well.
College Sophomore,5,"Great that we have them around they are helpful
"
Junior,4,I only had some online because of COVID. It was an okay experience and teachers worked with the situation well.
Junior,4,It’s a great college if your primary focus is academics or getting your degree finished. The town is small so there isn’t a whole lot to do off campus. It’s also a suitcase town. Everyone goes home almost every weekend.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy the small campus life. It’s easy to meet new people and make new friends. The professors are all nice and easy to get along with. The facilities are also great and serve as a great place to socialize with others. I’m happy to have picked Wayne State College as my home away from home.
Sophomore,4,Waynr State college is a great college for financially and academically. Making new friends is a big important on everyone's life. The entertainment for the college is great especially for the music department is awesome
Freshman,4,So far my experience has been pretty good. The people are very nice and sociable. My dorm experience so far has been pretty good and I'm excited for  the upcoming semesters at Wayne.
Freshman,4,I love be professors and environment. My only issue is the administration. Speaking with the financial aid office is like talking to an automatic robot and it’s difficult to discuss issues with the admin.
Sophomore,4,"It's not a bad college, it's big enough to the point that there is always something to do but still small enough to the point you don't get overwhelmed. The students and community are friendly and the professors are willing to work with you. It's about your average small-town college."
Graduate Student,4,"Wayne State College is a wonderful place to learn. The have many class offerings for students. The school has a lot of pride and is always looking to make things better. The professors are always available to help students with their assignments, and encourage them to try their best at all things."
Senior,4,Wayne State College is a great place to attend if you're looking for a home. Wayne state makes you feel like you are right at home while finding what you love to do and study.
Freshman,4,"Great college, overall. Friendly atmosphere, diversity is encouraged. The professors don't just teach you how to memorize - they teach you how to actually learn the material. The food is very average. There are many resources for students, such as free counseling, free visits with a PA and nurse, a free taxi service on the weekends for students, and more! Wayne is a small town, however, there is a good amount of events both on and off campus. Great quality education for a lower price than many other schools in Nebraska. I am proud to be a Wildcat student!"
Senior,4,"I like the atmosphere. Most teachers provide a very welcoming classroom and are very inclusive.  The students are very friendly and helpful, making friends here is easy for most. There are tons of clubs and programs you can join to meet more people with similar interests."
Freshman,4,"This is the place where paying college is relaxable. For example, In my first week of college, I was worried about paying off my tuition bill. I asked a member of the Wayne State College, who she directly contacted the Financial aid director to help me choose the plan that I wanted and set the date back to which it did happen. However, I wished they gave me the tuition bill in person than the internet because I thought I was going to pay more than five thousand dollars instead of three thousand dollars with my loan plan."
Sophomore,4,I honestly really like Wayne State. The city itself is small enough for that “small town feel” but also big enough to where you don’t feel like you’re on top of everybody. The campus isn’t extremely large but they’ve recently added 2 new buildings and the library renovation is amazing. I hope they renovate the dorm rooms that don’t have air conditioning so they do have air conditioning. My experience with the faculty is the teachers are very hands on and know what they’re talking about. I have no doubt in my mind that what I’m being taught now I will be using in my future career.
Junior,4,"Wayne State is where I managed to find my niche. The teachers and students provide a good environment to learn and to grow. I feel that Wayne State has given me the opportunity to meet people that have expanded my understanding of the world, and given me more to think about for the future."
Sophomore,4,"It was welcoming on the first day of college. They have other, more senior, students take us around and show us our dorms and classrooms. They also will help you with any questions you have on homework or dorm info."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Wayne State, soon to be sophomore. Overall, I have had an excellent experience at Wayne State. Although, some classes could be improved or replaced with better professors. Campus life could also be improved and the food is only average. There have been many changes and improvements through the course of the school year however. I am excited to return next fall and continue my studies."
Sophomore,4,Wayne State is a very great college! It made me such a better person by helping me explore other options while helping me find a major that is suitable for me and my interests. The professors are helpful if you need assistance and are always looking to help the students out.
Freshman,4,"If you are looking for a beautiful campus, friendly people, and great academics I would highly recommend Wayne State College.  Wayne is a small community full of helpful and happy people who are always willing to help. It is a great and safe environment."
Sophomore,4,Its a small campus so you feel included in everything. Also during the winter its not that far of a walk so you don't freeze. There are lots of trees and other plants which adds to the overall presence. The only thing they need to improve is parking. They need more parking for everyone.
Freshman,4,"People are friendly. Professors are nice as well, and overall it's a small college with a homey feel."
Freshman,4,The staff is very nice and always ready to help.  Everyone is so friendly.   WSC has more majors to choose from as well as minors than other colleges I have researched.
Senior,4,"Wayne State College is a small town, but gives you a big education experience. There are many activities that keep engaged in learning and social experiences."
Senior,4,Wayne State College is a great 4- year college. It has students involved in activities and always looking for was to help students succeed.
Junior,4,I would like to see better dorm life. What I like it the fact that the professors work with you and will help you even outside of the education environment
Junior,4,"I like the smaller class styles which leads into the teachers actually having the opportunity and time to get to know and are about their students. The efficiency they have when dealing with problems is great, and they continue to try to help you find someone who can help you rather than just saying 'sorry, bye'."
Junior,4,"My experience so far at Wayne State College is good. I like the class sizes especially for the upper level classes.Professors remember your name and it's easier to approach them  and campus  is never crowded. I picked Wayne State College because of it's tuition price and the fact that it's not too far from my home town.Although my college has good attributes it could fix certain areas. Wayne State College could fix their parking issues. It's a daily struggle to find parking. Besides parking funding for the college is decreasing yearly and they are not able to provide us the same service as a university such as hosting public speakers and learning events.  Wayne State College is not as diverse as it could be, it would be nice to interact with more diverse people with different views then me."
Freshman,4,"Wayne is a wonderful place to experience your first few years of college for a small country girl like me. I love the campus, the people, the food, and even the community. It is not too overwhelming or too small. The one thing I would change is just that there be better places to hang out with friends. Other than that though I would not change a thing."
Junior,4,"I'm a non-traditional transfer student, and I think Wayne State is an okay college.  It would be perfect for any student straight out of high school.  It offers alot of variety for the college experience.  It is however limiting for my own personal experience since I have children.  All of the clubs meet after school hours (3-5 pm) so that makes it difficult to be apart of anything.  Also, I had quite a few years in two other schools that had excellent accommodations for my learning disabilities.  This school has one person running the test, which would be exhausting, and I had to be re-evaluated for one disability that I have worked with other schools for over 4 years on, and the school psychiatrist didn't see it as very prominent.  So i'm more than upset that something that I've already had previously diagnosed, and worked with other professionals to overcome in my academic experience for more than a few years is being set aside."
Junior,4,"I like the small town and community feel, you know all of your professors and they know and care about you and your success. I also like how affordable it is, even for out of state students. I dislike the limited food choices and limited library hours, for I would like to be able to study Friday nights or Saturday nights."
Junior,4,I love Wayne State College. You get real professor student relationships. The campus size is just right. Everywhere I go I see a friendly face. 
College Junior,4,"Overall, I feel pretty safe, but I still won't walk around campus alone at night."
College Junior,4,"For the most part, on-campus housing is pretty decent. I would recommend providing air conditioning in all dorms though."
College Junior,4,I have attended a few sporting events but intramural events are more exciting.
College Junior,4,Wayne State College has been a great decision for furthering my education. The faculty are all very helpful and knowledgeable about each subject.  I have learned a great deal and have met amazing people along the way.
College Freshman,4,Great coaching staff for the football side.
College Freshman,4,It gave me hope for my future.
College Freshman,4,I'm not big into athletics but it is definitely a big part of campus life.
College Junior,4,Academics are solid and you get what you put into it.
College Junior,4,"School does its best, but students know how to avoid being caught."
College Junior,4,Most classes are fair and helpful.  Classes for the most part are small and teachers learn active students names.  Professors  know their stuff and are nice.
College Junior,4,Housing is solid and any minor problems are usually based off of individual student troublemakers.
College Junior,4,"Great bang for your buck college.  Nothing too fancy, a straight up state college."
College Freshman,4,"I love the small campus, it makes for easy walking between classes and I get to see my friends all over. It is easy to get to know people because I see them all the time."
College Freshman,4,Very friendly and I enjoy the classes for my chosen major.
College Sophomore,4,I've always felt safe walking across campus even at night by myself. You can always find campus security workers around.
College Sophomore,4,I came from a small high school so I really like the small class sizes here and the professors are always willing to help when it's needed.
College Sophomore,4,"I only applied to two colleges and was accepted into both, but I chose Wayne State because it seemed more homey here, and so far I have not been disappointed. The community and school is very welcoming and it has made me want to stay."
College Sophomore,4,There are many opporunities for students.
College Sophomore,4,"My frehsman year was rouhgh, we did not have a social often. Sophomore year is going better and meeting new people that live in the same building"
College Sophomore,4,I would do it for the WSEAN program.
College Freshman,4,The career center is great.
College Student,4,There is a lot of school spirit.
College Student,4,It has an awesome music program.
College Freshman,4,I have had great experience with professors and course.  Again I am not in favor of how many Gen-eds are required for everyone. I would rather focus on my area of study.
College Student,4,I am not apart of Greek Life on campus. There isn't any Greek housing available.
College Student,4,"Some of the departments are lacking, but there are quite a few that are very good."
College Freshman,4,"I'm currently a pledge for the Wayne State local sorority of ZTO. So far, I love everything about it, the people and the experiences. The girls are very kind and humble when it comes to Greek life. Wayne state has two sororities and one fraternity, since we are a smaller school. Sorority isn't a popularity game, it's something fun and also great for the community, to do. Soroities at Wayne, aren't mean or hurtful like many stereotypes think. Our girls are sweet and compassionate towards everyone and put their whole heart into the philantropies."
College Freshman,4,"It has a personal vibe to the whole campus. I wouldn't trade my small college for any of my friends large universities. My school is in a small town, so us college kids get very creative when it comes to activities. My school provides me with a lot of free and fun activities thoughout the year and as a student body we come up with traditions and fun things to keep us busy, like bowling nights, library coffee tables to help kids study and keep awake, rallies and dances, we even had a haunted house this year. My school also comes with a lot of free benefits. I got a free flu shot from student health and whenever my computer crashes, student tech comes quickly to help. I love my school and all of the great people I've met so far!"
College Freshman,4,"Living in the residential dorms provides you with the convenience of being 5 minutes away from your classes, converting the travel time you would be using up as a commuter to time that could be spent studying. Not to mention you're living in the heart of Detroit, placing you within walking distance of the D.I.A or the Detroit Historical Museum!"
College Freshman,4,The school's curriculum is well respected and I do not have any problems with it. Our professor know the thing they are teaching and show time to really get to know the students. The registration process was fairly easy and not too much of a hassle. It was a bit timely but it fulfilled all the requirements. Our study abroad programs are not that serious and only have two options to travel to. There are many places where students can go to study around campus. The library is a great place but we also have other places that students can go. All buildings are open late so we can go and work in the respected classrooms to work on homework.
Alum,2,"Scheduling disaster, faculty that could not agree, and subpar programs.  They did not take many of my credits I tried to bring in from University of Nebraska- Lincoln which ended up adding 2 years onto my studies."
Alum,2,"Undergraduate Experience: Some professors do a great job. Others seem interested in retiring. The Career Services Office is excellent. Huge variety of intramurals. Made life long friends here. The administration seemed hard on student centered faculty. Many of my favorite professors moved on and were replaced by adjuncts. Cheering on the rugby team and working on projects with my classmates in the library were my favorite things. Also, class trip helped me network and get summer job. Graduate Program: Unorganized. My advisor was MIA. Online class used a primitive program with almost no interactivity. Part time professors were holding program together. I switched schools despite the costs. No one seemed to care. My credits transferred."
College Senior,2,"The sports teams are ok, there is a lot of fan support."
College Junior,2,The school reflects Nebraska's diversity.  Very white but less than the local area average.
College Junior,2,Only two girl greek organizations.  The only male greek organization was temporarily shut down and is not impressive.
College Freshman,2,"The football team always stinks. The only sports we excel at are rugby, volleyball and track. School spirit is pitiful for football except on homecoming."
College Sophomore,2,The Greek Life is a lot different here than it is at bigger schools. It is a lot more laid back and the Greeks kind of tend to stick together.
College Freshman,2,Small enough school that Greek doesn't matter.
College Freshman,2,There is minimal school spirit and athletic support.
College Sophomore,2,Everyone goes out every night!! I swear I would be sitting in my room laying in bed and every night I would hear the same group of people live at 10:30pm EVERY night!!
College Sophomore,2,"There are a plethora of reasons I have had an overall poor experience here at Wayne State. Many of them personal, many of them from the school itself. There's just no fitting in if you're an out of state student like I am. Everyone goes home on weekends, so if you're out of state and don't have a car, you're basically living in a ghost town for a weekend. My major is good but we need an upgrade in technology, something we've been pushing for for a while not but have so far been unsuccessful in our efforts. Overall I just felt like an outcasted nobody here. This place does not welcome foreigners and it certainly does not welcome liberals. Don't make the same mistake I made... Do not attend Wayne State College"
College Sophomore,2,"Going out at night is something I would not recommend. There's a lot of drunk people, not very well lit, it gets pretty cold at night, campus security is pretty strict but they are helpful. Student health can recommend you to a doctor at the local hospital, but from what I've heard some of the doctors at the hospital are not the greatest. As far as sexual assault goes, people have been sexually assaulted on and off campus, but in Wayne we have what's called the Haven House, which helps with domestic abuse or sexual assault, and they are a fantastic service in Wayne."
College Sophomore,2,"The Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity has been suspended because of underage drinking at a party that lead to possible alcohol poisoning, and everything else is more of an honor society than an actual frat or sorority. The TKE's used to have a house, but that got taken away after their suspension."
College Sophomore,2,"I go and visit my friends who live off-campus and they've done a fairly good job of maintaining and keeping their house nice. Landlords are always going to vary. The apartments, if you can find them at all, are sketchy. Things happen late at night in Wayne America that would deter most from living off-campus. I'm not familiar with the process but I can all but guarantee Wayne State doesn't like you moving off-campus. Parking is a little ridiculous because the driveways can extend to the sidewalks, and god help you if your car extends even an inch over cause you will get a ticket. Unless your car is blocking the whole sidewalk entirely then for some reason no ticket. Pose minor inconvenience=ticket, block sidewalk entirely=meh that's fine. Ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,"Where oh where do I even begin... Let's just start with the fact that as I am looking to transfer, Wayne has been nothing but unhelpful in sending my transcripts to my applied transfer school. It's like they know I'm transferring, and thus holding me hostage. If you walk into the administrative building and say the word ""retention,"" or ""retention rate,"" you may as well have yelled ""fire"" in a crowded theatre. They know that students typically don't stay all for years, or use it as a stepping stone for some other big name school like UNL. As far as strictness goes they are either really strict or completely oblivious. If they catch you, you're a dead man, but that's assuming they catch you at all. And sometimes the punishment does not suit the crime, or the rule makes a crime out of something trivial. We have to go to the residence life office before we can hang up flyers, because they have to be ""approved."" CENSORSHIP! But I digress. You also have to go through ""chartwells"" the catering company, if you want any food item sold/given away at any club event. Let's say you're in the club of students who do things, and you want to raise funds for a conference by selling popcorn. You have to go through chartwells, and go through the student activities office and fill out a pile of paperwork just so you can sell $0.50 bags of popcorn. It is absolutely ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't go to parties but I have plenty of friends that tell me the one's that are around are bad. We had an incident at the Tau Kappa Epsilon house where some girls were at a party, underage drinking and had possible alcohol poisoning, and it forced the TKE's to be removed from campus. Also there's pretty much nothing open past 8:00pm and if there's any wind of any party of any sorts Campus Security and the Wayne PD are on it like white on rice. Having said that, there really is only one thing to do on a weekend, and that's get drunk, which I would not recommend as an activity, especially for the faint of heart and liver."
College Sophomore,2,"There is one dorm on campus that is of any strong value to it, called Pile Hall, with a close second being Neihardt. Other than that Bowen is filled with annoying freshmen who don't go to bed until 3:00am and they usually all pretty smashed. Morey is sketchy to the point where you wonder if someone has ever considered filming a horror film there. Berry ain't much better, in fact some have long debated which dorms are worse, Morey or Berry, so far we have not found a clear winner. The dorm I currently live in is Terrace which has it's ups and downs. The showers are very private and work very well, but there is no air conditioning. As for the atmosphere in general it seems like the students who stay in their dorms the whole time make up a fair majority of campus."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much.  A couple of chain places and a couple local spots. Not much is open very late.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Wayne is nice if you're into small town life, I'm more of a big city person so I find it to be quite boring. I think there's a ton of parties because there's not much else to do. Wayne is about 45 minutes to Norfolk and about 45 minutes-an hour away from Sioux City, both of these cities offer a little more options for shopping and restaurants. I would say that Lincoln is the closest for great sports and events. The local attitude toward students is great in my opinion. Many businesses offer student discounts, and some even hire students and offer flexible schedules."
Recent Alumnus,2,There's not many options for Greek chapters. I don't really see the impact of the Greek students and I don't really know of Greek housing.
College Junior,2,It seems like no one knows how to help you or they give you wrong advice. It tends to do more harm then help.
College Freshman,2,There's not a big influence.
College Freshman,2,no where to really get away and study
College Freshman,2,"there isnt much and what there is, is nasty."
College Junior,2,Parking spaces is very limited because everybody drives to school.
College Sophomore,2,"I transfered to Wayne State from the University of Nebraska at Omaha, so when I went to register for classes I was upset that there were so few choices. I was used to taking fun electives that I was interested in (such as Black Studies Class and Gerontology), but at Wayne those classes are out of the picture."
College Freshman,2,"The weather here in Wayne is very unpredictable. One moment it will be nice and pleasant out and the next it's unbearable. For example it is spring, April 18 and right now there is a blizzard happening."
College Freshman,2,"The professors are pretty knowledgeable in their departments. They are also accessible during certain times, but sometime you have to set up a time to meet with them. I would have to say that Education is the focus major at Wayne State College."
College Freshman,2,Being a psychology major is pretty difficult at Wayne State College. The only reason I say this is because there are no classes that pertain to a specific concentration in the major. There are only basic Psychology classes that every Psychology majors are required to take even though everyone may not want to do the same thing with their degree.
College Sophomore,2,There is plenty of parking on campus but it is not convenient.  A student must make sure to leave home at least 30 minutes before class in order to get a parking spot and make it to class on time.  It would be nice to have a commuter only parking lot.
College Freshman,2,"I received some financial aid, but it wasn't as much as I thought. Also, I tried looking for other scholarships on campus but it was too late to apply because I decided at the last minute to come here so I couldn't apply to any scholarships. In the beginning I didn't get my financial aid so I had to figure out a way to pay the school or else I was going to get kicked out, which was very stressful."
College Freshman,2,There isn't a variety of ethnic diversity at all but the diversity is in the personalities of people.
College Junior,2,"The college did some renovating as far as the cafeteria is concerned. Also, a lot of the options that were available for food last year are gone now, I'm assuming because of the government regulations, which I am not fond of. I would not suggest getting a big meal plan if you plan on going home every weekend. Also, you can only use your specified number of meals during that week, there is no carry over of meals into the next week. This causes people to lose a lot of money."
College Junior,2,The parking is ok but it could get better because there isn't enough space for students to park next to or even close by their dorms.
College Senior,2,"Small School, Limited Selection – Wayne State has a relatively small student body, but at least half of them are very attractive although not always smart enough to bother with. There are all sorts of guys, from farm boys to artsy types. Girls also vary."
College Junior,2,Small Town – Wayne is located in the middle of farm country and is a rather small town. There are alot of activities on campus and a few in the town. There are very few shopping options usually people drive to Norfolk or Sioux City to get what they need. There are a few more places to hang out opening soon so there will be more activities going on off campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Facilities are placed well but parking is a bear, nothing for students is close - quite a hike to get to where ever you are going.  And if going for a meeting, there still is not available parking."
College Sophomore,2,Off Campus Living – If you want to live off campus start looking early because apartments fill up quickly.  The closer you want to be to campus the more your probably going to have to pay in rent.  Most apartment buildings here do have a parking lot so no worries there. There just are not a lot of apartment buildings here.
College Freshman,2,"My first year as a psychology major I felt like I was doing it all on my own.  I made my schedule and found out my guidelines for my major all on my own.  I never heard anything about a psychology club, but knew there was one.  There were no posters informing students of meeting times or places.  I took General Psychology and Intro to Sociology and the workload was easy.  I hope that as I progress into my major, there will be more services offered to me."
College Freshman,2,"It's Just Like High School. Here at WSC, it's just like high school to me. We have our cliques and everything in between. The guys are more friendly than the girls most of the time. Though just talking to someone is fun because everyone comes from different backgrounds."
College Freshman,1,Greek life is tremendously overrated except for the friendships built.
College Freshman,1,Sometimes i forget we have them.
College Sophomore,1,"I came to Wayne knowing that the cafeteria food was not going to be gourmet or anything of that sort. Having said that, I did not expect it to be a giant steaming pile of [expletive]. Here's the problem, the food is always the same, it's almost always frozen pre-made stuff, and every so often you'll see a potential health code violation. Case in point, I saw mold on a bagel, my friend noticed the burger he was eating had pink in the middle knowing it had been sitting at a warmer (he works in fast food so he knows that could lead to salmonella), and overall it just tastes bad. Now you would think that the serving of pre-made/frozen meals would be in order to save costs right? Yeah that's not working out real well for them. Rumor has it the company that caters the food, ""Chartwells"" is over $6000 in the hole. Why you ask? Cause they throw basically everything but the kitchen sink away, and order the same 5 things from their supplier. Oh and if you think that isn't enough, wait till you get a load of this. ""Chartwells"" is owned by a parent conglomerate in the UK called ""Compass Group"" whom had been investigated by... wait for it... wait for it... the United Nations for bribery. That's right folks, the parent company who owns my school's cafeteria caterer, was at one point investigated for shady spending practices by the United [bleeping] Nations. Yeah the food sucks."
College Freshman,1,I feel like i haven't learned anything
College Sophomore,1,I transfered second semester and my financial aid was promised to me a week or two after I started classes. I waited almost three months before I recieved it. I had to call over and over again. I suggest staying on top of calling about financial aid and meeting with your financial advisor multipe times to make sure all goes well
College Freshman,1,Greek life at Wayne State College does not affect the social atmosphere of the campus at all. There are two sororities and one fraternity and you rarely hear anything about them. The only time you may see them is on Mondays when they're al dressed up for their meetings.
College Sophomore,1,"I was not aware the Wayne State College offered a Greek Program until I started talking to other students.  The college does not promote it in anyway and even after being aware that there is a Greek Program, I have not seen anything posted or any events held by them."
College Junior,1,"Unless you're a teacher, good luck. Lot 10 seems forever away from the dorms which are the closest. Parking there for class is absolutely unheard of due to the distance. I am friends with people who are excellent students but yet they are unable to attend class because they live on the other side of town and cannot find a spot to park."
College Junior,1,"The only ""frat"" in the town is the TKE house. It's just a bunch of guys trying to be ""cool frat guys"". It's the biggest joke in town."
College Student,1,"Spreading Like an Epidemic – There are drugs and alcohol everywhere on campus.  I know that the local police and campus security are trying to crack down, but most of what they are doing is off campus.  The real problem is in the dorms.  I can go to almost any dorm any day of the week and know someone who will be drinking or who has alcohol and where in their dorms.  I also can log on my twitter account and see a few people who are doing drugs.  They are open about it in social media, but the local enforcement is not doing too much about it."
College Student,1,"Fat and Drunk – The food at Wayne State college has healthy options on campus, but off campus is no man's land for the healthy eater.  Options include McDonald's, Dairy Queen, Runza, and about four or five bars.  There is a Subway, but that's all the healthier it gets around here for a decent price.  The bar food isn't all that expensive, but the options to eat healthy anywhere in town are pricey."
College Senior,1,Parking is very close together and a very long walk to the dorms. Teacher parking is way closer than student parking. Freshmen park in the back and have to walk even farther.

Junior,5,"Taking mostly hybrid classes with some of them being remote. Vanderbilt has invested a lot of money and has put a lot of effort into making this remote environment much more bearable, so I am very grateful"
Junior,5,Third year at Vandy! The collaborative environment and friendliness of the student body and faculty is amazing. I must say that the the academics are extremely rigorous and the bar is very high for all students so be prepared
Alum,5,"Once you graduate, you'd give anything for another week on campus with your friends, just the way you remember it.  Certainly there are areas for the university to improve, but I'm proud that students here wanted to push for changes and talk about issues that mattered to them.  I had the ability to build a ""custom"" academic experience, generally had very small classes and really genuine connections with faculty and grad students.  I miss the incredible opportunities to bond with strangers who became best friends, to try new activities and clubs that welcomed me like family and I miss Grin's Vegetarian Cafe, most of all.

At Vandy students went all out at everything we did, whether it was studying, being creative, pursuing our passions and certainly partying.  This is what made Vandy such a memorable place, was that people put their all into everything, and it really is a once in a lifetime opportunity to get to experience four years there."
Niche User,5,"I haven't taken classes online, but  I am pretty sure they would be incredible. Moreover, I would think the content online would be flawless."
Niche User,5,"My time on Vanderbilt's campus has been wonderful.  It's a beautiful campus, and the people are nice.  It's a very diverse community as well, which makes for rich relationships and opportunities to engage with students and faculty from all over the world."
Niche User,5,"It was a very positive course experience online.  The support provided is top-notch, and the university invests a lot in training professors to utilize online resources and tools to make the experience the best it can be."
Junior,5,"It was great! The professors did their best to cater to our specific needs while at home, all while still providing us with an excellent education."
Junior,5,"Vanderbilt is an amazing university. I have loved every second I have spent here. Not only am I challenged consistently by my coursework, the organizational culture, and my peers, but I am loved, appreciated, and driven forward by everything at the heart of this school."
Junior,5,"The best thing about Vanderbilt is the setting. I chose Vanderbilt over other schools I was accepted to at the time because when I visited, the campus immediately stood out with the vibrance of the students on campus, how they always seemed so happy. The campus was so alive. In terms of academics, class registration was probably the most stressful/frustrating thing. You think to yourself--I'm already accepted into this prestigious school, but it's all based on chance whether or not you can get the class you want to take because there's only a limited amount of seats in this class. Multiple times, it's a required class too. If only they provided more options that matched the demand of people wanting to take the class."
Junior,5,"Some professors used zoom, some professors uploaded study documents for students to complete on their own time. Professors generally became very understanding (no professors creating fake Chegg answers to seek out the cheaters)."
Sophomore,5,"Vanderbilt really cares about its students, and the community is great. It holds very high academic standards, so each student would have a chance to challenge himself."
Sophomore,5,"All of my professors did a fantastic job transitioning to online learning by using different apps to record lectures and slides. Exams were organized perfectly, and the professors were very supportive during office hours and via email."
Alum,5,"Friendly community, work hard play hard mentality, wonderful college experience, good college town, great professors and students"
Graduate Student,5,"My undergraduate experience at Vanderbilt was incredible, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. I learned so much in my classes, and it set me up for success in my career."
Graduate Student,5,"When we switched to online, the transition was smooth, and we were able to stay on track for the remainder of the semester."
Senior,5,"Vanderbilt has strong academics, a beautiful campus, and a great community. The financial aid is also very generous and extends to on-campus activities such as alternative spring break trips. Highly recommend. Also, all housing options cost the same, so you can live in a single room as an upperclassman."
Senior,5,"The Vanderbilt community has always been supportive, but I especially felt this during the last semester. Although it was frustrating and disappointing to have to leave campus so suddenly, the professors were incredibly understanding regarding the unique challenges we all faced during the COVID-19 outbreak, and worked hard to support our continued learning."
Graduate Student,5,"As a graduate student in the Human Development Counseling program at Vanderbilt, I would rate the university highly in regard to faculty, program quality and campus. However, I do wish that the university overall would create more opportunities for tuition coverage and student life engagement."
Sophomore,5,Vanderbilt is a phenomenal institution with world-class faculty and amenities. Students are extremely friendly and near geniuses. A truly collaborative and vivacious environment.
Alum,5,"I was a transfer student so I was worried about transitioning. They provided lots of programs to help students find their niche and make friends. I found some of my best friends. Their programs and faculty are all amazing. They are there for whatever you need. I finally felt challenged and realize now attending here was one of the best decisions of my life. I loved the programs, the professors, the numerous on campus activities, groups, and research. They also just started this amazing new program called Immersion vanderbilt that will reward people for doing activities outside of the classroom like research, internships, travel abroad, etc. This was a great experience."
Freshman,5,Alumni networking helped me get a FAANG internship. Really enjoying it so far but the academics have been a lot of work and a lot of late nights working
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Vandy. It has the best if everything. Not too big, not too small. Tons of different clubs and social groups. Challenging classes and ones that you can relax more with. Great people. It feels safe. There are tons of food options on and just off campus. And Nashville is the best!!"
Niche User,5,Vanderbilt has great financial aid opportunities and is an exceptional institution. Pretty much everything at Vanderbilt is awesome and I am very fond of the university.
Freshman,5,"Attending Vanderbilt has been the best decision of my life. Beautiful campus, amazing people, and great academics. What else can you ask for?"
Sophomore,5,"So far have had an amazing time, only complaints are the food and the workload, the academics and opportunities are amazing, and of course the reputation as well has been top when talking with employers"
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Vanderbilt! It was difficult for sure, and I had moments of pure stress over course assignments, but I learned more than I thought I could and gained a lot of skills that seem to be benefiting me greatly in post-grad life. Definitely make use of the Career Center, because they're always ready to help."
Freshman,5,"Vanderbilt University is the perfect blend of rigor and fun. For starters, it is a top 15 research university and holds a very high academic standard. Vanderbilt is also in Nashville, Tennessee, an amazing city that hosts more musical acts and events weekly than most places will in a year. There is never a shortage of fun in this fast-growing, active, and progressive city. The school is also apart of the SEC and has D1 baseball, basketball, and football making it one of very few private schools to have such a notable run of sports. All this considered, Vanderbilt is an incredibly open-minded school full of intellectuals that are driven by true collaboration and not harsh competition; an amazing place to study."
Freshman,5,Vanderbilt University is a really nice place and I'd say what I love most about it is the friendly school community. Everyone is generally nice and everyone is willing to help whenever you are stuck. Something I'd probably improve about it is the housing experience. Not so many activities are really house centered although there is an effort put in doing so.
Senior,5,"Vanderbilt University is a great school and I have really enjoyed my time here. You get the benefits of going to a top-tier school but with less of a cut-throat atmosphere than some other top-tier schools have. All of my professors have been very accessible and invested in my learning. I feel comfortable talking to my professors outside of class. There are a variety of resources on campus to help you feel supported and successful in your academic endeavors. They are currently working on rebuilding many dorms, and the new dorms are very nice. The campus food is much better than other schools and there are many different options. The students here are all very passionate about what they do and everyone has a desire to contribute to the community."
Sophomore,5,I love Vanderbilt! I feel like I'm a receiving a great education. There is a positive campus culture and I feel like students are extremely involved. The students here also are truly academically motivated.
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Vanderbilt. It is the perfect balance between students who care about their grades and experience, but also are down to have a good time and create a fun social atmosphere. My professors have been amazing as well."
Junior,5,I love my time at Vanderbilt.  The are some aspects in which the school lacks such as overcrowded dinning halls and some older dorms but the school is definitely making an effort to improve.  Being in Nashville is one of the greatest college experiences because there is always something going on.
Sophomore,5,"Vanderbilt is full of bright kids, and everyone is insanely welcoming. This is truly a community-based university, with everyone trying to help out the underclassmen, and the professors always being receptive."
Graduate Student,5,Being at Vanderbilt has been a wonderful experience! The faculty takes an interest in you and is very supportive of your learning and specific goals as a student.  They care.
Freshman,5,Amazing city. Amazing people. Amazing atmosphere. It cannot get better than this. So many happy people everywhere.
Freshman,5,It is a prestigious high ranking school in the South with amazing students and professors. Visiting will give you a modern but also historic vibe in the great city of Nashville.
Graduate Student,5,Vanderbilt University was my no. 1 selection when I was looking  into programs for Nurse Midwifery. I am so thankful to have the opportunity to attend such an outstanding program.
Freshman,5,The staff is extremely helpful and they work hard to make sure that you are comfortable.  The school is also very diverse and good with financial aid.
Junior,5,i love going to school here; the only thing that i would say needs improvement is greater inclusion of students of all backgrounds; the culture of the school can cater more to people who come from a higher socioeconomic status
Niche User,5,"While I was only a highschool student at their summer programs, I still found myself with a sense of comfortablity at Vandy and was treated as a college student with the proper challenges. Overall, it was much better than some other nerd camps I've been to at colleges."
Alum,5,"As one of the nation's top collegiate institutions, Vanderbilt equipped me with the knowledge I need to go into the world and ask the most difficult questions."
Alum,5,"I have enjoyed each of my four years at Vanderbilt. The start of my career was rough, but thanks to the resources offered at Vanderbilt, I entered my second semester with refreshed energy and an improved outlook on my college career. I have been eager to continue challenging myself and my potential ever since. I applied my new life lessons and not only improved my academic performance but expanded my horizons. Sophomore year, I started a mentorship program through our pre-med society for upperclassmen to mentor underclassmen, and I joined a research team investigating PTSD therapies at the Veteran’s Hospital. In my Junior year, I advocated for required relationship education for student groups and organized on-campus facilitators to educate our peers. I also hosted an assembly at my high school for education and prevention of unhealthy relationships. Inspired by conquering my own failures, I found not only personal success, but also ways to educate and benefit others."
Sophomore,5,Vanderbilt is an amazing university with extremely intelligent students. Great college city and environment to propel you forward in life.
Sophomore,5,"GREAT SCHOOL! Love the students and faculty I have met! I love the food, the people, the courses and everything about it!"
Senior,5,"The vibrant city of Nashville makes Vanderbilt University an excellent choice for any student looking for a fun college experience. The school itself is both academically challenging and socially invigorating. The campus is beautiful. Professors are dedicated to their work in and outside the classroom. All sports games are free for students and make for a great social outing with fellow students. Overall Vanderbilt provides a great, well-rounded college experience."
Senior,5,Choosing to go to Vanderbilt is the best decision I've ever made in my life. The professors here are incredibly wonderful and unreserved in helping the students. Classmates are intelligent and friendly. You can tell that the school truly cares about the students.
Senior,5,Vanderbilt University is a fantastic place to study. I am overall pleased with the high quality of my education. The professors are the best part.
Freshman,5,"Only my freshmen year, but I can not imagine attending another university. I'm struggling to do well in classes, but as a civil engineer I would expect that anywhere. The social scene is vibrant, especially if you are involved in one of the cultural or Greek organizations on campus. If you aren't, there are still plenty of opportunities around the school and in the city. I would definitely recommend checking Vanderbilt out, even if you think you're Ivy League bound."
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful and the tour guides were well-educated with the college. I love the focus on engineering, especially since I plan on becoming a chemical engineer. The campus is also right across the street from Bridgestone Arena, which is pretty great, considering I love hockey and like the Nashville Predators."
Senior,5,"I love the campus and the general uplifting nature of all the students. However, I feel that the whole campus could interact more, especially between majors that aren't as well represented on the main part of campus, in particular Blair. I would love to see more collaborations between music majors and the rest of campus."
Senior,5,"Vanderbilt is an incredible institution that clearly cares about their students! I've felt safe, supported and cared for all four years that I've been here. The students and faculty are kind, prolific, brilliant and compassionate."
Freshman,5,"I LOVE the size of Vanderbilt. I enjoy walking to class and being able to see at least a few people I know and am able to wave and say hello. At the same time, I can walk into a class and never have seen a majority of the students there but it definitely feels like a nice sized community. I hate those people, where I'm from, know nothing about the academic prestige of Vanderbilt and don't know where it is. The social life here is phenomenal and I couldn't imagine fitting in better anywhere else, I love seeing people from my classes who are at the top of the class but at the same time they were at a party the night before."
Junior,5,"This a great university that has given me the opportunity to explore differing worldviews in a relaxing atmosphere. professors are lovely and for the most part, classes are very informative."
Junior,5,"The most incredible part about this University is the atmosphere created by the student body. This university was voted the nation's happiest school for a reason, as the environment is just so uplifting, positive, and filled with motivated people who want you to excel."
Graduate Student,5,"Vanderbilt University School of Nursing. Loved my experience! Great teachers, easy to access, clear cut goals in class, great clinical experiences."
Niche User,5,I attended a summer program for three summers called Aspirnaut where selected high school students were able to do hands-on biomedical research at the medical center on campus for six weeks.
Freshman,5,"I love Vanderbilt University! However, one thing that I have noticed is that while the statistics on diversity is much higher than other schools, the different social groups are very obvious and not well integrated."
Freshman,5,"Amazing faculty, incredibly bright and motivated student body, gorgeous campus, nice dorms, friendly and collaborative campus culture, all in a great college town. So happy I chose Vanderbilt!"
Freshman,5,"Phenomenal school!!! I couldn’t imagine myself at any other school. I am so happy to attend. Their financial aid is amazing, their professors are inspiring, and the students are so down to earth. “Work hard play hard” suits Vanderbilt well. I encourage all to apply. You won’t be disappointed!!"
Niche User,5,"This is a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, good college. I wish I could do this all over again"
Junior,4,"Not being on campus has been more of a relief. I feel like I can focus better and engage more in class. Teachers are also a bit more lax, in a good way."
Alum,4,"Online classes aren't what anyone comes to VU for, but profs generally did the best they could and some really went the extra mile for students."
Sophomore,4,"I've very much enjoyed my time here! My favorite thing about this school is the collaborative environment.  You never feel alone here, and you'll find professors and friends who will support you through thick and thin.  The liberal arts education is amazing because I've been exposed to so many new topics that I would've never studied otherwise.  Although I'm here to get into medicine, I've developed a love for studying French, and this school has helped me pursue my passions in both fields."
Alum,4,Very good adaptation to COVID. Classes were flexible and professors worked to be accommodating due to stress.
Sophomore,4,Classes are not offered online during the normal  semester. The only reason I took classes online  was  due to Coronavirus
Sophomore,4,"Vanderbilt does a very good job of bringing its freshman class in. They have lots of cool things for you to do and people to meet. Once classes start however, these events can be a burden. The campus is very pretty with tons of trees. You definitely do not feel like you're in the middle of Nashville. The professors are super helpful and want to make sure you learn. There are high expectations but none of which are unachievable."
Junior,4,"My experience at Vanderbilt was amazing! Even though it is a highly competitive environment, the support system available to everyone is outstanding!"
Freshman,4,Vanderbilt is a relatively small campus located in Nashville and I have loved my first year here. The cmampus is beautiful and the academics are consistent with a  top 15 school.
Sophomore,4,"Vanderbilt has been a home away from home for me. A 4 hour drive from my family, I always feel close enough to visit, but far enough to be on my own. The opportunities I've found there have been very helpful for my life, both academically and personally. The friendships I've formed will last a lifetime, and the professors I've connected with have been more than helpful."
Freshman,4,Vanderbilt provides a community for all students to be a part of. Students are challenged in their academics but motivated by the dynamic and liveliness of the school.
Niche User,4,The application process was very good.  The website is layed out well and easy to follow.  I also had contact with recruiters who were very pleasant and well informed.
Alum,4,"Vanderbilt is a top-tier school that does not disappoint. It allows students to have a voice, is located in the perfect city, and is academically rigorous. Opportunities abound, students only have to reach out and take them. If you can get into this school, you'd be a fool not to attend. It truly is a home."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my experience here at Vanderbilt in general. The classes are challenging, but the scope of resources and activities available to students allow time to decompress and form solid relationships with other students and professors."
Niche User,4,I really love it here. Nice balance of that work hard play hard motto on campus. Studies are tough though so make sure you can handle it.
Freshman,4,Very good college! I absolutely love it here! I would very much so recommended this wonderful college to my friends and family!
Niche User,4,I took a tour about a month ago and it was phenomenal! I really enjoyed myself. Everyone on campus was so polite and welcoming. Also Vanderbilt requires you stay on campus and also helps you find a job on campus!
Sophomore,4,Pretty good school! They really make sure the the freshman are taken care of as we all transition into college.
Junior,4,"Vanderbilt is an incredible school with amazing academics and great professors. That said, it is also very difficult academically. In addition, diversity is definitely not the greatest but Vanderbilt does try to make everyone feel included, though this does not always play out."
Junior,4,I love the educational rigor of Vanderbilt and the general attitude and environment of the student body. It is ridiculously expensive though.
Sophomore,4,"First and foremost, Vanderbilt is interested in maintaining a good reputation. They will do whatever it takes to mimic Ivy League schools. That being said, if you can help Vanderbilt achieve that image, they will give you the world. If you do not, they will take your money and hand you a degree after 4 years. Nevertheless, the students at Vanderbilt are diverse enough that you will find a group you fit in with, no matter what kind of person you are."
Sophomore,4,"Pretty good, like it here! Great community, horrible food for anyone with dietary restrictions, beautiful campus."
Sophomore,4,"What I love about Vanderbilt is the commitment to creating a meaningful & memorable experience. Ever since stepping foot on campus - when I was met by my freshman Head of House and the Move Crew - I've been supported and welcomed. I've been encouraged to pursue my interests in and outside of the classroom and attended countless events.

Sometimes it feels like there are too many things to get involved in, especially with the weight of academics on our shoulders, but not everyone experiences this the same way. One of my favorite things is the identity centers like the Women's Center, Black Cultural Center and KC Potter (LGBTQ) Center who provide students with fun and informative programming and the comforts of home. Plus, can you ever go wrong living at an arboretum?

I mean this honestly (but always a little ironically), Anchor Down!"
Niche User,4,I have talked to Vanderbilt students before and everyone was nice and taught me how amazing campus life is.
Sophomore,4,I Love the number of safe spaces here on campus. I do think that there are problems with the housing such as the mold in several dormitories. I also think that the school needs to decrease the amount of electricity we use and the amount of water we waste.
Sophomore,4,Vanderbilt University is  a great school with a work hard play hard mentality. Academics are very challenging but there is still a fun social scene.
Niche User,4,"good school but felt like it lacked a bit on community like with the students knowing everyone
it wasn't that tight knit
the campus was average 
good facilities though 
very greek school, not my cup of tea but if you like that it's good for you"
Graduate Student,4,"My experience with Vanderbilt is very specific to my time as a graduate student which I know is much different than undergrad here. My specific program I have enjoyed the classes and core faculty, but have not had the best experience with the adjunct faculty here. My biggest complaint is the lack of diversity, but the way that Vanderbilt likes to portray themselves in a way where they do have diversity. It feels deceiving."
Junior,4,"Vanderbilt University is a rigorous school with many opportunities to further your education and career aspirations. I personally found a lot of personal and academic fulfillment here. While classes are difficult, you can find professors, advisors, RAs and friends who are willing to listen and help you be successful. They've either been in your shoes or are currently struggling with you. Campus life is diverse. There's something for everyone."
Junior,4,"I will do try to best my level. Vanderbilt university is very good and nice place. All teacher is good and they always teach nicely. I like this university, professor also teach well. Lastly I say one things if colleges and university is good he /she will get good knowledge . Do we good and be good"
Senior,4,"Vanderbilt is a great university that offers lots of diverse opportunities for students inside and outside of the classroom. Vanderbilt continues to work to make research, study abroad, and volunteer experiences more accessible to all students. The Vanderbilt name is also well respected wherever you go and graduate schools and employees look favorably towards Vanderbilt grads."
Freshman,4,"Vanderbilt is built for a specific type of student, and it really does help you figure out the type of student that you are. Make aware of your goals before you attend."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy my time currently at Vanderbilt University because there are a variety of activities to get involved with. All the people here are super nice while the professors seem to be interested in their subjects of teaching as well. Plus we're in Nashville where the food is great.
Sophomore,4,"Vandy is a great rising star in the world of elite colleges. It still retains a lot of its individual character as an SEC school with a thriving social scene in Nashville which is also growing a lot. At the same time, the academic competitiveness is rising which sometimes conflicts with the non-academic aspects of the university and poses a challenge to administrators."
Niche User,4,"My sister studies there. She says that it is a great place to learn, where students tend to work hard and play hard. The campus is beautiful-- although the freshman dorms are across the street on the school of education campus instead of main campus."
Junior,4,"Vandy is great for finding a place for everyone to fit in. There are so many groups and organizations to participate in. There is a high fitness culture on campus that can make it seem like a sin to engage in greasy chicken wings from the pub, but nobody will judge you to your face. The campus is large and pretty, but be prepared to walk. I repeat, NOT CAR FRIENDLY!"
Alum,4,"I have loved every year I spent at Vanderbilt. My professor were amazing and engaging, I did not take a single boring class.  I have found life long friends at Vanderbilt and also very much enjoyed the social scene of Nashville and the Vanderbilt campus itself. I learned more over the past four years than I have in my entire life.  The classes and professors at Vanderbilt made me excited to learn and more interested in subjects I once found mundane."
Freshman,4,"While Vanderbilt may be extremely challenging academically, the students who contribute to the student life and the city Nashville truly make for a great college experience."
Sophomore,4,"Vanderbilt is an excellent place to continue your education. It is easy to find your place at this school because the environment is amazingly friendly and welcoming. Greek life is huge here and many people get involved. The weather is usually mild and the faculty is great. The food is ranked in the country, and as a sophomore, I still enjoy it. Anchor Down! This school is not without flaws, however. The campus is pretty divided racially. There is no malice, but it is clear that intermingling between races only truly occurs in the classroom. That is one thing this school could improve."
Junior,4,The atmosphere is one of collaboration among students and most of the faculty is looking to help students in any way they can! I love the city too- it's a perfect distance from the tree filled campus and gives the college student the best of both worlds.
Sophomore,4,"Vanderbilt is a top notch university that's on the rise. Currently ranked number 15 in the nation according to US World News and Report, our school is on an upward trend. We're in a nice growing city in Nashville, TN which is not as big as a New York or Los Angeles but there are a lot of nice neighborhoods in the city near campus. The professors are top notch and while the academics are no joke there are resources available on campus to help."
Freshman,4,"Vanderbilt is one of the most beautiful campuses I've ever been to in my life. The faculties in each department, especially Peabody School of Education, are knowledgeable and experienced in their fields. Most students are easygoing and relaxed all the time, except the engineers who always look stressed out from their STEM courses. With its world-class medical school, Vanderbilt is proud to offer pre-med programs that yield e medical school acceptance rate of 70% among its pre-med students. Despite its pros, the school's party scenes are wild, and one student die from alcohol intoxication every year."
College Senior,4,Many students I know that have graduated have found jobs quickly or have gone on to grad schools of their choice.
College Senior,4,"The freshman dorms are great!  The new dorms - Kissam, were really nice as well. Currently living in an apartment style dorm with three other student and I really like this set up."
College Sophomore,4,"The recreational centers are outstanding in both style, design, and efficiency. Many students not only utilize the machinery placed in the centers for health purposes, but also have transformed the atmosphere into a social environment."
College Sophomore,4,"Vanderbilt university is nothing less of an Ivy League school. The university holds high expectations for all of its students and staff, and the campus is mesmerizing, to say the least."
College Junior,4,"As a transfer student entering Vanderbilt, I know little about the campus however, I applied eagerly because of my wonderful experience taking a summer class there. The students I met were ambitious and friendly and the professor was engaging and helpful. From what I experienced, I could tell that this campus combined strong academics with a diverse and welcoming community."
College Senior,4,Great opportunity to get involved in service and fun
College Senior,4,"Big part of student life, games are a lot of fun!"
College Senior,4,"Great school, very challenging. Best decision!"
College Sophomore,4,"Vanderbilt is a school on the rise and our reputation is spreading throughout the country as more and more students are being recruited from the west and northeast. The alumni network is still strongest in the south in areas like Atlanta, Charlotte, and Houston but is expanding in places such as Chicago and New York as well. There are lots of finance/consulting companies that come to Vanderbilt to recruit and I believe that the finance industry tends to do the most recruiting of any group."
College Sophomore,4,The courses offered vary tremendously but the classes I have enjoyed the most have been those that are no larger than 50 people because it gives a chance to learn more and discuss the issues.
College Sophomore,4,"There are lots of blue lights spread throughout the campus, and campus pd is easily accessible."
College Sophomore,4,I like how are school has a strong academic focus but the student body understands the balance of working and and relaxing.
College Sophomore,4,"I know students fare well in admission into Graduate Programs, but I've heard job placement directly after graduation can be a bit difficult!"
College Sophomore,4,"I lived in Gillette which is probably the worst of the Commons houses, but there were still never any major troubles with cleanliness or maintenance. It certainly wasn't Hank or Stambaugh, though!"
College Sophomore,4,"Vanderbilt students are required to stay on campus all four years, with the exception of some seniors.  I love this rule because I think it creates a strong sense of community.  The freshman dorms are amazing! All the freshman stay on the same part of campus called ""The Commons.""  It consists of ten houses which are the dorms and the Commons Center, which holds the dining hall, a minimart, the gym, and study rooms.  An esteemed faculty member is chosen for each of the houses, and they stay in the houses with the students and serve as ""The Head of House.""  I really enjoyed living on Commons because I think it truly helps with the freshman adjustment.  You get to live separately from the rest of campus with everyone in your class, and it's comforting to be with everyone else who's is brand new, unfamiliar and going through a lot of the same things as you are.  It also helps to foster strong friendships because everyone is located so close."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't know that many people involved in club or intramural sports, but I think those offered are good! Varsity sports aren't as huge as they are at other SEC schools, but football season is definitely very popular."
College Sophomore,4,Not qualified to give an accurate review of Vandy.
College Sophomore,4,"It's an excellent school, so I'm sure students have many opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,Greek life is very influential at Vanderbilt University
Junior,2,"I have had a not so great experience; fake friends, lots of rumors being spread about me... it feels like high school 2.0. People are extremely judgmental and vain. School is big enough that it would be almost impossible to know everyone, but too small to avoid the people you don't want to see."
Alum,2,"Recalling my time there, the housing is still my nightmare. The housing they provided is just horrible. Plus, students have to live on campus for four years. The rooms are ridiculously small and noisy.  Well, as far as I know, Carmichael Towers were not the worst. Some housing around Alumni Lawn are even smaller and have the problem of bugs. 
The academics are great but demanding. Your GPA could be low if you are not careful. The professors are responsible and approachable. Well, the quality of education is pretty good. 
The social scene is famous for being cliquey. If you are a minority student or international student who cannot get into greek life, your social life is going to be boring. 
Hence, if you come from a mid-size city and comfortable with greek lives, you might have a great time there. For those coming from a big metropolitan, preferring to stay in, are light sleepers and not fans for greek life, I would not recommend this school to you."
College Sophomore,2,"Yes, the faculty is amazing, but in a certain sense.  They are all very accomplished and esteemed; almost all of my professors this year were PhD's, but not all are the best teachers.  Most of the freshman STEM courses are weed-out, which is frustrating because with such a low acceptance rate, you'd think we were already ""weeded out."" The freshman math and science classes, and specifically exams, are unnecessarily difficult and clearly meant to get students to drop.  The discrepancies between different professors are huge.  If you are lucky enough to get a certain professor, you will actually be taught the course well and be prepared for the test.  If you get a different one, you may not be taught or even warned of all the material covered on the test.  My chemistry class was huge about 150 students even after several had dropped out.  I had to primarily rely on reading the textbook and my own outside work to actually learn the material and use going to class just as a supplement instead of the other way around.  Professors can be pretty helpful in office hours, but you need to go with specific questions already prepared.  Also be prepared for the occasional egotistic professor who will scoff at your questions and be rude. Engineering majors: the advisers are not helpful at all and will often tell you what is financially advantageous for the school.  They encourage first years to retake calculus instead of using AP credit in order to ""build a strong foundation,"" but any of the students will tell you this is an awful idea.  It is just a weed out course where nothing new or crucial is learned, it's just again unnecessarily difficult because the tests were very long and hard.  Another example: I was advised to move Computer Programming to the fall semester instead of spring, which was also bad advice because the class is taught very differently in the fall than in the spring.  To sum things up, it's much easier in the spring and actually geared towards freshman."
College Sophomore,2,"Well, the HOD (basically business majors) students are set up.  The pre-med students also seem to do well.  Other students in STEM majors seem to be ""dropped on their behinds.""   Often times engineering majors GPA's are too low to even score any internships during their undergraduate careers and find it hard to get in grad school or find jobs in their field afterwards- which is ridiculous.  For the class of 2016, the mean salary for chemical engineers was only $68,000.  Chemical engineering is supposed to have one of the top three undergraduate entering salaries.  For Vanderbilt to be a top fifteen school, that is not a lot at all.  It's mostly because the grading scale at Vandy tends to be lower than other schools.  No one is handing out any A's: a B is the new A, a C is the new B and a D is the new C.  An A in a STEM class is very few and far between.  The problem is that Vandy is not acclaimed as a STEM school, so when you go to career fairs and apply for internships, you're often overlooked because of a low GPA, when truly, a 3.0 at Vandy is basically equivalent to at least a 3.6 at the majority of the schools of the students you're competing with. Vandy is not like an MIT, Rice or Stanford though so recruiters do not recognize this.  I'm a hardworking student, go to office hours tutoring and all that good stuff, but I do feel that engineering majors are screwed over at Vandy."
College Junior,2,"Our athletics are laughably bad in some areas, but pretty great in others. Baseball and basketball make it worthwhile but for the most part, our sports are embarrassing and we don't belong in the SEC."
College Freshman,2,"The courses are tough, especially if you take demanding classes, I regret taking a handful of demanding classes all at once, that was a bad idea. Also, the professors here are researchers, therefore they don't teach, so if you want to learn something, turn to youtube and your textbook"
Recent Alumnus,2,"The Arts and Sciences career center is a joke. I only had one friend who used the career services on a regular basis, and he was not able to land a single internship using them. He ended up getting an internship with a bulge bracket investment bank through a family connection.

Generally speaking, if you do not seek out their help, they will not be of any assistance to you. And the school does not host a lot of top companies. The only industries that it is decent at are health care and consulting. Health care is a major industry in Nashville because of the tax incentives offered by the state of Tennessee to health care companies. Consulting is decent because a number of Vanderbilt alumni have gone on to work for major consulting firms. But in reality, none of the classes at Vanderbilt are really that useful for going into consulting. Thus, you're going to have to sell yourself to the consulting firms as a well-rounded generalist."
Recent Alumnus,2,"To start with the positive, the academics at Vanderbilt are truly top-notch. The professors are genuine experts in their fields, have published in scholarly journals, and are generally available for office hours. Small class sizes make for good class discussions and easy participation opportunities. Nashville itself is a great and fun city, and one that you can totally fall in love with during your 4 years at Vanderbilt. The campus itself is beautiful, with excellent academic facilities, guest speakers and food.

However, Vanderbilt is a study in constrasts. It is billed as a southern school, yet the majority of students are not from the south; a significant portion of them (the Northeasterners in particular) detest and despise the south as backwards and racist. They openly discuss how they wish they had gone to an Ivy League school, but were rejected and ended up at Vanderbilt instead.

Vanderbilt has a very clear class divide: the rich, white students join greek life and mostly stick to themselves, while the others, including minorities, hipsters, transfer students, the ultra-religious and those who just don't fit in to Vandy culture, are left to do their own thing, but are generally looked down upon as second class (socially speaking). Vanderbilt boasts that half the students receive financial aid, yet the diversity is sorely lacking; the clear reason being that the school is unwilling to take on and dismantle greek life for fear of losing alumni donations.

Most pathetically, Vanderbilt is located in a truly awesome city. And yet many students never leave the campus to see and experience Nashville, because many of them consider the south to be scary, backwards, racist, etc. And of course these people grew up in places like Scarsdale, Orange County, Chevy Chase, Highland Park, etc."
College Freshman,2,Very dominant over all aspects of campus life.
College Sophomore,2,"As a transfer, I'm kinda disappointed about my overall experience. The upperman housing is terrible and the housing department is useless. Food here are very limited especially on week days night. School work are very hard no matter what major you are. Plus, student here are very very fratty."
College Freshman,2,"The school seems to have an unspoken issue with minorities of all races and sexual orientations, although I do have to say, feeling marginalized makes people closer. The black community here is really tight-knit, and the LGBT community is, too, but if you don't really fit into them, then you're on your own. I can't speak for the other minority groups. As a black kid in the middle-class, I can see this a lot, and it was initially really difficult for me to make friends because of that. The Chancellor of the school is working really hard to change that negative experience for minority students, but the community members as a whole (as in many of the students, parents, etc.) seem a bit resistant to it. Definitely not THE friendliest environment for minorities, but it's manageable."
College Junior,2,"Whether or not Vanderbilt is the school for your is totally dependent on who you are as a person. As someone that is not very into the greek life scene at all, I do find that there are still a lot of potential places to make non-greek friends. But... the fact that it dominates the social scene bothers me. There's always an assumption that you're somehow affiliated with greek life and people always seem surprised when you're not especially for girls. Additionally, there's a general sameness to the student body. There's not a lot of diversity of thought or attitudes."
College Freshman,2,"Very, very expensive. Vanderbilt does not let many people live off campus at all, so it is mostly rich kids with connections who are able to get off campus apartments."
College Freshman,2,Campus housing is just cheaper. Just live on campus. Everyone does.
College Sophomore,2,"Commons is great; new buildings and great social atmosphere that fosters friendships. Apart from Commons, everywhere else is generally dead. Nobody likes to venture out of their rooms to meet or hang out with others who live in the same building. McGill is the exception to this, but in terms of building quality and cleanliness, every single residence hall needs to be renovated. There's mold and a musty smell in at least one corner of each building. I have yet to find a building other than Kissam or Commons where students do not need dehumidifiers. In my res hall, there's no thermostat, so you're stuck between frigid AC when the temp is >55 degrees and sweltering heaters when <55 degrees, both on full blast. 

The dorms also need more and better social spaces. Almost every floor in every hall is nothing but corridors, which leaves no space for socializing or studying with others on the same floor. Recreation rooms in the residence hall have very few amenities (e.g. Tolman has only a foosball table in its basement). Study spaces are almost non-existent.

The only downside to Commons is its distance from main campus. As for upperclass housing, Morgan/Lewis seem to be the best in terms of cleanliness and space. The major downside to the ""nice"" housing, however, is the distance from everything except the gym and Blair. Basically, you pick between quality and convenience."
College Sophomore,2,"The average male student has one look: backwards baseball cap, tshirt, cargo shorts, Sperrys. The average girl? Three quarters exercise pants, big tshirt, running shoes. At first glance, the average student on campus looks very attractive. Delicious even. As soon as partying weekends hit or classes start, you will no longer think them attractive and you are left wondering how in the hell they managed to get accepted by Vanderbilt. The average student is preppy, only interested in makeup and boys, lazy, disgusting pigs, sleep around like nobody's business, always out partying, rude, stuck-up and prissy, and most likely a psych major. 

Now, the non average student, which they are kind of hard to find on occasion, are cool, classy and chic. Easy going, interested in chilling and just talking, not huge on the 'get drunk until we pass out' scene. Basically, pretty much the opposite of the average student, and waaaaaaay better to hang out with."
College Sophomore,2,"The party scene is great for people who want to go out and drink three or four nights a week, but if you do not want to do that, you should pretty much avoid the parties. They start later than you should really be going to bed if you have an 8 a.m. the next morning, and frat row always sounds way too loud."
College Sophomore,2,"Vanderbilt is a beautiful place with beautiful people... on the outside. Vanderbilt is a business that is trying to maximize its revenue and increase its ranking. The students are solely concerned with GPA's and reputations on campus. The student body is not cohesive at all and breaks into cliques based on race, campus involvement and Greek Life. The Vanderbilt experience that was provided five years ago is completely non-existent today. I have had terrible experiences with Vanderbilt professors, administration, staff and students. There are redeeming qualities to the school (such as the Nashville environment) but such qualities can be found at any highly competitive University."
College Senior,2,"Study drugs are abused by many students, alcohol by most.  It's difficult to compare to other campuses without having witnessed firsthand, but Vanderbilt seems to have something of a problem with drug safety.  However, there are social groups that don't fit that mold, and they are just as visible and easily accessible."
College Sophomore,2,The WASPs pretty much have control over the campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Parking at Vanderbilt is not great, we're not meant to be a commuter school.  It's expensive to park and difficult to find open spots.  "
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much diversity on campus.  There may be diversity in regards to numbers on paper, but the diversity is not evident when walking around campus."
College Freshman,2,"Most kids are white, upper class, heterosexual, and conservative. "
College Sophomore,2,Pretty facilities but a long walk to get around campus.
College Sophomore,2,"The social scene could be better.  Too many of the parties are fraternity based so non-Greek life people have to make their own, which usually aren't as good as frat parties."
College Senior,2,Parking on Campus is by permit only. Permits for general parking are about $330 per year. Freshman can't have cars.
College Junior,2,"Your typical Vanderbilt student is a rich, white southerner. As a black middle-class student, I guess you could say I stick out. Diversity isn't terrible (I have two Asian friends!), but it certainly isn't great. If you cannot stand guys who pop their collars and talk about how rich their fathers are, then this isn't the school for you. Personally, I find humor in all the arrogant people here, but others can't stand the atmosphere."
College Junior,2,"The process to applying, finding, and funding off campus housing is so arduous and lengthy.  My roommate and I started the process, but got overwhelmed and realized it wasn't as good of a deal as we had originally thought. Plus, the ones that are close to campus fill up early, so one will also have to have a car (more expenses) in order to travel back and worth. I suggest on campus housing."
College Junior,2,"VUPD does not monitor much, only in emergencies.  Visitor rules are fairly lax, and many hallways and suites are co-ed.  Students get free reign of most of campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is incredibly limited. Permit costs are high and you aren't allowed to have a car freshman year (although some people get around this by getting a permit to a garage in one of the nearby hotels). Driving to class is not really an option as most students live on campus and there is no parking near most classroom buildings. Having a car is great if you have an internship or want to explore Nashville, but definitely not a necessity."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is very expensive, but is to be expected in Nashville. Freshman can't have a car on campus, although it's easy enough to keep a car parked near campus on several streets with free parking if absolutely necessary. Having a car certainly isn't necessary, but is a great convenience. It's relatively easy to get a parking permit as a sophomore and above."
College Sophomore,2,"There exists racial diversity on campus, but you will be silently discriminated against by most of the white community for being anything other than white or black. In other words, white people will avoid you for being Asian. All the Asians here came because they were either unable to get into higher-ranked schools, or because they are party animals. Most of the black students are here on athletic scholarships. Sad to have to list these stereotypes, but they are true for the most part. There is a severe lack of diversity in interests here. Most people just want to party and graduate with their degree. This is the wrong school to attend for people who want to be accepted by anyone outside of their ethnic group."
College Sophomore,2,"Doggoned PERMITS! For one thing, permits cost SO SO much. (since they assume that since you are attending Vandy, you have major money to blow.) Freshmen are not allowed to have cars are campus (aka buy a permit) so that is a problem. And then most of the upperclassmen have a car so it's a literal adventure to find a close parking space, especially before class. There are various parking garages around campus-since the medical campus is RIGHT in the middle of Vandy-but student parking is all the way on the top and it's usually only a floor and a half so that is usually filled as well. And Traffic&Parking are vultures when it comes to giving out tickets. It's ridiculous. There are enough spaces...but not enough spaces for the people living there. There are ways to beat the system, but they are well kept secrets. ;)"
College Sophomore,2,"As a sophomore, parking is limited to the worst spots on campus. Additionally, having guests come is a nightmare because getting temporary passes is impossible, and so the guest is guaranteed a ticket."
College Junior,2,"Drinking Is Overbearing – Drinking is clearly visible on main campus. The school has made several strides to curve underage drinking. One of these includes having freshman campus separate from main campus and dry (meaning no alcohol allowed with zero tolerance policy) as well as having faculty living in all freshman dorms. The crowd that one hangs out with has a huge impact on their drug and alcohol experience, but drugs and alcohol are heavy in greek life."
College Freshman,2,"Monsoon Sreason – Lots and lots of rain, aw well as being very humid"
College Freshman,2,"It's so hard to find parking, I've gotten four tickets this past month! Freshman can't drive, so they either have to park a couple streets over from the commons on 17th or take taxis, borrow cars, and walk."
College Senior,2,"Nashville's weather is the craziest weather I have ever seen. One day it is sunny and warm, the next it is snowing. Also, be prepared for snow! It snows here and it gets VERY cold. But other than that, the weather isn't all that bad."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Fine, Nothing Special – There aren't that many options for dining at Vandy, although if you get creative, you can stay pretty satisfied. The best places in my opinion are the Commons Dining Hall, which has several different choices from a salad bar to Chinese food, and Chef James, which has a different hot entree each day. Although healthy eating isn't the easiest, with a little bit of effort and planning, it's definitely possible. I recommend trying to live off campus, that way you can avoid the meal plan altogether and eat what you want!"
College Sophomore,2,"They try to make it diverse, but everyone sticks to their own race for the most part. There are a ton of Malaysians, but they literally don't hang out with anyone but each other. Not many gay people. Those who are are not really accepted by other guys but have lots of girl friends."
Alum,1,"Ever seen an 18 year old in a shiny new BMW?   Then you know a Vandy student!  The lack of diversity here is staggering.   The rich, elitist, white-privilege bubble that exists here will absolutely blow your mind.  

If I had it to do over again, I would have gone to a public college.  Once you've heard the phrase ""C'mon, his parents *only* drive an Infiniti!"" uttered, or seen a kid refuse to do a community service project because he was tired of the homeless wanting to buy his new Nikes, you've officially heard it all.  True stories (and you know who you are, a-holes).   

PS - School spirit is a joke.  What are we proud of: a ""Commodore""?    A rich, robber baron Railroad tycoon from the 1900's who broke the backs of the working class for his billions, that's what.   If you want to be exposed to non-millionaire kids NOT born on third base (I.E., the 99%ers) then choose better.  I wish I had."
Junior,1,"The dorms are horrible to start with and the school administration does everything in their power to suck money from the students. The school is now making all students live on campus however their dorm that is housing 600+ students is not ready for the new year. Absolutely terrible. They also don’t let anyone live off campus, so if you were hoping to have fun in college, don’t apply here. On top of that, the academics and D1 sports really are average. Half the professors can’t speak English or are too focused on their own research / lives to teach a class well. After having been here for over 2 years, I wish I had known how bad this school was before I applied and would transfer if it wasn’t already too late."
College Freshman,1,I hate Greek life and so I really can't comment on the relative quality at Vandy
College Junior,1,"I don't know if Vanderbilt has Greek life that's truly worse than most other schools with Greek life, but I honestly hate it. The sheer amount of clique-y-ness that goes on sororities is immature enough, but the partying, underage drinking, and repeated sexual assault cover-ups that happen in the frats is so below the character and the reputation of this school."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Greek life is a stain on Vanderbilt's reputation. I can say that as a white male that grew up in a rich suburb in California, I was looked down upon for not being a part of a fraternity. The divide between greeks and non-greeks is generally racial and socioeconomic: greeks tend to be rich and white from suburbia and do not receive financial aid. They snottily look down upon non-greeks as second-class students. Greek life divides the campus in a very palpable and regrettable way.

But the real problem is that the culture greek life creates is preventing Vanderbilt from truly being considered an Ivy League-level school. Incidents like SAE destroying its house, DKE getting busted for cocaine dealing, and alumni coming to campus for a football game and having to walk through beer cans strewn everywhere dent the school's reputation. Until it rids itself of greek life altogether, it will have trouble making it to the level of the top 12."
College Freshman,1,"I personally believe Greek Life is the worst because I do not see its purpose on campus except for party throwing. Unfortunately, it permeates some corners of campus."
College Freshman,1,Not many people live off campus because there aren't many options
College Sophomore,1,"The Greek life at the school can be really intimidating, especially for students who don't drink or students at a lower income."
College Sophomore,1,The economics professors at Vanderbilt all teach lecture-style classes. They are extremely challenging and place no importance on the individual student. Major advisors also show little interest in students.
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life at Vanderbilt is shallow and is only concerned with reputation. It promotes racism, anti-Semitism and is the reason many students decide to transfer. Greek life offers little to the Vanderbilt community other than great nightlife."
College Sophomore,1,"Always difficult to find a spot, and once you think you've found one, you get a ticket."
College Sophomore,1,"It's college, there's obviously going to be ambulances and people passed out around campus."
College Sophomore,1,There aren't many options and the food is borderline bland.
College Sophomore,1,The students as a whole encompass a friendly environment.
College Sophomore,1,Nashville's very country. So there's mostly country music.
College Sophomore,1,Not really strict. The police aren't around when most crimes happen.
College Sophomore,1,It's hard to get around to find any open restaurants without a car.
College Sophomore,1,It's a diverse college with a major influence on greek life
College Junior,1,"Permits cost a lot. Ticketing is scary. I was once ticketed three times in a day (I was in class!). Needing a car on campus isn't really necessary because walking is good for you anyway (it's a big campus, but not that big). Finding a parking space can take hours, too."
College Sophomore,1,"Very hard to get off campus housing, and when you can, it is usually quite far away."

Alum,5,"Holy Cross is a stellar community of learners. Challenging faculty and curriculum. Yes, students can be a little competitive with one another. Quietly has one of the best Pre-Med programs in the US, as well as one of the strongest English Literature Departments in the country. My four years at HC were spent doing a ton of work and leaning in hard, not only to complete work load but to achieve good grades; an ""A"" isn't something that's doled out..you've got to really work very hard..even if you may have been top 10% of high school class and/or high SAT scorer. Common refrain is that it 'might be more difficult to get into Harvard' but Holy Cross academically is equally, if not, more rigorous.  Holy Cross also practices what it preaches with respect to civic-minded aka social justice matters; students proactively seek opportunities to help and serve others. In today's world, Holy Cross (and its fellow Jesuit institutions) are vital to sustaining happy, healthy, and whole communities!!!"
Alum,5,Took several language classes online that each included some form of in class assessment (graduated pre-Covid). The online classes I took were all excellent!
Alum,5,"An incredible four years to say the least. Generous financial aid, breathtaking campus, dedicated/high quality faculty, rigorous academics, excellent study abroad opportunities, strong campus community, and great alumni network/job placement. Came from lower income background but was able to study abroad for an entire year and graduate with very little debt due to Holy Cross's generous financial aid policies. Broadly speaking, the student body is diverse, hardworking, and committed to public service. Worcester also has great restaurants and bars, plenty of shopping, and there are lots of other colleges in the area (and is also only a 40 minute drive from Boston!) The career development center is top notch and works diligently to connect students with Holy Cross alum in all job industries. Excited to continue to watch Holy Cross transform in the years to come with the new student recreational center and Arts center opening shortly."
Alum,5,N/A - This was not applicable to me as I did not take online classes.  I was there before COVID-19 /quarantine.
Freshman,5,"The campus is gorgeous! From the students to the staff, everyone is very welcoming. Great food, amazing resources, and a very strong alumni network."
Senior,5,"College of the Holy Cross will always be my home away from home! I love the atmosphere here as the study body is very tight-knit and welcoming. I always feel very safe on campus. The professors are very personable and truly care about you as a person. As a rising senior, I have also been very involved in extracurriculars over the years. I have explored my passions at Holy Cross and it truly has been a blessing. I would not have wanted my college experience any other way."
Senior,5,"My time at Holy Cross has been incredible. College is definitely the best four years of your life, and Holy Cross has seen to that. There are so many opportunities and great people at Holy Cross. I have made lifelong friends and incredible memories."
Freshman,5,"Holy Cross is great!  It’s a small school so it’s easy to get to know each other.  Huge community feel; this became especially evident after we were recently all kicked out due to Corona Virus concerns:( Fantastic professors, challenging but interesting classes (would highly recommend attending a rigorous college prep school before you come here!) You can get tons of individual attention if you seek it out!  Lots of study abroad/study away opportunities!  One thing I would change is the lack of diversity.  As a Hispanic pell grant recipient coming from a diverse area, it was a bit of an adjustment to come to such a homogenous community dominated by the exclusive, white, not-so-self-aware upper class lifestyle. Regardless, I have met great people here and the experience is what you make it!"
Alum,5,"I had a wonderful experience at Holy Cross! I would recommend this college to literally anyone, the professors were top of the line and there is such a sense of community."
Niche User,5,"Everything you could ask for in a college - friendly students, thoughtful and caring professors and an incredibly beautiful campus. The new recreation center and performing arts center will be fantastic additions to the campus."
Junior,5,"Holy Cross has been an incredible experience for me. The school does hold up to being quite rigorous academically but it is so rewarding. There are so many resources for students to succeed. Every employee is so kind and does everything they can to make sure that I have everything I need. As a first-generation student and student of color, I was a bit nervous about different challenges I might face at the college but the college has served as such a great support system. Everyone here wants you to succeed and to be happy. Very expensive sticker price but the school works very very closely with all families to meet 100% of demonstrated need and make getting a college education a reality.  Highly recommend."
Sophomore,5,The College of the Holy Cross has really helped to to adjust into college life while also still being academically rigorous. The professors and everyone on campus truly help you in any way that they can to make the experience memorable and enjoyable.
Niche User,5,"In all honesty, the College of the Holy Cross has been a fantastic place for our family. My daughters were able to get a job right after college, thanks to the great recommendations from the professors. Also, I was very satisfied with the education that the school provided."
Sophomore,5,"I would describe Holy Cross as opening and welcoming. Easily the best thing about Holy Cross is it's sense of community. You'll find a true sense of belonging not in just one single club or sport, but in the community as a whole. Everybody gets along well with each other and people are always open to help. If there was anything I would change, is that the food could be better."
Alum,5,"The College of the Holy Cross is the perfect example of a New England liberal-arts college. The classes offered, of which there are many, are small enough to feel recognized among the masses. The professors are available to meet with and take a real interest in the students who take their classes. The best thing to say about Holy Cross is that the ability to form longstanding relationships with professors is easy and recommended. With them on your side, it becomes so much easier to succeed in life; they are more than willing to write recommendations."
Alum,5,"Everyone is very kind and willing to help others. Holy Cross became my home away from home. I have met some fantastic people with diverse backgrounds, and I was able to try different things that I never experienced before."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved attending Holy Cross, but the professors demand heavy workloads. However, Holy Cross is a place where supports you to discover your true passion, and the professors do an excellent job guiding."
Alum,5,"Admissions do a great job selecting a group of young students with a unique and intelligent feature every year.  When I was a student, my professors were dedicated to their students, and they did a great job guiding their students to thrive in their major."
Alum,5,"Despite the fact that the College of the Holy Cross requires a heavy workload inside and outside of the classroom, I really enjoyed my time at Holy Cross because I was able to build a special relationship with my professors and fellow classmates. The best thing about Holy Cross is that the professors are passionate about sharing knowledge as they encourage students to further expand their knowledge by providing numerous research opportunities."
Freshman,5,"The College of the Holy Cross is great. There is such a community atmosphere on campus, and the school does a phenomenal job at offering so many activities and speakers. There is always, always something to do on campus. You will never be bored here. The academics are challenging, but they do not have to consume all of your time. There are many opportunities and activities that you can become involved with through the college. 
Most students are incredibly friendly and intellectual. Professors are kind and want you to learn material that they are passionate about."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Holy Cross has been incredible and insightful. Many of the courses are interesting and contribute to developing the student's opinion, perspective, and understanding of others. For a first year, it can be a struggle to adjust and take the initiative to get involved but there are many excellent resources on campus. I would love to see more events/advertisement throughout the year towards first-year students to make them feel comfortable and confident in joining clubs or volunteer opportunities."
Alum,5,"Excellent, open minded professors that are willing to work 1 on 1 and odd hours with all students. Very understanding in certain situations. Facilities are new and improved and the campus is beautiful. If you don't mind winter storms and stairs, the school is great. Student atmosphere is fun and the college allows lots of room for student voices."
Freshman,5,I love it. Just absolutely amazing! I was given a free ride and I am extremely blessed and excited to be a Crusader!
Freshman,5,"I love everything about Holy Cross, it is an all around amazing college to attend. The academics are top notch, the sports are average but a very good addition to the college experience. The teams at Holy Cross are Division one, but are not impossible to walk on, so do not let the division one title discourage you from trying out. There are a lot of clubs on campus to participate in and so much more. It is a great school!"
Sophomore,5,"I have really enjoyed my Holy Cross experience so far!! I have met some amazing people while getting involved with the school, and while the academics are challenging, professors are really willing to help; they want you to succeed."
Sophomore,5,"After my first year at Holy Cross, I now call it home. This college delivers students an amazing education while also cultivating an amazing community of global citizens in the process. Its small size gives students the capacity to forge bonds and build relationships with their professors--providing them with the best educational experience possible. It is home to a community with respect at its core. Most importantly, however, Holy Cross gives its students a multitude of opportunities that not only help them grow but also deliver them the tools that lead them to a future of their choosing."
Freshman,5,"It has a wonderful selection of interesting classes, amazing professors, and a beautiful campus. I find the people here to be open and understanding as well, and I could not recommend the academics highly enough."
Alum,5,My experience at the College of the Holy Cross was amazing. It is a small school so there is a real sense of community and family. The class sizes are small which is very beneficial to students. It is an NCAA Division 1 school so sports also have a big following for a small school.
Niche User,5,"This is the college that I will be attending in the fall of 2018. I went there for a tour and interview. I fell in love with the campus and its people, it's a truly stunning college and I am honored to be a future student here."
Alum,5,"Great atmosphere! Everyone is so nice! Academics are tough, but the professors are amazing and really care about you!"
Freshman,5,"I love the friends I have made and the opportunity for success after graduation that is made available to me. The alumni network is extremely helpful and always willing to meet with you, give you guidance and extend a hand! One thing I might change is the access to Worcester with shuttles and the food in the dining hall."
Sophomore,5,"Holy Cross builds a strong community between students, faculty and staff, which for many becomes a home away from home."
Alum,5,"College of the Holy Cross will give a safe transition from high school into an undergraduate college. You will be very close with professors and students. The college prides itself on values of volunteer and service for others. This is a school, where, if you are determined to succeed, you will."
Sophomore,5,The academics are top notch.  The classes are challenging but interesting.  The professors are accessible and inspiring.  The student body is great.  I do not like the food.
Alum,5,"The College has an exceptional tradition and especially high academic standards.  Its alumni are close and tightly-knit... a great thing for friendship and professional interests.  The campus is among the most beautiful in the country and if Worcester is not Boston, it is lively and within easy travel not only to Boston but to ski country to the West and North.  Though (like Boston College and Georgetown) it has a Catholic history, kids who are not Catholic will find it a hidden treasure and on a par with New England's finest liberal arts colleges.  Not to be overlooked!"
Sophomore,5,"As soon as I stepped on Holy Cross's campus I knew that it was the school for me. In regards to Academics, Holy Cross's coursework is considered one of the best and most rigorous in the nation. A's are not easily given out, so you'll have to work for them...but it's so worth it. Professors are so helpful and care so much about their students. For the past couple years Holy Cross has been ranked as having the most accessible and inspiring professors. If you are looking for a top notch school with AMAZING professors and faculty, apply to Holy Cross."
Sophomore,5,"I am a current student at Holy Cross and I genuinely love it here. No, it's not perfect, but I could not imagine a better college for me. It's not that every day is wonderful, because we all have bad days, but I have never once regretted coming here. People told me I would hate Worcester but I don't at all; Shrewsbury Street especially is great! My classes are challenging but the workload is not overwhelming. You will never meet more brilliant professors or students. People here take their work seriously, but they don't take themselves too seriously. I never feel like I'm ""competing"" with my classmates; it's not a cutthroat atmosphere at all. "
College Junior,5,"The sense of community that is present at this school is astounding. No matter what your religion or background, everyone on campus -- from students to faculty to resident Jesuits -- wants to help facilitate a healthy environment for learning and  friendship for everyone. I have not had a single bad experience with anyone at this school."
College Junior,5,Holy Cross is known for its tight-knit alumni network. Alumni from Holy Cross are continuously seeking to help graduates.
College Junior,5,"The professors really are one of the primary reasons for continuing to love the school so much. They are extremely demanding and push you way past what you may consider your limit, but they make you realize that you truly do not have the limit you assigned yourself, and instead are capable of so much more. They are inspirational and provide you with amazing opportunities and learning information that I'm confident will help others and me in the future."
College Junior,5,"I have absolutely loved my Holy Cross experience thus far. Financially, it is extremely difficult to stay at the school, and I'm going to be in debt for quite a while. However after having completed 2 years on the hill, I have faith that it is all truly worth it. My only other issue is that there are very few LGBTQIA+ students on campus that are confidently ""out,"" and it saddens me to see it especially when almost every student I have met has been extremely welcoming to me and other out individuals. I'm hoping that I see more and more students feel more comfortable with themselves on campus, and more LGBTQIA+ students enrolling! If you are one of these students, definitely be aware that there may not be as many students like you and I on campus, but it is still an extremely welcoming atmosphere and I did not have any problem at all being my true self."
College Senior,5,"The alumni network is amazing, as is Career Services, which helps students find and secure internships for the fall, spring, and summer. There are always recruiters on campus, and we always get emails about networking events. I personally love the Women in Business conference each fall."
College Senior,5,"Can't speak highly enough of the education I'm receiving. The professors are absolutely brilliant and actually want you to get to know you and watch you succeed. I've had incredible classes both in my major, and classes I've taken for my common requirements (gen-eds)."
College Senior,5,I've typically always felt safe on campus.
College Senior,5,"When applying to colleges, Holy Cross was my dream school. I'm thankful every day that I was admitted, because I have had the most  incredible college experience here. Not only have I had amazing three years here socially and made life-long friends, but I've learned and grown as a person, a student, and a member of society. Everyone is so friendly, intelligent and ambitious, and really pushes each other to be their best selves. Holy Cross is definitely a work hard-play hard atmosphere, but the party scene--whether it's a night at the bar or a day drink off campus-- makes all the work we do worth it."
College Junior,5,"If I could go back in time, I still would have chosen to go to Holy Cross. I could not have imagined a better experience and I am so happy I chose to go there."
College Junior,5,Holy Cross has a very strong alumni network and everyone who goes there or has gone there has a lot of school pride.
College Junior,5,Public Safety is always there for the students and assures all of the students' safety at all times.
College Junior,5,"I could not be happier at Holy Cross and would never choose another school to attend if given a second chance. I can't imagine myself at any other school. From the people to the beautiful campus, my time there has been truly extraordinary. I have formed friendships that I know will last forever. Also, Holy Cross has truly challenged me to become a better and more well-rounded person."
College Freshman,5,Very safe & secure campus. Public safety always makes sure everything is good at night.
College Freshman,5,"Its been awesome. I met so many new people, got out of my comfort zone so many times, and enjoyed all campus activities."
College Freshman,5,The office of student involvement and academic services is great with getting students to participate and running many alumni networking.
College Freshman,5,"My school (College of the Holy Cross) is amazing. Academic are great, and so are the people!"
College Sophomore,5,"Although Worcester, MA is not the safest city, Holy Cross does a great job of making students feel safe. Especially on weekends, it is rare that you will walk ten feet without seeing a Public Safety car or a blue light."
College Sophomore,5,"While not a cheap education, the post-graduation prospects for Holy Cross students makes the price well worth it. Year after year, Holy Cross students go out into nearly every field of work and do great things. As a Crusader, graduating college isn't quite as terrifying as it is for others."
College Sophomore,5,"With small class sizes, it is very easy to get immersed in discussion for the entirety of a class period at Holy Cross. Luckily, most professors aim for this, and will not stop discussion in order to ""get through"" their own agendas."
College Sophomore,5,"While the Holy Cross freshman and sophomore dorms are nothing to write home about, the living conditions greatly improve in your upperclassmen years. Because all of the dorms are relatively small, there is a great sense of community, and a great deal of long-lasting friendships are formed in the dorms."
College Sophomore,5,"Holy Cross does not have Greek life, which makes the campus a very inclusive environment."
College Sophomore,5,"Holy Cross has truly mastered the liberal arts education experience, even if this means a massive work load. The challenging academics guarantee that you will feel as though you are getting your money's worth."
College Freshman,5,"The community is so close that I feel very comfortable walking around by myself. Leaving the library late is never an issue. While I have never personally seen or heard of any sexual assaults at HC,  sexual assault education and awareness is a major part of campus life."
Alum,4,"I had no experience with online learning so I am not able to adequately respond to this question. Based on what I understand, I would imagine the online learning experience to be excellent."
Senior,4,I have not taken any classes online yet. I will have to take all of my classes online this fall due to the pandemic.
Sophomore,4,College of the Holy Cross has a very nice and cozy campus. Everyone in the community is familiar with each other and it feels like one big family with all your distant cousins and family members you didn't know you had in one place. There are lots of nice places to study and the campus is very beautiful in the warm weathers.
Sophomore,4,"Personally, my professors made it very comfortable and available for me to join online classes and adapted to new ways of teaching to help me learn remotely. They put in a lot of effort to helping students get adjusted to the new setting in the middle of the year and I think they did a good job and making sure we are on the right track. The school also made some adjustments in their guidelines to help us change or adjust our courses if necessary for the semester."
Freshman,4,I personally did not take online classes but of what I heard it went great. It was engaging and very successful.
Senior,4,"Despite these unforeseen circumstances, Holy Cross has been able to provide its students with the necessary tools needed to successfully transition to online classes. With the little time they had, Holy Cross was able to transition to online classes in the best way possible. Though different professors had different ways of handling how they conducted their lectures, the institution as a whole always kept us updated and provided the necessary resources needed to finish the rest of the semester."
Senior,4,"College of the Holy Cross is an exceptional school with exceptional professors! Despite the rigorous academics, Holy Cross  creates an environment in which professors want to see you succeed. From various academic resources , to social and extracurricular activities, the spiritual community, and everything in between, the College of the Holy Cross fosters an environment in which they not only want their students to grow and experience the world around them, but they also cultivate an environment in which the next generation of Holy Cross students can be men and women for and with others and continue to ignite the world in a positive manner around them."
Sophomore,4,Academics are hard but manageable and the party scene is there if you want it to be. Most professors are excellent and I've had a ton of positive relationships with them. The students are the best part of the school and make my whole experience.
Senior,4,"My experience at College of the Holy Cross has been wonderful so far. Both the school and the campus are breathtaking. The view from the “hill” never ceases to grow old even after three years. I have also loved every professor I’ve had at the college. Being in the sciences I’ve taken some difficult classes, but my professors are always there to help me with problem sets or questions I have regarding the lectures. There are definitely perks to going to a small school. I truly feel as though I am receiving an amazing education. I've grown and am learning so much from my classes it’s hard to believe that I will be a senior this year. Last semester I was fortunate enough to study abroad in Peru and it was definitely one of the most incredible opportunities Holy Cross has offered me. Overall, the education I am receiving from my school has exceeded all expectations both academically and spiritually."
Freshman,4,You have to work very very hard here. The workload is exceptionally heavy. The social life at HC is not great. The community can be very down in the winter. Worcester is not very exciting either. The teachers at HC do care very much about your effort and want to help.
Freshman,4,"The academics at Holy across are an excellent experience and the professors are very easily accessible. Dorms are alright, they really depend on what you and your roommate(s) do with them."
Alum,4,"It is a great school if you want to stay on the east coast and work or attend graduate school there. The reputation is unparalleled on the east coast. However, I moved to the west coast and the alumni network and reputation isn’t as prominent here. Just be aware."
Sophomore,4,"It's a small little college campus, which offers a good sense of community. The small size also makes you feel like a person, not just a ""number"" as if I attended a much larger state institution. Also, the food is fantastic! I know plenty of students at other schools that can't tolerate their college dining."
Sophomore,4,I would like to see more involvement of Faculty and Staff to promote a safe environment for minorities on campus.
Junior,4,"Holy Cross is a great school. They attract a very specific kind of student, high achievers who want to work in business or politics later in life. The campus is beautiful and professors are very nice. They really care about their students."
Freshman,4,Holy Cross is an incredible institution with the abilities of a large school with the accessibility and personableness of a small school.
Alum,4,"While I think HC has a great academic program and that I really learned a lot there, they do not prepare you for obtaining a career after graduation."
Junior,4,"Overall, Holy Cross has a great way for the students to get connected with the community and its faculty. The only aspect of the college that can be improved is the way it handles certain controversial outbreaks (such as vandalism, women shamming or politica/racial slurs) and how the students of color are integrated on the campus."
Niche User,4,"My experience with Holy Cross has been amazing. I love the school and would go there in a heartbeat, but we recently got my financial pre-read back, which doesn't look good for my chance to go."
Sophomore,4,Holy Cross has been a great experience for me so far. It's small size provides students with the ability to fully connect with other students and with their professors as well. People truly get to know their teachers and are able to form relationships with them. The academic programs are top notch and the campus could not be more beautiful!
Alum,4,"Loved Holy Cross in many ways--great professors, excellent courses, beautiful campus, loved the year-long study abroad program--and frankly had an overall great experience. In retrospect, however, it's simply unnecessarily expensive for undergrad when you consider most HC students are good candidates likely to go to grad school and financial aid is low (unless you're an athlete), despite what they preach about being need based. Would have liked more encouragement to engage in more strenuous academics--esp taking/auditing extra classes or doing a capstone project (which I never heard of until it was too late)."
Junior,4,"My favorite thing about Holy Cross is the general warmth and openness of the community.  Since I first arrived on campus all of the students, faculty, and staff have been very supportive and have made sure I was able to make the most of my college experience.  Holy Cross holds on to its values as a Jesuit university and is at the same time quite liberal compared to other religious, private schools.  I wouldn't trade my experience at Holy Cross with anything else."
Sophomore,4,"Holy Cross is a great school academically, located in the improving city of Worcester. Because the student body is so small, most people are very friendly and willing hang out. Academics are definitely competitive. Don't come here expecting to pull all A's, and even then, studying still has to be a number one priority. That being said, Holy Cross embodies the phrase ""Work Hard, Play Hard"". From Wednesday-Saturday you can always find a bar or party to help you forget about the mountain of work."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Classes were interesting and engaging. Professors were helpful if you reached out to them, which most of them encouraged for you to do. Courses were challenging and good study habits are essential to excel in them."
Recent Alumnus,4,Campus works hard to teach about resources and safety specially for incoming first years as they get taught about possible scenarios during orientation.
Recent Alumnus,4,Dorms were your average college type. The biggest perk is that the more seniority you have the easier it is to get the housing of your choice. For the most part the dorms are spacious and were always active with activities for the students.
Recent Alumnus,4,"As a fan supporter the athletics department provided many ways for the students to be able to participate in the athletic events. There were always opportunities were nonathletic students could participate in, such as working at the games or for the athletic offices. As for the other fans they always provided freebies and equipment for the fans to come to the games. The school spirit was always at the top."
Recent Alumnus,4,"It has a great Liberal Arts curriculum that allows you to explore all aspects of its education. You get to explore many different classes that you would have not thought of and that turn out to be awesome. As for uniqueness the school offers many retreat opportunities, it offers many ways for students to study abroad (not just an year or semester you have a month long semester option and even classes that have study tours out of the country), in addition it has amazing volunteering opportunities that allows for you to reach out to the community and help make a difference in the life of the people of Worcester."
College Junior,4,"The school does an excellent job at keeping our campus secure both on and off hours. Should something serious occur, the school also does well in informing the students and faculty of the problem and how the school intends to resolve it."
College Junior,4,The best reason to live in dorms on campus is for the community inside them. The RAs do a great job at keeping the peace while also maintaining a friendly environment for everyone in the building.
College Junior,4,"Our players work very hard in class and on our teams. Some of our teams are not the best, but most sporting events are still a good time for students. Our current athletic facilities are average, but recent construction promises a higher quality in the future."
College Junior,4,"The sexual assault cases I have heard of have been addressed, but it did take a while for the two friends that have been in that situation. However, the school has essentially a zero tolerance policy for such incidences, and actively seek to take care of such an issue."
College Junior,4,"I really do love the housing lay out at Holy Cross. It allows you to establish really close relationships with people that you'll see basically on a daily basis. Because there are so few students, you get to know the majority of the class and see them all the time."
College Senior,4,"Housing is fine. Freshman/sophomore year are standard doubles. Junior year is suite style living. Seniors have the option of on-campus apartments or off-campus houses/apartments. Off-campus housing is all clustered around 5 streets, which is nice because you still have that community feel, and it's convenient for party-hopping."
College Senior,4,Varsity athletics are definitely gaining more support as years go on. We're in the process of getting a completely new athletic center for both varsity athletes and non-athletes.
College Freshman,4,It is awesome! Everyone is great and make you feel at home
College Freshman,4,"From what I have heard, I would have loved to have a greek like in my school!"
College Freshman,4,Games are very well supported and advertised!
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are amazing, they're passionate about what they teach and hope you'll continue to study it in the next semester."
College Sophomore,4,You always get emails at least once a week with internship opportunities and open invitations to visit the career center or meet alumni.
College Freshman,4,"Worcester can be rough, but the area of and directly around Holy Cross is safe. Unless, you count the weird guy who films students walking past his house."
College Freshman,4,Dorms are what you expect for freshman and sophomores. the nicer apartments go towards the juniors and seniors. Its the basic rule of housing gets better as you go up through the years.
College Freshman,4,"So I'm only a freshman, but so far my time at HC has been pretty great. Independence is key to your college experience, and at Holy Cross its no different. If you want to take mad easy classes and cruise through a semester with little effort, the options there. If you want to challenge yourself, there are classes for you as well. Most of my intro's were pretty easy and I didn't stress at all, but I assume that will change as I go through the years. Signing up for classes is a hassle, since everyone in a grade signs in at the same time to compete for 20 person classes. This can be a blessing in disguise however since sign up can push you towards classes normally out of your comfort zone. Dorm life and food is pretty standard, except if you're in Mulledy. Sucks to suck, have fun with your mile walk to everything. Party Scene/ Social life kinda depends on the friend group you fall in with. Some people drink every night, some don't drink at all. Off campus parties are usually Saturday. A lot of people bitch and moan that guys can't get into parties if they're not on a team/ club team but that's not true. Joining a club team is easy and your bound to make friends with athletes at such a small school. If you can, get a fake cause bars like Liets can provide some of the best nights at HC. Drugs are around if you want them, but again depends on your friend group. Kids will rarely deal with people they don't know."
College Sophomore,4,"Workload is often complained about, but I believe it makes us better students and I don't mind it (my major is also easier than those studying chem/accounting/etc. I love studying on the fourth floor of Smith or in Cool Beans 2."
College Sophomore,4,"It has had its amazing moments and not so amazing moments, but ultimately I am glad I chose my school and I believe the students are overall wonderful, intelligent, dynamic people. I have made friendships with people that have challenged my ways of thinking, and I am especially grateful for the year-long study abroad program, which I will participate in next year."
College Sophomore,4,"With the athletic complex currently being renovated, the athletic facilities on campus will likely improve greatly over the next four years. With this, there will be even more opportunity for athletics on campus, as Holy Cross students are typically very active. While the varsity sports do not reign supreme on campus, they are certainly an essential part of the student body, and the varsity sporting events are well-attended."
College Freshman,4,"Campus police are always circling around campus even at 3 in the morning which is excellent so you feel safe all around. 

They are very serious with their job."
College Freshman,4,"Reading through some of the negative comments in the overall experience, I feel the need to justify some of the Holy Cross atmosphere. My greatest concern upon arrival at HC was the stereotype of the rich, snob who only wears Vineyard Vines. Since I have come from a different background, I was scared I would feel left out or just left among a group of shallow people. And the answer to that is, yes there are shallow people here. HOWEVER, there are plenty of people who are not only concerned about parties and looks. I've learned that rich kids can be really down to earth, so as much as I thought they would judge me, I was the one being judgmental. Every student at every school has to forge their own friendships with the people they find similarities with, and its no different at HC. Same goes for partying...if you're into that scene you'll have a fun time, but if not their are like-minded people to hang out with! You just have to take the opportunities to meet these like-minded people.

Sure its a rich kid school, but it has offered me the greatest education I can imagine. I know all my professors on a personal level and two have already put me in contact with colleagues for internships, just out of the concern for my success. My course load has been a wide range in subjects, which I love. It has given me the opportunity to explore subjects I was not considering. Overall, I love my school, but just as with every other school, it is what YOU make of it."
College Senior,4,Many people have talked about great internships and employment opportunities.
College Senior,4,Generally safe. People get sent to the hospital for alcohol poisoning every so often during party nights.
College Senior,4,A lot of school spirit for certain sports teams.
College Freshman,4,"Holy Cross is a very tight-knit community, and students are often challenged and presented with opportunities to get involved."
College Freshman,4,"Got put in a great dorm -- made some seriously solid friends.  Everyone is friendly and it isn't hard to make friends from all different kinds of academic interests or sports teams.  Worcester gets a bad rep but it's got a lot of good places tucked away if you know where to look -- there are also a lot of ways to get into Boston or Providence if you have the time.  Bar scene is a lot of fun, weekends have their ups and downs, but so far it's been a lot of fun."
College Freshman,4,I am very happy with my choice! Holy Cross is the best!
College Sophomore,4,"If you put in a lot of effort then you will be rewarded big time! Doing well in class requires a lot of hours working on course material. Just as important is the social life, interacting with peers and getting involved with community service projects and clubs. A lot to offer from a small school."
College Sophomore,4,I believe my school is great because it makes a serious attempt to make the campus an inclusive environment. I am a minority student on campus and at first the environment can be overwhelming. The faculty and President of the school make sure to hear and address concerns or discomfort in the best way possible. The school also provides many opportunities to volunteer across the country or locally. My school pushes its students to experience diverse environments and diverse issues that will prepare them for the real world.
College Senior,4,"The public safety officers use an effective amount of strictness to ensure the safety of all students. The parking policies could be less strict, however."
College Senior,4,I did not have problems with the financial aid process.
College Freshman,4,There are not major problems with pub safe or RAs unless you are taking things too far. Only on a few occasions would I say that pub safe was being ridiculous with rule enforcement.
College Freshman,4,"The school is expensive. I feel like every time financial aid deadlines roll around, I'm panicking and it's very difficult to figure out what exactly needs done."
Junior,2,"I was a huge fan of the College of the Holy Cross, until I stepped on campus and saw how hard a  4- year private Jesuit dominated liberal arts institution was to fit into. On top of that, being a student of color was even harder. There is rarely any diversity at my campus, and I decided to join clubs like A.S.I.A. to be apart of something more and to stick to my roots. I enjoy educating others about my Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Chinese culture and I wish I could be able to see more support in different people's cultures on campus, and less racial remarks"
Sophomore,2,"Social scene only includes drinking. Nothing to do here. Freshmen and sophomores aren't allowed to have cars so you feel super trapped on campus. My mental health has never been worse than it is here because I feel like I can't breathe or have fun due to schoolwork. On top of all of this, it's extremely expensive."
Sophomore,2,"Holy Cross is very socially cliquey and culturally northeastern.  Most friend groups are formed within the first few weeks of freshman year and remain the same until graduation, and many social cliques are based off of high school friend groups.  It is extremely difficult to make friends after the very beginning of the school year, as a lot of people are not very willing to accept new and different types of people.  Unless you're an athlete or over 21, there are very limited social options both on and off campus.  Holy Cross does not take its Catholic identity seriously at all, so avoid this school at all costs if you want a meaningful Catholic education.  If you're not from the New England region and are not socially outgoing, DO NOT come here.  This school can be a very lonely and isolating place, and although the academics are top-notch, in the end it's truly not worth it."
College Sophomore,2,"Public safety is typically incompetent if you need anything, and they will break up parties."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorm bathrooms are atrocious, and the size is just average until you're a senior."
College Freshman,2,"Off-campus parties are usually very crowded. You will be asked several times, ""who do you know here,"" or just be kicked out if you're an underclassman. Police usually bust the parties around midnight so there isn't much to do after that besides get sh*tfaced back in your dorm room. Kinda lame to be honest."
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of party varieties. Most of the time you just have to make your own or go to a bar if your older.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Very difficult to get financial aid, and it was a big hassle to go through financial aid."
College Sophomore,2,About 90% of students live on campus. It is more convenient to live on campus with everyone and it is more safe.
College Sophomore,2,"Worcester is not a good college town. Other than the fact that our school is closed off from the city, there isn't much to do in Worcester."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone drinks, but thats not to say everyone parties. If you're not on a varsity team good luck getting into any parties"
College Sophomore,2,"Once it gets warm, all the guys are out in their finest pastels. Everyone wears sperrys, j crew, and vineyard vines.  There's a few students who go against this norm, but they're tough to seek out sometimes. Everyone is really friendly.  Everyone holds doors for each other.  Girls are generally more attractive than the boys here."
College Sophomore,2,"Very little ethnic diversity on campus but admissions and brochures like to pretend otherwise. Most people are straight.  Most people are accepting of other sexual orientations, but words like ""gay"" and ""faggot"" get tossed around a lot casually."
College Junior,2,"Holy Cross is a very white, Catholic, upper-middle- to upper-class school. The administration knows this and is making a big effort to diversify, but it's going to take awhile to see results. I have seen very little evidence of overt discrimination, but I can imagine that it would still be somewhat difficult to be any kind of minority here. I will say that I'm pleasantly surprised by the political diversity. Both the College Democrats and College Republicans are active on campus, and you'll see signs for every candidate hung from dorm windows during elections."
College Junior,2,"Drinking is extremely prevalent on campus. There are a few tobacco and marijuana smokers, and I'm sure you could find harder drugs if you knew where to look, but they aren't nearly as prevalent as the drinkers. I choose not to drink, and while I've had very little overt pressure to do so, I have definitely felt weird and left out."
College Junior,2,Holy Cross actively discourages students from living off campus. The application process is very tedious. Most off campus students rent rooms or houses right on the other side of College Street--no one really gets very far away.
College Junior,2,"Worcester is right on the edge of the snow belt, so we get a lot more snow than Boston. Although the maintenance staff does a good job of keeping walkways clear, it's still not much fun to walk up and down our huge hills in the cold! It also tends to be unusually windy on campus (again, because of the hills). On the plus side, fall is gorgeous."
College Junior,2,"For such high academic standards, the food is lacking. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Very few students engage in drug use, but there is quite a bit of drinking and the HC pub safe can be quite strict. Although not their main function, most of their time is spent breaking up large parties in the underclassmen residence halls, making sure stunts are safe crossing the street to off campus parties and ensuring they do not congregate in the street and become a mob. Seemingly petty things such as carrying an open container in a residence hall come with being ""written up"" which usually involves a letter home and a meeting with Paul Irish from the admin or an alcohol counselor. Third offense brings housing probation."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Worcester is a weird, mostly dangerous and run-down place. There is a small handful of good bars/restaurants. There are some cute neighborhoods (but you're a student . . . you don't care). The weather is terrible. The locals hate Holy Cross. For better or worse, the campus is pretty isolated from Worcester."
Freshman,1,"So far my experience at Holy Cross has been abysmal. I do not know what sort of student would even remotely find this school acceptable. MINORITIES STAY AWAY. Once on campus you will begin to feel like an outsider. Just simply walking around campus and you will often receive glaring looks of curiosity just by looking different from the student body. There has also been multiple of instances of racist activity on campus such as swastikas drawn  around dorms. 

Academics are unnecessarily difficult  while offering a limited number of useless majors to choose from. Many of the classes are focused on educating the whole person , rooted to a liberal arts education. Complete nonsense. One can simply research philosophical questions online. Don’t waste money. 

Holy Cross has a heavy drinking culture. The majority of the student population are alcoholics. I can’t go to the bathroom without seeing excessive vomiting on the floors"
College Freshman,1,"Dorms are horrible. Janitors do not clean the room or ask to vacuum. The bathroom is cleaned but not well. It is sloppy. The toilets are not cleaned. Floors are always wet; no drainage. Moths always at some point occupy the bathrooms. 

Worst option is Mulledy--FARTHEST from everything (other than Figgy but is a nice senior dorm). Dorms should not cost this much.

The resident assistants are too flexible with noise level. RAs do not walk around as much as they should be. Because of the flexibility with rules, people are always awaken on a school night at 2-3 am. 

Hard to socialize. 

Dining is so far from everything. Library is also very far."
College Freshman,1,"Public safety says they are there to help you if you're in need of assistance, but really they don't give a sh*t and will get you in trouble for anything you do that is in the slightest bit wrong."
College Sophomore,1,we dont have Greek life
College Sophomore,1,Social life must include drinking…because that's the only way to have fun right? Maybe for a bunch of boring people who have no hobbies except looking in the mirror
College Sophomore,1,"There is no diversity on campus. Everyone dresses the same, everyone acts the same. There is no culture. Nothing stimulating. Everyone comes from New England. Everyone comes from a nice background. What about foreign students? What about artists? What about bands? What about something other than sperrys and vineyard vines? How about some colored hair, how about some informed opinions."
College Freshman,1,We have no Greek system.
College Senior,1,"Students have ""NO RIGHTS"" when it comes to living off campus. Everyone wanting to live off campus is subjected to a Nazi-like review process which can take months. despite the fact all students are adults over adults over 18, Holy Cross treats them as children has stripped their rights away.<br/><br/>Most students are not allowed to live off campus after an exhausting 3-6 month review process. This whole process sound illegal to most students and runs completely contrary to what a college or university experience is all about."
College Freshman,1,The only dining hall on campus does not consistently offer fresh and pleasant food. There is not much variety but it does have the occasional meal that creates a long wait time.
College Junior,1,Punishments Are Severe – it is absolutely ridiculous how religious people are the strictest.  It is ridiculous how you loose your housing over the most minor infraction and misunderstanding about a situation.  not everyone gets to give their side of the story
College Sophomore,1,"Too Limited – There are not enough options for food. There are no outside vendors of food on campus, and the food that they serve is overpriced and very limited.  There is only one type of coffee that is sub-par, the food at Kimball (the main dining hall) is on a menu that repeats every month or so, and there are only three other places to eat other than the main dinging hall.  Also, you pay a specific amount for a meal plan which is split between meal swipes (for kimball) and dining dollars (for any other place to eat/get coffee on campus).  Even if you have 200 dining dollars left, they do not transfer over to the next semester, so your money goes to the school and you don't see any of it.  "
College Sophomore,1,"Not Good – Parking on campus is very limited.  Freshmen and Sophomores can't have cars on campus and even when you do have a parking pass it's very hard to find ""legal"" parking."
College Sophomore,1,"The Computers at Holy Cross are far from perfect.  The servers crash occasionally preventing students from even using the school computers.  Almost all of the computers run on Windows Vista software or something older (I'm not a mac person, but they have only a handful of them).  Bring your own computer."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The city of Worcester is not a nice place to live as a college student. Worcester is also making a huge deal out of off-campus partying so on top of students living in houses that should be condemned, the police are constantly stopping by violating student rights."
College Sophomore,1,Social Atmosphere – Extremely homogeneous. Same things to do every week
College Freshman,1,its cold and windy in the winter since were in the wind. Its bareable if you bundle up
College Junior,1,White as White Can Be – if your looking for a diverse campus this ain't the school for you..there's very little diversity here..everyone here is pretty catholic and white..and those who aren't are usually ignored or oostracized.

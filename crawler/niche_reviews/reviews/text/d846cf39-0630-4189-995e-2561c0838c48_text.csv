Freshman,5,I took no online classes this Academic Year so therefore I need to just fill in this box as much as possible sorry if there any moderators that have to look at this
Freshman,5,They have a great learning environment and student life as well as professor I can't wait to start my my year this August
Sophomore,5,"Due to COVID 19, all of my classes were commuted from face-to-face instruction to an online platform. Everyone did the best they could with what they had."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love it! The classes are smaller than average so professors can teach more effectively and take time to make sure that students understand the material. The professors, administrators, and staff are very approachable and will do their best to help with any problems you may have"
Senior,5,USCA is a very good college with a long list of student life and activities. I do disagree with the requirement of ICE credits in order to graduate especially since the ICE system is always messed up. I also think that there could be more communication between departments.
Senior,5,"I have had a wonderful education at the University of South Carolina Aiken. The instructors here are always there when you need some extra help or just need to talk. It's a small community, so the student body is very well connected with each other. Sports are present, but are not predominant here, which is a huge plus for me. The equestrian community here is unparalleled."
Freshman,5,University of South Carolina Aiken had a wonderful campus. It also provides a small college feel and has a great location.
Junior,5,"It was really good for my first semester as a USC Aiken student-athlete.  All the coaches and professors show me good examples and show me how to be a better person day by day, teaching me and supporting me in every decision that I had in my first semester far from home. I would like to thank you all the staff in the dorms to help me as well with any problem that I had during this semester! I am glad to be back this Spring to finish my first year in this great institution."
Niche User,5,I have visited the University of South Carolina Aiken a couple of times and they are friendly and welcoming. Their students seem to feel safe in the environment that they study in. They also have a vast variety of courses and majors that one can take. A lot of extracurricular activities are offered to all students in the area that attend that school. The University of South Carolina Aiken has affordable housing and is clean. I took a tour on a field trip there and everything was a good campus to study at. The library had a lot of books and computers and they were willing to help and answer any questions you had.
Senior,5,"I have had an excellent time here at USCA. All of my teachers thus far have been super helpful in helping me achieve my goals. I am a Nursing major at the school, and scoring well in my core courses was highly important to me. The school has countless sources available to help you pass, so please take advantage of them."
Niche User,5,"As an incoming freshman, I am excited to attend USC Aiken.  I feel at home here, everyone is friendly and kind with outgoing attitudes and a focus on school.  The professors are approachable and the athletics programs allow me to participate and celebrate sports events."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshmen at USCA and I absolutely love it. It is a small and secluded campus with so much to offer. There are usually events every week (if not every day) that you can participate in. There are over 100 clubs to join and ways to get involved. I have met so many friends and have had so much fun just in my first semester of being here. There is no party scene and the campus security patrols 24/8 as well as keeping the gates locked at night, for our safety."
Sophomore,5,I love how it’s family oriented and every one is so nice. I love how they treat everyone equally no matter what.
Freshman,5,"I love how small the campus is and how all the school buildings are in the same circle. The professors are pretty nice and good, but you have to put a lot of effort and time into your studies in order to pass and make good grades. Also, the people are really friendly there and it's easy to make friends and be in a type of sorority. The school has really good coaches and sports teams. They also have many clubs that you can join anytime. I would recommend going to USC Aiken if you are considering it."
Freshman,5,"I've just began as a student at the University but i believe that within my 4 years i will grow to love the atmosphere and the people because it is a friendly environment and the campus and dorms are beautifully designed. Along with academics and professors, the school is decent and is increasingly excelling at being better."
Freshman,5,"University of South Carolina Aiken makes you feel like you are part of the family.  From Open House to Orientation, I finally felt like I belonged to a terrific group!  I can't wait to start my Freshman year at University South Carolina Aiken!"
Sophomore,5,Everybody at the school and professors are very friendly . The area and community is great. I havent had the full experience of the school yet because this will be my first year there and I will be coming in as in sophomore this year. The events and actives they have around campus is always fun and i know that from just being from the same area that the college is located. The sports games also be very fun
Senior,5,It is a small campus that allows for the teachers to be interactive with the complete student body. The material being taught is current and provides the students with an easy transfer into the job market.
Senior,5,My experience at USC-Aiken has been nothing shy of amazing. The teacher to student ratio is perfect for students to be successful within the classroom. USC-Aiken has multiple activities and groups to join to help the students get more involved. I have had the opportunity to be apart of a special fraternity and compete with them in intermural sports. USC-Aiken has been the best college choice for me.
Sophomore,5,I am truly pleased with this university. They have so many activities for the students to engage them and challenge them. The tutors there are amazing and very helpful. The professors there truly care about the success of their students.
Junior,5,I love this school and the nursing program! They always fun activities going on and the campus is beautiful (:
Freshman,5,USCA is such a welcoming school! There's so much to do here at school. The teachers are amazing and the students here really show their Pacer Pride! I feel 100% certain I made the right choice when I chose USC Aiken. GO PACERS!
Freshman,5,"There's so many new things going on.  I was surprised coming from out of state, but I love it.  I'm a big sports fan so seeing a nationally ranked basketball and baseball team is great.  

My favorite is the professors.  They seem to care about me and my classmates.  I feel like I am getting everything a big university offers, but in a place where I am not just a number.  Most of my classes have less than 20 people.  

I was worried about tuition, but the tuition here is comparable to my home state and I was fortunate to receive aid.  Everyone has been super friendly.  I live in a great on campus apartment, have made a lot of friends, and even got invited to my roommate's family home for the holidays.  I really do love it here and am so happy I chose Aiken.  I didn't know all that much about the school going in, but it definitely worked out great!"
Sophomore,5,"This school truly makes you feel so welcomed, the staff and the students are amazing. I am glad i chose this School"
Junior,5,"USCA is a smaller college.  It is in close proximity to Aiken, North Augusta and Augusta. They offer online classes as well as classroom lectures.  The diversity is well established.  The curriculum has something for everyone whether you use the school as a stepping stone to the next level or plan on graduating and moving onto a job."
Senior,5,"Its a small school, which is great for one on one experience with the professors. Professors are willing to help."
Junior,5,USCA is a great all around campus! Everybody is beyond friendly and more then helpful. The student to teacher ratio is also amazing!
Junior,5,Everyone seems fun and inviting. The campus is moderately sized and well maintained. You can tell the people there are good and the teachers are superb from the way that the students talk about them and share their experiences so readily with everyone.
Freshman,5,USC Aiken is a great school with many opportunities. The environment is peaceful and is also one that is easy to adapt to. Surveys and statistics spread across the past decade or so also show that this college is one of great educational value.
Sophomore,5,Excellence campus always full of activities! Everyday there is something to do and the cafeteria is always serving up fresh food. There is even a Starbucks on site and free nursing care and wellness center.
Sophomore,5,The professors are genuine and truly care about the success of the students. USCA is awesome and I love the city of Aiken. The only thing I would change is campus dining.
Senior,5,"Aiken, SC is one of the most beautiful and historic places on the East coast and USCA is a perfect duplication of what this town is all about. The experience I’ve had so far has been nothing but exceptional. I wish I could stay here forever!"
Niche User,5,"One of the most exciting part of winter break, 2016, was visiting, University of South Carolina’s campus. Although I will be starting my college experience, fall 2018, it was my first time out of five times going on USCA’s campus tour. My first experience was fun and exciting, the tour guide had a sense of humor and seemed to know every important detail there was to known about this amazing school. This fourth year student was a psychology major, which gave me a heads up and helpful tips, being that I’m going to major in that specific field. The campus was small and people friendly, my favorite spot is the student lounge, with its comfy sofa chairs, pool table, food court and highly convenient bookstore. I am looking forward to starting my freshman year off great, and enjoying my time in USCA’s student lounge.
	Sincerely,
	Stephanie Lopez"
Senior,5,"I like University of South Carolina Aiken because it is a not very big university; the environment outside the buildings is really beautiful: flowers, trees, benches everywhere, there is a fountain which is really nice; the quality of education is very good. I like the small classes and Professors know each of the students and they help students every time when someone seeks help. I like that every student has academic advisor and also that students can create their own class schedule the way they want to. Likewise, if they want to work, they can do it on campus or off campus. I personally live on campus and I really like that experience, because I have access to everything I need, it is very safe, and it is not very expensive. I enjoy my years at University of South Carolina Aiken and I do not want to change anything."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at University of South Carolina Aiken and I love my first year I have wonderful professors. We  have wonderful students there that I have gotten to know.  I love these school itself and I love the sports activities that we have on campus and I feel very safe attending University of South Carolina Aiken
Freshman,5,I like the Campus it is very beautiful and everything on campus is in reach. When you leave the campus there are stores not even 5 miles away from the campus. I love the dorms they are very different and you have your own bathroom. Basically the campus is a very exciting place to be
Freshman,5,"I am currently still attending USC Aiken. USC Aiken is great with their students, and make sure our academics are great and we get as much help as we need."
Freshman,5,University of South Carolina-Aiken has been a wonderful experience overall. With so many changes in my first semester this college has been a huge help adapting to college life.
Freshman,5,Usc-Aiken is an awesome university. It's small so finding your classroom is not hard. The teachers are nice and very helpful.
Niche User,5,The University of South Carolina- Aiken is a great school. The students and faculty make it seem like home and the campus is clean not too spread out.
Junior,5,"I have thoroughly enjoyed my years thus far at USCA. From extracurricular activities to the classes, I feel as if I have become more enriched and enabled both as a person and in my field of study."
Freshman,5,I liked that the University of South Carolina Aiken is a small college in a small town but has a big heart. Even though they are small they are one of the top 4-year universities in South Carolina. Their tuition is also lower then most other 4-year colleges in the State. They dorms are so beautiful and the professors are exceptional. I feel that this is the only college that suited all my needs and there is no other college for me.
Freshman,5,"Whenever a person  can say that a place feels like home. That place must be pretty spectacular. That's exactly how I feel about USC Aiken, it has such a up lifting environment for students. It really is great place to get college education and experience college life."
Freshman,5,University of South Carolina- Aiken is a excellent college. There is nothing to change. Every thing is just right.
Sophomore,5,I love how the university keep you updated on news and events that occur on campus. Student life has amazing ways of getting you involve on campus. Professors are tend to care about students and find a way for students to engage in learning.
Sophomore,5,"The University of South Carolina Aiken has a variety of majors and minors for students as well as many opportunities for students to get involved. Being a smaller campus, students are able to connect and interact closer to others and their faculty. USCA has some of the top rated academic programs and also a superior athletic program. There is something for everyone, of every age, at every level, at USCA."
Niche User,5,"USCA has a very beautiful, open campus. You can easily relax and do work anywhere. They have a very well known Nursing program, it is also very competitive so you have to work hard."
Senior,5,I love the connection that the university has to the community and how this helps gets students out there into their chosen field of study. It helps to get jobs and internships very simple and easy to do. I love the small class size because it makes learning the material easy to understand and you also can build a relationship with the professors which is also very beneficial.
Freshman,5,"It has been amazing and a lot of fun working with USCA so far. There have been so many nice people I have met and they have all been so helpful to someone who is new. I recommend that anyone who wants a nice small school, choose USCA."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman here at the University of South Carolina Aiken. So far my experience has been wonderful. The campus is very beautiful and everyone is very friendly. However, food choice may not always be the best. I believe having a variety of good food choices are needed. Sadly to say, there are plenty of days I have not eaten because of poor food preparation and choices. Eating is very important because everyone should be satisfied with their choices of what they should want to eat."
Junior,5,"Its great, provides students with a focused atmosphere. Has many great professor that each student can learn from. Student life is very flexible allowing students to participate in many student-led activities: fraternities, sororities, on-campus jobs, and many more."
College Senior,5,At this school you work with professionals of that field who can give some amazing recommendations to help their students get ahead in life.
College Senior,5,My school is very small and the professors prefer to get to know their students individually thats what I love best. It is not difficult for a new student to get involved as long as they have a positive attitude.
College Junior,5,I love attending sport events at my school. We have a lot of supporters to our games especially basketball.
College Sophomore,5,I have enjoyed the time I have spent at my school and am looking forward to the next 2 years I have here. The courses are challenging and the professors are great.
College Sophomore,5,Athletics at my school is very important. Students are involved and the teams perform great.
College Freshman,5,It's a very safe campus.
College Junior,5,Sports are some what important on my campus
College Junior,5,I really wanted to pledge delta but pledging costs too much so I've decided against it
College Junior,5,the academics is the best
Junior,4,"I was not taking many classes online until the Coronavirus. Some of the teachers made their classes a bit more difficult during this time, but majority of the teachers were super helpful and understanding."
Junior,4,"I am currently in my junior year at USCA. Overall, I really do enjoy it. Most of the professors are great and truly want to see their students succeed."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy USCA. What I like most about the college is the small community that allows you to get to know your peers quickly and easily.
Senior,4,"There was a point in the semester that the entire university had to switch to online due to the coronavirus. This was not the greatest for everyone including myself because its simply not how I learn, but given the circumstances the professors were very helpful to me and my struggle with online classes."
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed myself with a lot of what the campus had to offer. This was a very accepting campus and loved all walks of life upon it. I felt that every student, whether they be black, white, gay, straight, different cultures or religions were all respected in many ways. The professors for myself had their ups and downs. I have received many wonderful professors, but I've also had some who weren't so great. Overall, the campus itself it beautiful and so are the people who walk it every day."
Freshman,4,"As a college freshman, I wasn't sure what to expect. I definitely didn't expect to take half of my second semester online due to COVID 19, but these things do happen. The campus is, in my opinion, beautiful. The upperclassmen for the most part care about helping new students settle in, and the professors (that I've had, at least) are willing to help anyone who needs it. The food on campus is expensive if you don't have a meal plan. I don't know anything about the dorms or party scene because I live off campus, though."
Junior,4,"I like that there is a wide variety of people that attend this school. The campus is on the smaller side but it gives you a lot of opportunities for one-on-ones with professors and to build friendships with numerous people. Sometime I wish there was more to do off campus without having to go to Augusta but sometimes downtown Aiken has fun events to attend. Basketball games are really fun to attend here and even though there isn't a football team, there are many other fun sports to participate in and watch. The school also offers a wide variety of intramural sports that any student is allowed to participate in. Overall the professors are great and knowledgeable and there are good academic programs, and its a lot of fun to watch athletic games here and you make memories and bonds that will last a lifetime."
Senior,4,It is a great University. Majority of the professors I've came in contact with has been very helpful.
Freshman,4,I like that it is small and that you can get to know your professors better. The campus is pretty and overall it is a good school.
Senior,4,"I am currently a senior at USCA majoring in exercise and sports science. Attending this university has been mostly a positive experience. The professors provide an environment where it makes it easy for the students to learn. They work with students through email, by staying after class, and by going outside of their office hours to meet with students who need extra help. 
The campus is a beautiful sight to see. One of the better things about this campus is that it is not too large, which makes it easier to get to class on time.
Something that I do like is the education, but I would like to make some minor changes. Such as class availability, some classes aren’t available in a window that I see suitable, whether that be a time or a class not being available for a whole semester. 
Reiterating my original point, my overall experience at this university has been a mostly positive one."
Junior,4,"My experience so far at USCA has been a good one. I've met great people, professors, and learn a lot of valuable lessons. There are great teacher that will help you in any way to see you succeed and great opportunities to help you along the way as well such as, study groups and free tutoring. The environment is very peaceful and the campus is always kept clean and up to par. There is a lot of diversity on campus. People from countries you wouldn't even think about. I wouldn't change anything because they give you all the tools you need to succeed."
Freshman,4,I will be attending in the Fall.  I have visited campus a few times to get a feel of the campus and it seems to be a good fit for me.  I hope I am right.
Junior,4,"USC-Aiken is diverse and is slowly growing. The college is not to small, but big enough that you have the opportunity to meet so many new people and gain new perspectives. The faculty always remembers student names or faces, and the class sizes average around thirty people. Most of the buildings, and the cafeteria especially, could use some updates and modernizing, but the environment offers a great college experience in my opinion."
Sophomore,4,I really like this school. It’s small yet it’s a lot to do and a lot of people to meet. It’s more like a second home than a school. Dorms are amazing!
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience at USCA has been a great experience.  I am currently living in the dorms but some of them need updating.  For the most part, the professors are very good but I have had a few that were not.  Other students in the same class but different professors had a better experience than myself.  That’s the most inconsistent part of the college.  But overall, it’s been a very good experience."
Freshman,4,I liked the challenging science curriculum they offered their STEM students. I also liked how small the school was and how the ratio of student to faculty staff was very well balanced because each student could have one on one time with their professor. I would like to see a change in the housing aspect of the college because some of the buildings are outdated and old and I feel that sometimes students get worried about the structure of the building.
Freshman,4,My experience at the university of South Carolina Aiken has been great. I have learned to be on my own as a young adult. I have met alot of different people and nice people. People from all parts of the world. It has taught me how to talk more. I have learned to open up to people. I also know how to deal with certain situations as a young lady. I am very independent. I have enhanced my drawing and painting skills from my professors. I have made a lot of new and fun friends by talking more to strangers.
Niche User,4,USCA is a great place to attend college if you would like to be in a small town with little distractions and friendly people.
Sophomore,4,"I first didn’t know anything about the University of South Carolina- Aiken. I just accepted the enrollment because I wanted to be away from home but now that I have experience of being a pacer I love it. The campus provides everything that can help improve the learning process of people like me that needs extra help such as tutors, writing lab, computer labs, etc. I wouldn’t change anything about USCA."
Senior,4,"I really appreciate the professors who are truly passionate about what they teach. Those are the professors who make a difference in student's lives. There is also a ton of leadership opportunities. Besides the horrid food, the campus is quaint and has a lot of heart."
Sophomore,4,"The University of South Carolina Aiken is an amazing college, although I have made a lot of mistakes in my college career the administration has always been very open and helpful. The BEST part about USCA is the fact that this campus is so small but still feels like a big university in a way. The class sizes are small but you get all the benefits of a massive university.

The support teams at USCA are always professional and do their best to help you resolve any issues that you have: Financial Aid Problems, Registration Problems, Housing Problems, and much more.

This college is accredited and offers a very wide array of majors to choose from that allows people from all walks of life to be able to attend to reach the career goals that they want.

Another good aspect of USCA is the security. Security is a top priority there and all students feel safe being on campus despite everything that has been going on in the news lately."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful and all of the academic buildings are within a reasonable walking distance. Student life provides many events for the students on campus but they are very disorganized. The athletic teams are good but this university does not have a football team. The school is extremely diverse with students of all ethnicities, nationalities, religions, and genders with a huge international community. The food is not very good but this is most colleges."
Sophomore,4,"Usc Aiken is a very good school. Despite the minor personal issues I’ve encountered with some of the faculty members, it’s overall great. You’ll revive a great education as all of the teachers there have their PhD’s, everyone’s willing to help when you need it, they provide LOTS of tutoring opportunities (for FREE), and so much more. With this school being in the small city of Aiken, it also gives great opportunity to venture out to places like the mall in Augusta (which is 30 minutes away) or to downtown Aiken, or maybe even Atlanta for the weekend (which is a little farther, but still somewhere fun to go)."
Freshman,4,So far my experience at USCA has been good. I have made a few friends and all of my professors have been super understanding when it comes to things such as my mental health and the way it hinders my performance on many things. I would like to see the number of extracurricular activities to change so there are more things to do while on campus. I would also like to see their intakes on those extracurricular's to change so that way they accept more people in.
Freshman,4,"The University of South Carolina - Aiken is one of the top Liberal Arts schools in the Southeast. USCA has many great programs of study and small class sizes to help you focus, grow, and connect with professors. This school was my first and last choice and I would not change anything about this school."
Freshman,4,I have overall enjoyed my first year here and will be returning next year. It is a great place to go if you want that one in one connection with you professor.
Junior,4,"USCA is a pretty great school, especially when you consider how small it is. We have fantastic business and nursing programs, though I myself am a biology major. If your major is offered here then you'll be in great standing with awesome faculty and a great opportunity to connect with your teachers and classmates in ways that you can't do at larger colleges.
I love USCA, though I can admit that because we're a branch campus sometimes we get financially overlooked in favor of the larger campuses...so some of our equipment and buildings are a little dated. We still have everything that I've ever needed, and I can't stress enough that if USCA has the program it's going to be just as great as anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"In general, USCA faculty, staff, and professors are very friendly. I love USCA, but the only thing I would like to see change is more varying options regarding future career paths. For example, I would like to pursue a pre-med track, but no one is knowledgeable about any furthering education options besides graduate school, so I have had to create a pre-med track on my own without guidance."
Sophomore,4,I like the campus and the teachers are very helpful and friendly. It's an overall calm place and it's easy to focus on your work.
Sophomore,4,"The University of South Carolina Aiken is a great, small, local school for students interested in an intimate education. Teachers are great when it comes to communication for classes, although all teachers are different! You will definitely not be disappointed!"
Sophomore,4,Housing is great. I would like too see more tutoring opportunities. The events are fun. The classes are alright.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at USCA has been amazing so far, I enjoy most of my professors and have had fun on campus. USCA has given me a chance to become the person I am today, as I have been attending this school I felt as those I have became a better person by interacting with different cultures and races of people. The campus is clean, family-orientated, and the student life is great. The student life is the best part about the campus because there is always something that is for everyone, which means that no matter what you enjoy or what your hobbies are there is something on campus that will fit you. The work load for most classes is average because the professors are considerate and do care about you and provide people with the best help they can give which I think makes the school even better.  The dorms and housing on campus are basically average but the dorms allow us to feel like we are on our own as we have our individual freedom and can express ourselves in our spaces."
Freshman,4,"I always knew I wanted to go here, there are some surprises that come with this school but what don't. I mostly decided to come here because of the great nursing program and it wasn't too far from home. The campus is pretty and a nice size."
Sophomore,4,The school itself has been a place where I have truly learned so much about myself and about what I'm gonna do with the rest of my life .
Freshman,4,"A few things I love about USCA is the campus. It's woodsy, but is small enough for you figure out where everything is. Another thing I love is the professors. They are always available to help and are always quick to respond. The downside is that due to the trees, and grass, the dorms sometime get the uninvited visitors of roaches and spiders."
Senior,4,I love that this college is small and in one area. I can walk to all of my classes within a 15 minute time period. I love the class sizes. The dorms are alright but far better than other dorms I have been exposed too.
Senior,4,"USC Aiken is a mixed bag of scenes. While it is not the most challenging school and has some issues with poor management and arguable student corruption, it's amazing professors and great connections coupled with  a hidden party scene makes  for an experience. Going  to USC Aiken will at the very least be a memorable experience. Although the classes aren't particularly challenging the, if you show aptitude in a subject the professors  will work with you as much as possible. Many of the professors have credentials that over qualify them for their positions and are artful in sharing their skill, knowledge, and connections,  with students. Aside from that, the campus facilities and such are average.  Athletics are inconsequential here unless you play women's basket ball, rugby, or ride horses. Worst of all is the  student life and government organizations, which are hated almost  universally and considered by many to be corrupt."
Junior,4,I like about USCA is that the professors are very caring and love to teach. Another thing I like about USCA is housing. At USCA dorms it feels like I'm at home. And something I would changes at USCA is to have more activities on campus on the weekends because mostly activities are during the week.
Senior,4,"This university provides a close knit environment, while providing many opportunities for students to become involved. The student-teacher ratio is comfortable, and also provides a way for students to build that relationship with their teacher in order to learn better. The faculty and staff is amazing and help students succeed in any way they can. However, I do believe some changes could be made. I believe that with the number of incoming students increasing, more faculty should be hired to make more class options available to students. This also evens out the number of classes teachers have to teach. The school should also look into providing more classroom space for these incoming students and classes. This way, they do not have to wait until later on in their college careers to take their basic classes, which helps their schedules out tremendously. I feel that the money the school spends should be spent on this and not frivolous things."
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at USC Aiken has been great. I haven't had any concerns or problems about the school since I first enrolled. Overall, the campus life and academics are great. The campus life of USc Aiken provides students with a variety of opportunities ranging from student clubs, student activities, ect. to on-campus jobs and academic help."
College Sophomore,4,This school is awsome for business and Nirsing students
College Sophomore,4,The school could use better tutoring services
College Sophomore,4,I am a cheerleader at my school. The level we're at isn't the best but we're also a small D2 school in the middle of nowhere so I guess it's to be expected.
College Freshman,4,My professors have been very helpful throughout the semester.
College Freshman,4,Students are very excited about supporting their team.
College Freshman,4,This school allows students to obtain their undergraduate degree without piling up student debt. Students are more able to get a start in life once they graduate without the burden of loans.
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy the University,  and I love learning. It's been a challenging experience in nursing school but in the end I'll come out ahead. The professors are passionate and love teaching. Most of them go above and beyond to make sure that we understand the teaching !  I couldn't pick a better school!"
College Junior,4,Class sizes are great!! Professors are great and willing to help if you want it or need it. I've only had two bad experiences with professors.
College Junior,4,This is a very nice school with very good reviews and I'm a student and I love it! They help you get prepared for the work force before you graduate so you are prepared.
College Junior,4,"Campus is very safe and there are emergency towers located around campus as well. It's very safe though, especially if you live in housing on campus"
College Junior,4,It's very nice compared to other colleges!
College Senior,4,our campus is very safe there's an officer on duty at all times and they can escort someone who may feel unsafe.
College Senior,4,"There is no greek housing available at our campus, but the greeks on our campus are more of the popular students."
College Sophomore,4,We have support centers and university police
College Sophomore,4,The people I lived with my freshman year were miserable and rude. Eight girls is too many to shove in one dorm.
College Sophomore,4,Nice facilities. I go to the gym a lot and they offer many fitness classes and personal trainers.
College Sophomore,4,There's not much to do in Aiken but the school is lovely.
College Freshman,4,I like this school since it is so close to home.
College Senior,4,"I would describe my college experiences as a life changing event. I came to college not knowing what to expect and I was a bit nervous. I would say that I have matured tremendously as living on my own I had to take on responsibilities  that I probably wouldn't have had to do had I stayed home with my parent.

My school has a lot of extra curricular activities to offer in which I am a part of Curls and AKA sorority."
College Sophomore,4,I have not heard of any assaults on campus. If you have night classes you can call security and they will walk you to and from classes.
Sophomore,2,My online experience was very hard because I didn't have no internet at my home so it was very hard to get my work done.
Senior,2,"Honestly I’ve had a really bad experience with this school. After my freshman year a lot of things started to get exposed about how this school handles incidents that goes against what this school stands for. This school capitalizes off of diversity. However, there have been many incidents where students have made insensitive racial comments and they were not punished for it. I have also been personally victimized. They also do not handle conflicts between students well. I have had some roommates that were really nasty to me and every time I tried to report it they never took me seriously and made me look like I was the problem. This school needs a lot of work done to make all there students feel comfortable and safe living on campus."
Freshman,2,"I love the small campus of USC Aiken. The academics are not what I'd expected. There are not very many athletic teams. Not a football team. Not many parties. The housing may look nice from the outside, but is pretty shitty inside. The food is mediocre. There is a Starbucks on campus, and a Zaxby's up the road."
Niche User,2,Totally a local school. Don’t come here from outside of SC. They literally roll up the sidewalks on Friday nights. Everyone goes home. And the campus is a ghost town until Monday morning. There are ZERO  activities on campus on weekends. If you don’t know anyone it’s a super lonely and isolating place.  Too bad they don’t take the 13%of students from outside of SC very seriously. My daughter is withdrawing and coming back to New Hampshire. If you are from here it’s probably fine. Don’t come here if you have no ties here.  It’s terrible. Also. Filthy forms with cock roaches galore. Total disappointment. None of the students we have spoken with understand why it wins awards.
College Sophomore,2,I have yet t beginning looking into internships and job prospects but from what I have heard from other students USCA is lacking in this area.
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of choice with Greek life.
College Freshman,2,"If you are transferring and in need of finanical aid, know all the details before it is time for regirstation. At times, certain peope had no idea what I was talking about regarding aid although at the end of the day, they certain patient and helpful once I got to the completed the entire process."
College Freshman,2,There really isn't too much to do in Aiken unless your 21.
College Freshman,2,"I am not happy at all with the program.  My never has anything nice, let alone positive things to say.  She should be there to uplift you when you need encouragement, not give you negative feedback.  If i had the chance to do it over again I wouldn't have choosen USCA.  I plan to get my BSN and then go back to school while I'm working to get my masters degree in Nursing Administration."
College Junior,2,After the ice storms campus was closed due to power outage and clinical was cancelled causing our class to be 2 clinicals behind; this is not easy to make up.
College Junior,2,"in terms of clubs there are not many to choose from, the nicer clubs are in downtown augusta. Transportation is more available in augusta as well than in aiken (for safe traveling)"
College Freshman,2,"There isn't many clubs or bars in Aiken, but I don't mind that. "
College Junior,2,I have had a problem with financial aid every year I've been at USCA.  They never seem to receive my files on time or they don't process them and make me redo all of the paper work.  It's extremely frustrating! 
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid services were helpful with answering questions, but at times it seemed as if they were a bit unrealiable with the information. It seemed as if I had to handle things on my own to get things done. "
College Sophomore,2,They don't give much help to undecided majors to find something to stick to.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I feel as if USCA's police force are very lenient. I have attended this college for over two years, and have never put my parking pass on my car. I have never been written a ticket because of this."
College Freshman,2,"This grade is acceptable and it's passing, but it's just not good enough. DON'T WASTE TIME. Be sure to give yourself ENOUGH time to study, it will surely pay off in the end. I had to learn the hard way. No one told me college was going to be hard nor easy, and honestly after my very first test at USC Aiken, I thought I had failed at life. It only made me push harder to pass the next test with at least a B. In college, time is of the essence...be sure to use it wisely."
College Freshman,2,"Personally, I hate dining on campus. I wouldn't have wasted money on a meal plan if it weren't required for individuals staying on campus. There are three dining areas on campus, The Station, The Market, and The SAC cafe. I mostly eat at The Station, however, it closes at 5 on weekdays and 2 on Fridays. At The Market, its just a small convience store that is VERY expensive so I only go there in extreme emergencies. The SAC cafe's food is not up to my taste, so I rarely go there and end up spending most of my earned money on food outside of campus."
College Freshman,2,"The nightlife on campus is very boring. In the town of Aiken, there's barely anything to do. As a student, if we want to have a good time; we have to travel miles away. Occasionally, we have frat parties. They tend to be the only fun that we have on campus."
College Senior,2,"I would give Aiken's night life a solid C.  If you know for sure you are a party person and like to do a lot during the night time, then this is not the school for you. During Thursday-Saturday downtown Aiken is usually a cool spot for students who are 21 and older, but as far as fun for 18 and older there are only the on-campus parties and or Frats/Sororities parties.  The best bet to really have fun on campus is to get out and get involved and make your own fun."
College Freshman,1,"The School of Business at USC Aiken isn't hard to get in, but when you are a freshman trying to register for classes, it gets hard when you are given basically a limit of 17 credits per semester(unless you want to pay for every hour you take a class if you have more than 17). They give a preference to upperclassmen and it gets hard to find classes to fit into a good schedule and get all of the required credits for a degree. If you're heading for the bachelor's degree, the first two years will consist of general education classes. Once you are a junior, then you begin the business classes."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't party. I have more sense than to party, while I have an education to worry about."
College Sophomore,1,There are not any transportation options other than having your own car or borrowing a friends car.
College Junior,1,"I think that the strictness of USCA is ridiculous. They have arrested one of my classmates for drinking orange juice from his roommates fridge and gave him a felony charge of theft. It was orange juice. I have also been ticketed for smoking in my car when that rule was stated nowhere. I have been ticketed for kissing my boyfriend on campus because that was considered indecent exposure. Last but not least, I was sentenced to probation of the school because I was yelling at a peer too loudly at the edge of the parking lot at 5 pm. Please realize at this time, no one was in class, nor were there any events. They are outrageous."
College Senior,1,"There is an extreme lack of public transportation in Aiken. There is not a bus system in place, only taxi's."
College Junior,1,Some Things Don't Pass – The police on campus always ticket people for speeding so don't speed.
College Junior,1,Can't Find a Park by My Room – You really have to fight for parking spot. After 6pm its hard to find a parking spot.
College Junior,1,The campus transportation consists of either walking or riding from an off campus site to parking lot.
College Sophomore,1,"Very Little To Do – If you're looking for a school with great night life, this is not the one! While there are many clubs and organizations, most are during the day and they don't usually have much stuff going on at night. The town has little to do, but as with any town, if you look hard enough,  you'll still be able to find SOMETHING- like bowling, movie theater, etc."
College Junior,1,There are only a few scholarships offered and unless you have a stellar gpa and are involved in every organization known to man don't hold your breath on getting one.
College Junior,1,"Going through the Financial Aid process ever year is a burden because I run into some sort of trouble every time. I recieve a decent amount, but the financial aid process is stressful."
College Sophomore,1,I just transferred here and recieved no financial aid this semester. My payment was due before I could get my financial aid done and processed.  I am in the process of completing all the information for next semester and it is ten times harder here than at my old school.
College Freshman,1,None Existant – No transport provided other than flyers of local cab services around campus.
College Freshman,1,"The University of South Carolina - Aiken is not a stellar school for public transportation.  The only realistic options are to live on campus and walk to school or to drive/carpool.  There are technically taxis, and possibly even a bus, but they're very unrealistic options."

Sophomore,5,It was an alright memory that I hope I can continue to embrace as time passes by as I continue through my journey in the school.
Sophomore,5,My world at College of Mount Saint Vincent has been great and I can't wait to have many more wonderful things with my peers at this school as the time goes by. I am super grateful for all of it .
Freshman,5,"During the COVID 19 pandemic we, students, had to take online courses from home, and I am proud to say that the College of Mount Saint Vincent did an excellent job with preparing students and teachers with the online formats and classes."
Freshman,5,"My experience at the College of Mount Saint Vincent was incredible! The thing I liked the most about the school is how of a close-knitted community it is, everyone is friends with everyone, also the staff and teachers are exceptional."
Sophomore,5,"Online learning was pretty good , Professors were understanding made the work easy to understand along with the finals"
Alum,5,"I was a Psychology major, Philosophy minor. All my professors, for both core and elective classes, were great, some more so than others. I really feel that I received the education I paid for and now I have a Bachelors's degree. A lot of diversity in the student body and the activities that were done by student life was always inviting. A lot of great experiences in and out of the classroom. Personally, I found the campus food to be great but there will be some who disagree. And the campus was always kept clean and in shape, no matter the season."
Junior,5,"Last year has been an amazing experience for nursing. The teachers are enlightening, they care about their students learning. I was nervous entering nursing school but, the teachers pave my way and I’m truly excited for next semester."
Sophomore,5,"I love how I feel safe, the dorming environment is great. I would love to see more clubs and more events"
Freshman,5,"Something that I liked was how nice everyone is and how helpful the teachers are. Also, the system in the school is really good because it makes everything much more easier for the students. And I think that even for the new freshman students they try to help them as much as possible and make the transition very easy for them. I think that this is very good because the transition between high school and college is be very challenging. Especially, for making new friends and finding those people that can understand you. My experience so far has been good because I have learned a lot about myself and i think it's really cool to find out about so many people that are interested in the same things that you are."
Freshman,5,"So far I've had a great experience at the College of Mount Saint Vincent. The school offers many different clubs and things to get involved in on campus. Campus is both commuter and resident friendly, making it easy to integrate into campus. I've been able to create a great relationship with the majority of my professors and feel like the majority of my questions have been answered. I'm very pleased with my college experience thus far."
Freshman,5,"College of Mount Saint Vincent is really good, the only thing that needs improvement would be the food."
Graduate Student,5,Lovely school. The campus is beautiful and the teachers really want you to succeed. Everyone works together very well
Freshman,5,"I like that the campus is beautiful and has a different feel to it. Professors are great as well. Getting around campus isn't hard. Commute can be better, but traveling from Queens, New York makes it about a 45 mins drive."
Freshman,5,The College of Mount Saint Vincent is a very comfortable and diverse setting for me it makes me feel right at home. Everyone on campus are always so helpful and generous!
Freshman,5,I love the different community service opportunities that they have as well as the small and beautiful campus. The professors were all very interesting and enjoyable.
Sophomore,5,Overall the campus itself is beautiful. All the professors are amazing. The only problem is that the financial aid office is disgusting. The worst people in that office that just sit around and laugh at students’ problems.
Alum,5,"I just graduated from CMSV last May and I miss It terribly. I am currently getting my masters at another college and It reminds me of how good I had It at CMSV. Everyone becomes very close in your classes, athletics and student activities. The college really stepped It up from my freshman year of 2013 until now. Also, the party scene is decent on Thursdays but after that you have to make your own plans. My friends and I took advantage of the city being right there and went every weekend. I would highly recommend this college if you want to go somewhere that has decent athletics, is small, has a campus but is also in the city."
Senior,5,Professors are great! They try to help you as much as they can and pursue you to continue with education.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a Finance Major. It has been  great. They are extremely supportive, especially with scholarships. They are most charitable and looks out for the less fortunate. Student activities makes every effort to ensure that students enjoy their stay here. I am also an athlete. The girls on my cross country team are amazing and supportive. I am motivated everytime I compete. Due to my circumstances, my college ensures that all my needs are met."
Freshman,5,"Mount Saint Vincent is one of the best colleges in the country, I highly recommend  anyone to join. At first I didn't think that it would be the right school for me with it being catholic and all but overall its a really good school. I am majoring into nursing. and what I like about it the most is that if you fail the first time you can try again, other colleges wouldn't be so generous. But all of your dream are welcome at the College of Mount Saint Vincent."
Freshman,5,"So far, the staff are very supportive and really care about all the students and take the time to really get to know you and just help you become a better person."
Freshman,5,"Very well organized, Prestigious , helpful college. Beautiful and very accepting.  Well conditioned and ran. Great professors. Many clubs. Variety. Very diverse."
Freshman,5,I am starting the accelerated nursing program at St. Vincent and am please to say that I have a high GPA. I work hard and am very determined to enter the workforce after an extensive education
Freshman,5,Everyone at the mount are so kind and cheery. They really make you feel at home and it truly is home for 4 years of your college experience
Sophomore,5,The College of Mount Saint Vincent is an excellent school. It's vast selection of majors and warm and friendly faculty make success possible.
Freshman,5,This school has the best staff and an even better environment! I definitely recommend CMSV to any new students.
Freshman,5,The College of Mount Saint Vincent is an amazing school. This is my second semester there and I still love it. I love the fact that this school is small. It really gives you a close family feel.
College Sophomore,5,They connect you to their connections.
College Sophomore,5,Professors are there for you and they make sure you learn the material.
College Junior,5,"Since I'm a science major, I am in love with the science building and the professors. They are honestly the best and actually care for me and my goals in life and try to make my life much easier when it comes to grades, assignments and management."
College Junior,5,"There is no type of sexual assault on campus. There aren't any issues with the law, nor with security. We'd use security for a ride up the hill so we don't get chased by raccoons"
College Junior,5,"Everyone on campus loves sports. We all participate in sport events and if theres space, in the sports teams itself."
College Freshman,5,facalty is very active and aware
College Sophomore,5,My Advanced Spanish class was the best yet most difficult class I ever took. I learned so much throughout my year of taking this course. I loved every second of it and I worked sooo hard for that class
College Sophomore,5,The school always lets you know about connections and our supportive alum community. So the professors are always kind enough to tell you when they think you have potential and want to work with you
College Sophomore,5,I feel extremely safe on campus and in the community
College Freshman,5,Students have a great career center to visit with many helpful advisors who guide you through almost every step of joint a career field that will match your major and what you enjoy
College Junior,5,The school is safe. Securities are everywhere and are ready to help.
College Freshman,5,"It has so many clubs for students to interact and also achieve new experiences and learning methods. The clubs aren't only for interacting but also for learning, and making learning fun. The teachers there are great! They are truly dedicated to their students and help in any way or form to make sure we understand what we're being taught. Every worker there is always ready to help guide us. My favorite experience so far was being able to spend a whole week on campus for the Trio program. This program is one of the best programs they have. It truly helped me have a better understanding of college and made me feel so welcomed."
College Freshman,5,I love the vibe from sporting events. Our main field looks over the Hudson River and it's just such a pretty sight to behold while cheering on your school.
College Freshman,5,The security is great and very helpful.
College Freshman,5,They practically throw money at you. Most of my peers don't pay a cent to go to this college.
College Junior,5,"Manhattan is a half hour train ride away. City life is beautiful, especially Christmas time."
College Junior,5,"Our school is diverse in the sense that we have a lot of ethnic backgrounds. The most popular would be Filipino, Hispanic, and African American. We have a very big diversity and also international students. Since we are founded by the Sisters of Charity we do somewhat hold a level of conservativeness with relation to Catholic beliefs.  "
College Junior,5,What I found that sets us from other schools is our proximity to the city and beautiful campus location. Our buildings are somewhat old and you can see the history on them. 
College Junior,5,"The one thing I love about our school is the proximity to Manhattan and other areas of New York. Riverdale itself has a lot of charm because of its wealth and kind of quiet atmosphere. We also have a spectacular view being right on the Hudson. I think our school's location is perfect, not too close to the city and definitely not too far. "
College Senior,5,"It is very strict. Many do not part take into usage, but if it is done, it is mostly smoking. Drinking is mostly done out side of campus."
College Freshman,5,The school is very diverse and open to different things.
College Sophomore,5,"The workload is as expected for the Nursing program. The school maintains high standards, as it should for any health care providers."
College Sophomore,5,I'm only familiar with the Nursing program and I highly recommend it. The standards are high and Mount Saint Vincent nurses are held in high regard.
College Freshman,5,For a communication major there are many classes that are open for you to take for this. Also there are many intership oppurtinites that are open to us.
College Sophomore,5,Crazy Nights – The city life offers students a diversity of things to do. The clubs are amazing and very diverse. There are theaters and pubs and restaurants that are open almost 24 hours.  Transportation can either be a taxii or a train or a bus. Very accesible.
College Sophomore,5,"College of Mount Saint Vincent, the name says it all. One of the great colleges. Faculty is very helpful, students are friendly and the dorm buildings are good place and the view is excellent."
College Freshman,5,CMSV is very generous with scholarships and financial aid.
College Freshman,5,There's a free shuttle to 1 train every 15 minutes.
College Sophomore,5,"Check Out Clique or Leather Lounges – Our school has a good number of hardworking club promoters. At the beginning of the semester, we had buses going from our school to some lounges, which makes nightlife a success at the College. Clique is located in Yonkers just north of the school and Leather Lounge is on 125th street in Manhattan. Since the city is so close, you have many options to choose from."
College Sophomore,5,"Check Out Manhatttan Which Is 25 to 30 Minutes Away from Campus – Being that the College is still in a city, you can still go to Manhattan and choose from a variety of restaurants. I can't really name them because there are too many.  The choice is up to you."
College Freshman,5,"Honestly, if you are not a nursing major, then this is not the school for you. This school is very competitive, nursing wise, and with good reason! The College of Mount Saint Vincent's Nursing graduates have one of the highest NCLEX passing rates in the state!"
College Freshman,5,Love it – I love CMSV.
College Freshman,5,The drug scene varies with the different groups of people.
Sophomore,4,i am new its my first semester. i like the school. it is a friendly and diverse community. there are a lot of activities to do on campus. the only thing is i wish the school was not so expensive.
Freshman,4,"The professors really tried to keep the class engaging and were understanding of poor internet or other computer problems. However, some classes just don't work as well online, for example, my science class."
Junior,4,"did not take online courses at this campus, however they did make a quick switch due to covid and seemed smooth"
Sophomore,4,What I like about mount Saint Vincent is how caring the professors are how they make the learning interesting along with understanding each student
Freshman,4,my experience so far is really good. I love the place is located at but it's just a little pricey and thats basically the only problem. I understand its a private school but yeah.
Sophomore,4,Such an amazing campus! Res life is super fun. Everyone there is very friendly and social. Lots of activities and clubs to join.
Senior,4,I am going into my final year at the college and all I can say is that it has been one heck of a ride. I have met some amazing people who have become my close friends and wonderful professors who have helped bring me out of my shell and provide me with wonderful career opportunities.
Senior,4,"If you're looking to attend a small school where the professor to student ratio is on average 1:6, this is the perfect school for you. I love CMSV. I have one more year until I graduate and it feels like time has flown. The professors are all amazing; most of them very mature in age and filled with so much wisdom. Even the food is good and is made by order. I've lived on campus since I was a freshman and have been a Resident Assistant for 2 plus years. It has created such an inclusive environment for me. You really find not only classmates and friends, but people you can call family when living amongst each other. This is not much of a party school which can get boring at times but it definitely gives you no other choice but to really focus on your studies."
Senior,4,"I like the nursing program of the College of Mount Saint Vincent, It is very efficient and they program prepares you will for the NXCLEX. I have met a nice quality of friends and study partners at this school, I don't ever feel alone and feel that there are professors who actually want to help students. I also love that the lecture halls are not huge and not 100's of students in one lecture hall makes It more educational for students."
Niche User,4,I applied Early Decision to Mount Saint Vincent. The application process was easy and they responded in a timely manner. They have the major I am intending to study and awarded me a very generous academic financial package. The campus itself is beautiful. The size of the classes are small so you will get to know your professors well. My only concern is freshman are tripled up and food choice options are limited since the campus population is very small (approx. 1600 students).
Sophomore,4,What I like about the college of Mount Saint Vincent is how small and connected everything is. It has an amazing view and the professors are very kind along with the students.
Sophomore,4,"I love the small class size of classes, and the extra help and encouragement provided by professors and other staff. The nice environment and a lot of academic resources provided."
Junior,4,"The College Of Mount Saint Vincent is a great school that offers a great education and a welcoming environment for incoming students. It is a small, yet beautiful campus and it is very easy to be fully integrated within it's community with all the clubs that are offered."
Junior,4,If you want to go to a small college this should be in your list. A small college provides more one on one Professor to student relationship. Another perk is being so close to the city but the campus environment seems like you’re in upstate NY with all the beautiful landscape and being right next to the Hudson River the sunset is always beautiful.
Freshman,4,"The Mount is a great school with a lot of potential. It has some flaws like only one dining hall with a limited amount of options, but the school tries hard to try and please every student. the professors go above and beyond for the students. with such a small class size it is easy for a teacher to really get to know a student instead of knowing them as a number in a massive lecture hall."
Junior,4,I personally like the school. I like the small class sizes because you get the opportunity to form a great bond with your professor and classmates.
Freshman,4,"Amazing environment! Love the teachers and majority of the student. A beautiful place, however the wifi sucks and it is unorganized."
Senior,4,"Very small campus, you will run into the same people almost every day. The nursing department is slowly getting better, but still has its flaws. A high acuity of students are nursing majors. The food is good, a bit pricey but reasonable. The workload can be heavy, depends on your professors, but most are understandable. not really a party school, so don't expect too much."
Freshman,4,"I personally like bigger schools however, the mount is an average school. They offer great academics here but the school is not worth paying over $40,000 per year."
Junior,4,"The College of Mount Saint Vincent is a very nice school with great people. This college helps you succeed with your academics, the professors are very enthusiastic to teach. One thing I would change about the college is the tuition money."
College Sophomore,4,not much going on with assault. Pretty safe.
College Sophomore,4,My stay at this high school was great. Met a lot of people and made a lot of connections. I would chose it again because the teachers can teach and prepared me well for college.
College Junior,4,"The career that I am pursuing isn't one that is very common on campus. I am study to become a Neurosurgeon and its hard to find anything with jobs or internships to study under a Surgeon, even more so a Neurologist. But I will say that in any other career choice, the school does its best to get involved in trying to find you a place at an internship or job that would fit your needs for your degree."
College Junior,4,"I adore being at the school I am in. Theres a lot to do for such a small school. The clubs are amazing and organized, the sports teams are great and look like a lot of fun, the student body itself is amazing. Everyone here , including the professors, are amazing and actually try and help each other achieve their life goals."
College Senior,4,Love my professors accept for a hand few. Course styles and topics do vary when students ask for a variety. More available times and online courses should be offered. Class size is very small and effective.
College Senior,4,Generally feel safe on campus. It is very open but I have never had a issue on campus that made me feel unsafe or if I was in danger. Security guards could be a bit more friendly with the students and should be more willing to give escorts.
College Senior,4,Campus housing isn't too bad depending on the building you are living in. Facilities usually takes forever and a day when asked to fix something in a student's room. Social atmosphere is comfortable and inviting. All buildings are close to one another so it is very convenient when going to class or other educational/social buildings.
College Senior,4,"Sports teams are very popular on campus. The students are full of ""dolphin pride"". The attendance for games are usually over 30/40 which is good since we are a very small school. I would love for them to be involved in the student affairs activities and doing more with the athletes. Coaches and team members could be better as well."
College Senior,4,"Love the professors, job opportunities on campus, extra-curricular activities and the students. The College of Mount Saint Vincent is a very comfortable, family-like community. If I could I would definitely redo my years here. I learned a lot in and outside of the classroom. I've also attained tangible skills that I will use in my field of study and daily."
College Sophomore,4,the teams are good and a lot of school spirit.
College Sophomore,4,I have learned a lot the teachers are approachable and my classmates are nice.
College Sophomore,4,The buildings are convientely located around the class buildings so it's easy to get around deposits the bad weather and travel commutes. Living on campus is great
College Sophomore,4,The athletes are really nice and just normal people like everyone else. You just have to be yourself and put yourself out there
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school. So much that I need to get 2,000 to be able to continue attending the school. I'll do anything to continue my education there . Extracurricular activities are great and the mount community is growin bigger and it makes me so happy"
College Junior,4,"I have never visited the oxley center for myself, but I heard they are willing to help you with your resume and help find an internship best for you. As far as recruiters, I have not heard of any coming to campus. The college keeps in touch with their alum mostly to come back to give a speech or to ask for donations."
College Junior,4,Campus is really quiet and there are no reports of anything bad happening. Security is always driving back and forth on campus. It is a little sketch because just about anyone can walk onto the campus without being questioned.
College Junior,4,The athletes at the mount are treated as if they're celebrities.
College Freshman,4,"Professors seem to be great, they enjoy what they do and help student to understand almost everything to the core"
College Freshman,4,There security everywhere on campus to make sure the safety of the students is first
College Freshman,4,"The campus is nice, the Dorms Are Cozy, a great environment to study"
College Freshman,4,Enjoy my engaged classes the environment is great and there is a lot of motivation and push by facilities to succeed
College Junior,4,Professors are very helpful and want thier students to succed. The professors know thier material.
College Junior,4,Dorms are cozy. The staff and students are friendly.
College Junior,4,"The school is small and surrounded with friendly faces. The staff are always helpful and care about thier students. The only bad thing is that there are lots of hills and requires a lot of walking. Utimately, it ios one of the best colleges in the Bronx."
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is great, but it depends on the building. Mastro is nice because the rooms are big, however, genders are separated by floors in this building (only 1 male floor and 3 female) and ONLY MASTRO is run by central air/ heat with a box in your room to adjust it, meaning once they shut off the air the first week in September you cannot adjust the AC anymore and it get's HOT in the rooms for about a month, especially if you're on the top floors. Then, in May they say they'll turn the air on but it takes about a week for it to switch from heat to air (the heat and air can't be run together, so if there is heat it's staying that way for a while and if you want AC you have to wait 5 days for it to switch over) so you are usually sweating during finals week. However, all the other buildings are gender separated by wings and they have their own personal AC/ heat unit in the window. Rooms are nice size, RAs are friendly, and floor-mates are close."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the Mount! I think it's a great school with a lot to offer! The school is small so you get to make a lot of friends easily and you don't feel lost. Also you're teachers get to know you very well and try to help you succeed as much as they can. We're also a quick train ride away from Manhattan, which I love!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"The professors are great, but it's still very expensive. heavy workload as a biology major but worth it in the end"
College Sophomore,4,"small class sizes, friendly, beautiful campus, fun"
College Freshman,4,All of the administrator's and security take their jobs seriously.
College Freshman,4,"Since I am a biology major, I am planning on applying medical school and taking the MCAT."
College Freshman,4,I love my school and I love to live in the city.
College Freshman,4,I myself play for the Men's soccer team at CMSV. I love the sport and I love the guys that I play with.
College Freshman,4,I love everything about this school. I enjoy living in New York City.
College Sophomore,4,"Since the school is in a small town, most people around the area know the school so you would have made some connections if you volunteer or have a part time job."
College Sophomore,4,"The athletics offer basketball, soccer, softball, baseball, swimming, wrestling, and lacrosse. Most students on campus support the basketball team and the soccer team. We just opened up a field last year so that we can have home games."
College Sophomore,4,"After committing to a school I had never heard of and thought I would hate, I feel in love with the people, the teachers, the location, and the science department."
College Freshman,4,School spirit is great and some athletics coaches are not the best
College Freshman,4,"The people are very welcoming, the teachers are very helpful, the campus is beautiful."
College Freshman,4,Good school everyones really welcoming
College Sophomore,4,The people are amazing. The staff really helps when needed. They look out for everyone.
Freshman,2,"If you go here, you will be making the worst mistake of your life. This college is just a big joke from their non existent financial aid to half of the trash teachers they hire. You will be teaching yourself the material at this college I guarantee you that. From your first year here you will see just how unbearable the campus is from the type of people they allow in the college. There's is no competition to get into this college and it shows everyday you wake up here. Not to mention at the mice problem they have at school. Its a issue when u go under your bed to find mice have been playing in your shoes. The hot water in most of the buildings don't work except for Alumni Hall. This school is a joke and you will be a bigger one if you go here."
Freshman,2,"Ayo this place ain't it chief. The school is super unorganized and a total mess, Food is wack like a 3 pc chicken tender basket is 12 dollars like what. Bruh living there is a literal hell, They be wildin in the halls until 3 am every damn night and they break everything in that building. The sports team is so disorganized both of my coaches got fired in a month span so we no longer got the programs, Wack."
Freshman,2,"Teachers were excellent and mostly cared about students and their education. I spent only one semester here however, because the school was too expensive for me. Small school and campus. There were many sanitary issues in my dorm building (spellman) such as rats and roaches. The cafeteria food was either gross or ok."
College Sophomore,2,we don't have a Greek life there are no fraternities or sororities.
College Junior,2,"Nobody seems to know what they are doing. Nothing is consistent. One day one administrator tells you one thing, and the next day a professor tells you something different. You waste a alot of time and money trying to figure out what classes you truly need to take, and when you do find out, it's too late to register. I seriously am so unhappy with my decision to come here."
College Sophomore,2,there are not really that much options of off-campus dining
College Senior,2,The college does not have off-campus housing at the moment.
College Senior,2,There is no party scene on the campus.
College Freshman,2,They ruin any fun and are way to strict. Feels like im back in high school sometimes
College Freshman,2,The best it gets is a dorm that has a good amount of people in it. No frats or big sports parties or even after parties. If you want to party you have to find one on your own.
College Junior,2,I have applied for so many scholarships and I am having a hard time finding money for the school but I love the school so I try my best.
College Junior,2,I have no idea about any Greek life at my school to be honest.
College Junior,2,Drugs and alcohol on campus has been increasing very semester.
College Sophomore,2,"The computer labs are alright, they so can do better with advance equipment. The classrooms really don't have much technology in there besides a projector and a laptop the professor has, that's really it. Wireless internet always has so type of problem on campus and it's so slow! My high school was better equipped with advanced technology and WAY WAY better than this college. At orientation they make it seem like the top notch, but it's all fake."
College Sophomore,2,"I think that the school is all for favoritism and just a whole bunch of politics. They got so many scholarships for only a certain group of people. They have like Seton scholar for people who went to Catholic schools which is free rooming, some Filipino scholarship that basically gives them a full ride. And then you have your basic merit scholarship which is like nothing compared to the other scholarships they have at the college. Financial Aid is the worst they never try to give you something."
College Junior,2,There is some school spirit not too much it could definitely be something that should be improved. maybe the school would be a little more fun and interesting if there was more school spirit
College Junior,2,"I am honestly not every fond of forming due to the people. It's okay but it definitely could be better, I much rather travel back and forth home but due to class schedule being most at night it's not possible also practice are at night"
College Junior,2,When there is a snow storm or rain storm the power does go out many times.
College Junior,2,"Not enough options and the options that are available are a little costly, especially for a college student that doesn't have enough income coming their way"
College Freshman,2,We're a D3 school and we aren't ranked high at all.
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of variety at all. Sometimes the food isn't even fresh I've had stomach aches from eating food in the cafeteria too many times.
College Freshman,2,The shuttle doesn't run on the weekends and i feel it should have more stops.
College Freshman,2,Barely anything in walking distance. There's an abundance of pizza shops and Chinese restaurants. Not much of a variety.
College Freshman,2,We need more computers available to us.
College Freshman,2,I personally feel it can be more diverse.
College Freshman,2,registering is the worse process ever
College Freshman,2,pretty dead and dorm gatherings end early
College Freshman,2,If I had the choice I would live on campus.. It not worth the time and struggle.
College Junior,2,I don't know many people or have even heard of being able to have off-campus housing so I really can't say much on it. 
College Freshman,2,what i can tell you is do it as early as possible because if you don't you will not get that much money and you will go through so much trouble like i did.
College Sophomore,2,Very Expensive Apartments – New York has a very expensive living cost and minmum wage is at $7.50. Its hard to find a p[alce to live especially if you move in out of state and do not know any one. Hard to find responsile roommates.
College Freshman,2,"Somewhat Secure – The college has 24 hour security. However, some people who do not attend the school do sneak on campus and the dormitories."
College Freshman,2,The campus does not provide enough transportation whatsoever. I find it ridiculous how the shuttle does not operate during the weekends.
College Freshman,2,Shuttle Vans – They come every half an hour.
College Sophomore,2,"Rainy Days – Rainy days are horrible-there are puddles and potholes everywhere, and there isn't enough tools used to drain the rain out properly, such as catch basins."
College Sophomore,2,"Making Visitors Park in a Far Area – There is parking available for visitors all the way at the top of the school on the highest hill. When visitors come, regardless of where they are going, they may have to walk up two big hills to get back to their car."
College Sophomore,2,Could Be Better – The athletic facilities can be much better. The school primarily focuses on basketball. The tennis courts are gone. The gyms are not great. The student center (Alumni Pavilion) is really nice. There has been an increase in campus activities.
College Freshman,2,"I've seen better dorms, but the one I live in is pretty big, which is one of the only good things. Elevators are always broken though, laundry machines are broken sometimes, and the bathrooms are really disgusting when they're not cleaned."
College Freshman,2,"My Night Life – My nightlife is okay. I'm not a big party person unless it's really close on campus. But, it's okay. I enjoy it."
College Freshman,2,Parking on campus is horrible. You are ticketed and fined for being in the wrong parking lots. The only parking lot for commuters is at the top of campus.
Sophomore,1,"Come to this school if you want to be milked for all your money and treated like you're trash. When the pandemic happened they refused to refund residential students the outrageous amount of money that they paid, which wasn't used because school moved online. While Covid-19 cases are rising, the school remains open. Why? Once again you realize that all they care about is the money they milk out of students who are forced to come to campus everyday. It's simple, we make them money by coming to campus, so they force us here regardless of the risk it poses to thousands of lives. This is 100% NOT a Catholic institution, but instead a greedy, cruel, money hungry business."
Sophomore,1,They just don't care. Don't waste your time. They were very inconsiderate during the transmission to online courses.
Sophomore,1,the college of mount saint vincent is not currently doing any online classes. All the classes here are in person learning. this school has good protocol when it comes to the whole corona virus.
Freshman,1,I haven't taken online classes.  But I suppose they might be a good and nice transition. Thank you for reADING
Freshman,1,"I have been trying to get into contact with the staff at this college and it has been a wild-goose chase trying to get somebody to listen. When somebody does listen, they send me to another department in order to get the information that I have been asking for. Being an out-of-state student has been particularly  more difficult because they do not inform us of the opportunities we can take to quarantine on their campus and or other resources that can be helpful. Nobody picks up the phone, everything gets sent to voicemail. This has left me TIRED. Was told today that we would get emails regarding our roommates and nothing, as expected. This college is unorganized and doesn't make its' students a priority. My admission counselor doesn't return phone calls and leaves for vacation after I send her an email... THEY DON'T CARE."
Freshman,1,"This school is completely unorganized when it comes to dealing with issues. The staff is rude and doesn't care about stuff. The financial aid department is an absolute joke. They take days to respond back to your emails and they don't even address the issue at hand. It's more on the money-hungry side. There are a handful of good professors. Freshman dorms always got people blasting music or being loud in the halls. Girls' bathrooms are dirty. To add some razzle-dazzle, this school got mice running around everywhere. Spellman dorm always got stink bugs popping up. The food is alright a little pricey, some things will give you bubble guts. The school got clubs. Don’t let the scholarship foul you, they may be charging you extra then what you're supposed to pay for. Unless you have no other school in mind then this place is for you!"
Alum,1,"I was bullied at this college by students, faculty and staff alike. The bullying consisted of name-calling, spreading rumors/gossip and overall disrespectful behavior towards me. I tried speaking up but it didn't work since EVERYONE on campus was involved. I had a full ride scholarship at CMSV and due to financial difficulties I wasn't able to transfer. Hence, I endured the bullying in silence even though it was taking a toll on my mental health and academics. This college is not the place to be. There are no good people at CMSV. It is the worst college ever!"
Freshman,1,"My experience with this school was horrible. Everything is negative. Unlike other Catholic Universities, the Campus Ministry is poor.  During the summer of going into my freshman year, the administration was slow at responding to requests, which was a major turn off."
Niche User,1,"College of Mount Saint Vincent is the worst!!! Before you go there, the staff is amazing and accommodating but after you attend, they’re terrible! They won’t speak to parents even though you’re the one paying the bill. The teachers are a hit or miss. There are mice/rats in the dorm rooms! My son found a dead one in his dorm room. Three people to a room is uncomfortable. There is only one dining room which serves the same boring food and the sports programs were also not good. It’s supposed to be a Catholic college, but the coaches curse the kids out and humiliate them.  There is nothing to do on the weekdays or weekends!!! Worst school ever!!!!"
Freshman,1,"Worst school ever. Transfer rate after the first year is very high. Food gets VERY old as there is only ONE VERY SMALL eating option on campus, which takes VERY long to make your food. Kids on campus who attend are very weird and seem to only care about sleeping and smoking weed. Due to how dead the campus is, there is an emphasis on going home every weekend. It is a big suitcase school and tends to be a dead ghost town on Friday-sundays. Campus safety is a joke, as random people sleep over everyday without being overnighted. Academically, the school is a joke. I learned nothing, everyone cheated, very easy to get an A. The professors don't have high resumes. A degree from here isn't any better than a degree from a community college as this college isnt highly regarded whatsoever. The athletics are a JOKE. Every team sucks and the athletics department is so stupid and incompetent. Every team gets new coaches every year. The teams are extremely volatile as many players quit midseason."
Sophomore,1,"This college is not worth the money. It has a beautiful small campus.  Other than that, the student life is little to none. There are no fraternities, no soroities. The classes are extremely boring and disengaging. This feels like a high school or a community college than a private university. The dorms can be disgusting, there are plenty of mice and rats. The party scene is crappy especially if you don't choose to go out on Thursdays. I will say the local area to the south of CMSV is very safe. To the north it can be dangerous in Yonkers. CMSV is on the border."
Freshman,1,"Currently I am a freshman looking to transfer. I moved here in August, and the school is disgusting. The facilities are old and dingy. The classrooms wreak of sweat and the professors are OKAY. I Don't feel like I'm coming here for higher education, more like high school PART 2. I feel that I made a horrible decision. Please do not come here unless you have an EXCELLENT financial aid pkge and you've looked at ALL your options. There is WEED, DRINKING, AND DIRTY MOUSES in the dorms. DO NOT LET YOUR PARENTS INVEST THERE MONEY HERE. PLEASE!"
College Senior,1,"The school does not promote greek life and they do not allow the students to even consider starting up a greek life. Most of the time, students are quickly shut down when they ask faculty and executive board members to implement sororities and fraternities."
College Freshman,1,"We don't have a greek system, which is very sad. I've always wanted tot pledge to a sorority."
College Sophomore,1,"I only say it's the worst because of the stupid nursing department. In the past, I have heard great things about the staff and the department chair and the college was great. The department chair is rude, unprofessional, hypocritical, unorganized, and above all inhumane! The department chair lady has  guy that looks like a 80's gym instructor and always in other people's business. What kicks me off is they have a sign on their door stating, ""There is no such thing as a quick questions"" WHAT!!!"
College Junior,1,"There is no Greek life in campus , there should be but it's a catholic school"
College Freshman,1,This school is very boring and is not really unique.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life and I think it would make the campus so much better since it's pretty boring.
College Freshman,1,Wish we had greek life I would pledge
College Freshman,1,Too many parties occur and some people are just out of control.

Freshman,5,"Due to the pandemic, everyone had to transition to online classrooms and I can honestly say the transition at Peirce College has been amazing! The UI is simple, easy to navigate and just overall not a daunting task."
Freshman,5,It's been a very pleasant experience so far. The Staff has been extremely communicative and involved. I received a ton of help with getting the necessary information to setup my classes and taking advantage of amenities offered to me. The professors have also been great as well and the best part of it all is the ease of use with the online Canvas tool since distance learning is the norm right now.
Senior,5,"What I like about Peirce the most is all of the support you receive. If you cannot find the person you are looking for, or if it seems like you need support someone will direct you to the correct resource. In addition, there are lots of resources to help the transition from student to career."
Senior,5,"The canvas powered by Peirce is easily accessible. Each time an assignment is submitted, there is a congratulatory flash with falling trophies, stars, confetti, or balloons. Zoom meetings are encouraged and held while recorded ones are kept on file for students who may not be able to actively attend. When assistance is needed, staff is usually quite fast in responding to emails and requests. Paying tuition and purchasing books as well as accessing tutoring or coaching is quite easy."
Junior,5,"Love this institution of learning as it allows you to go attend 100% online, going onto campus or both.  The flexibility is great for adult learners, such as myself who have family and full-time jobs that must attend during the day."
Junior,5,"The system created for online learning is simplistic in nature.  The system allows the learner to determine their schedule; however, standard submissions, test, and quizzes are required at a certain timeframe.  In addition, the professors do a great job of keeping the students engaged."
Junior,5,My classes were both online and in class. The online courses are very easy. The professors make sure you have everything you need and they are always available for any help needed

Sophomore,5,I love the online learning options. If you are working and also going to school Peirce is the most flexible with schedules.
Junior,5,"I love the fact that Peirce college courses are flexible for the average working person and parents. This is major because a lot of people do not succeed because some schools do not offer such flexibility. Even though the classes are 7 weeks, they aren't excelerated and are very well manageable."
Junior,5,My online experience is great. My teachers are prompt with their responses. My syllabuses are very easy to follow and so is navagating my way around the website.
Junior,5,The professors are available for questions. When I lost my grandmother last year they showed sympathy and reached out to me. The presentation on how to take online classes in Canvas  helped me tremendously.  It walked through how to read everything and find the assignments and easily to adapt.
Junior,5,"I receive emails daily about what’s happening at the campus, event invites and scholarships. It’s great to know because someone’s due to my job I can’t always go on the school site to see everything. Also it’s nice to receive invitations to things that are along with my degree or an opportunity at a different job."
Freshman,5,"Amazing!!! They assisted me every step of the way as well as encouraged me! I would highly recommend Peirce College to my friends and family. Even with the scare of COVID-19, they have reached out and checked to see how everything was going with me!"
Sophomore,5,"The campus is small and quiet, accommodates adults who work full-time. Campus engagement is not mandatory (which is a plus for FT workers!) The tuition is affordable and you have the choice to alternate between in-class lectures and offline."

Junior,5,I love Peirce College! One thing that I would like to see is consistency in advising and that every student is the same.
Junior,5,"They look at you as the person you are, not the number you are on papers that are printed on a computer screen.  The staff is knowledgeable,  and the diversity of the campus is the best in Philadelphia for sure.  I will be graduating next year and looking forward to the pomp and circumstance for sure."
Freshman,5,Peirce is a great college. I wouldn’t Change anything. The staff and professors are friendly. The atmosphere and environment is amazing. I’m glad I chose Peirce College as my school of choice. The Walker Center is amazing. Tutors are never rushing or upset when you need extra help with things.

Freshman,5,"The best college experience that I have ever had, so far. Both professionally and educationally beneficial. Great staff; helpful and concerning. Great professors, as well. The work is both challenging and easy-going."
Freshman,5,"I am a transfer student, starting class May 18th 2019, at Peirce College. I’ve been on campus and I’ve took a tour and so far everything looks amazing. The faculty is full of great people and the building itself is soo calm and relax. The administration and finance department does they best to help a student get enrolled and squared away for classes, by keeping us updated with current information. I think I’m going to love it."
Senior,5,"I love Peirce College to the point that my daughters also attend here. It has flexible attendance where you can either attend online or on campus at the same time, it is up to you."
Senior,5,"I love Peirce College, this is a place that the teachers, advisors, alumni, faculty in general want to see you succeed. It was real flexible for me because I have kids and I was able to balance my personal life and school like with the PeirceFit program. I never been to a school where you can attend online or in class at the same. This place is great."
Junior,5,I love the fact that you can have flexible scheduling with your classes.  I can either attend on campus as well as online.  This works best especially for people who work a full time job and also want to maintain a full time college workload. The professors are great and the atmosphere is wonderful!
Senior,5,Peirce is an excellent option for adult students. The flexible allows you to work and still attend classes full or part time. The assistance provided by Professors is  amazing.
Freshman,5,"Since I’ve enrolled, I completed my first semester with a 4.0 GPA. From the admissions staff to the advisors and professors, Peirce truly is an institution for adult learners. I look forward to the challenge in the upcoming semesters."
Freshman,5,"What  I love about Peirce is the family atmosphere on campus.  Everyone is met with warm welcomes
From Staff and faculty.  To be honest  I have nothing  I dislike about the school .  Peirce lives up to their reputation in my eyes . I love Pierce College ."

The staff really work together and they make you feel like part of a big educational family. They give you detailed information about everything that you plan to do at the school. Online learning i the best teachers communicate with you on a daily basis. Never once did i call or come in to the school and did not receive the help i required. I would recommend that if its your first time going to school then you should go to a small university that can give you the desired help you need to succeed in class.
College Junior,5,I love my school Peirce college because when im there i don't feel like a stranger. I feel loved im gald i can go to any teacher and ask for help and advice on my classes.

College Junior,5,"The weather rarely gets bad, It has very little effect on myself. I am very determined to go to school in any kind of weather even if its a tornado. My education means a lot to me"
College Junior,5,"There is a local subway near by and plenty of buses to take to get from school to home.  the cost of transportation is 2.25 which is not very bad, There is really no need for a car but many students prefer to take a car because its more quick to get from school to work and home"

Junior,4,The teacher are very willing to help you in the course and finicial aid process. I am good in writing papers but the teachers and tutoring center is so willing to help you. The colllege has made it easier on student to attend classes by having all classes online and on campus
Senior,4,"I am a adult learner returning to school.  It has been a great experience to attend Peirce College. The professors are great and very patient.  Also the classes are a nice size, nothing overwhelming.  Peirce College offers great tutorial assassistance if needed."
Junior,4,"Some good and bad professors. Same with your advisors. Can go to school online, on campus, or a combination of both."
Freshman,4,Peirce College is great overall with one issue for me. Peirce staff doesn't delegate when you no longer have an advisor ahead of time and they need to make advisors more available to students when needed via email. Outside of those things the school is great and I have learned and overcame so much attending this college due to the flexibility of FIT!
Junior,4,"The software associated with some of the course is not good, like Test out.  Although Peirce does offer online chat with some departments, it would be better if they offered online chat for student financial services.  It takes a little bit of time for financial aid to be applied to your account making it difficult for students to know what their exact balance is for any given semester.  The staff seems very friendly and helpful, admissions was fairly smooth.  And paying hundreds of dollars for books and then only getting 3% of the sell back price is TERRIBLE!"
College Freshman,4,From the time I walked into Peirce I was welcomed and felt very comfortable. By the time  I left I had a full idea of what my school offers and how they will help me thorughtout the entire  way.
College Junior,4,"security will walk you to your car if needed, security is good"

Recent Alumnus,4,I feel secure on campus
College Senior,4,Peirce College is for working adults and they really do help you when you need it.  They give help online as well.

Not everyone is willing to go above and beyond for their students and I had professors who seem to care about us as a hole and I enjoy taking classes there.

College Freshman,4,I have dated anyone on campus but there are plenty of options for junior and senior students.

College Freshman,4,I love the pricing of the food at the University of the Arts cafeteria. It is affordable and the food is delicious. You can purchase a lunch for under $6.
College Sophomore,4,If you want to learn then you will but you only get out as much as you give in
College Sophomore,4,its some what near the Lakewood town center so there are a few choices. Panera is my most favorite. There are other ones though too also the Lakewood town center is less then 15 min drive

College Junior,4,There is accessibility to everything that you need near my collegel.

College Student,4,I buy a transpass every week because I have a full-time job and a busy family life.  Public transportation is definitely a major necessity in my life right now.
College Senior,4,"I can get away with some things, but things that matter I can't get away with. For example, attendance is strict, but wearing flip flops is okay."
College Senior,4,"I haven't been to too many restaurants around my college, but the ones I went to was really good. No student discount though."

College Senior,4,I'm enrolled in the Business Management Department and I'm very satisfied with the workload and the curriculum. Each professor I've encountered has had very unique and distinct teaching styles. This keeps the class work interesting and cutting edge.
College Junior,4,"I was part of a new program called Health Information Technology, so as of today I have not experienced any practical experience in my field. I received a virtual view of a medical records department, which was nice but does nothing when you are looking for experience on your resume. Yes I do have concerns finding an internship or volunteer work because all summer I have been looking and also waiting for responses back to be a part of an organization. As I begin working on my bachelor's degree in HIA my hope is to  still find an internship/volunteer to experience my major in the real world."
College Junior,4,I attend evening classes which are mainly working adults.  The guys are either married or in a relationship. The women are working women or either single or married.  Most adults are A students because they study and work together to achieve for the highest grade.
College Senior,4,It was really difficult at first because i was working. But i have over camed it and im ready to receive my degree
Freshman,2,"Great when you first enroll then no support, rude teachers, and classes that have nothing to do with your degree."
College Freshman,2,My Collge does not have Athletics  attached to our school.
College Senior,2,A majority of the jobs pushed at school are only nursing opportunities or military jobs. There are not a majority of jobs offered for each of the individual majors.
College Junior,2,School is an adult learning school.  It does not support sports.
College Senior,2,"There is no dining options on campus since it is a small private college. However, there is many places outside and very close to campus to dine. "
College Junior,2,"Philadelphia is a high crime area and the parking is virtually impossible and extremely expensive.  I am taking on-line classes, however, so none of these issues affect me or a lot of Peirce's students, as they are also online."
College Junior,2,They do not offer a lot of majors - so you need to make sure that they have what you are looking for.
College Junior,2,My college dosen't offer on campus housing. everyone who attends peirce is a commuter. peirce is still a great sschool that offers a comfortable learnng environment.
College Junior,2,"I received a good amount of financial aid, but being a single mother of three children, working full time and trying to obtain a degree to provide a better living for my family, makes be believe that there should be more scholarships advertised in the financial aid department to help everyone with their educational financial burden."
College Senior,2,"Average Technology – The computers at Peirce are available in the library, but have limited capabilities. Those wanting to use their own computers in the computer lab may be disappointed with access to the network, and will not be able to print materials easily."
College Junior,2,"At this school it does not seem to matter, but I would like if we had a strong greek life hear"
College Junior,2,there are none at this college. This college is consider a career school.
College Junior,2,Drug Scene at Pierce – While there is no one openly using on the campus it is definately there behind the scenes.  At the quad area in front of the library I think it is probably the most frequent conversation overheard.  Students talk about using in the parking lots.
College Freshman,1,"We do not have any Athletics at my school , but we do have plenty of clubs"
College Sophomore,1,"There are no sports in this school, although we need a gym."
College Junior,1,"My financial aid was constantly a hassle, I am a single  mother that is 20 years old and I am currently receiving welfare benefits. I am trying to stay in school to earn my degree, however my financial situation is causing me to have little classes and very difficult to stay in college. My school does not help with scholarships now and or other alternatives to pay for classes I am really struggling to succeed with very little help."
College Junior,1,"There is no uniqueness about my school except that the professors are less involved with their students than other colleges, however it is a small college where you wont feel overcrowded with people and have room to think during tests"
College Junior,1,"Off campus dining only provides salad bars and a small pizza restaurant near by, there is a small amount of options of variety in that area unless you walk far from school to the local mall. However If a student decides to take that route they may be late for class so it is best to either bring your lunch or wait till class is over to eat a delectable meal."
College Junior,1,"I receive no help and school, the workload is a lot , There are no internships or job opportunities. My major is surrounded by business such as accounting, English and business ethics. The course talks merely about certain ethics you must have in order to start a business."
College Junior,1,"At my school there is only business and law offer for courses, The professors do not teach well and the offer no extra help. The workload  that they give you is overbearing but  students are left on their own to learn. the registration process Is fairly easy they will offer you a lot of scholarships to real you in"
College Junior,1,"There is a mall parking lot and have little parking, if the whole parking lot is filled I would have to park at a local store and hope that my car is toweled"
College Junior,1,"Parking if Phila is the worst - you can never find a spot, almost always end up with a very expensive ticket, and the cost is astronomical."
College Senior,1,"The drug scene at Pierce College Woodland His is strangely unnoticeable. Prior to being a college student, I was exposed to many negative rumors about what college life is like. I would hear comments such as, ""All the girls in College are sexually active and love to party and do drugs"" or ""College is crazy because everyone is on drugs and there are college parties almost 5 days a week."" However, now that I am currently a full time student at pierce college, attending 5 days a week, I have had the opportunity to evaluate whether these rumors are true or false. Throughout my 3 years of attending Pierce College, I can argue that the drug scene at pierce college is unnoticeable; I have never personally witnessed nor heard from colleagues about students involved with drugs at pierce college."
College Sophomore,1,"Teachers are apathetic, generally speaking. The sense of pride in their academia seems to be lacking. There are classes that are relatively futile in terms of transfer ability to four year programs. The courses are rarely challenging, however do wet the mind just enough to soak up the concepts of the specific subject matter."
College Senior,1,"I received a fair amount of financial aid, but recently I've been experiencing some issues. I've recently realized that it's very important to keep my own financial records of my financial aid. My awarded scholarship and employer discount wasn't applied to a few semesters, until I notified the financial aid department. The financial aid department at my school is currently in the process of reviewing some missing loan funds that was disbursed from my loan company, but wasn't applied to my school account."
College Senior,1,"I find it difficult to obtain financial aid at my school.  To date, I have not received any financial aid other than student loans through the state.  I now have 12 credits left (3 classes) to complete my degree and am unable to obtain any more state loans.  My contact with the financial aid office has been a difficult process in try to help me locate options.  This is the ONLY problem I've ever encountered with the school."

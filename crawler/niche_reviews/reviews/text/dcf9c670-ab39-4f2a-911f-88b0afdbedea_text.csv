Freshman,5,"I love the environment of the campus. Just being there is very inviting, and I feel safe. I personally feel like God drew me into this school for a reason because I’ve learned so many valuable things not only about my degree, but as well as about my life. Definitely worth coming here. It feels like home."
Freshman,5,The professors are great and very caring. They want the students to do well and be successful. The food is pretty good on campus. The dorms seem to be too hot or too cold.

College Sophomore,5,"We support the sports teams, but they don't overshadow academics."

College Sophomore,5,The computer services are great.
College Junior,5,"Since I've been living in Dallas all my life I know all about that life! That's what I used to be about! We have underground clubs for the youngsters 17-20. Then you have your clubs for the 21 and up which now I prefer since I'm that age and but really I just like the lounges not the clubs. I really don't like to get that wild like I used to! But the DJ's are off the chain, the music is always on point, the places are very nice, the ladies are always looking good! You can't beat a night in Dallas! Since we can't party here at school thats what I would advise the students to do so they will not get in trouble trying to have a party here on campus which nobody would because there not that stupid."
College Junior,5,"This Is Dallas – Besides being a small Christian school in a hidden place we are no more then 10 minutes from Downtown Dallas! Where everything happens at! We have the nicest clubs and lounges in Uptown! Very nice bars for you to go relax with friends after a hard day of studying. We have SMU which is 10 minutes away as well a very popular campus here in Dallas. We have NorthPark  Mall, the Galleria, man I can go on for days! 20 minutes away we have SIx Flags in Arlington, Hurricane Harbor and with the New Cowboys stadium that just was built and Ranger field! There is plenty to do here in Dallas. I also forgot September is coming up so the State Fair of Texas!! The biggest and best fair in the world!!!"
College Junior,5,Very Diverse – Dallas Christian College is a very diverse campus with different ethnicities to religions. Being here at a Christian College we are here for Christ and Christ doesn't see color so we are all brothers and sisters in Christ. We are all family here! That's what I love about this school!!!
College Freshman,5,"Guy and Girls Are Equal – Guys and girls are both great people in this school mainly because of the Christian aspect.  Most girls are Conservative, but their hearts are pure as well as most of the guys."
Sophomore,4,I love the small campus personally. Being at a school that contains about 250 students is a lot easier for me academic wise. I went to a large high school so coming here is a nice change for my personal preference.
Freshman,4,The school has a great environment and is also on the outskirts of Dallas. Helps people build character and has good security on the campus. The home visits the students take are great because they teach people about getting to know god and show them what he has done in their life.
College Freshman,4,My roommate is the best
College Freshman,4,I love chapel. It gives me a different perspective on my faith.
College Freshman,4,This school changed my whole view of college.

College Freshman,4,"My  school is pretty cool, close to family."
College Sophomore,4,Our athletic teams are really good.
College Sophomore,4,"The main transportation are cars. If someone needs to go somewhere and don't have a car, they usually can find someone to give them a ride. We are within walking distance of food places and a Walmart, so a car isn't necessary. We are even close to a train/bus station, so people can walk there if they want to get to somewhere further away."
College Sophomore,4,"It's mostly very nice, but can change in a split-second. It can go from cold to hot to freezing in one weekend. You just never know for sure what it's going to do."
College Sophomore,4,It's great being so close to everything and not being in the middle of Downtown Dallas.
College Student,4,"I love the grace that they show to the students. They understand that we make mistakes and they try everything they can to help us better ourselves. The curfews are perfect to me, they give the students enought time after school to study with friends or to social and be back to the dorms on time to prepare for bed and class the following day. I love my experience ."
College Student,4,"Varsity sports at Dallas Christian College are pretty huge, especially the way campus treats us. We have wonderful training and workout facilities, including our own trainers, psychologists, and academic."
College Freshman,4,"In the dorms we have curfews during the week, which is understandable because of school. But we also have curfews on weekends, which I think is wrong. It is the weekend and we should be allowed to stay out how late we want, we are in college and the campus should trust us to make right decisions on how mature we could be when we are out on our own."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very friendly. Dallas Christian College is a Christian school so most people do not judge others.
College Freshman,4,The off-campus is okay. It is good to have your own freedom what you want to do at home and have no curfew.
College Freshman,4,"I am majoring in Education, and the teachers here are great. The homework is not something I can not handle. And the activities we do for our community are extremely great. The faculty is really helpful when students have questions."
College Freshman,4,"When I moved to Dallas to attend school the weather was different but it was not unbearable. It is always fresh with a splash of cold air, I love it. It does not affect school much because the campus is so small and all my classes are in one building I have no issues with the weather."
College Sophomore,4,Just fill out your FAFSA and do what they tell you.
College Sophomore,4,"The weather here is very nice, specifically in Fall and Winter."
College Sophomore,4,"This is a large city, and there are many choices of where you can eat. So far, I've been pleased at every place I've eaten, and the costs and locations are quite reasonable."
College Junior,4,"The computers are excellent and there are many available, but currently they are working on fixing the internet which can cause issues."
College Sophomore,4,Just like any average city and since being in Dallas home of the barbecue state options are skies the limit in this open range.
College Sophomore,4,"Varsity sports at Dallas Christian College are pretty huge, especially the way campus treats us. We have wonderful training and workout facilities, including our own trainers, psychologists, and academic advisers"
College Sophomore,4,Its open in the midst of Downtown Dallas but located in a nice secluded neighborhood that makes up for the openness
College Sophomore,4,The financial aid office has been very helpful with the filing of all information and are very willing to help you figure things out.

College Sophomore,4,"There are plenty of options near the campus, it's Dallas.  There is a wide variety of dining choices."

College Freshman,4,"I love the grace that they show to the students. They understand that we make mistakes and they try everything they can to help us better ourselves. The curfews are perfect to me, they give the students enought time after school to study with friends or to social and be back to the dorms on time to prepare for bed and class the following day. I love my experience here, so far."
College Junior,4,we are near downtown dallas so we are close to all the shopping attractions. food places everywhere. but i have yet to see a dollar store
College Junior,4,I Need Money – my experience went smooth. the financial advisor got straight to the point but in a nice approach.. she was also very helpful in showing me other options i would have. i needed more money to pay for school and she was very helpful at directing me where to go. she wasnt all about the money she acted as if she was more concerned about getting me in and thats what i loved about it the most.
College Junior,4,"Love in the Atmosphere – everyone at dallas christian is so friendly. if im caught walking alone, there is always a student or a mentor that recognizes you and offer assistance or even just to say a friendly hello.The school is pretty small so we dont have to much security but because we have so many educators involved in the students life,we dont really need a huge security staff. everyone has a huge amount of respect for one another and i just get that huge feeling inside that says i know i am safe. i can feel the love all around me and the school just has you feeling like your safe at home. i can just feel the love in the atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,"Although you might have to walked through a park first, once reaching the Dart Train station you can ride it everywhere around Dallas, and even down to Forth Worth"
College Freshman,4,This college accepts any religion around Christianity from Catholics to Contemporary Christians.  Races are diverse as well as economic backgrounds and political.
College Freshman,4,Not Much – The weather here is diverse but awesome.  It does not get too hot and it snows just enough to enjoy but as much to hate it.
College Freshman,4,"Great Restaurants – The dinning places around the school are very diverse. Being in Dallas it is not that hard to find specific foods, if you are a picky eater."
College Freshman,2,The athletic teams are very good but its too strict and it doesn't challenge me enough.
College Freshman,2,I do not really like how sports almost define the students who go here to this college. Most students just come here for sports instead of really trying to get an education. The athletics here are very poor and very unorganized.
College Freshman,2,Cannot Do Much – There are many rules on campus but also it is a christian college. As long as you are not doing anything illegal you'll be all right.
College Freshman,1,It was very bad. The lady who was supposed to help was never around. Students would email her and she would never respond.
College Freshman,1,We DO NOT have security on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"The Bar/Club Scene – Amazingly, there is no night life as far as to kids going to clubs. It is agains the rules to go to bars here."

Sophomore,4,"Good evening, I'm currently enrolled at Polk State College, what I like about PSC is that its very affordable, as well as, the location is very close to home. There are a lot of professors that are willing to help, when in doubt I know that they will be a helping hand. There are many clubs to join to have new experiences also meet people with the same interests as you. Some things I would like to see change at PSC are the having more venting machines on campus, the cafeteria food lower prices, and for the gym to be larger."
Sophomore,4,Online classes are more easier to take because they more likely work around anyone's busy schedule and can be very beneficial. But I don't recommend to students who think they can just slack off if they take online classes.  but overall it very good.
Sophomore,4,I choose polk state because my mom told me it a good school and i feel a sense of security and reassurance. It a very awesome school  with very caring staff and faculty who are willing to help no matter what the issue is and will always have 24/7 help care. Professors are willing to put twice as much effort as the students because they want to ensure success. I'm already in my fourth semester and so far I love it and wouldn't change anything.
Sophomore,4,My experience is very good. the students are very passionate and care about their school. The school is very well built and able to help out however they can. The professors are a little pushy with their ideology but can teach.

Senior,4,I have taken 3 online classes and feel confident with the instruction I received. I took them over the summer and still was able to fully enjoy my summer while taking these classes. I would definitely take another online class!
Sophomore,4,"It was super easy to register for classes, advisers are always willing to help! They do a lot of events for Spanish Heritage and Black History Month, and overall a great place to go to school! Very friendly environment. Classes are on the smaller side so it helps you connect with the professor!"
Senior,4,"With Polk State being a community college it is very affordable for anyone who is interested in starting out their college career. Professors are very understanding to most students and just require communication throughout the semester. They are always there to help you succeed. Polk State also provides around the clock tutoring for free which is very beneficial, and have a superb library for essentials. Overall my experience in Polk State has been very positive and constructive in my path through college."
Sophomore,4,The Polk State College Professors went above and beyond to help the students out and genuinely cared about the students! One specific thing I would like to see change for Polk State College is student life. The student is a bit bland.
Sophomore,4,"I love it here! The music department is great and Manzi is so nice! Everybody loves her! There is a particular professor here that outshines every other educator. This professor is Prof. Pringle-Brown, even if she's not your professor, she will help you in any way she can and genuinely cares for all the students at Polk State College.

Sophomore,4,"Is a very good college if you are just wanting to get your AA, or if you happen to be going into a program that they offer such as Nursing or buisness."
Niche User,4,The staff at polk state college truly care about their students and their success. Their arts program is great!!
Sophomore,4,Over good so far my only real issues are with communication between financial aid and admissions. They would tell me important thing last minute or when the office just closed which is annoying
Freshman,4,I have started Polk State College and i am taking classes for my requirements for my nursing degree. The staff is excellent and the guidance counselors have been really helpful whenever i have questions.
Senior,4,At Polk State you will have an amazing college experience all the people who work there are there to help you in all ways necessary. While i am a Polk State student i have been living in my own apartment and that works well for me many other live with their parents and this causes a cheaper expense and will help save for when you want to buy your own place or go yo University. The college life here at Polk is very interesting and they try to have activities to make it feel as if people stay on campus it is a TRUE college experience without having to pay so much as well as living on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Honestly, as long as you pick the right professors it is pretty good. Only giving it four stars because financial aid truly sucks."

Should you decide to transfer Polk State College staff will help you out with anything you need to do prior to transfer."
Freshman,4,The classes are easy if you put the effort in and complete everything that you need too. Teachers are nice and actually care about you. Things that can be improved are the application process as it is a little complicated and frustrating!!
Sophomore,4,"Polk State College is a state college so unlike a university, it has no dorms or college type parties on campus. It is, however, convenient for people of all ages due to the accessibility of the multiple campuses, classes, and professors. Polk State College tries to help its students by any means. A perfect example would be it’s mandatory first year seminar class. It helps to introduce freshman to college life and the campus itself. I would recommend Polk State College to anyone looking to further their education but stay local, parents who have families to tend to, people currently working to support themselves, and students fresh out of high school."
Freshman,4,"Polk State College is a great college to get your AA degree and transfer over to a different college. My experience at Polk State is amazing, the teacher are really nice, reliable, trust-worthy, and understandable. Faculty are really nice, I enjoyed my time doing dual-enrollment while being in high school and thats what convinced me to finish my AA at Polk State College."
Sophomore,4,"Polk state is a great school, and the atmosphere is nice. Many of the professors are kind and understanding, but also provide a good learning experience. The only downside is that it focuses a lot on specific programs, and those programs are extremely difficult to get into."

Senior,4,"I liked attending Polk State in Winter Haven. The teachers that I had were all very friendly and made sure that you understood what you were doing. There is always events going on around campus and the atmosphere is friendly. Just wish some of the upper staff were more on the same page and emailed back quicker, but overall I enjoyed my time at this campus."
Niche User,4,The nursing program allows students to succeed in the medical field. The affordability of tuition for schooling is good.
Sophomore,4,"Polk State College is a fine institution, staff is friendly, Professors are professional and the students don't bother me; Now, not too say that the students wont interact with me I just personally choose not to interact. The campus has decent food. Also this school offers a program for high schoolers to enter college much earlier; and I was one of their former students, it was a great experience. I was enrolled in an info tech program which got me a head start in the professional IT world. Without their hands on help I doubt I would have ever learned as much as I have about computers."
Sophomore,4,"I'm in my second year at Polk State, in progress to receive my associates degree. Polk State is a very great school, with a majority of the professors being really great. I go to school on the Lakeland campus which is always incredibly clean. It is a very safe campus and there are many security guards that are always on duty. The classes are cheaper than the same ones offered at universities and there always  events going on, ran by the student government."
Sophomore,4,"Polk State College is a state college so unlike a university, it has no dorms or college type parties on campus. It is, however, convenient for people of all ages due to the accessibility of the multiple campuses, classes, and professors. Polk State College tries to help its students by any means.

Freshman,4,"Well upon talking to employees and professors that work their, I feel that these are people who care about you and want to see you succeed in the world."

Freshman,4,"Polk State is a great community college with quality education at a fair price. For a small city community college they have many class options, majors, clubs, organizations, and more. They have 4 different campuses placed around the county for convenience. When it comes to local colleges, Polk State College is among the best."

Sophomore,4,I've had a great experience with Polk State College. I completed all of my prerequisites at this college due to convenient evening classes since I worked a full-time M-F 8-5 job. Some things that I would like to see change would be the wait time to see an advisor. My time is extremely valuable and when I'm waiting an hour to see an advisor it becomes frustrating!
Junior,4,"Polk State is a small campus, making it very easy to navigate. The majority of the staff and professors are very helpful and passionate in what they do. The campus is beautifully taken care of. The professors go above and beyond to help you become a better person in more than one way. I can see in my GPA the ways going to a smaller college is helping."
Alum,4,Great experience! Saved a ton of money while figuring out my future.  The art professors are more reliable than the advisors at this college at helping you to determine your college path for your degree
Niche User,4,Polk State is a great place for individual studies because it is a very remote college that strongly supports dual enrollment and gives students many opportunities to seek assistance or help.
Sophomore,4,"The college is thoroughly involved with their students and they offer great aid in assisting students. However, some of their faculty members and professors can be rude and uninvolved."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed many of the professors. I have learned a lot from them, and appreciate that they are willing to help students."
Sophomore,4,"So far mostly smooth experience at this college. They offer multiple locations for education. Unfortunately that often involves bouncing between the two. They have very few technology classes and teachers. Scholarships are available and athletic teams, alongside clubs. They have a performing arts theater and often have free events on the campus such as movies or sporting events alongside free food and activities. They recently changed their content management system from PAL to Canvas. It's better in a lot of ways but more limited on the information shown unfortunately. However the design is cleaner which makes it easier to find stuff. The campus administration has been a bit bumpy on the financial department but ultimately all my issues were resolved, all at one point I was dropped form my classes because they did not apply my scholarship money despite reminding them about three times prior to the due date."
Alum,4,"Polk offers a pretty relaxed environment. The class sizes are fairly small, making a students' education more intimate and able to get individual help."
Sophomore,4,"I have had great experiences at Polk State through the collegiate high school program. Switching from a traditional high school to a college setting was one of the best decisions I ever made. Like any school, there are some great professors and some not-so-great professors. I think that Polk State is an asset to the Polk County community and is dedicated to improving the lives of their students."
Sophomore,4,Polk State College is a very good college. I like that it has multiple campuses making it very convenient for me to get there and attend classes. Most of their science and math faculty are excellent teachers. All of their professors seem to genuinely want  their students to succeed. I also really like their writing professors. I do not like the fact that it is sometimes very hard to get answers on what classes I need to take and why things have not shown up on my transcripts yet. I also think their website needs to be improved.
Freshman,4,Polk State College is a very good school for those who are seeking out to get their AA or to go there for a while and then transfer to another institution. The classes range from about 15-25 students and the professors are willing to help out with one-on-one. They have a great tutoring program and clubs to get you involved with the school.
Senior,4,"My overall experience with Polk State College has been amazing. You have one-on-one time with professors and plenty of activities and events to go around. There's always been trouble with wifi, however, and that is something that won't be fixed for a long time, if at all, due to lack of efficient funding going towards community colleges. The food at Metz cafe is terrible; There are more junk food options than clean and healthy options and the cafe closes at 2:30 pm, which is unfortunate for students who may rely on it for late lunch or dinner. The school is small, and unless you're taking nursing classes, classrooms tend to be around 20-22 students. The most I've ever been seated with was 40, but even at that amount, I was still able to receive one on one time with my professor. Because this is a community college, there is not ""party"" scene, dorms, or return on investment."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the professors have been great. The student life is quite lit, the club that oversees all student activities do a really great job. The campus is in no way secure, and with how things are looking, there is a great need for increased security. Polk State's classes are quite easy to take and pass."
Niche User,4,"I have yet to attend Polk State, but I have heard very good reviews and the times I have visited I have had great experiences with them."
Niche User,4,"They are very easy to work with and helped me out a lot with me classes. Professors are extremely nice and ready to help, they're all understanding of different situations you're going through."
Sophomore,4,Polk State College is an affordable school with great opportunities and teachers that provide a great education and options for nontraditional students who are seeking their degree.
Freshman,4,"My overall experience at Polk State College is very good so far. The professor's assign a workload of homework but it Is for the student's benefit. There seems to not be a big diversity of people, but everyone seems kind. The professors are amazing at teaching, well at least the professors I have taken recently. I have learned so much in my first semester of college. I am still in my first year of college and I do not have one complain of Polk State College."
Sophomore,4,Polk state college is a friendly college that will assist you in getting the degree you desire. The college will never leave their students feeling lost. The school guides their students to achieve their goals and assist them on moving forward in life. They also have events to where any student is allowed to join and have fun. The college is enjoyable and has great professors to help learn the required classes the students need to take. Its a great school and its cheap too!
Sophomore,4,If you are planning on going to Polk State College this is a small school with great teachers that want to help you pass the class. But there are no dorms and the party scene well there is none.
Sophomore,4,"Great professors, but somewhat lacking in administration. Great food, great access to resources. The learning opportunities are fantastic, free tutors are always in the library and will teach you everything you need for the course."
Sophomore,4,Its a good experience. The advisors really helped m when i had trouble getting financial aid. It was hard especially since my dad died and thay did every thing they could.
Sophomore,2,My sister graduated from PSC and she always had trouble with financial aid. I'm on my second year here and I always have trouble with financial aid. Most of the people I talk to have no idea how to fix the problem. They're unorganized and never have a solution to my problems. They never give me my full amount.
Junior,2,"online courses are usually made to be finished at your pace, ask questions if needed and address any concerns you may have right away."
Freshman,2,"Staff aren't really that helpful or friendly. Getting help or answers is like pulling teeth and when help is given, it may not even fully resolve your problem because the answers given are very basic"
Niche User,2,"Polk State College is a decent and affordable option for practically anyone. The best the college has to offer is by way of its nursing program, which is considered excellent by all the hospitals in Central Florida. Its EMT and Paramedic programs are considered equally excellent. However, other than those programs, the school is very mediocre at best. Most of the General Education courses are taught at a pathetically simplistic level. The theater department of Polk State College is also a complete joke, regularly causing their aspiring student-actors to quite literally become worse at performing than they were before entering the department."
Niche User,2,The financial aid office and student services area sucks. Half of the time you're going down there because they didn't process a paper correctly or your financial aid isn't available. Professors weren't any better either. Half of the professors are part time high school teachers.
College Senior,2,"There isn't a diverse amount of classes available. First come, first served."
College Senior,2,"I am an environmental studies major and I don't have much luck here. If you're going into the nursing or teaching field, by all means, stay for four years! It really is great for that. Anything else, not so much. There are great biology professors, but I don't know if you'll find all the courses you need for a biology major. I am giving up two free years from a scholarship because they just don't have what I need."
College Junior,2,I have not seen any of these events on campus
College Sophomore,2,"I'm excited to transfer schools soon and actually feel like a part of the community, where as polk state was just a minor stop along the way to my goals."
College Sophomore,2,"For the quality of education in this demographic area, the tuition could be a little lower."
College Sophomore,2,"They don't actually offer my major, I will have to transfer."
College Sophomore,2,There's a very limited selection located on campus as per the library. Nothing really feels like a college campus for example there is no team spirit. Campus activities aren't really advertised in any way.
College Junior,2,I haven't even heard of this being available.
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid department is the worst part of this school.
College Freshman,2,They do not want to help you much find a way to get into school if you are in need of help at least at the Lakeland campus.  I really and truly want to go to school and I need help due to being a single mother of three children with no job and in need of help with childcare.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The class sizes are usually small, which is good. However, there is very little interaction between students and makes the overall experience not so good."
Recent Alumnus,2,"It is hard being a science major because there are not many classes to pick, which makes scheduling difficult."
Recent Alumnus,2,There is not a large amount of different courses. For some subjects there are even very few professors to pick from.
College Senior,2,"This school, is terrible from financial aid, to the academic advisor, i wish i could have went somewhere else."
Recent Alumnus,2,There aren't that many choices when it comes to getting picking classes for each semester's schedule.
College Junior,2,Takes to long to give back disbursements
College Senior,2,There is wifi but it is very bad and i is only on certain places on campus
College Sophomore,2,i had a horrible experience when converting my grades
College Sophomore,2,"its sad but i think it could be better i am an outsider which moved to Florida, it kind of a culture shock"
College Junior,2,It's impossible to see an adviser or financial aid representative. Many teachers are very flexible and easy to communicate with.
College Junior,2,The A.A. program for secondary education is very limited.
College Junior,2,"Being a State College, Polk State has a very limited network of B.A. and post A.A. degrees and programs."
College Student,2,im not sure about the student body at my school
College Student,2,my online professor is very complicated and doesn't teach nothing related to the course.
College Junior,2,frustrating in general. uneducated counselors and financial aid advisors. 
College Junior,2,In short our school does not have a football team. Its hard to raise school spirit with out a team.
College Junior,2,"I only received enough financial aid for my basic courses, not even books. I had to pay $155 out of pocket to pay for a courses for next semester and will not have enough money for books."
College Junior,2,I have not been contacted by anyone about career services. 
College Junior,2,"At Polk State College, the student body is very diverse. The age difference is very noticable, as we have 16-64 year olds attending the college year round. We have students who take their appearance, reputation, and over all character very seriously, and some who seem not to. It is not surprising to see a 16 year old who is pregnant attending class, neither is a 64 year old man."
College Senior,2,The financial aid is very unorganized and unknowledgeable.
College Senior,2,"polk State online Courses is not very good, Because of the way the want things but not enough of information on the course to give them what they want."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The financial aid process at this school is alright. You must have to stay on top of it to receive your aid. If not you might not make it in for the semester your applying for unless you pay out of your pocket. At the school financial aid office the staffs tends to lose your documents when you submit them. You have to go back and explain everything to them and even re-submit your documents. I personally think they need better employees. However, I stay on top of financial aid because it is important for me to be enrolled in classes and the process for me always go through. I also get my money worth out of school in general because i have access to a lot of resources that are not at my home. It is important to turn in all your financial aid documents on the right time because registration date for classes may be delayed and even you can be dropped from them as well."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Polk State could improve greatly with its library and student center. The library selection consists of books published 20 to 60 years ago, and new books are rare finds. The student center needs to be expanded to prevent massive crowds during primary hours of the day. Overall, the campus needs to be updated."
College Junior,2,There office is open to go in and talk. There are many jobs offered at the campuses.
College Junior,2,You have to ask questions. You are expected to just know what to do.
College Senior,2,"I know they have busses for the collegiate students which are high schools students, other than that there are few."
College Senior,2,it really depends on the field. The Career center isn't well advertised. I have only heard of students getting jobs through networking within their majors and with their teachers and fellow students.
College Senior,2,Their system is old and needs to be updated. The lines are insane
College Senior,2,"Basically, you aren't really able to meet with any advisors due to their demand by other students, so not much discussion is to be had with anyone regarding your scheduling."
College Freshman,2,"Polk State College has a majority of African American Students. There is even a black student club in the school. Most students in the school are searching for a better education to support their families, or to improve their quality of life. Although, there are some high school graduates who are planning to transfer."
College Freshman,2,"The classes are great, and I learned a lot. There is no gym only a small workout area.  Financial aide is a joke, if you need help you are better off learning getting help from other students. If you are going on a G.I. bill I recommend you avoid them. They were not helpful until I was calling them everyday and I was about to have to quit school."
College Senior,2,"I am currently a Business Major, and the classes do tend to keep you busy. I find that the in-class courses are easier than the on-line or hybrid ones. I would recommend not using the on-line sources because I have had 6 classes dropped from my transcripts due to computer error on their part. The staff are always way behind and if you have an issue that needs to be corrected, forget it. They won't do it especially if you aren't on top of them 24/7"
College Senior,2,"My major is English Literature and it's one my school doesn't have. I'm on my own until I get to a university that does have my major but while I'm here, I'm taking as many English and writing classes as I can along with other classes that I'm interested in and would help with my major, like computer and math classes. My workload isn't too bad, but I'm doing as much as I know I can handle because I don't want to waste time if I don't have to. I'm doing an internship but that is from my own connections and it's probably the most helpful thing for me and my writing."
College Sophomore,2,"Do Your Research – It is not expensive at Polk State, but you definitely get what you pay for. Sometimes, the classes are amazing and you are getting a great deal but some of their programs are not worth it. For example, the Drawing program, for lack of a better term, sucks. Unless you are a back-to-school adult or a young adult who has never taken art classes, this class has the potential to disappoint you. Just make sure you do your research on the different classes before you apply. I heard that their business and management track is great."
College Junior,2,"Financial aid for me is impossible to obtain because it is based on my parents income, yet I will be the one responsible for paying for my classes. Knowing that, I'm scrambling to get scholarships to help me with my college expenses while working and paying for all of my other expenses."
College Sophomore,2,Not Enough Information – There needs to be more people providing information on grants and aid available to students.
College Sophomore,2,"I have had nothing but trouble with the financial aid dept, they change rules and do not notify students. they hardly ever answer their phone lines and when they do they act like you are bothering them. When you go to the office there are long wait times and when you do get seen the workers are not helpful."
College Sophomore,2,Lots of High School Students – i am an adult student and i dislike having to deal with all the high school age students loitering around campus.
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid office is good for FASFA questions but needs improvement when it comes to other sources of funding for college expenses and finacial advice. You are pretty much on your own for that!
Recent Alumnus,2,"Some Good Professors, but – Some of the professors were great, and I mean really great. Then there are the ones who should just retire already. They seem to hate the students and resent them. With PSC being my first attempt at college I was considering stopping after I got my Associates degree. It wasn't until the last 3 terms I had that I finally met new professors who were eager to teach and help the students."
College Senior,2,"From time to time the student services are either no help or send me in circles. For me the class depended on the professor. I've had good ones and I've had bad ones. For the most part ""Only in Polk county""."
College Sophomore,2,"My school is one that not many people have heard of before.  It is in the county of Winter Haven and there is very little to do in the surrounding area, which is a serious down fall.  There is also not much support for sports and activities affiliated with the school.  But this is some what expected with a two year school.  For being so far away from home, this school is not at the level that I would like it to be."
College Junior,2,I think the financial aid that is given by the school is pretty good.
College Student,2,"PCC Experience – The flexibility of the classes are good, but the places fill up so fast that it's hard to get the classes you need each semester.  Also, the admissions office and the financial office need to step it up, at least at the Lakeland Campus.  There's one lady in the financial office that needs to learn how to pay attention better so I don't get sent to 10 different people just to be sent back to her.  It's retarded.  Also, the wait to see an admissions counselor is ridiculous.  Winter Haven never has problems like that.  The Lakeland Admissions Office workers seem to be lazy and don't care about the students at all, maybe minus one counselor.  As for transferring my AA degree to the University I'm choosing, I shouldn't have any problems provided that PCC actually sends my transcripts (I've heard a lot of people have problems with that)."
College Junior,2,"Very Convienient but Not My Place. Polk state college is a good school, for what it's worth. However, I am an ambitious person. I know there are better things out there for me and I am striving to get them. Polk state was my last resort, although its very convienient for me to attend because it's close to home and my job, I want to experience the college life. I want to transfer to a university, live in a dorm and be surrounded by thousand of people whom are going through similar things as I am. I still have yet to check if my current credits will transfer to a four year university, so that might be stressful.  Polk State also saves me a lot of money. Tuition isn't too bad."
Niche User,1,"When I went their for open house night and it sucked. They did not even want to help me in becoming a chef and help me opening my restaurant. Lastly, I asked if the professors would help me if I fall be hind; they said no."
College Freshman,1,"I started school In August of 2016 and I have had no luck at all here. It is difficult to talk to somebody in the office or anywhere else, it has taken for ever to get my student loan (still have not received it), and no matter how many times i tell somebody something they still do not seem to understand."
College Junior,1,Did not take an online class.
College Senior,1,"Honestly, my experience at Polk State College has been the worst. The staff, for the most part, is unhelpful and pretty much incompetent. I have never come across a school staff so unwilling to help its students. It's crazy to think that people actually take pride in going here, because I cannot wait to graduate and leave this school in the dust."
College Sophomore,1,"No one really offers anyone a hand, if you want it you have to search long and hard to get what you're looking for."
College Sophomore,1,I'm pretty sure everything offered here is for people who don't want to do a lot of schooling to begin with.
College Sophomore,1,Staff does not have knowledge of their jobs and makes students waste time
Recent Alumnus,1,There are not many job prospects when graduating from this school.
Recent Alumnus,1,There aren't many options for aspiring students here.
Recent Alumnus,1,None of the students want to interact. It's horrible.
Recent Alumnus,1,They don't give out that much money.
College Sophomore,1,"I mentioned before that I transferred here and financial aid (whose sole job is to aid in financing their students) overlooked that I had recieved a pell grant at my previous institution and halfway throughout the semester, called me infroming me that they were taking away the money. Mind you, halfway throughout the semester is too late for a refund of any sort. So, I ended up stuck with the 500 dollars (75 of which was refunded to me and used for books) for a class that I was ONLY taking because it was paid for. I'm highly upset with financial aid. The person whom I spoke with informed me that it was MY responsibilty to make them aware of the fac that I had previously attended another institution, as if sending my transcripts and enrolling as a transfer student did make it obvious enough."
College Junior,1,"Polk State is for the job-working, part-time student. There is little to no social scene, very little campus life. There is nothing unique, except that the Polk County sheriff station is on campus."
College Junior,1,"The value of education is very poor, especially for the amount of money I'm expected to pay each semester."
Recent Alumnus,1,I hate the online courses. They are confusing and make little sense
College Freshman,1,"My mother makes too much money to fit into the financial aid requirements, unfortunately she is unable to help me to pay for college on my own so I am forced to pay out of pocket or get student loans"
College Sophomore,1,I really do not hear much of career services at polk state college.
College Junior,1,"The wireless network at the Lake Wales Campus is horrible. If you can get logged in to the network, the signal is never strong enough to stay connected. It makes it impossible to use your own personal computer. This really makes it hard if there are hours between classes."
College Sophomore,1,"Most majors are only two year programs, therefore, there is little to no help for those graduating the college. Their primary focus is nursing, which is important but unfortunate that that's the only four year degree they offer."
College Freshman,1,"Although, I'm not a hundred percent sure, this school does not provide post-graduation services."

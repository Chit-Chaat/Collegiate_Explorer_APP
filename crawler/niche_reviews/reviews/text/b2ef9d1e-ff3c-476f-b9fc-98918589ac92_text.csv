Sophomore,5,"The online courses are obviously not the same as in person class, but it's really helpful since the professors find their way to make it easier for the class to not struggle. Being able to make an office appointment either in class or in person and they're really flexible especially when they have their own life to maintain as well. The online classes aren't much depending on what classes you're taking, but just like every other class it's for the degree that we are pursuing. There's nothing bad that i'd say about online classes now that I'm aware of everything since the pandemic happened in late March. The experience was new and I never thought I could handle doing classes from home, but it worked fine, since like I said professors understand especially when it's online. There's always a reason to why students take online classes especially when having a full time job or when you have reasons that are priorities and the professor understands what life can do to someone."
Sophomore,5,"The diversity of UNK is amazing and I love how everyone is super friendly and we're all helpful to each other like a big family. UNK it not only about the friends, but it's also about finding who you truly are and what degree to pursue. The housing is good quality which makes being a student way easier since they help provide food us, as well as the food. There are different types of options to chose from, either fast food or a cooked meal in the cafeteria. The local area isn't bad as well, it's right when entering the town and it's easier for students that are planning to visit easy for them to locate especially when the town is getting so much bigger. The professors are very helpful and always try their hardest to make time for their students. The safety is amazing, which makes students travel from class to class way easier and whenever something is wrong it's awesome to have some safety around us and faculty."
Senior,5,"The online experience was pretty good overall, your online experience tends to depend on the teacher teaching the class."
Senior,5,Great university that engages and challenges its students to be better and strive for more. It is a truly great university
Freshman,5,"I am taking all my courses on line.  Kearney has made this very easy and things are going well.  The professors communicate well and it makes it very easy to attend. I think if you are considering a college and would like to take that college on line, UNK should be a consideration."
Sophomore,5,"It is a really fun and family type place, I love the atmosphere with the sports because, the games that I have seen they're usually very packed almost like a division one football game, the meal plans are really good and the restaurants they offer on-campus like the chic-fil-a and subway's. Such good food and don't even get me started on the people! They are so accepting and open to meeting new people and making friends, they are so fun. The coaches are so respectful as well, I have seen coaches sit and talk to players about it all. I haven't moved in yet but I have been up there and been to some workouts, coaches have made this transitional experience such a breeze and have been there for me as soon as I decide to leave Fort Hays, making me understand that I wouldn't be able to play right away but that I will have an equal shot and that my talent in their opinion is exactly what they're looking for! The admission staff is one of the best. Tom Knott has kept me posted very well."
Graduate Student,5,I'm located in Washington state. And I have noticed how much instructors and staff do care about you. Registration and Financial Aid do as much as possible to keep you informed and help you out with your classes. Thanks a lot!
Graduate Student,5,My instructors are helpful. They do follow up with you after you have a question. They make sure you have success with the online classes which prepares you for the future!
Graduate Student,5,The professors are awesome. They work with you. I completed my undergrad and my advisor was always keeping contact with me. I could reach out to all and they helped very much. I felt safe on the campus. It was big but not to big.
Graduate Student,5,My program is blended and the teachers do very well at making the online classes easy to follow. They use Zoom and it works really well.
Freshman,5,"It is a fantastic, small campus with a friendly environment. I am very involved on campus and I love my professors. They are always there to help!!"
Freshman,5,UNK offers wonderful academics and has some of the most passionate and caring professors. It's very easy to make connections and find ways to network.
Junior,5,"The University is truly dedicated to helping and teaching students. The education program, like many, is incredible and run by many passionate teachers."
Niche User,5,"Kearny involves many great opportunities for those around the world, and the learning opportunities are amazing."
Niche User,5,I have taken 16 credits of college classes through my high school with UNK. Their staff have been incredibly helpful with my application process. There is always someone that is willing to answer any question I may have.
Alum,5,"I was thrilled with the educational guidance the University of Nebraska at Kearney provided for my teaching career. I am currently in my sixth year teaching and continuously use the information and strategies I acquired at UNK in my classroom every day. 

The College of Education is filled with many highly qualified professors who are willing and available to discuss your future goals with you. They are there to help answer any and all questions you have regarding classes and scheduling. 

The campus is a quick 15-20 minute walk from one end to the other. It is a beautiful campus and UNK is continuing to extend and improve the campus and buildings."
Niche User,5,I toured this University and everyone there was welcoming and made it feel like home. Most definitely a place I can see myself at.
Niche User,5,I enjoyed that it was close to my home and that it was not very expensive. Also offered the major that I wanted.
Alum,5,"I loved the small class sizes and the ""homey"" feel of UNK. All of the professors are knowledgable in their field and truly care about their students."
Senior,5,It's located in a growing town. Class size is amazing and the professors are truly there to help you learn and to be successful. There are plenty of activities and extracurriculars to get involved in.
Sophomore,5,"I think the University of Nebraska at Kearney is an excellent college. There are countless amounts, and a large variety, of activities that you can get involved in.  I have only been there for a year, so I haven't gotten involved in too much. However, everything that I did get involved with was amazing. The campus is great, there are some very pretty areas on campus. All of the professors I have had so far were all really nice, and good at what they do. For the food on campus, it is good, I am a somewhat picky eater, so I wish there were a few other options, or I wish some were an option more often, but besides that the food is quite good. So, in the end, the University is a really great place to be, and I would definitely recommend that people go here."
Graduate Student,5,It is amazing and has so many unique biology courses to offer! I highly recommend this school if you are looking to earn a degree online! The advisers are extremely helpful and all of the professors are prompt with their e-mail responses. I have learned so much through this university and I really enjoy getting home from work to sit down and study!
Freshman,5,"Here at UNK, everyone is super nice. I'm nearing the end of my freshman year and all of my professors have been amazing. The people you meet here and the friends you make are very friendly and stick by your side."
Freshman,5,"I love attending school at the University of Nebraska at Kearney because it has allowed me to grow in my strengths, develop friendships, engage in organizations, get to know my professors, and strive in my academic successes."
Junior,5,"Came here for football on a scholarship and its great! I had no clue about the mid west as i am from California but i found it easy to adjust! Campus is clean and safe, parties are cool too! “Cant spell drunk without UNK”"
Niche User,5,I am currently a senior in high school. I went to go tour UNK and I really liked the campus. its very diverse and not to big but also not to small. It's in a urban area near lots of close places that are very handy.
Niche User,5,"I think the University of Nebraska at Kearney is a great college for students who want to be interactive with professors and other students. I have three older sisters who all attend Kearney, and two have transferred to Kearney from other colleges because it fits them perfectly. They had a lot of friends they knew from high school and they have made so many friends in the time of being at college. I have gone and visited them so many times and I love the campus of Kearney and the dorms are very nice I have probably over thirty friends who stay in the dorms and some of them are not all freshman! So if you want to have a relationship with others and your professors I highly recommend you go to the University of Nebraska at Kearney!"
Sophomore,5,"I liked that the community took great care of UNK and the student life allows for many opportunities to meet new people. However, the food could be improved."
Junior,5,"Very good school to go to. From my opinion and the opinion of my girlfriend and others who attend, it's a great college for just about any degree. The school isn't ranked on the top of the list in America, but you get your bang for your buck. They also prepare you for a career by helping you connect with potential employers though your senior year."
Alum,5,"I earned bachelors and a masters degrees from UNK.  Both have prepared me to take the next steps in my career, as well as connect me to individuals within my field to expand upon further opportunities."
Freshman,5,"I was extremely skeptical about UNK because I'm from Kearney, but after starting here I have never felt so at home... so surprised! I haven't made too many friends in class yet but I enjoy my area of study and the professors."
Alum,5,"I absolutely love the University of Nebraska at Kearney. It is a great college with a lot of options as far as Greek life and other organizations. I choose Kearney because it is very affordable and not too small, but not too big."
Freshman,5,"I have been at UNK for almost a year now and it is completely different being on the campus than it is from the outside. I have really experienced every aspect of the school from academics, to sports, to music, to greek life and I have really enjoyed my experience. The school is small enough that you can get close with your professors and advisors while being involved in as much as you would like but big enough that when you want to switch friend groups or join something new, there is always something for you to do. I really think that if you are from the midwest that this is the place to go."
Niche User,5,Ive never been a student at Kearny but overall just for me to go to a visit I have been greeted with helpful smiles and they could answer every question ive had about the school. I like how it is a smaller school than UNL and provides an efficient and well-taught learning system. What i would change is the price of attending the college.
Niche User,5,"Although I've only gone to visit, I believe the campus is top notch. I start classes there in the fall and I cannot wait."
Senior,5,"The University of Kearney Nebraska is a beautiful campus, especially in the spring and fall months. The small town feel makes it easy to get comfortable and adapt quickly."
Sophomore,5,I love the feel of the university. The faculty really cares about the students and this has turned into my home away from home.
Sophomore,5,"I love UNK. It is the perfect size for me. I had a goldilocks moment while visiting campus, thinking this school is just right for me. The atmosphere is always positive. The classes are great and I am learning a lot in the teacher education program. Definitely considered UNK if you want to be a teacher."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at the University of Nebraska at Kearney has been unlike any other experience in my life. I have been blessed to be part of such an outstanding university that gives me every opportunity to get involved, meet new people, and better myself every single day. As a student diplomat (tour guide) at UNK, I get to show off the campus I am so passionate about 2 days a week and I am given the opportunity to share my college experiences with younger high school-aged kids who are thinking about coming to college. I have gotten the age-old question during tours before: ""I know you get paid to tell us what's so great about Kearney, but what would you change about the college?""
I always have the same answer for them: Nothing. The faculty and staff are as helpful as we as students could ever imagine or ask for. The facilities we have are, I believe, second to none. The opportunities we are given are endless. The University of Nebraska at Kearney can be home for anyone."
Freshman,5,I love the campus. Small and easy to get around. Nice people and good food. I'm only a freshman and can't wait to continue my schooling here. I would definitly give it a chance if you are on the fence. It is a cheap school to go to and lots of friendly people. There is also always an event going on so never get bored.
Sophomore,5,The University of Nebraska at Kearney is a college that fits me well. It so easy to make friends and be a part of a community. Through one semester I have made some of best friends. Also I live in one of the halls and our floor is very close and extremely fun to just be around. The professors here at Kearney are phenomenal. They are some of the nicest people and really help you be as successful as you possibly can be.
Freshman,5,UNK is a greta college to attend. All the professors and students are welcoming and always help if they are asked to. I have had a wonderful experience thus far.
Sophomore,5,"For me, the University of Nebraska at Kearney is a perfect fit.  It was close to home for me and just the perfect size.  I have only been in a lecture course and that was the only class I have been in that has over 30 students.  The staff is great and very helpful, I have never had trouble trying to get my professors to help me.  The other students are very welcoming as well.  When I first arrived as a Freshmen I was scared because I thought I wouldn't know anyone but that quickly changed.  I lived in the dorms my first year and it was lots of fun meeting all the new people and making life long connections."
Niche User,5,I liked being able to make quick scholarship applications and having many I could apply for. I also liked the amount of information they showed without being too complicated. Overall I would recommend this.
College Sophomore,5,I've only met a couple people who do drugs on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"While I'm walking on campus, or driving near campus, I see campus police car often. In addition to that, campus security walk around in late night. I feel really secured as long as I'm within on-campus area."
College Junior,5,The school offers job fairs twice a year for graduating seniors to make relationships as well as job fairs for freshman- juniors to understand what it is like to apply for a career. Every student adviser sends out job openings related to the field of the student as well as benefiting volunteer opportunities.
College Junior,5,"our campus has its own police department, not just campus security which makes our campus safe at all times throughout the year. Whenever there has been an incident where a victim is involved the campus has dealt with it quickly and professionally."
College Sophomore,5,The professors all know what they are talking about in their respective courses. They always provide the material needed for students to succeed in their classes.
College Sophomore,5,"The criminal justice program is one of the best in the country, and the internships are numerous. The help provided to receive these internships is very helpful as well."
College Sophomore,5,The school provides multiple opportunities for different groups of students to meet and get together. They provide fun activities for students to attend including multiple sporting events and a yearly concert for the students to attend at either discounted or no cost to students.
College Freshman,5,I have night class that gets out at 9ish and I feel completely safe walking back to my dorm. The campus police drive around often enough for me to notice and feel secure. I couldn't ask for a safer environment to be in.
College Freshman,5,"I couldn't be happier with my greek experience. I went through formal and informal rush. There was a mistake in my application thing for formal rush which was of no fault of mine, but it was taken care of so painlessly and nicely that I have not complaints. I am so happy I found a family away from home!"
College Freshman,5,The science courses have great professors that really enjoy their jobs.
College Freshman,5,The school is very serious about safety. We have blue call lights all around the school and we have numbers of police officers that will give us a ride to our dorms if we do not feel safe.
College Freshman,5,I love the school that I attend and I would not pick another one if I had the chance.
College Sophomore,5,I feel pretty safe on campus. Especially because the UNK police are out and about every night.
College Freshman,5,It's just the right size for people who dont want to go to a huge school.
College Junior,5,"I have been at this school for a couple of years, and I have yet to hear of a serious issue in regards to crime or safety. It is a very safe environment here, and the drug and alcohol usage is kept to a minimum while on campus. If it is used, which I am sure it is, it is used off and away from campus. Sexual assaults are nonexistent here, or if they are, I have yet to hear of it. However, out faculty and staff are very supportive when it comes to topics like that. They are willing to talk and listen, and they will do everything in their power to offer you their support."
College Junior,5,"Applying for financial aid is extremely easy, and to receive the financial aid is not a big headache. It is simple, easy, and fast, and anyone can do it."
Freshman,4,"I love the campus and the people on the campus. Some of the teachers could definitely be better, but most of them are great."
Freshman,4,I have taken online classes here and they are very easy. You will have just as much hardness as you would with an in-person class.
Freshman,4,I am taking all my courses on line.  Kearney has made this very easy and things are going well.  The professors communicate well and it makes it very easy to attend.
Freshman,4,"They have way too many construction projects going on at the same time, but other than that it is great!"
Freshman,4,"UNK is a tight knit community. If you’re looking for a smaller college so you can see familiar faces every day this is the place for you. The class sizes are small which is nice so you can get to know most of your professors pretty well. The size of the dorms is a bit smaller than average I’d say, at least to the other universities I have been too. But it tends to stay pretty clean."
Graduate Student,4,"Interesting courses and very approachable instructors. The fees are quite high, however, for graduate level classes, the prices are fairly average for online programs. There is a lot of diversity in available courses, which is very nice."
Sophomore,4,"I had a good feeling when visiting the campus, and after attending for a year I can say with certainty that I picked a great school. The professors really care for individuals and give a plethora of resources to help anyone go where they want to go. And the culture of the entire school is one that is inclusive and fun to be a part of."
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student commuting to campus from another town.
My professors have been warm and open to me and I have enjoyed
exploring the campus with new friends.  I am not into the party scene
so I cannot rate this aspect.  The campus is beautiful and easy to learn."
Graduate Student,4,"UNK-Kearney has been a good school so far.  This is my third semester as a graduate student in the biology program and it is challenging and rewarding.  Some of the professors are not flexible like they need to be with online courses, but overall it has been a good experience."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at UNK. The professors are willing to help, knowledgeable, and welcoming of questions."
Sophomore,4,"As a student athlete at UNK, I have really enjoyed my time at UNK. The professors work with athletes well. And the atmosphere at UNK is always cheery and nice to be around when away from home!"
Graduate Student,4,I'm in the Teacher Certification Program and I am really liking the classes that I've taken. At times the information is repetitive but it has really instilled the information well. Some of the administration is hard to get a hold of because I'm a distance student and I live in another city but the program director is spectacular.
Senior,4,"While I don't agree with many things that the administration does, the faculty and staff is where UNK shines. They are caring and always go the extra mile to help their students develop their skills."
Senior,4,"University of Nebraska at Kearney is a very good college for someone who is stuck between big university and small town college. It is big enough so that there are always new people and new things to take part in but small enough that you will probably recognize people in your classes other places you go. The town offers more than most towns of this size but most of the people are genuine, pleasant, and open minded. Overall great school and you really can't go wrong with the below average tuition."
Freshman,4,"I have absolutely loved my experience here.  The campus is very ""heads-up"" and makes it easy to get to know other people.  I have found some of my best friends here.  The professors genuinely care about their students and will do everything in their power to help students succeed."
Freshman,4,Great student life Great student lifeGreat student lifeGreat student lifeGreat Great student life lifeGreat student lifeGreat student lifeGreat student lifeGreat student lifeGreat student lifeGreat student Great student life student life student life student life student life student life student life student life student lifeGreat Great student life lifeGreat Great student life student life student life life
Sophomore,4,"It's taken me some time to fall in love with UNK but now I wouldn't go anywhere else. The academics are at a decent level for a state college. I love living on campus because it makes going to class about a 5 minute walk and attending the activities convenient. The cafeteria isn't the best food but we have Subway and a market you can buy groceries at along with opening a Chick-Fil-A. Our sports teams aren't good but the games are still fun because people get so into them. The local area is small to me but I know for most people it offers a lot. Overall, I wouldn't change where I chose to spend my four years at college."
Freshman,4,"This university is placed in a good setting and it provides remarkable education in such a low price. The community of Kearney is good and I think it is really important for you to have your study environment as peaceful as it can be. Though some buildings are quite old, there is undergoing of new STEM building which is state-of-the-art architecture."
Junior,4,"The good thing about studying at the University of Nebraska - Kearney is that it offers a lot of opportunities for students to find what they are interested in. At first, I was not sure what I wanted to do but with the help of my (many different) academic advisors I was finally able to narrow it down. It helps to know that your advisors are genuinely interested in the well-being of their students and their success. One thing that could be improved is the diversity on campus; while there are multiple groups that are meant to include everyone, they usually do not work as well as they are supposed to. The campus just needs to be a little more inclusive for everyone to feel comfortable getting a degree here."
Freshman,4,"My experience at the University of Nebraska at Kearney has been very good. I have meet a lot of people and have made several life long friendships. The academic part is excellent! The class sizes are the perfect size,  not too big but not too small. The professors are very easy to talk to if you have any question. I have enjoyed my time here at Kearney! It is a great school."
Alum,4,"Kearney is a great step for those coming from rural, small town life. It is nicely situated in the middle of the state, close enough to the city to visit but far enough a way to be peaceful. The class size is small enough to get to know your professors if you want but big enough to slip in and out if that is more your style. Your achievements are in your hands!"
Freshman,4,"UNK is an excellent college the professor like to get to know you personally, the campus is clean and I’ve never felt unsafe while at UNK. Go Lopers!!"
Freshman,4,"I love the opportunities provided at UNK along with the diversity. Although, I would like to see more areas to people among the campus can park."
Freshman,4,I love how personal the campus and classes are. You don't have large lecture classes where you are one of 500 other students. It is really nice to get to know your Professors and classmates personally. I love being able to walk to class within 15 minutes and I feel like I belong here.
Sophomore,4,It is a smaller school which is nice because you actually get to meet and talk with your teachers. The party scene is a bit too much for how small the school is but it is fun to go out every now and then. I would like to see improvement on the food at the school because it is better than highschool food but not by much. For the cost of attending the University of Nebraska at Kearney I would recommend going there.
Sophomore,4,At UNK I have found many people who are different from me but also very alike. Everyone is very driven for their studies and there are so many teachers/resources that are open to you. Choosing UNK as my college was a great choice for my budget and for the education that I want for my future.
Senior,4,The University of Nebraska at Kearney feels like a home away from home.  The professors at UNK work with you closely to give you every chance to succeed.  The people at UNK are what make the place so special.
Senior,4,I loved the education program and all of the professors. I played softball all four years and found they were constantly working with my schedule and doing anything they could to assist me with my studies. If I could one thing from my college experience I would have added my minor sooner than I did!
Junior,4,"So far I have really enjoyed being at UNK campus, Kearney itself isn't much of a fun town but it seems to be a good and overall safe town which is important. Unlike bigger schools, UNK makes creating connections with professors easier because it is smaller than the other Universities in Nebraska, which is something I love because networking is vital to future opportunities."
Freshman,4,"I have been at the University of Nebraska at Kearney for one year now and I love it. The size of the town and campus are perfect for getting to know people without getting overwhelmed with too many people. Kearney is also very welcoming to college students and offer great deals around the town. The campus is all within walking distance so getting to class is very easy. The only downside to UNK is the cafeteria food. It has gotten better since I first started here, but it could be better. The dorm rooms are a tad small and outdated, but the way the halls are set up allow for great socializing. So far my experience as a loper has been great!"
Niche User,4,"Nice large campus with a variety of majors. University of Nebraska at Kearney is an affordable midwestern college great for getting your bachelors degree. It is public, so the student body is a good size. Nice cafeteria with good choices and room. The best part is the UNK stadium."
Senior,4,"UNK is small enough that my professors know me by name but it is large enough, there is always something to do!"
Junior,4,I love the small school feel at UNK faculty is very friendly and helps you when you need it. I thought the cost could be cheaper.
Sophomore,4,"I love the size. It's big enough that it doesn't feel like my small home town, but smaller that a huge place like Lincoln or Omaha. All of the buildings are close together and easily accessible. The food could be better, but I didn't come for the food. The upperclassmen dorms are really pretty nice and makes up for the unpleasantries of the traditional dorms your first year. Also, the university provides off campus living for adults attending."
Senior,4,I am strictly an on-line user and so far my experience has been great. From the Advisors and  the Professors I have had classes with. If I ever have questions about financial aid they are always willing to point me in the right direction.
College Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed almost every class I have taken at UNK. There have only been two teachers that I strongly disliked (one was always canceling class at the last minute like 10 minutes before class was supposed to start when we were all already in the classroom waiting for her). All my other teachers have been very helpful and excellent at giving help outside of class. It would be nice to be able to move our class schedules around longer than the 1st week and still get a full refund.
College Sophomore,4,"My hs had pretty much not diversity at all, so coming to UNK was a breath of fresh air. Everyone is super accepting and friendly to those who are of a different race than themselves. There are people who are definitely not as open about sexual orientation, but it's easy to avoid them."
College Sophomore,4,"Since my major, athletic training major has different characteristic than any other major, instructor of classes tends to be same so that they are reachable when I need their help and size of class is about 15-20 people so they really think and care about student and that's helping me learning materials from course. And my academic advisor used to work with national women's volleyball team and know very much about athletic training profession. This make me feel confidence to follow his advise and those are really helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"From perspective of my area of study and kind of job I may have in the future, one can highly expect to have opportunity to have much better job than you ever expected. For example, one of alumni from my school, University of Nebraska Kearney, worked for beach volleyball as an athletic trainer in 2016 Olympic game."
College Sophomore,4,"I live on campus more for having chance to get involve with community than anything else. I think living in the dorm is huge part of being in college life. It is not cheap (at least my school...), but it worth it."
College Sophomore,4,"I am majoring in athletic training major and the school I attend right now is one of the great school in the nation in that field of study and they have great program.

Even if I can start over from choosing school, I would pick same school."
College Freshman,4,"I felt at ease in all of the classes (barring lecture classes, average size was about 18), the professors were accommodating, treatable, and answered questions. A lot may be expected of you at some point, but they give you enough of a heads up to make it easy on you."
College Freshman,4,"As an education major, I have enough help in the department and have my ear to the ground on several job possibilities. Finding a part time job until then has been easy."
College Freshman,4,"By and large, I feel safe on campus. We have our own police department, not glorified mall cop. They can be self-righteous at times and turn a blind eye to some of the parties, but they keep the peace."
College Freshman,4,"As a member of FIJI, Greek Life has a good impact on the campus and surrounding community. However, the poster child and black face of greeks (you know who you are) throw parties and get hammered any day that ends in a Y."
College Freshman,4,"My school is really big on the spectrum of learning, though like HS there is a bit of a focus to sports rather than education."
Recent Alumnus,4,I am an intern here in the athletic department!
College Junior,4,"My overall experience has been great in all aspects including my academic program, my interest and effectiveness of classes and teacher relationships. My classes are never too big to be overshadowed and I have always gained extra help as needed with ease. The school also offers free tutoring for the more difficult classes on campus so all students can succeed."
College Junior,4,"there are many different housing options to choose from and each one has different amenities to match the student's needs. It is easy to make new friends, but also easy to maintain privacy. the application process is simple and the cost is comparable to any other small university."
College Junior,4,Greek life on campus is very involved in the community and is constantly raising money as well as volunteering around the city. Each on campus greek house has an event that the entire campus may participate in at least twice a semester. This makes it easy for non-greeks and greeks to have relationships with one another and avoid dividing the campus.
College Junior,4,My school has a recently renovated health and sports center open to all students who enjoy working out. My school also has high school spirit for all sports events and even intramurals.
College Junior,4,"I transferred to this school for the amazing radiography program. Because I was a transfer student I was extremely nervous my first semester, however by the end of the semester all of my teachers knew me by name and what my work was like. My grades sky rocketed and I was thrilled to be presented with my very first deans list award. I now have three additional deans list awards, lifelong friends, and teachers that I can still communicate with. Because of the teachers dedication to personally improving every students education along with building relationships I would without a doubt choose my school again. If given the chance to start college again I would have never transferred to UNK, but rather would have started there from the beginning."
College Sophomore,4,"There are multiple programs offered to students in need, and there are always people there to offer help and support to those who need it."
College Sophomore,4,"All of the teams get a good turnout for games or matches, and the other athletic teams often come to support any and all other athletic teams. The environment is fun to participate in and be involved in."
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is friendly and talk to each other in halls.
College Sophomore,4,They do great things for their sorority.
College Sophomore,4,I love how close it is to my hometown.  Also love how friendly everyone is on campus.  There are many different events you can go to weekly.
College Freshman,4,You can almost always find a UNK PD around and there are emergency light stands spread around campus. I feel pretty safe on campus. As a victim of sexual assault not on campus I can say that it is sometimes hard for me to feel safe. I can walk around campus with head phones in and still feel like I am pretty safe. I appreciate how effective the precautions are and I am very thankful to the PD that help keep our campus safe.
College Freshman,4,"You will always find at least one professor any where you go that you do not get along with or don't like their teaching methods, but you can be assured with coming to UNK that you will also find a teacher that you absolutely love. Classes will have their own difficult parts, but if you enjoy the professor or the topic chances are the material will come easy to you as well. Classes aren't normally huge, but if you get a lecture class they will be a little larger than other classes offered at UNK which are still smaller than normal classes at other schools."
College Freshman,4,"I had to live in Mantor my first year because of a scholarship, but I love it and I hope to stay in this building until I graduate. There are some places that could use some fixes, like the water damage from the flood last year, but for the most part it is great. You get to meet a lot of people and make a lot of friends."
College Freshman,2,No body seems to respects Greek life except for the people in Greek life. The sorority girls are not very well liked and the fraternity boys are pretty arrogant. Most of the Greek groups have housing just for them.
College Freshman,2,You don't meet many people. Very isolated.
College Freshman,2,They lost my papers several times and I was very upset about it.
College Freshman,2,"Our dorm building is really old and you can tell. My first night staying on campus, the roof leaked in my room right onto my bed. The paint is chipping everywhere. Girls in my wing were in the hall past quite hours being really loud with our R.A. and they were talking badly about my roommate."
College Freshman,2,Drugs on campus and off campus are big deal and they need to be more strict on the punishments involved and need to stop the drug trend from growing
College Sophomore,2,"It seems to be available around, I stay away from those things."
College Freshman,2,Can't get into sports cause the teams suck.
College Freshman,2,There is no cheap way to get to and from Nebraska and Florida.
College Freshman,2,"I've been on my own for two years, but the government still says I'm a dependent. Getting aid is difficult, even through ROTC and the Nebraska National Guard."
College Freshman,2,"Small town, still growing. Not much to do."
College Freshman,2,No transportation options. You need a car to do anything off campus.
College Freshman,2,I have to walk across campus at night by myself all of the time. It's defineitly scary but nothing has happened to me yet. Feel much safer with a group of people.
College Freshman,2,Small town so there is basically just chain fast food places to eat. There aren't any really good sit down places to eat.
College Freshman,2,I've lived in a big city my whole life and I thought that  living in a smaller city would be fun because the sense of community would be stronger but I was wrong. The town is very small and most people who live here are actually rather rude. There is also not a lot to do off campus which is boring.
College Sophomore,2,i am an art education major... i dont understand why i have to take math and other such classes to help my students in the class
College Sophomore,2,i am a vegitarian. everyday i would have to get subway or eat upstairs and have only pizza or cereal!
College Sophomore,2,"Alot of off campus housing is house rentals, and most people are uncomfortable with it cus you kinda dont feel as safe sharing the house ."
College Sophomore,2,The cafeteria food isn't very good. It seems to be greasy and there isn't very much variety. Also they don't seem to have the necessary everyday staples.
College Freshman,2,"The food does not taste that great, except at the beginning and end of the year when the food is good. During the middle, it feels like they fired the good cooks."
College Freshman,2,"Drugs aren't as bad as the alcohol usage at UNK. It is obvious that the majority of people go out to drink on the weekends and for ""thirsty thursday."" You hear about parties with alcohol getting busted all the time."
College Freshman,1,Not even real chapters. I wanted to join before.
College Freshman,1,I accidentally slept through a practice fire alarm. I had never heard their fire alarms before so it didn't even occur to me that it was a fire alarm. The hall director made a huge deal out of it. He accused me of lying and didn't believe that I was sleeping. The whole situation was blown out of the water in my opinion and it has gone on my permanent record now. But everything else I don't really have a problem with.
College Sophomore,1,when i lived on capus i had to pay quite a bit of money to park on campus...but there were never any spots open. now that i live off campus i have to walk to school because there is no parking anywhere aroud campus 8am-4pm
College Sophomore,1,"ive gone in to the finance aid office to ask for help finding scholarships, all they did was hand me a piece of paper with scholarship listings and sent me on my way"
College Sophomore,1,"Ugh.. Parking is not the best, whether you are a commuter or on campus resident. And they just took out one of our parking lots to expand the health and sports center. Also finding a good parking spot is hard work."
College Freshman,1,"There is a lack of space available to park on campus. Not everyone who lives in the residence halls can even have a permit. The commuter lot outside Men's Hall is filled at 8:00 AM because there are so few spots to park. When an event happens during the weekdays on campus, there isn't room to park in most of the residence lots. Moreover, the parking permits cost too much at $100, considering that students may not even be able to park in the area designated by permit because space is so short and getting shorter with more and more building projects."
College Freshman,1,"At UNK, barely anybody goes to the Loper athletic events. It just isn't seen as an important aspect of the campus life."
College Sophomore,1,"Our campus is incredibly strict about alcohol and drug use. There used to be the saying, ""you can't spell drunk without UNK"" but those accusations have been completely proven false since I've been here. Cops are all over: on campus, off campus, and at your parties on friday night. They seem as bored in this town as we are, and get their fun by ruining the chances of ours."
College Sophomore,1,Meal Plan – The campus requires students to have a meal plan if they live on campus. In order to get out of this expensive meal plan you are required to write a letter to the board you must go talk with the director and jump through many more obstacles in order to get out of this strict meal plan.
College Freshman,1,"Well first of all there is never enough spots for all the students.  Second of all, if you do finally find a spot, you have to walk a great deal before you can get to the correct building.  Lots of people are terrible parkers and take up multiple parking spots which just makes it so much harder to find a spot."
College Senior,1,"Chartwell's is very poor.  The quality of food is terrible, and the choice is very small."
College Senior,1,"More Commuter and Residential parking tags are issued than there are spaces available.  With the improvements made to Bruner Hall and others projects happening, there are even less spaces available for commuters and residents.  Parking 4 blocks away and walking to class when I have a commuter tag is ridiculous and disrespectful to us that are paying for the service."

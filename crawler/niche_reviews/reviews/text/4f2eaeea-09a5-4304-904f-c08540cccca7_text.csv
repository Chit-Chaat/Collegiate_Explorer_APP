Alum,5,"Where do I begin... I moved to Portland from the Southeastern United States and immediately fell in love with both Reed and the city itself. Growing up I never felt as though I was really where I wanted to be. I was always curious about things others weren't and constantly searching to gain more knowledge about any and everything. 

I found that community at Reed. I can't say everyone there was constantly as curious as I was, but I can certainly say the vast majority of students were. My day to day conversations went from protein-protein interactions to whether Dionysus was influenced by the Egyptian god Osiris to whether or not cereal is a form of soup. 

I studied biochemistry at Reed and although I was nervous about studying science at a Small Liberal Arts College, I quickly realized the beauty in not battling grad students for resources. I'm a published scientific author and I don't even have a masters degree. 

I took a chance on Reed and it changed my life for the better."
Alum,5,"I did not take any online classes while enrolled at Reed, but I can say from what I've heard the college has been really amazing at making sure the classes are as close to the in person experience as they possibly can be."
Freshman,5,"Just started my freshman year here online because of the COVID-19. I expected it to be worse, but classes are engaging and professors are always willing to help you, since the school is small."
Freshman,5,"My classes are all online. I can watch lectures in my own time, and in class we practice and ask questions."
Sophomore,5,Great professors and very intellectual atmosphere. People are generally very nice and usually talk about academically related subjects. Beautiful campus!
Freshman,5,"I came to Reed expecting to be disappointed, and I was surprised. Immediately upon arriving at Orientation, staff and students made an effort to help me find my place at Reed. The campus is beautiful and downtown PDX is easily accessible. However, since we aren't in the heart of the city, I don't feel unsafe walking across campus most nights. I honestly love my dorm, it's the best I've seen of all my friends at other schools. I think Reed still has places to improve, but I do believe that these improvements will be made because of how involved student government is, unlike other colleges. Lastly, I'd say that Reed is can still be a great fit for those not fitting under the 'super liberal hippie nerd' stereotype that some Reedies perpetuate. A lot of my friends at Reed don't fit the mold at all and have since relayed their happiness in their decision to go to Reed because it was a place where they aren't the archetypal student."
Freshman,5,"I really like the professors here. They treat you like their colic and help you in everyway possible.
The canyon is beautiful and the library is a great resource too. You'll find your unique intellectual circle and enjoy your experience at Reed."
Junior,5,"I think the relationships that students have with professors is really unique, and I can't imagine it being better at any other college. Classes are engaging and challenging, though sometimes academics can overwhelm social life."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Reed recently and I now work in financial services in NYC. Reflecting on my undergrad experience, I received a wonderful liberal arts education from a faculty of amazing professors. Reed offers a rigorous academic program, but also has a wonderfully quirky and liberal culture / social scene. Other miscellaneous thoughts: students have lots of autonomy, most campus dorms are nice or new, the campus is very safe and scenic, renn fayre is fun, the cafeteria (Commons) has good food, and Portland is an awesome city with lots to do, great food to eat, and lots of beer to drink."
Freshman,5,"The Reed experience is definitely very subjective in that you need to have a Reedie mindset before actually attending the school. In my time here, I've found that most students here have a strong ""work hard, play hard"" mindset. This definitely doesn't mean we're a party school (we're far too nerdy for that), but we do some... interesting things to pass the time (I was recently approached by a concerned Campus Safety Officer who wanted to know if I was feeling a bit hot. When I replied ""girl, I'm always hot,"" she nodded and walked away. I was standing in the middle of a parking lot wearing a hat that was on fire). Do keep in mind that the ""work hard"" portion of the saying is not messing around: practically  everyone here sees a therapist because we're all so overwhelmed with work. 

Also, we have a nuclear reactor."
Freshman,5,"Reed college is a beautiful, unique intellectual community. People are kind, passionate, warm and genuinely care about one another. The workload is tough, but there is a great variety of programs and resources to make use of to stay on track. Though notoriously liberal, it is not an ""echo chamber"" because students all form their own opinions and ideas within that ""liberal"" umbrella. Professors are engaged and care deeply for students. The living situation is incredibly nice - dorms are ""divided doubles"" most of the time, meaning that you get both a roommate and your own room. Reed is the best education that this nation offers if you are able to fit it."
Freshman,5,"The students are kind and open, and the campus is gorgeous. Everyone is so passionate about being intellectual, and the atmosphere is bursting with intention."
Sophomore,5,"REED IS  a great school with a very in-depth education. Teachers are very dedicated to the students and higher learning. You are likely to be very competitive coming out of the school, ranking better than top colleges including Harvard and Stanford."
Freshman,5,"So thrilled to be here at Reed, I'd recommend it for anyone who wants to be in a challenging academic environment, surrounded by folks willing to talk about Kantian Ethics at 2am !"
Niche User,5,"Incredible academic atmosphere and genuine dedication to the student attracted me to this institution.  The progressive approach to helping students become well- rounded graduates is unparalleled.  This school stands alone with their culture and student activities, there is truly no experience quite like it.  Feeling like a peer when collaborating with professors definitely helps to develop dialogue with professionals in your field after graduation."
Alum,5,"Reed College was an amazing experience. I went there for about two semesters, non-consecutively, before transferring to a school closer to my friends and family. The academics were extremely rigorous and advanced compared to every other school I've been to. The faculty was understanding and supportive, and most of the students there are open-minded and friendly. Reed is a great school."
College Sophomore,5,"I have felt incredibly safe at Reed, though I am also a masculine bodied person.  Many of my friends, however, who are of much more vulnerable groups similarly feel that Reed is an incredibly safe place; both including non-students and among students."
College Sophomore,5,"It seems like all the professors I've encountered genuinely care about my understanding of the material. Although the work they assign is hard, there are resources available to help me out when I need them."
College Sophomore,5,"Reed is challenging and supportive, both of which I never had in high school."
College Freshman,5,"Community Safety officers are super sweet and have always been super polite and nice to me. Just don't do dumb, obvious stuff and you won't have a problem."
College Sophomore,5,"I have loved nearly all the classes I have taken. Professors are always eager to talk to you and help you with anything, and they love to get to know you as a person too. Professors certainly demand a lot from you but are there to support you. Class sizes are small which encourages more discussion-based learning and a more personal environment with your classmates and professors. The academics are definitely the best part of this school."
College Sophomore,5,"Our alumni network is very strong, and everyone in the Reed community is willing and eager to help you find jobs. Some majors have more difficulty finding work (the humanities majors) but other majors have plenty of options and opportunities (the science majors)."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Reed college is a well-equipped school, but with regards to human resources and material facilities. The academic level is high, students are serious and dedicated and hard-working. Class sizes are small and most upper-level classes are conference style, which enhances student commitment and responsibility for the material at hand"
Recent Alumnus,5,Athletics is not a priority for the majority of students at Reed. There are facilities for those who are interested and they are just fine.
College Freshman,5,"Reed is absolutely amazing. There's definitely a love/hate relationship--be prepared to get your ass kicked with frequent late nights, mind-boggling readings, hard-ass professors, and more. Remember THAT week in high school? That's every single week at Reed. But honestly, it's so incredibly worth it. It's so rewarding to have exceptionally passionate professors whose top priority is to teach you, and to have close relationships and rapport with them. The community is so weird and caring and empathetic and open, for the most part. It's hard to describe Reed, the experience is so so unique in itself. But if you are ready to be challenged intellectually on an exceptional level, if you are ready to be part of an vibrant and devoted community--then it is probably for you."
College Sophomore,5,I like the intellectual environment and highly engaged professors.
College Freshman,5,"I have no idea why (as of the time of writing this review) the grade for people at Reed is so low. I've never seen so many attractive people in one place in my life. Also, the guy/girl dichotomy on this website isn't fair to all of the non-binary cuties on campus."
College Freshman,5,"Community Safety Officers (CSOs) are ever-present and are the sweetest human beings on planet earth. They hand out trading cards with their pictures and interests on them!! They even have game nights!! I've never heard of a student who had a bad interaction with a CSO. They do have to report you if they catch you doing anything that violates the AOD policy, but unless you are VERY blatant with your substance use chances are you won't get caught."
College Sophomore,5,On-campus resources are genuinely helpful and always available to students in any emergency.
College Sophomore,5,"Great gym and sports facilities, but no sports culture - which is AMAZING!!!"
College Sophomore,5,The administration truly cares about students and isn't just a faceless bureaucracy like at some schools.
College Sophomore,5,Financial aid proved to be very helpful and relatively hassle-free.
College Sophomore,5,The dormitories are beautiful and the food is much better than at other colleges. The professors are by far the greatest at what they do and really care about their students. Administrators and faculty are here to help students and not just enforce rules. Reed College is a place where everyone really cares about the education and institution.
College Freshman,5,Portland has better food than most of the world
College Freshman,5,Portland is a hip-happenin' place!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
College Freshman,5,There are a whole bunch of nice / convenient restaurants within walking distance.
College Freshman,5,Reed is very generous with the amount of money they give out. Most of my tuition is covered by grants!
College Freshman,5,It's the best. Really. Work hard. Play hard. Good luck. Don't be a dick.
College Freshman,5,Grad school loves Reed kids.  Anything will be easier after Reed.
College Freshman,5,"Love it. Fantastic. There's a place for anyone. In one phrase, ""work hard, play hard."" Good luck in your college search!"
College Freshman,5,"If you don't have intimacy issues, or are into sex/romance at all, you'll be able to find whatever you're looking for quite easily. If you do have intimacy issues, or aren't into sex/romance at all, people are respectful of that. There are good looking guys and girls, although I would say my taste in people is weird sometimes. There's a variety of looks and sexualities, to say the least. A lot of people are open to a lot of things. I hope you find what you're looking for."
College Freshman,5,"Reed has a great reputation with great grad schools, so if you're into that, Reed will help you get into a fantastic graduate program after you leave Reed. Freshman year isn't difficult, but gives you the building blocks to deal with the upcoming storm that is compromised of your later years at Reed. Class get harder and more interesting. Truly, only come here if you are interested in learning and can work hard, otherwise you will have a terrible time. The science, history (including art history) and english departments are particularly respected."
College Freshman,5,"Professors are highly-educated and highly-respected, most have PhDs, and no classes are taught by TAs. But, given the variety of professors, there's a chance that you'll have teachers whose styles you don't like, and that's a fact at all schools. But, they will respect you if you talk to them and try to work with them. They are always willing to hear counterpoints and arguments, and don't mind questions. You'll get the nice teachers and the more intense teachers, the harder graders and the more lenient ones, but one thing they all have in common is their desire for you to truly understand the material. There are many tutoring opportunities, and you're surrounded by so many smart people who are willing to help out, and not be pretentious about it. You can study in the beautiful Performing Arts Building (PAB), outside, anywhere outside, Commons, the cafes, etc. Many picturesque options, lots of quiet options. Curriculum gets exponentially harder, especially junior and senior years. Come here expecting to work hard. Make a point to make lots of friends freshman and sophomore year, and learn how to study."
College Freshman,5,"Some days I don't care about anything except how beautiful the campus is. I try my best not to skip class but sometimes I just lie down and admire, it's hard not to. Some of the dorms are average looks-wise. But overall it's gorgeous to a fault."
College Freshman,5,"It really tells you something that the most unsafe I've ever felt was when nearby school students come to campus parties. Not to say that the majority of them are bad, I've met more great people from off-campus than not, but consent is a very, very big deal at Reed, and from what I've experienced at some other schools, this emphasis is not as great. Reed feels very safe, I actually get kinda nervous at parties at other schools, especially big state ones. But, as is unfortunately the case, always be careful at parties, regardless of where you are."
College Freshman,5,"Say, theoretically, your friend is puking so hard that the puking scene from the Exorcist looks like casual drooling. Say, theoretically, you also happen to be inebriated, but in a functional way. Your friend definitely needs hep, but are you going to get in trouble for calling campus security to help out? Nah. Reed has a great medical amnesty policy, so you will not get in trouble for getting help for your friend. Reed has a somewhat contentious relationship with the Portland Police Department, in which the police aren't called, unless in a very serious, violent situation. In the case of a dumb, drunk college kid, the Campus Security helps out swiftly and courteously. You're not going to get in trouble for something unless you're being obnoxious, stupid, or dangerous. Don't be any of those, and you'll be fine."
College Freshman,5,"Oh man. Whatever you want, it's within walking distance. Food carts? Oh yeah. There are myriad options to choose from. It'll hit your wallet not from price, but from the amount of food you'll probably be buying. If you drive/walk/bike/bus system, there are even more options, it's ridiculous. Hammy's Pizza delivers until 3 in the morning. There are great places to hit up for brunch, and Farmer's Markets and fruit stands. So. Much. Food. For cheap, and good quality."
College Junior,5,Reed is well known for its academics. 
College Sophomore,5,"Lots of food carts all over Portland provide good, cheap food. There are a few decent places within close walking distance, but taking a short bus ride will give you greater options."
College Junior,5,"All Reed seniors must write a senior thesis and defend it in order to graduate. This is an extremely laborious task and the culmination of one's time at Reed. Although some other colleges have honors programs tat require a thesis, the universality of the Reed thesis showcases the rigor of our academics and shapes how students learn. The knowledge that we will all embark on this task and complete it to join our fellow alumni is empowering and fosters a wonderful sense of community."
Recent Alumnus,5,Every major at Reed is intense and would be an honors major elsewhere.  All students take a qualifying exam in their major in the junior year and write a thesis in the senior year.
Recent Alumnus,5,"This is a big topic of debate.   In the past, there have been those who misused the unusual freedoms of Reed to their own detriment."
Recent Alumnus,5,Community Safety Officers and new head of safety keep things safe.
College Sophomore,5,"I Love Portland. Portland is a great city, probably the most liberal city in the U.S. It does have its drawbacks, like historical racial issues (unequal public school funding, gentrification, etc.), but overall, it's way better than most of the U.S., in my opinion. Way more vegan culture and delicious eats here. Way more respect for the environment. Way more small, local business, that don't channel money into megacorporations. There's a great underground music scene, winter and summer. Reed doesn't have the best reputation in the wealthier, more conservation neighborhood south of the College. Sometimes Portlanders regard Reedies as privileged white rich hipster kids that like to party and do drugs and quote great classic literature (and to some degree they can be this way, haha). But overall Portland is pretty much all hipsters anyway, and Reed's overall reputation is good. It's definitely known for it's intense academics, intellectualism, and it seen as somewhat elite. A friend of mine described it as an ""intellectual wonderland""."
College Sophomore,5,"A Very Autonomous Environment – The Honor Principle is the prevailing rule here at Reed; it holds that, in any given situation, a person should do whatever is most honorable. This can obviously be interpreted in many ways, and this is part of the collaborative and dynamic nature of the Honor Principle. It's part of what makes Reed such a great and unusual place. People come here because they respect the philosophy of the Honor Principle and want to live by it themselves, and be in a community in which others do as well. It's common for people who've lost things like phones, jewelry, etc., to have it returned quickly. A friend of mine lost a laptop; it was turned in to Community Safety within an hour or two. It's a pretty great system that gives each member of a community a lot of freedom, and, along with it, responsibility. I love it."
College Sophomore,5,"Many Opportunities, Good Access – The academic programs are well-structured and all culminate in a thesis that students work on throughout senior year, and some start the summer before. Professors and students often are close and even work together sometimes, and it's not uncommon for a professor to host a casual get-together in his/her home for his/her class. The professors care about the students and their academics, but they themselves are also active in academia. There is a great sports center with classes from yoga to fencing to weights to ballet. A new performing arts center is under construction. There's Prexy, the music building, with around 10 pianos, plus other instruments. There's a small nuclear reactor. A greenhouse for biology students. A sound-proof room for psychology testing. A wide array of materials in the chemistry stockroom. A library with maps hundreds of years old. There's quite a bit of opportunity here. Campus life is very much a tight-knit bubble, but it's still very lively and active. Social life can be great here if you want it to be, and if you want to just focus completely on academics, you can do that too."
College Sophomore,5,"Single Dorms for (Almost) All! Pretty much the only people who get roommates are freshman--and they almost always have divided doubles, which are two separate rooms connected by one door, with one room having the door to the hallway. Almost everyone else gets their own room, which is awesome. All of the rooms are pretty spacious and comfortable as well."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I really enjoyed my time at Reed; it exceeded my expectations. 

The academics here really stand out– the professors are engaging, approachable, and will usually go out of their way to help you succeed, the courses are always challenging and sometimes mind-blowing, the other students are bright, have interesting things to contribute and usually make class more interesting. While you are challenged more than you ever really thought possible, it is also incredibly rewarding. Writing a thesis is one of my proudest achievements.

I really love the campus atmosphere and beautiful aesthetics, as well as the surrounding city. Talking a walk through campus during any season is something you won't regret. Portland is a great place to live as a young person.

Students always seem up to some crazy hijinks, and there are a lot of opportunities to unwind and de-stress after a long week. There are some really cool student organizations, half of which have to do with free food or free beer. I feel like most people can find their niche here. It is a small and sometimes insular community, for better or worse.

The administration is a lot more flexible and student-oriented than people give them credit for. Students have a decent amount of say in the way things are run (there is a student representative on several important committees) and the way student body funds are spent is entirely decided by us. It seems like if you make enough noise about an issue it will be addressed, so it's possible to effect change.

I love Reed, especially the people here, and I would do it all over again in a heartbeat."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Woodstock and Eastmoreland:
Not the most exciting neighborhoods, but you have all your basics within walking distance (grocery store, gas station, a decent amount of restaurants and bars, a hardware store, Bi-Mart). Eastmoreland is a wealthier residential neighborhood comprised of retirees who like to complain about Reed while attending its public lectures and a lot of families. Woodstock is pretty middle-of-the-road, it kind of feels like a small-town main street. Both are safe.

Portland:
Portland is a fantastic place to live. It's easy to get around via bus (and soon via train/streetcar as they expand into the SE) and there is a ton of stuff going on all the time. Great music scene, great foodie scene, billions of local coffeeshops and breweries. The cool neighborhoods tend to be dominated by hipsters. Sometimes Reedies chose to live a little further off campus, usually in the Hawthorne/Belmont neighborhood. 
Go watch Portlandia if you want to see what living in Portland is like; it's not that far from the truth."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Reed is a very unique place in every sense of the word. Its students are unique, bright and quirky, its professors are unique in their talent and passion for teaching, its curriculum is unique especially Hum 110 and the rigorous senior thesis component, its campus traditions are unique, fun, and somewhat crazy."
Senior,4,"Reed is tough and the academics is especially challenging. Your ideas will be constantly challenged and you will be pushed to the limits, but you will be in a supportive community with smart peers and caring professors. Campus is beautiful all year round and life in Portland is generally great."
Alum,4,"Reed College is not a school for the careerist. Those that think they have achieved a sufficient amount of learning by simply earning high grades, in this age of grade inflation, will be best suited somewhere else with a larger alumni network that will non-chalantly hand you a job upon graduation. The heat that Reed College currently faces is due in part to its approach to education: students are to study and learn first before all other things such as partying, career networking, and entrepreneurship. There are those that do not feel that education is a top priority at college, but rather the ""social/life/business"" aspect. What can I say, people value appearances and status."
Freshman,4,"I would like to see more active clubs on campus. Also because it is a small college, many 100 level classes are hard to get into as a freshman."
Sophomore,4,"I've loved going to Reed,  I've met some amazing people and had a fantastic time learning in the environment that Reed provides its students."
Sophomore,4,"Everyone is very smart and open minded. However it is full of a bunch of very very rich liberals, many claiming to be radicals, who care more about abolishing cis than abolishing property and poverty. Just don't get fooled by ""communism, atheism, free love."" This is just another perpetuation of the liberal capitalist order. Community safety officers are so lit tho, they deserve more credit."
Freshman,4,"Reed College is incredibly demanding academically, but the community of support from students is an amazing thing to experience and to witness."
Sophomore,4,Reed challenges me academically and emotionally. It is very difficult to succeed but I enjoy the experience.
Sophomore,4,"Best part about Reed: The professors, the campus and the academic program.
Not so great part: The management"
Freshman,4,"Reed is very very challenging, but does encourage intellectual growth and personal development in its students. The campus is beautiful, and dorms are generally all above-average. Unfortunately, Reed is not particularly a diverse campus."
Freshman,4,"As a first year at Reed College, I have so far enjoyed my experiences. The academics are challenging but ultimately satisfying. I have complied a short list of the pros and cons of Reed college. 

Pros: Focus on the learning rather than the grades; Small classes; Liberal standing on most social problems; Nerdy and Geeky students that are obviously well educated; Small campus; little focus on sports or bodily appearance; can form close bonds with the professors; beautiful campus and fairly okay food

Cons: Some students/ professors have a bit of a haughty attitude; First and some of second year classes are lecture based (not like how the school was advertised to me); The school is a large majority white and that can effect academic subjects/ silence the people of color in the community; some professors listen and respect their students others do not; drugs are very prevalent but you can avoid them"
Freshman,4,"The academics are as rigorous as the rumors say. I may be biased, as a STEM major, but the workload can be a bit overwhelming at times. The campus is small, and the student body as well. There's definitely a strong sense of community, though, and there's something to cater to nearly every interest."
College Junior,4,"I like the courses, many were not what I expected in a really good way. I liked most of my professors, they were willing to work with me if I had any issues, they're very understanding and offer productive feedback."
College Junior,4,"I always feel pretty safe on campus. CSO's are friendly and great. usually you can go about your life without feeling like you're under strict watch, but if you do need something, CSO's are readily available, nice, and very willing to help."
College Junior,4,We don't have it and I really enjoy that.
College Junior,4,"We don't have competitive sports, but the PE classes and Sports complex are really interesting and fun. wide variety of stuff to choose from, some off campus, some pretty unique stuff. clean, nice facilities"
College Junior,4,"Really glad I ended up at Reed. I like our school's culture, though sometimes it can get a little stuck on itself. Fun events, sweet people, really great classes, good club choices. Really queer friendly, not so racially diverse. Generally really tolerant, progressive, and safe school. Serious about learning, but definitely have a lot of fun too."
College Sophomore,4,"Courses are incredibly difficult, and we go into every class expecting this."
College Sophomore,4,"All the dorm are only open as lottery options, and the quality differences between there are pretty drastic  One complex, FSM, is very much like a hospital ward, while another complex, the Groves, are almost entirely perfectly designed conference rooms and housing."
College Sophomore,4,"This first year at Reed has by far been one of the most expansive experiences of my life.  I don't think I ever would have had or taken this academic, social, relational, business opportunities anywhere else, and the level to which they spur you on to live your life is incredible."
College Sophomore,4,"If you need help, you can get it regardless of what you've been doing. Medical Amnesty is great."
College Sophomore,4,"I've been told that in the realm of academia, Reed is exceedingly well known. Outside of academia, well, it's not very popular. But so many Reed grads go on to earn even higher education that I doubt that is a real problem."
College Sophomore,4,"I've never felt unsafe on campus, but I have friends who have been uncomfortable alone at night."
College Sophomore,4,"I lived in Sub-free housing my freshman year and loved it. We have a great community in Sullivan, and although I can't really speak for any other building I think it's similar elsewhere."
College Freshman,4,"Except for the dorms in FSM, the housing at Reed is definitely above average. Sometimes people can get pretty gross in the bathrooms and kitchens; nothing you wouldn't find at another college."
College Freshman,4,"There's a large variety of pretty cool PE classes, which is required at Reed. Students that I have heard that play sports really enjoy doing so. Definitely don't go here for the athletics; but if you'd like to remain in athletics and be healthy, there are options and the facilities to do so."
College Sophomore,4,"Reed is definitely a unique place, and I really like it here. The academics are very demanding and it can get very stressful, though it all seems worth it. The people can be hard to get to know but everyone is truly unique and interesting, and very kind. Reedies look out for each other, which makes it much easier to be a student here."
College Junior,4,"My time at Reed so far has been amazing. While there's always the occasional bump in the road that makes me question my decision to attend Reed, I honestly think that if I was to do it all over again, my choice would still be the same. While I can go on and on about how great the academics are, one thing that never ceases to amaze me about Reed is its uncanny ability to allow you to be who you want to be. The college puts everyone under an immense amount of stress, which ultimately forces you to find the activities and the people who you love, relatively early on. Early in my freshman year, for example, I made friends with a group of really great people. We studied together, watched movies together, went on adventures together, and when we got really stressed out, we played chair-tag with the rolling chairs in the new Performing Arts Building. Essentially, you do what you want, you be who you want, whenever you want, and everyone still loves you for it, without judgement. Coming from New England, it was quite the culture shock when I realized that there's no pressure to conform, here. I think that is what is really great about Reed.

I'm attaching the link to Reed's newest admissions video, because it's fantastic.  www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-rd69yZw_w"
College Sophomore,4,We have good student DJ's
College Freshman,4,"Each dorm community has it's own pro/con list, but no place is so awful that you wouldn't want to live there. Even the buildings notorious for falling apart (the cross-canyon dorms) have such an excellent community that people choose to live there year after year."
College Sophomore,4,Quite a few houses and places to rent but the price range varies a lot.
College Sophomore,4,"Plenty of great restaurants to choose from, and all within walking distance. However, the pricing is pretty steep and they haven't even heard of a student discount anywhere in this city."
College Sophomore,4,"Commons is pretty good and swinging by Caffe Paradiso once in a while can prove to be rewarding when they have decent specials. Also, Paradiso has great ice-cream."
College Sophomore,4,"Delta, Tom Yum,  Tani's, foodcarts... yum."
College Sophomore,4,Expects students to behave like adults.
College Sophomore,4,"Wish they we had more ""good dorms"" than ""bad"". Our nicest dorms are amazing, and the not so nice ones aren't really the worst it could be. So, overall, compared to most other colleges we hear about , it's pretty good."
College Freshman,4,On campus food is always super yummy even if the pricing in Commons can be steep.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus because I know that as soon as I call the on-campus security they'll be there in a heartbeat. They're all super nice and have their own trading cards!!!
College Freshman,4,"Reed is always helpful in job hunts and internship positions. I haven't had the time to have either of these yet, but they are there."
College Freshman,4,"I've heard it described as ""the most diverse group of white people you'll ever meet"" but that's only partially true. But mostly it's true. There are  a lot of white people, but the more interesting variety. You don't get a lot of cookie-cutter white people, which is nice. I'm a white person, but my whole family is from Iran, I have another caucasian friend who speaks fluent Spanish and Swedish, another caucasian friend who has lived in New Zealand for several years. SO, if you're into that, Reed has that type in plenty. People are very open about their sexualities. One thing I've learned is that assume nothing about anybody. Really, if you have a ""gay-dar"" it won't work here. You can't tell. It also isn't relevant, unless you're trying to sleep with someone/ date them, but even then, if you're at that point, you'll know."
College Freshman,4,"Most weekend nights there are off campus parties or dances in the SU, but sometimes, if the stars and due dates align, many people are too worn out/broke to throw parties, but you can always hang out with your friends and throw one in the dorms, or sit around and wallow. It kind of depends on the attitude you bring. You're ready to party? You'll find something. Want to chill out, take it easy? You'll find something to do. Want to sleep? You have a bed. Want to study? That's respected and admired. This is a very ""work hard play hard"" kind of school, but you will not be pressured to do anything you want to do. I've met maybe a couple of people who look down on substance-free people, but people who judge people like that are few and far between. Substance free is not going to be deleterious toward your social life. Do what feels comfy, and you'll do great!"
College Freshman,4,"Commons, in partnership with Bon Appetit, is surprisingly yummy, but pricey. Homer's Hut (known to literally only 2 people as Jabba's) has pre-prepared food like Amy's and Annie's. Homer's is open until 3 am, which is dangerous. Paradox is student run, so sometimes you get yummy pastries and sometimes you get not-too-good coffee, it depends. You can apply to have your own baked goods sold through Paradox. It's better than many schools. You'll always have healthy options, and the grill has great burgers, and there are great desserts, and amazing chocolate milk, but some days nothing looks good. It happens."
College Freshman,4,"If you're do a major you actually want to do and are interested in it, you're gonna have a good (albeit rough) time. Freshman year is pretty easy, but it grows exponentially harder, so be prepared for that. There's a reason Reed has the academic reputation it does. Hum is kind of annoying freshman year, but you learn a lot of core skills from it that will be necessary for the rest of your school and work career, like how to present your arguments well, how to agree/disagree with people, writing skills, etc. Just power through it. You'll be able to take lots of interesting classes in addition to major requirements, so that's nice. The science programs in particular (biochem, psych, etc.) are renown, as well as the english department, and art history."
College Freshman,4,"It really really really depends on which dorm you're in. Living in a small campus has made me so lazy. For example, Sullivan is maybe only a 5 minute walk from the rest of campus, tops, but it's enough to be annoying, especially when it's cold. It does have the benefits of a full kitchen, so that's nice, and it is quiet, so if you actually want to sleep, it's great, but for social stuff, a little isolated. The Grove buildings are gorgeous, but also far (5 minutes). ODB is closest to everything, but doesn't have ovens or stoves, rooms can be either small or huge. So really, it does depend. Hope you get lucky!"
College Freshman,4,"I'm not planning on living off-campus until maybe my junior year, but I've been to several off-campus homes and know people who live on campus, and all report it being very easy to get housing. If you want apartments or houses, there are nearby options."
College Freshman,4,"If you have the time to go out on the weekends/weekdays, there's always some big thing going on on campus or off of it.  If you get your work done during the week you can always get out of the Reed bubble on the weekends, or walk down Woodstock and find something to do."
College Junior,4,No need for a car. 
College Junior,4,We have to take qualifying exams. 
College Junior,4,The financial aid office is great and always willing to explain the process to students.
College Junior,4,Computer services is pretty excellent.
College Junior,4,"There aren't a ton of options immediately in the neighborhood, but what is there is good and it isn't hard to venture out farther to more spots. Portland is a foodie city!"
College Junior,4,The bus system is pretty good in Portland and I use it all the time.
College Junior,4,"Dorms can vary pretty vastly, but the nicest ones are quite nice."
College Junior,4,It is challenging and rigorous and you will become a better student for it.
College Junior,4,For a small college we have a pretty broad selection of courses and every department is pretty great in their own ways.
College Junior,4,Portland is a very cool and amazing city. I feel more at home here than at my real home!
College Junior,4,I have learned such an incredible amount since beginning Reed and do not think other schools will teach you how to think as well.
College Sophomore,4,"You can get wireless internet almost all over campus. I've found this really convenient for my phone bill, because I can get a minimal data plan.
Unless you are crazy about printing everything, you really don't need a printer. Printers are all over campus, and you get a decent amount of printing credit to begin with. I printed only when I had to, and ended up with a lot of money left over. The speed has never been an issue; I could easily stream Netflix any time of the day.
Some words of warning, however: Like many campuses, Reed is really strict on illegally downloading copyrighted content. You can get you internet suspended for a week or two for torrenting a single song. So be careful there."
College Junior,4,"The psychology department at Reed is phenomenal. I may be biased, but it's really wonderful. Professors have a wide range of expertise, but all come together in a way that makes the department feel like a family. I've loved every psych class I've taken and wouldn't want anything else."
College Junior,4,"Reed is governed by the Honor Principle which is not easily defined. The basic core of the principle is to act with honor. If something seems dishonorable to you, do not do it. Although this seems very ambiguous and lax, I find it to be surprisingly wonderful and effective. Students really do strive to act with honor and uphold the Honor Principle."
College Junior,4,Reed has a beautiful campus. There is plenty of green/outdoor space between our spacious front lawn and the canyon. All of the facilities are very nice and mostly quite new.
College Sophomore,2,"The housing lottery itself is absolutely horrible because there are not enough spaces on campus for the student body and many people with disabilities are not given on campus housing because that could be seen as ""unfair"" to the able bodied students but it could risk someone's life to live off campus with their disability; however I'm not sure what it is like at different schools."
College Sophomore,2,"The student body is very white, and though the administration proclaims it's trying to get more diversity, their main concern is, of course, who brings in the most money."
College Sophomore,2,They only take into consideration fafsa and css. There aren't many options besides those two for struggling students.
College Freshman,2,"All people do is take a lot of drugs and then sit in silence in a room. Most Reedies don't know how to party and the school is so small that if you do party with some people you will be bored of them by sophmore year. If your looking to party in a traditional college way, reed is not for you."
College Junior,2,"Organized sports are relatively non existent, though there is a huge variety of PE courses."
College Junior,2,It's different to typical colleges.
College Junior,2,"It's not known for being hugely diverse, but I think the college does try to promote diversity and I think we have a surprising amount of international students for being such a small school."
College Senior,2,"Feels very rich and white.  50% of students pay full tuition.  Only 8 black freshmen last year...  We're getting better w/latino folks and it's a safer space than many for people of all/most genders/sexual orientations.  People from all of the country and world, which is nice.  You can build a diverse group of friends, the MRC is great for this, but you sort of have to work for it."
College Freshman,2,"Rain Rain Go Away – It is always rainy or cloudy. Or at least it feels that way. When a sunny day rolls in many people are outside, some of them are naked, trying to soak up what sun they can while it lasts.

If you like rain, it's okay..."
College Freshman,2,"The four year course plan for all hard science majors (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology) are extremely packed. To be able to graduate in four years (especially for a Physics major) you need to know as a Freshman you want to be a science major. Also, there is not a lot of room to take other classes that interest you :("
College Freshman,2,"Trying to Step up – Reed has a reputation for being tolerant of drug and alcohol use. The administration is trying to counteract this reputation by stepping up on punishment and policy enforcement. However, the first time punishments are not very severe."
College Junior,2,"Need-Based, Not Merit-Based – For my situation, it is very difficult to get financial aid because it is all need-based and not merit-based. Although on paper it may look like I have ample funds to pay for my VERY VERY expensive private, independent liberal arts college, it is not necessarily the case in real-life. From what I hear, however, students who are from low-income families find financial aid at Reed great and very worthwhile."
Senior,1,People only talk about how intellectual the college is supposed to be because anything else is either too below us or too hypocritical to claim. I would call it pseudo intellectual. Most professors are too plastic to stand. The Dojo a completely waste of space. The campus stinking with vanity.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no Greek life at Reed. Greek life is stupid and exclusionary, and host to a whole bunch of issues. It's historically damaging to a college and to students. Thus, we have none. Except maybe rugby or outhouse, but they're not technically separated by gender."
College Sophomore,1,We have no sports except for Ultimate Frisbee and Rugby. Anything else is unofficial. The Sports Center is quite nice I believe... I've only been inside a handful of times but the facilities seem up to date and clean and not too crowded and all that.
College Junior,1,"Too One Note and Not Enough Options – I get that a small school is limited in what it can offer but with that in mind they should have tried to make sure that each of the 7 professors in the poli sci department has a completely different focus. Instead they have 4 professors who focus just on American politics, one IR professor and 3 political philosophy professors. So basically if you want to study anything other than the US or philosophy (so basically about 90% of the poli sci field) that's not really an option here unless you get lucky with the random visiting comparative politics professor they bring in each year."
College Junior,1,"Plainly, It Sucks – You can't go anywhere if you're underaged. There really aren't any good clubs in Portland if you are over 21 either. At the parties on campus very few people dance. Most people just stand outside drinking their crappy hippster beer trying to make themselves sound smart."
College Junior,1,"My experience of Reed's diversity has been *very* different from what others have described here. As someone who attended an economically and racially diverse public school for high school, I was shocked by Reed's monolithic whiteness and Reedies' overall privilege. There are definitely exceptions, but the dominant culture at Reed is very much upper-middle class. Most students (in my experience) attended expensive private high schools, and the vast majority of American students there are from California or the Northeast. While Reed is definitely accepting of quirkiness, different sexual orientations, and social awkwardness (and there's something to be said for those things), it lacks in the departments of socioeconomic and racial diversity. While Reedies are, or try to be, accepting of most people, in such a monolithic environment privilege is sometimes not noticed or called into question, resulting, at times, in a weird, pretentious, ivory-tower culture. Reedies have a tradition of proudly boasting that Reed isn't a trade school, for example (and one went so far as to shout this during a debate over whether or not the school newspaper should serve as a means of gaining experience in journalism). Most Reedies seem completely unaware of the classism inherent in demeaning trade schools. It's a small example, to be sure, but it's indicative of the way Reed's lack of diversity sometimes creeps into the public dialogue without being challenged."

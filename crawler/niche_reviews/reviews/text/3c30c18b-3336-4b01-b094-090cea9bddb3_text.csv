Freshman,5,"Location-close to home, Great Professors, Smaller Classes-better learning environment and more individualized attention if needed, Cost of Education."
Freshman,5,"I love that this is a small school. More intimate classes, 16 to 1 student-professor ratio. I would love if this campus had dorms owned by the college, and an updated cafeteria."
Junior,5,"Penn State Wilkes-Barre is a quiet campus in Lehman, Pennsylvania. They offer an assortment of academics, athletic programs, and student assistance. Professors there are easy to work with. The campus is beautiful. Parties shouldn't determine where a student will attend college. There is a limited party scene here. There isn't much in the immediate area, but Dallas is nearby, offering many places to eat and shop."
College Freshman,5,"Since this is Penn State there is a very large alumni association, and I beleive that this will be helpful in finding a job"
College Freshman,5,I love going to my school because the teachers are wonderful and extremely helpful. Everyone on campus is very welcoming and it was easy to find a great group of people to be with.
College Junior,5,Professors are very Knowledgeable and are there to help students
College Junior,5,The school is very safe and clean
College Junior,5,This school fits what i wanted for a school
College Junior,5,School provides easy access to interships
College Junior,5,They have a very good Athletics department
College Junior,5,PennState Wilksbare is a small relaxing campus
Recent Alumnus,5,"Being a Penn State campus, the degree you earn here will be regarded very highly."
Recent Alumnus,5,Classes are small and all of the professors genuinely care. Many are adjunct professors and only teach once a week. But almost all professors will learn your name after 2 or 3 classes and you get to know them as well.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The campus is small, with little going on. Here are a few security guards and other staff that walk around campus during the day. At night, there are street lights and emergency buttons just in case."
College Freshman,5,Financial aid paid off my full tuition
College Freshman,5,"I gave everything a 5 star rank, and for a very important reason. Technology on this campus is the best 100% no flaws. Wireless is great everything you name it, it is 100% perfected here. "
College Freshman,5,"It is the best because, the campus security is there, but not everywhere. This is great because you have freedoms to do what you want. No checking in, or doing any of that stupid stuff. Just freedom and liberty. "
College Senior,5,"Well, I am a transferred student and the program that I joined has been working with Luzerne County Community College (where I transferred from), so getting into my program wasn't difficult at all. Normally for students to get into a program, they have to be sophomores and had fulfilled the required courses."
College Senior,5,"What I love the most about my school is that in there I am not just a number, I am me. The staff and faculty know me by my name. They notice things about their students. And most importantly, they really care about all of their students. My campus specializes in my major, the students and faculty in my program are amazing people. The student life is great, there are many different students' organizations to get involved-in."
College Senior,5,"In our campus, staff and faculty are very strict on what the have to be and a laid-back in somethings. I.e. anything involving drugs, alcohol, cheating, violence, and other situations around this matters, they don't play about it. The would go full-power and hardcore about it. But stuff like: a first offender parking violator, or a past due payment, are not much of a deal. To put it in a more simple way, they use their common sense."
Freshman,4,Smaller class sizes everyone seems to really enjoy including myself. I wish my classes could start at 8am instead of 10.
Freshman,4,"Great teachers, very helpful. Small classrooms and very personal instruction. The campus is a little small and there isn't much to do there but it is excellent if you are only interested in acedemics"
Freshman,4,I enjoy the comfortable atmosphere here but at that same time would like to experience a larger school.
Senior,4,The campus is very scenic making it a relaxing campus to just hang out and have fun friends. Also the campus has a great landmark being the Hayfield House giving the campus a lot of history and culture to the area.
Niche User,4,This campus is very nice location wise and with historical aspects. The staff and professors are always willing to help students.
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus and I know that if I had any issues that the campus security would be extremely helpful in taking care of any problems
College Freshman,4,I love going to school here because all of my teachers are wonderful and helpful. There is always someone to turn to if I need help with anything and the small campus size leads to a more personal college experience.
College Freshman,4,I'm not sure five'll the ends and outs
Recent Alumnus,4,Drug use is limited but not unheard of
Recent Alumnus,4,I think the curriculum is very straight forward and the class registration is online and very easy to figure out. Classes are small so if you're an underclass man some classes may be full; but you will have no problem registering for them once you are a junior or senior. It is also very easy to find a quiet place on campus to study alone or with a friend.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I did not live on campus but I have had the opportunity to go into many of the apartments. They are fairly spacious compared to your average dorm. Each apartment has 4-6 students that share 2 bathrooms, a living room, and kitchen. The students who live there are usually fairly close and get along. Your roommates will most likely have the same major or a similar major to you."
Recent Alumnus,4,This campus is for students who do not want to be in a large class setting but still have the resources that a large university can give you. The classes are small and the professors usually know your name after a few classes.
College Sophomore,4,Lots of help in this area. Many talks and lectures you can attend
College Sophomore,4,"Overall experience has been pretty great. I wish the financial situation would be better as well as some professors, I wish they cared alittle more."
College Sophomore,4,The school itself is a great school. Lots of help and answer of questions everywhere you go.
College Freshman,4,Easy to get a long with as long as you show them respect
College Freshman,4,They try their hardest to make it good
College Senior,4,"It should be open a bit longer for the on-campus students. It would be a lot more convenient to us to just walk to the cafe, than to drive a restaurant."
College Junior,4,I have never felt unsafe. I know that we have cameras around and I see security gaurds walk around campus at all hours.
College Sophomore,4,"Very Nice Apartments! Two buildings are air conditioned while two are not, however; both facilities are extremely nice. Rooms are furnished and there is a tv in the living room."
College Freshman,2,There aren't many girls that go here
College Freshman,2,Once again there is not a lot around campus
College Freshman,2,The teams are pretty bad
College Freshman,2,There is not a lot to do around campus
College Junior,2,There needs to be more parking available for students. You should try to get to campus a little early in order to get a good parking spot.
College Junior,2,"There really isn't too much of a Nightlife at Penn State Wilkes-Barre. Every weekend students make an attempt to throw parties, that usually involve everyone sitting around listening to music or a few people playing pong. Usually these parties, never last for too long because a Residential Assistant shuts them down. Off campus, the closest 18 and older club is the Woodlands. This club is usually full of high school kids or middle aged men. I wouldn't describe this club as much fun either but at least it's something to do."
College Sophomore,2,High Prices – The food is very good however you must pay per item and they are pricey.
College Freshman,2,All You Can Do Is Go Clubbing – There really isn't anything to do off-campus except go clubbing Thursday night. It's boring on-campus as well.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life
College Freshman,1,"PARKING....SUCKS It is okay in the main lot, but there is never any open spots by the tech. center, where a majority of night classes take place..."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is ok, but not a lot over by the tech center, and no bus or shuttle service to town... very poor here..."
College Freshman,1,"Lots of White People – There are around 92-94% whites. It is really hard to communicate with them because i am a minority. I always feel like i'm not wanted in any event, except sports."

Freshman,5,"I have taken two online quarters at Spokane Falls Community College. The schedules organized for students who take online courses are easy to follow, as well as appropriate for us to avoid excessive workload. Our professors are also approachable whenever we have questions in virtual class meeting or after class finished."
Sophomore,5,"Switching to a remote online experience has been a little difficult, but my professors are always there when I need help or have any questions. Due to there little size in classes, it is easier to keep in touch with your professors during this pandemic."
Sophomore,5,"I had a great experience online schooling, for the most part. I would have to say the only snag I encountered was when I was forced into an online lab class, by COVID-19, that should normally be taken on campus, other than that my experience was wonderful!"
Sophomore,5,I had an amazing experience with Spokane Falls and I'm sad to be finishing up this chapter of my life!
Sophomore,5,"Online classes are very easy to navigate, the staff is very helpful if you have questions or technical problems."
Sophomore,5,Spokane Falls Community College has awesome instructors. They were all very helpful and I learned a lot. There is a lot of interaction with staff if needed.
Sophomore,5,"For me, I like studying online. There are several benefits that studying online. For example, I could take notes easily since I could review the teaching videos when I am available. Besides, I don't need to spend time on traffic to get to study."
Sophomore,5,"Spokane Falls Community College is a great college. I have been studying here for three years. I started with IELP( Intensive English Learning) since I am an international student. I feel like the teachers here are all very kind and nice, they treat every student as best as they could. Besides, the teachers are also very professional and effective; for instance, my major is mathematics, and I always can ask questions from my instructor or other people who teaching math, and they always responded very quickly and specifically. All in all, I like Spokane Falls College, and I believe you will also love in here."
Freshman,5,"I haven’t actually started there yet but from what I’ve heard from friends who have attended, it Is a great school to go to for an education."
Sophomore,5,I LOVE attending Spokane Falls Community College. The administrative staff is very helpful and friendly. Financial aid is quick and easy. My instructors are amazing. Full of fun events and workshops for all colleges aged students.
Sophomore,5,"Being in the Integrated Community Services program, I was able to take some online classes. Not all my classes where online, but they all could have been. It was easy to navigate and had no problems doing the course work."
Sophomore,5,"I liked the campus and how beautiful it is. It is also a smaller campus so it is easy to navigate. The staff members are helpful and friendly. The classes are small which allows for more contact with the professors. The athletics department has so many awesome people including the coaches, the student athletes, and everyone else involved. Overall, this is a great school to get a solid education from."
Freshman,5,I’ve enjoyed my experience so much at Spokane falls! I believe I have had great instructors and great classes to follow along with. It is very hard work but I do receive the needed help. I have felt very secure in this school and and very happy with my decision.
Sophomore,5,"I am a music major here at the falls and I love it! The music building is beautiful and well-maintained. When I started, I had some trepidation about college in general. However, the professors in the music program are all amazing and caring. They helped me get through the enrollment process, explained how college works, showed me my options, and now they are showing me I can achieve my goals. The professors I've had outside of music have been hit and miss. Some are overly political, some treat their students like children, and others are simply checked out. I have often wished I could skip lectures and just show up for the tests. However, the staff running the bookstore is fantastic; the best customer service I've ever seen!"
Freshman,5,What I really like about Spokane Falls Community College is that the instructors are very helpful and tret you really good. I wouldn't change a thing this is an amazing college to attend.
Freshman,5,I really enjoyed the engagement level of the professors. All of them have been extremely helpful in guiding me through my first quarter of college. I also appreciate the free use of their gym.
Niche User,5,"It is located close to my family and I have family that attends that school. I like that there is a lot of apartment choices around the school. The athletics is very interesting, such as their basketball."
Freshman,5,The campus here in Pullman is small but mighty. We are close knit and if feel like the staff really has my best interests at heart.
Freshman,5,"In 2015 I participated in the SEER class program through CCS at Spokane Falls Community College. This provided me Adult Basic Education. From there, I have become a Nurse Assistant Certified through SCC. Currently, I am enrolled in AA-DTA. The library at SFCC is open to the public. The librarians are resourceful outside of the library services as well. The student store and cafeteria is VERY AFFORDABLE. Any student of SFCC and SCC can utilize both campuses. I mostly appreciate the campus being open during the Summer. Anyone from any department can answer questions or point you in the right direction."
Freshman,5,I have just been through my first quarter and the professors where great. They really wanted me to pass and did everything in their power to help. My experience so far has been wonderful and I don't regret choosing SFCC for my college.
Freshman,5,"This is a great college, all of the teachers are extremely nice and well educated, and all of my classes have taught me a lot to further my education!"
Niche User,5,I am really liking the people that are there to help you get through the first challenges you face into the adult world.
Niche User,5,"I like the classes it offers, but I don't like the location of the campus because it is far from a lot of things. The staff/ teachers are nice and helpful and there are groups to embrace all different types of ethnicities/ cultures."
Junior,5,"Spokane Falls community College is an amazing campus, when  I first stepped into the campus  i was looking at the map and a gal asked if i needed help. they really  like their job and you can see it."
Sophomore,5,I love the Business major professors at this college especially. The professors are all very helpful and the campus is beautiful and fun. I feel my education has been wonderful coming from SFCC. I would definitely attend again!
Sophomore,5,I like Spokane Falls Community College for the fact that it was a great transition from high school to college.
Freshman,5,Spokane Falls Community College on the Pullman campus gave me the opportunity to continue my education when i could not afford Washington State University after getting academically dismissed. Spokane Falls has great instructors with experience at the University level as well. The office staff is very helpful and the tutors are available when needed.
Freshman,5,Spokane Falls is a great place to attend right out of high school. The counselors and advisers are very helpful in helping you set up your two years and the classes that you need to take in order to graduate.
Graduate Student,5,"I absolutely loved SFCC. The faculty was in general very courteous. The professors were devoted to their respective curriculums and were always willing to assist students with their work.

Additionally, a variety of resources were available to students, such as the library, the math learning center, and the tutoring center. Everything in the school emanates its resolve for individual student success. Looking back upon the years at the college, I see now that it was here that I developed a passion for the sciences, and my love for literature. With its characteristic charm, Spokane Falls inspired me to give my all - to study and work hard to achieve my goals.

The only aspect of this school I believe can be improved is its new student orientation. As it was my first college experience, I felt quite daunted at the school's many facets. Greater detail, and better explanation of the school's website and on-campus student resources would elevate this school's status to near-perfection."
Sophomore,5,The campus has a nice layout. All the buildings are modern. Lots of technology resources to use. Cafeteria food is delicious. Tons of different clubs to join. There’s a lot of diversity here. The professors are great. It’s close to downtown. I really like this school and am going to miss it when I transfer.
Freshman,5,It's a great school! They really have your back academically. They really want to see you succeed! They genuinely care about you and are welcoming of you.
Niche User,5,"When I was able to tour the Spokane Falls Community College campus, I was able to freely walk where I wanted to, making it easier to explore the facilities I was interested in. Everyone there was very helpful and friendly, and overall seemed like a great community."
Freshman,5,"Spokane Falls Community college is by far the best college that I have had the privilege to attend. I had a hard time trying to find a program to go into that I would enjoy and have a successful career in. The counseling department took the time and helped me find a program that I will excel in which was Social Services. I had a couple of run ins because I was already a college graduate, and enrollment was a little difficult. The admissions office and the counseling department gave me a full list of what I needed to do, assisted me along the way and I had all my ducks in a row by the time the quarter started. They care about their students and take pride in their school and believe that every student is special and prepare every single student for their future career."
Sophomore,5,"The overall atmosphere here is wonderful. Kind staff, good food, clean buildings, teachers that want you to do well while still challenging you to learn more. They even help students who don't go to school here through tutor sessions and help with figuring out scholarships. The councilors try their best to get you what you need, on the degree plan that you want to be on.  Here, teachers understand that life happens, and as long as you inform them of what is going on, they will work with you rather than against you. For example, when a very close family friend of mine died, the teachers offered to let me take as much time as I needed to recover without my grade being docked (which was otherwise stated in the syllabus that missing to many days could be detrimental to your grade).  The security here on campus understands that we are all students trying to get by, and they are also willing to work with everybody here on campus."
Freshman,5,I received all the help I could need. The only reason I can't succeed here is if I don't try because all the staff and faculty were extremely helpful. The education is excellent and I think it is priced reasonably.
Sophomore,5,I love the SFCC campus and it's friendly atmosphere. I am currently enrolled in the Graphic Design program and constantly speak highly of it. The instructors are AMAZING and truly care about their students. All the courses are intertwined and completely relate to each other. I have learned so much and have had a great time.
Sophomore,5,"My college experience at Spokane Falls Community College was a sweet experience that will forever remain in my memory. This college has superb faculty and staff; they are always seeking better opportunities for students in their education. The courses offered teach students well and help prepare them to face the general society once finished. The college is very accommodating in buildings, classrooms, parking, and socializing. All the resources available to students is of very good quality, and the people are helpful and friendly. The students body has much variety, and adds to the spice of life for the students become very attached to each other and stand up for each other."
Freshman,5,"Community colleges usually get bad reputations simply because they're small and only offer two year degrees. Spokane Falls Community College goes beyond to assure comfort and happiness while attending. I am enrolled in the photography program, and from what I've experienced, the instructors are the best of the best. I enjoy attending this school because I instantly feel comfortable in my classes and around campus. The campus is spacious and has lots of beautiful trees. If anyone in the Inland Northwest is interested in attending a community college, I definitely would recommend checkig Spokane Falls Communtiy College out, online or have an on-campus tour! I promise you will not regret it!"
Alum,5,"High quality resources and classes, pretty nice campus. Some of the best professors I have ever had at any university here. Advisors and staff are friendly and helpful as well."
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and the professors are dedicated. I started this Fall of 2016 and enjoyed my biology and geography course very much.
Sophomore,5,This is my second time going to college and this has been a much better experience. I dont feel set up to fail like i did at Spokane Community College. From the beginning of school I've had many people help me along the way and have been very satisfied with their customer service. I have and will continue to recommend to other students what a great school this is.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Especially with all the developments that are happening in the moment i am really proud of this school. The use of CTC link, gym renovation in school, bus pass schedule being used , the international student program is really good too."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I like the activities conducted by the student government every quarter. I like the education that i am getting in this school because its making a great and strong foundation in my life. Many instructors are always willing to help the students to achieve their goals. I like the president of the school because she is always there to help the students whenever they need.

I always see her busy in meetings at school."
College Sophomore,5,"Many classes, small class size, and great teachers"
College Junior,5,This school is very flexible in terms of accepting credits from other schools and providing courses that will be accepted by other schools.
College Junior,5,"The teachers here are phenomenal and really do whatever is needed to help you succeed. Even with online classes, instructors has encouraged me to come to campus and meet with them if I have any questions that could be better addressed in person. The workload is manageable but not easy!"
College Junior,5,The teacher has one on one talk and how to further your studies.
College Junior,5,All the teachers are really nice.
College Junior,5,"Class sizes are very small that it helps when you have a question, homework assignment, or test because they can help you one on one."
College Junior,5,The atmosphere and location-better than others.
College Senior,5,I had the privilege of attending a wonderful school!!! Thank you for giving me a chance and allowing me to succeed!!!
College Senior,5,Excellent went through courses and achieved high grades when it comes to hybrid classes.
College Senior,5,They worked with me to make what I needed to accomplish become accomplished!
College Senior,5,I am still getting situated with transferring to another University and am being assisted to achieve my goals and dreams. So yes overall I am having a great experience!!!
College Senior,5,Everyone I encountered was amazing dedicated and extremely thoughtful!!!
College Senior,5,Overall excellent in every category!!!
College Senior,5,I had great experience all the way around from my professors to fellow students everything went extremely well!!!
College Senior,5,I had the best experience and I know if I had to do it all again I would have chosen SFCC!!!
College Senior,5,"My favorite experience would be in the cafeteria. In the spring there ate shows that ate pout on by the students, like karaoke, lip syncing, and a talent show. Also in the fall we celebrate thanksgiving and of feels homey"
College Senior,5,The librarians always offer help and know how to offer their resources
Freshman,4,"This is a great school to start with as an international students. I have received so much support from my advisors as well as my professors, who always stand behind my future success. My favorite aspect is there are numerous events organized monthly for students to participate in, thus, it becomes an opportunity to share traditions and cultures from other nations."
Freshman,4,"I have been able to communicate easily with professors and staff! which is great, due to the barrier of having to do everything online. The Canvas page is super easy to use and very effective when it comes to classes."
Freshman,4,"It has a great community and environment to grow as an international student. Professors and staff are always willing to help and give assistance in anything you might need. 
The only thing I would try to improve is having more variety of classes to take. 
(science classes)"
Sophomore,4,"An amazing small, community based school located in Spokane, Wa. The professors are very interactive with there students and are always there if you have questions or need help. Classes are always very interactive because of the small classroom sizes."
Sophomore,4,"This quarter is quite hard for me when I have to learn Math, Sociology (teach about America's society and other communities in the world as well as America's politics), and Humanities (study about racism, sexism, class, intersectionality, queer..with writing-intensive, and diversity) at the same time. Study math online is hard, but study about America's society, America's people alone is harder for an international student like me. However, overall, this quarter passes well because every instructor who taught me this quarter did their best to get used to teaching online, and that provides me helps whenever I need them."
Sophomore,4,"As a first year international student, SFCC is a great place that I have never regret to choose it. The school has a program named ""Honor"" for international ones to learn classes at a higher level so we can have some advantages when we transfer. There are also many clubs and organization that available to help international ones as well as take care of us to make sure that we are doing great as well as organize many international events so that exchange students have chance to express their culture, feel less home-sick, exchange culture..., many other meaningful reasons. As a girl who came to the US at the age of sixteen, this college is a perfect place for me to ""running start"", I can skip two years in high school to save money and time, I have a nice full homestay to live in, and Spokane is a peaceful city too. Overall, this school is a great place for young international students. The only thing I hope the school can fix is to add more necessary courses for certain majors."
Sophomore,4,I am currently a running start student at Spokane Falls Community College. SFCC has a great and very welcoming community and is the perfect place to pursue quality education at an affordable rate.
Sophomore,4,Spokane Falls Community College has been an affordable and easily accessible option for a two year degree. The campus is modern and well cared for with a brand new gym and recreation center. Parking is abundant and classes typically a 20:1 student to teacher ratio. School clubs like Health Club and French Club as well as the student government provide students with opportunities to connect with each other and their communities while developing leadership and teamwork skills.
Freshman,4,The people here are very nice and willing to help. It's a small college but still has many resources. The college is willing to help people going through a hard time and might not have as much money.
Freshman,4,"I’ve just finished my first year online here and it’s been fantastic. I’m a non-traditional student with a 15-year gap from high school to college. I’m very happy with my choice of college and studies (library). I didn’t have the greatest high school experience so I was hesitant to go back to school, but SFCC has been great. The professors have helped me enjoy learning again."
Sophomore,4,"Most of the staff and faculty genuinely care about their students, but there is a lack of diversity, and the transparency in regards to financial aid could use some improvement."
Senior,4,"Of the local community colleges, Spokane Falls is the best. The community, nature, and education are very well balanced. The professors are always so helpful, and personally I think they have the best prefessors by far. The admininstration side of the school is quite iffy; however, once you reach the person at the top, they are always helpful and help you figure everything out completely."
Sophomore,4,"SFCC is good college, there are a lot of instructors willing to help you. However, trying to resources or information or trying to get help, takes a little bit to get. You may talk to your instructor and they will say one thing but you go to financial aid and they say something else then you go to admissions and hear something completely different. But it is a good college and offers a lot of technical degrees, just do some research before or talk to a counselor and they will help you find those answers."
Freshman,4,"There isn't anything that I would change about it right now, I haven't been here that long but all the teachers are extremely friendly and more then willing to help you with anything that you need. The other students here are also super helpful, they are willing to help you with directions at anytime."
Alum,4,"I very much enjoyed my time as a Running Start student at SFCC. I felt that the faculty were usually very kind and willing to help. I had very few professors who were not willing to help, or didn't teach the material very well. The art scene at this school is incredible. My only suggestion would be to improve upon communication between the college Running Start advisors and high school Running Start advisors to provide more clarity to students."
Sophomore,4,I participated in running start and had a good experience. I loved the fact that it's a small school. Some part a little undated but . SO far I have had a good experience.
Freshman,4,This school is a great place for people to come and experience college on a small scale. It's a nice area in the city and the staff have been incredibly helpful with any concerns you have.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, it’s a good school! The staff helps you out a lot. The only issue is that I go to the Pullman campus and there aren’t a lot of in-person classes, so most of my classes are online."
Freshman,4,"SFCC is one of two community colleges here in Spokane. I chose  SFCC because it has a younger student body. Most students are running start students or recent high school grads. The campus is beautiful and well maintained. The fitness center has been newly renovated, so the gym is very nice. Also, the fitness center has a rock climbing wall now!"
Freshman,4,This school is great. I'm on the Pullman campus and the staff is great. There is a awesome variety of classes and the community is lovely.
Freshman,4,"The campus was great, they are continuously updating the buildings or creating new buildings. There however was a lack of parking. If you were luckily enough to get into one of the parking lucks you better count your lucky stars. Otherwise you have to walk a VERY long way."
Sophomore,4,"The college is located just on the out skirts of Spokane, giving it a more peaceful atmosphere. It also offers a variety of online and hybrid classes for working parents, making it possible to obtain a AA degree that is transferable to a four college."
Sophomore,4,"The majority of classrooms are smaller than I expected, which gave it a high school feeling. The faculty is very kind and are willing to help you succeed in any way they can. The campus feels very open so you don't have to swim through the crowd while going to your next class.  I have been attending SFCC for almost 2 years."
Sophomore,4,"As a Spokane native and a Sophomore transfer student from the University of Washington in Seattle, Wa, attending Spokane Falls Community College was by far, one of the greater experiences and decisions I have made to date.  A former athlete at UW, coming back home for the year was a growing experience.  Obtaining two jobs, taking 20 credits a quarter online at SFCC, and eventually rejoining the sports of Cross Country and Track and Field, I found my time at SFCC to be beneficial to both my financial situation and busy schedule.  Excellent quality in the academic and athletic departments all the same!"
Freshman,4,I went to Spokane Falls Community College (SFCC) straight out of high school. I was surprised to discover the rapid increase of class pacing from my high school.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the campus; it is a very beautiful campus, and well kept up. The professors I have had have been pretty good so far, and the staff is well informed and willing to help on all the questions you may have!"
Sophomore,4,I am a High School student here via the running start program. Going to SFCC as a high schooler has been an amazing experience. I was able to cut my total tuition in half because of the program!
Freshman,4,Going here made the transition between high school and college very easy. The professor really do want to see you do well.
Sophomore,4,I have had a very positive experience at Spokane Falls Community College. The staff and faculty are helpful and friendly and the courses truly are set up for your success.
Freshman,4,"At the falls, the teachers are there to help you. There is a lot of 1 on 1 time available and all of the teachers take the time to help you out. Classes are small so you can ask as many questions as needed. All the teachers Ive had so far always tell the students to ask any questions needed if they don't understand a subject."
Sophomore,4,"I am a Running Start student at SFCC. Overall, I like the college life better than the high school scene. Spokane Falls, for being a community college, is pretty good. However, I do not get that involved in clubs and activities, so I can't comment much on anything other than the campus and the professors. I have not disliked any professors I've had, and my courses have been academically challenging. SFCC is a great college to attend if you want to get prerequisites out of the way or if cost is a factor in where you're going to attend."
Sophomore,4,Most professors that I've had or that friends have had are excellent and engaging. It's well worth the money.
Freshman,4,Great School for a community college with instructors who care and want to help you succeed.  Every has been very helpful from admission to counseling. It a good place to get started if you plan to transfer to another college to complete your degree
Sophomore,4,"I loved the athletics from the falls, the college is a great place to start your own fresh college experience before heading to a university. Really gets you help and sets you up on a right path to choosing what degree you want in life. Also have tons of college's near by to choose from: Eastern Washington University, Whitworth University, Gonzaga University and Washington State University."
Sophomore,4,Great building block for a future career. Professors really care and encourage students to strive for big dreams. Easily accessible and affordable. Lots of connections to 4 year universities. Easy transfer credits.
Alum,4,Spokane Falls Community College offered online and evening classes that allowed me to complete courses while working full time. I appreciated the instructor involvement in the student success.
Sophomore,4,"I like everything about SFCC. It's an amazing college, I've learned a lot and I can't wait to learn more."
College Senior,4,I came in as a running start student. SFCC welcomed me in like a regular student and I felt like I was at home.
College Senior,4,I was able to apply most (45 credits worth) of my AP test credits toward an Associate of Arts degree.
College Freshman,4,"While I haven't officially declared a major, I have taken an interest in the humanities. The building where most of my classes meet is pretty great. Sure, it may not have some of the amazingly cool things bigger colleges and universities have, but it's still a good, applicable curriculum and adequately equipped classrooms."
College Junior,4,"I love it

* teachers are nice

* classwork is challenging

* great motivators"
Recent Alumnus,4,so far i have enjoyed many things. I feel satisfied.
Recent Alumnus,4,I am planning to take online classes later but i have taken hybrid classes which are really nice. We interact with students in class and out of class.
Recent Alumnus,4,I have seen many career workshops in school which helps many students.
Recent Alumnus,4,many professors especially those dealing with science have high levels of education which is really good. I get quality education from teachers of quality.
Recent Alumnus,4,some students work in the campus which helps a lot.
College Sophomore,4,"I am majoring in fine arts and so far, i have learned so much. I barely knew what to expect in the art world, but my art teachers have be so helpful with guiding me and instructing me on what I do well on in my art and what I can improve on. The teachers are fun to be around and they make the class entertaining. One thing that I would like to see is a class about how to sell my art and how to price my art. I still struggle with settling a price for my art that I would like to sell."
College Sophomore,4,"The teachers are great and they always have time to talk one-on-one. The students here are diverse and everyone is accepted. The one thing that I don't like is the new student portal that they installed, ctc link. It is unorganized and it messed up and/or lost some of the teacher's documents. Other than ctc link, my college experience has been going well."
College Junior,4,"I am on the track team here at the falls, and the consoulers made it easy to schedule my classes around my practice time."
College Junior,4,"Its very convienient and easy to use, if you need help there are ways to ask for help from other students and the professor."
College Junior,4,So far its pretty great and I feel right at home.
College Junior,4,Some of the online classes are very cooperative with your work schedule
College Junior,4,The alumni network seems pretty good. The career center is very helpful with resumes and applications
College Junior,4,The courses offered through the American Honors program are awesome
College Junior,4,I feel like a big majority of the people at this school already have a career idea they are planning for
College Junior,4,The staff and faculty in the early childhood education department are very helpful
College Junior,4,"The online course availability at this school is wonderful. The workload is very manageable and allows you to take additional online classes, in-person classes, keep a full-time job, etc. It is relatively user-friendly."
College Junior,4,"Overall, Spokane Falls Community College is definitely the best place for me. It is in a location that makes it easy for me to commute. Class times are very diverse, allowing me to keep a job while also attending classes. The classes are definitely worth the money and are just as good, or in cases even better, than what I could obtain at an extremely expensive private university. I love the fact that there are people from all walks of life at this school."
College Junior,4,"I came to SFCC after dropping out of Whitworth University. Whitworth was unable to provide me with the outlets I needed, such as tutoring services, one-on-one sessions with professors, and academic counseling. SFCC has been one of the best decisions in my life and has reinvigorated my love for learning. Coming to SFCC was one of the best decisions I have made in a long time and I am very optimistic about my success as a student here."
College Junior,4,The class size are pretty normal and the style they teach is good.
Freshman,2,At Spokane Falls Community College I have had good experiences with all my professors and fellow colleagues. On the other side people working in the Financial Aid office have been a major stressor.
Niche User,2,Will NEVER go back!! This is a horrible school! Professors don't care about you one bit! Even if you tell them you need help they completely ignore you! They also teach you garbage. Was a complete waste of time and money. Do not go there!!
Graduate Student,2,"The staff at SFCC were less than unhelpful. I felt like an inconvenience ALWAYS when I asked for help in any department. It is a cheap way to get your AA, but was hard to get through and I am looking forward to attending a university where the staff actually care about the students."
Sophomore,2,"It has sucked honestly, I did running start and I wish that I had not because now all of the places I want to transfer to seem out of reach and it is really disappointing."
Sophomore,2,"Although getting there was was simply breathtaking as the views are nice. This school has nothing else good going for it. It is very diverse, which is good, but anything you need to do outside campus (financial aid, some teachers are rude/don't care about you) and took what should of been a great experience into a bad one. I wasted an hour a day going to and from this school and it wasn't worth it after a while. There is also no student life, or party scene because it always felt like you were only there to get your AA and nothing else"
College Sophomore,2,Not bad. The teachers aren't great but not awful. However it's still not worth the money and experience.
College Junior,2,"i wouldn't choose this school again, because some of the staff members are always in a bad mood, when you ask a question they look at you in a bad way. the professors give you homework everyday and they give you short due dates."
College Senior,2,"The process is tedious. So much just to get educated tip have a better life and even then, you go out into the world and are afraid due to being more aware of the changes that need to occur."
College Sophomore,2,"I received no financial aid for winter quarter. I think that the school fees are higher than they should be, but who doesn't think that? I have a family house with eight people living in it. My parents can barely afford to feed their kids so school is financially my problem, but for some reason I received no grant options for winter quarter. It just didn't seem to make sense to me. I may have to take a quarter off of school because I can't afford to pay for even one class due to my minimum wage job."
College Junior,2,"i just dont like the system the set up, when asked how its going to take to go through they wouldn't give an answer but estimated the time and said to come back"
College Student,2,When I tried to transfer to Eastern I got no help from Spokane falls with out trouble.
College Junior,2,"Personally I think they should change their questions to determine whether you are independent or not. According to financial aid, because I am not married, homeless, the age of 26, or in foster care, I am not independent. Because of that in order to be eligible for a pell grant, they must go off of my mother's income. I live on my own, pay my own bills, and depend on nobody, but myself. My mother & her new husband made too much money this year so I am not eligible for a grant & their ""expected family contribution"" is $11,000, which I wont be getting a dime of from my mother. Therefore I feel they should change how they look at dependents & independents and how it affects students and their ability to afford college."
College Senior,2,"Eastern Washington isn't a super diverse place as it is, and the student body reflects that."
College Senior,2,"You really need to apply for financial aid by the first priority deadline, because the school runs out of money very quickly."
College Senior,2,Online classes are confusing in the beginning but once you launch into them the course material is rather great. It is almost easier to follow along online with the course than in a regular classroom because it is all spelled out for you and in one spot.
College Senior,2,SFCC is average in that it has the necessary facilities related to it being a community college and not a university. In general I would say that it is just average overall.
College Senior,2,"They are okay. The athletic center is small and only offered to students with a class there making it difficult fro other students who want to get fit. The lab is small and often times you cannot find an open computer to do your homework and studies on, which can be frustrating. Campus activities are limited and few and far between making campus life not as fun as it  could be. "
College Junior,2,There is wireless internet access across campus. It's great except every now and then done of us get kicked off the internet. Even those on the computer connect to the Ethernet get kicked off and kicked out of their online class. 
College Junior,2,It's alright. Personally I'm more of a face to face student. The main problem with our online classes in American Honors is our audio bridge. We use adobe connect to have classes but it isn't as great as face to face classes for me personally. 
College Sophomore,2,My English 102 Teacher this quarter is quite rude
Sophomore,1,Do Not Recommend!  The teachers are inexperienced and do not care for the students. The admission and counselors not care if you graduate and only want the students money and will change requirements and  other thing without informing the students.
College Sophomore,1,Not a fan of online courses too much negative bias
College Sophomore,1,They've had little to no impact on me
College Sophomore,1,Like I said before if I could go back I wouldn't go here.
College Sophomore,1,"I really wish I hadn't of gone here for school. If you believe in the trickle down effect this will probably be the worse decision of my life coming here. If I knew what I knew now the military would be a better option, going to a four year university and acquiring debt would be a better option, or even going to trade school would be a better option. I would strongly recommend not going here. If I've learned anything from attending here it's if I become a parent not to send my child here."
College Senior,1,I feel they give up on students to easily
College Senior,1,I go to a community college - there are no post-grad services available.
College Senior,1,There are no post-grad services at my school.  
College Junior,1,Didn't really receive much information or help from financial aid office so I have loans. Emailed them questions and they never got back to me. 
College Freshman,1,"Frustration, that is the best way to describe the way most people feel until they transfer. I passed a math 92 class, and they told me I couldn't take the next class, they told me I had to take math 91 even though I passed my class with a 3.6 and no teacher. I have to talk to teachers, then counselors/advisers  then they have to talk. Then they have to make special calls for me to other people I have never met just to get me in the right class and let me take a class I need. This happens every quarter and I doubt its going to stop this quarter, but I can still hope. Almost none of my credits will transfer unless I decide to not go for Engineering and I do something like an Art degree, which would be fun but definitely not what I am here for. I would enjoy having one quarter where I didn't have to fix what somebody else did, that gets paid to do, and cannot do it correctly."
College Junior,1,"Good Price – however you have to be the first in line to really get any help in school, as far as grants go. do things asap!"
College Freshman,1,"Time to Get With It! My ed 202 teacher didn't know what the Common Core State Standards were until students brought it up in class.  Unbelieveable!!  She may have been a good teacher 30 yrs ago, but it is time to get current on the info she presents.  The campus web site is not available to students after 9:00 pm.  Unbelieveable!!  In this day of iinformation and technology this is unacceptable.  I took three writing classes before I had a writing instructor.  All the first two could do was give assignments.  little to no help or instruction in how to make the produced writing any better.  SFCC, it is time to get with it!"
College Junior,1,"Falls Off a Cliff – Social scene: if there is one, its invisible or only comes out while I'm busy studying for tests. Some students are focused on their education and work hard to prove themselves. Others are simply here to satisfy their parents and spend half the day smoking pot. There are signs everywhere that prohibit smoking within 20 feet of a door or window, but nobody seems to see them. 
Academic Programs: Those students I mentioned earlier that want to succeed are the only ones who hear about special honors or unique oportunities. The rest of us are just part of their paycheck.
Campus Life: I don't live on campus but know a few people that do. Most of the people who live on or near campus smoke pot in all their free time and come to class Monday morning still drunk from Friday night."
College Junior,1,"Falls Off a Cliff – Some staff including professors are very helpfull and want nothing more than for you to succeed. But the majority of the people working at the Falls either need better coffee or to simply find a new job. I feel like a number at this school and on more than one occasion my needs have been set aside when I ask for help simply because some ""rule"" prohibits them from performing a task on a certain day of the week. For example, my wallet was stolen and I needed to purchase a new ID card. The woman at the student help desk refused to help me and claimed that she didn't know what sort of photo ID I could use to verify my identity. There are math and a writing labs for students to use and get help on homework and such. Sounds great, huh? It's only great until you've been sitting there patiently waiting for a tutor for three hours and all the staff and tutors would rather gossip behind the desk than do their jobs. This is the most expensive community college I've come across and besides the unhelpful staff and impossibility to speak to a councelor, the atmosphere is unwelcoming. The only ""social"" spot on campus is overcrowded and the students are caught up in the same drama since high school (not to mention that their acting the same way they did 3 years ago). This wasn't the college experience I had hoped for and isn't worth thousands of dollars each quarter even if you manage to score classes with good professors."

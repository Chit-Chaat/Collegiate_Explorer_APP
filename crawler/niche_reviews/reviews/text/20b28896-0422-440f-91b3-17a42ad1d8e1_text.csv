Junior,5,"My experience at Pace has been one of excitement and joy. I am learning so much more than I expected and really enjoying living on campus. I've made life long friends here. The professors have been very helpful and always willing to go the extra mile for me. I have had access to both the classroom and online courses.  The rooms here on campus are very nice and my view of the city so far has been amazing. There are plenty of on activities on campus. I also love the ability to enjoy the NY city life style which was always a dream of mine. I like having the ability to eat on campus as well as offsite using my food allowance. The cafeteria food is very good but having the ability to go offsite gives you more choices. The school has great speakers who come here along with entertainment in the auditorium that provide for great learning experiences and fun. I am enjoying everything, the Covid-19 outbreak was stressful however it was handled very well by the school administration."
Junior,5,I found that life at Pace is exceptional. I made some lifelong friends. The professors are wonderful and very helpful. My classes are wonderful and I am learning a great deal. My experience here has been fantastic and living on campus here in NY is a dream come true.
Freshman,5,I am an upcoming freshman therefore I have not had an expereince with this university but for the most part it seems very good and they have helped me throughout the application process.
Sophomore,5,"You have access to so many resources and staff members. It will be what you make of it. if you seek extra help you will get it , there is always someone to answer your questions or help"
Freshman,5,"I am an upcoming freshman for the class of 2024. Even though I have not attended Pace yet, I have received help from many of the school's offices. I have nothing but good opinion of the school based on how well the staff is to their students."
Junior,5,"I only took online classes when we had to close campus due to COVID-19, but all my professors were very understanding and significantly cut the workload. This was extremely helpful, and they made themselves available often to support us."
Sophomore,5,Pace is centered around giving their students ample opportunities and ways to get connected in the big city. Pace does a great job with connecting their students with one another and allowing everyone to feel accepted.
Niche User,5,I am excited about the opportunity to study at Pace University. The admission team has been very much helpful and supportive throughout my application process and the fact that it's one of the best private universities in New York. The idea of studying  New York City is also a great experience.
Freshman,5,"I fell in love with Pace the second I stepped on campus. I know that Pace is the place I will grow into the performer I am meant to be, I just need a little help getting the funds to get there."
Sophomore,5,This a great school! It gives me wonderful opportunities and the classes are amazing. I can't wait for many more great years at Pace University. The environment is great and the people there are the best. I am so glad I chose this school because I would not be happy anywhere else.
Freshman,5,"I recently auditioned for Pace University for the BFA Musical theater program, and this has been my hands down favorite audition. The faculty were so inviting and truly cared about our performances. Also, the students that were helping out with the audition were so kind and fun to talk to, so I could learn more about the school from a student perspective."
Senior,5,"Pace University is a private university that’s bursting with opportunity. With campuses in New York City and Westchester County, Pace easily capitalizes on its location, connecting students with jobs and internships throughout the New York metro area. Academically, students are quick to highlight the “good” business program as well as the stellar performing arts school. No matter what you choose to study, classes at Pace tend to be “small,” a fact that many students here love. After all, small classes allows for a lot of “one-on-one interactions with professors.” And speaking of professors, while they can definitely run the gamut, most are truly “passionate about their work and subject field.” In turn, that passion helps them conduct “engaging and interesting” classes."
Freshman,5,"Pace University is a great place to go and learn because of how open and inviting the students and staff are. It is a great community to be involved in, and allows students to live in a great location, New York City."
Sophomore,5,The diversity and location of the school is good for options for internships and more opportunities in the area.
Freshman,5,It was amazing because of how great the campus looks and feels like a home. Also I have learned so much about community and how to be a member of there society by caring for other people and sparking a change in the world.
Niche User,5,"The university is smaller than other New York schools, but each program becomes more intimate and classes can become more personalized."
Niche User,5,The thing I like about pace is their diversity in arts and education. The amount of internships for each major and that they have professors who work in the major they're teaching.
Sophomore,5,"Small classes, diverse student body, good professors and all of the educational and entertainment resources of New York City."
Freshman,5,Pace University offers a variety of opportunities for its students and creates a safe space for everyone to personally and academically grow. It allows for the flow of creativity in a harmonious community.  Not only do they grant exemplary academic support and guidance but they continues to push their students to be unique.
Freshman,5,I was nervous about moving to NYC for college from Florida but everyone has made me feel secure. The advisors are super helpful and sweet. I cannot wait to spend the next 4 years at Pace!
Senior,5,"I LOVE Pace so much! I've transferred a lot so I've been to quite a few colleges, and this one is my favorite by far. The classes and teachers are incredible and really interesting; super current and engaging. The campus is in the middle of FIDI so there's so many places to eat at/ shop/ hang out and the train station thats the closest takes you to literally everywhere. The food is also some of the best college food I've ever had and they have a lot of options for vegans/vegetarians/etc. Everyone is so nice and theres so many different types of people it doesnt matter what youre into or who you are you will forsure find a crew you'll fit in with!"
Niche User,5,I love Pace University due to its commercial dance program. This program will help me to see what I will be doing in the dance industry.
Sophomore,5,I chose Pace because of the many opportunities that are available to me. One great aspect of Pace is career services. They promise to help students with finding careers from graduation to many years ahead.
Junior,5,I really have enjoyed the professor. I love that they are in the field I am currently studying and give real life experiences.
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman and I love it. The area is amazing, the people that attend the school are friendly, the food could be better but it is good so far, there are also lots of on campus job opportunities and lots of opportunities to have advisors to make sure you stay on the right path."
Sophomore,5,"Pace University in New York City is a phenomenal college. Who doesn’t love the city life? Instead of a boring, normal campus we have the city as our campus! The professors are very flexible and understanding. It’s also very helpful how many resources there are such as: the library, the writing center, CAP, and of course the extra hours the professors give us to answer questions.  This is a great place to meet new friends from all over the place, and not just states other countries as well. This is my second year and I love it, you will too!"
Freshman,5,Pace University is such a positive and impactful place. Within minutes of being there I felt a sense of community; like I belonged there. It truly encourages every single person to be who they are and students as well as faculty and staff are all there to help you whenever you need it!!!
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman planning to major in Political Pace at the University of Pace. I am very excited to start my educational journey and pursue my degree in this facility. Not only do they have clubs for every interest, there staff is very helpful and will guide you through the transition from high school to college!"
Sophomore,5,"pace university is a great school. the new york city campus location is perfect for any students seeking an authentic NYC experience, located right in the financial district of manhattan. although the city life can get stressful, the academic advisors and professors are very helpful and truly have your best interest at heart. the academic advisors at pace take the time to reach out to you and genuinely care about your success. the classroom sizes are perfect for students who have trouble focusing and who need to connect with the professor. pace university truly sets students up for success!"
Freshman,5,"During my orientation for Pace University, I was educated about the different benefits of being both a commuter and resident. There are many food options, opportunities for students to get involved on campus, and its easy to communicate with professors."
Freshman,5,I really like Pace's student involvement. They really listen to what students want and try to plan certain events according to them. They also have lots of clubs and options for study abroad. Their security on campus is very good to. I feel very safe and comfortable walking around campus. They have a lot of good job opportunities on campus.
Sophomore,5,"Pace university is what experiencing being a resident in NYC feels like, as well as a college student. At Pace, you really get the best of both worlds of studying school while exploring and learning New York because it's right at your fingertips. You'll never be bored, not only are you residing in Manhattan, but Pace itself has numerous clubs, activities, greek life, etc for students. Although I would rate the professors, 9/10, they all do their best to bring their students to top-level achievement. The career services department makes you ready for the real world as past employers from companies are assisting you on obtaining jobs and internships.  I could go on and on, but you'd have to go to Pace to experience it for yourself. Pace has the door for you, all you have to do is open it."
Sophomore,5,"Pace University's professors are some of the most hardworking, dedicated professors out there. Amazing education is offered at the school thanks to them, and thanks to resources like the library, learning center, and the hours that these are open."
Sophomore,5,"I love the freshman housing, it's the nicest on campus, but I also love that they offer you a chance to earn points to qualify for nice housing. The community service opportunities are all over the place and there are unlimited way to be involved in campus activities and events."
Junior,5,"I loved it. Curriculum for your major/minor will most likely bring you a well, in-depth form of education that will make every penny of your tuition worth it."
Freshman,5,"The Nursing 4 year program is set up to fail students. Guidance through this program is missing. Otherwise, the college is good and the rest of the majors are better."
Freshman,5,"I'm so excited to start my freshman year here in the fall. Not only because of PACE being located right in the financial district of Manhattan, but also the infinite amount of opportunities that await me. I will have access to professors with incredible experience in their field as well as the ability to study in beautifully new renovated spaces that are student friendly. I'm beyond thrilled to study here."
Niche User,5,I’ve visted Pace in total of three times. The second I saw the school I knew that was the one for me! Everything it has to offer is what makes it so special!
Freshman,5,"It's a great school, good professors with a passion to teach their students. Picking your courses is very flexible while studying Marketing I get to take a class in Religious Studies and a Minor in Graphic Design giving me a variety of topics outside of my Major."
Freshman,5,Pace is such a friendly and understanding place. All the staff want to help you (teachers included) and it's a place that many people can call a second home. You'll meet so many great people there and it's a fun experience living in NYC.
Freshman,5,"Whether it be the performing arts, business, computer science, or even communications, Pace University offers the education and connections to succeed in the multiple facets of the work force. The commercial dance program has a full semester in Los Angeles where students can connect with working professionals on the west coast while learning how the job market differs on that side of the country. The Lubin business school is directed by Neil Braun who is on the board for the IMAX corporation and many other networks. This provides direct connections to high level companies for students of the Lubin business school. These are just a few examples of the opportunities that Pace has to offer for their students."
Freshman,5,"Pace Univeristy is great, especially for Freshman, because they help imessly with the adjustment process. Pace provides many activities so that students do not feel alone and have a lot of fun during their time!"
Graduate Student,5,Excellent college! Lots of resources! Diverse student population! Helpful professors. In the heart of NYC next to the beautiful Brooklyn Bridge. Plenty of food choices and secret green gardens to chill. Love studying here!
Junior,5,"The Pace student community is very diverse. I like that there is tolerance and acceptance of each other.

I would like to see a more diverse staff community."
Sophomore,5,"good school , diversity  and good learning areTheater and the arts[edit]

Main article: Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts


National Collegiate Athletic Theater and the arts[edit]

Main article: Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts

The Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts is the principal theatre of Pace University and is located at the university's New York City campus in Lower Manhattan. The 750-seat Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts is home the television show Inside the Actors Studio hosted by James Lipton and previously the home of the National Actors Theatre, a theatre company founded by actor Tony Randall who was in residence."
Graduate Student,5,Amazing accelerate nursing program. Love the small classrooms and great teachers it has! Would recommend for someone looking to get more prepared on their career!
Graduate Student,5,"The best part about Pace University is that the professors are extremely helpful, understanding and make it so much easier and more enjoyable to be in school."
Senior,5,"Pace is a good Division Two sports college with most major sports. It has great professors, access to top-rated companies, helpful support services such as career and advising."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love Pace and I am so proud to be a student here. I will be a sophomore in the fall and I am so excited to go back to school. I learned a lot and am offered endless opportunities to better myself socially, physically and mentally."
Niche User,5,"Pace is in an amazing setting, right in the heart of New York City, with fantastic dorms and wonderful people. The professors and students are great."
Freshman,5,"Pace University! Ugh, there is literally nothing bad to say about this institution! I love the welcoming environment of this university. I feel so welcome (of course!) but I also feel like I belong as anyone you meet here, whether it be staff or students, instantly become like family to you!"
Sophomore,5,"I love our involved the campus is. There are so many activities going on and clubs the join. The only thing I don't like is how hard it is to get housing for each year. So many people did not get housing for next semester, which doesn't make sense. Everyone should be able to find a spot to live. The food also could be better. I am a vegetarian and there are not a lot of options for me. I cannot eat anything from the grill anymore because they don't have a separate grill for vegetarian and vegan food and they don't clean the grill after they put meat on it."
Sophomore,5,"Pace University is great, when it comes to networking. They have a strong internship program, and just being located in the city alone, makes it easier to reach out to companies or jobs!"
Freshman,5,"I really like it here at Pace University, there are so many opportunities available to students. The location is a definite plus, as most New York attractions are just a short walk or subway ride away. The academics are exceptional and it is especially advantageous for Business majors to be located in the heart of Wall Street. Aside from that, there are many campus activities and clubs for students to join, and there is always free food available at one event or the other! The faculty are very helpful and they are invested in seeing students succeed, which can really help boost student morale. In addition to this, the university really pushes for real world experience, like internships, and the career services department is a great resource for students to utilize in their search for such experiences."
Senior,5,The tight knit community in my department was great because professors know exactly who you are and are willing to help you whenever they can.
Niche User,5,The campus is really nice and very close so you don’t have to walk 20 min to your next class .  Food is alright and there’s vending machines everywhere.
Niche User,5,Pace has such a great  vibe and a fabulous musical theatre program that really has the feeling of a family.
Freshman,5,"Pace University has an outstanding business program. They have an awesome reputation; other companies love Pace students. Pace University is very good at preparing their students for internships and jobs for the future. What I do want to see change is the food, the food isn't the best. The professors are great and there are a lot of activities and programs for all types of students. It is a liberal school and I am more than happy to be a part of Pace University."
Junior,5,"I transferred to Pace from Westchester Community college. So far, my experience at Pace has exceeded expectations. The program is great, the professors are very supportive and the students are very friendly."
Junior,5,"Rigorous academics, diverse student body and excellent professors. I transferred to Pace from NYU because I really wanted smaller classes and Pace definitely has that. So content with my decision to transfer to Pace University."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy my experience so far at Pace University. The campus being in New York City is my favorite part of it. So far the teachers are good and flexible with certain issues.
Sophomore,4,"The online learning experience is alright. There's definitely a learning curve getting used to Zoom and all that, but I'd say Pace is doing better than some other schools."
Sophomore,4,"I love Pace University and I definitely would not change my choice of school, but there are some things they could do better. The university is learning how to change and I'm glad for that!"
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy Pace University, everyone is extremely welcoming and accepting. The professors are very knowledgeable and love to teach."
Freshman,4,I haven't taken any online classes because I'm very going to be a first-year student this fall. But overall it seems like the proffesors are very helpful with the students.
Sophomore,4,Many of the professors quickly adapted to online learning and offered extra resources and time for their students
Freshman,4,"My online experience has been limited due to the fact that I have not started classes yet. However, you can find anything you need to know about Pace on its websites or simply email the admissions counselor whenever you need to ask a question."
Freshman,4,"Good experience overall. Pace is very expensive - I spent over 100k for an education, it needs updating, they just did renovations but the actual classrooms aren’t great. My ROI based on my income for my first job is 34%"
Freshman,4,"Academics were manageable but kind of easy. Taking science online is basically required because they are the only ones offered for non science majors. That class, sci 101 is difficult because you need to do experiments from home."
Freshman,4,"There's so much to do in terms of social clubs and such. There are also lots of resources for support if needed. However, the food and dorming are....well awful. Definitely not worth the amount of money we have to pay. Overall, the atmosphere and classes are great, but you can probably get the same thing somewhere else for cheaper and with better dorms and food."
Sophomore,4,"I was pleasantly surprised about my online learning experience with Pace. When COVID-19 affected in person classes and we had to resort to remote learning, it was not an easy transition for me. My professors however, were very considerate and actually encouraged communication between their students just in case they needed more time on an assignment or they were struggling with the workload, etc. All in all, they were all very pleasant and eased our worries as we slid into an uncomfortable transition while under Stay-at-Home orders."
Freshman,4,"The staff and students are amazing and it gives the whole campus  comforting feeling. Each program has its own specific requirements and rhythm as to how they operate, which helps create creative diversity between the students. There is also a lot of students from every type of background. Pace praises themselves for giving each student a personalized education, so they can pursue the type of career that they want."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed Pace University. As a black queer student, I think they could do better with hiring more teachers of color all across the board. Not all the staff will like you but you will absolutely find at least one staff member that you bond with and guide you. Like any other institution, they put on a front about being helpful towards students but as a whole, it can be difficult to navigate yourself to graduation. They are money hungry. As for student life  Get involved!!! You are in the city and Pace offers quite a lot to do and get involved in. Cafe food can be trash but you're in NYC and there is a Starbucks on campus. They offer great internships and business opportunities. Overall Pace is a great school I am happy I went and I think it was worth (not 60k a year) some of the money I paid to go there."
Alum,4,"I have to say my time at Pace was an exceptional one.  I was in the Modern Languages major (French/Spanish) with two minors in Art History and Classical and Medieval Studies. The professors, especially for language, both modern and ancient, as well as art history were inspiring, motivating, and helpful.  I cannot express how much my time in the art history minor developed my love of the discipline.  I highly enjoyed the diversity of the campus itself.  There are students from all over the world and is ideally located. So, one has access to all of the five boroughs quite easily. One caveat is that during your electives, make sure to have a supervisor who knows your interests. I had one from the computer science department assigned to me (for some reason?!), so I ended up redoing many of my courses selected because they did not reflect my interests. So, be aware one can use electives to mold them into a minor(s)."
Sophomore,4,Pace University is a very diverse college. You can meet just about anyone from anywhere. The academics are pretty solid and teach you everything you need for your major. I only wish the college had a better cafe but we also are located in NYC so food is everywhere.
Freshman,4,"Pace Performing Arts Program is phenomenal. As an FTVC student my teachers are geniuses. After just one semester I learned so many things about myself and how to make the most of a give script. As a first year student Pace does a good job with providing different activities for students to attend. Ex: Paint and Sip, Silent Disco, Trivia Night, Movie Screenings, Cultural celebrations, etc.."
Niche User,4,How everyone I met that goes there has nothing but good things to say about the school. The campus is amazing and also in the middle of the city. I would for sure recommend the school to people. Their business program is also amazing.
Freshman,4,"I am only a Freshman at Pace, but I, at the moment, have had a good time at university. So far, I am very pleased with their Business school. The only negative I have about the school is the school's Math department."
Junior,4,"I’m a junior at Pace University in NYC with a major in Finance and a minor in Economics. My experience has been mostly positive, all professors are very knowledgeable with a lot of experience in a field they are teaching. I absolutely love the NYC campus, there’s always something to do plus the view of Brooklyn bridge is amazing. The campus is always clean and safe. The local area is another plus, the campus is downtown Manhattan which means there’s always something to do outside of campus, many coffee and food places."
Niche User,4,Pace University has a great atmosphere and good living spaces for all students. The variety of majors offered at the university is ideal for students who aren't completely set on what they want to study in the future.
Junior,4,"As a minority, I thought I was way out of league in attending Pace University. However, the campus is perfect for my personality. It isn't too big. Campus is broken between buildings, and in the Tribeca area, it has all the commodities of New York City. It is also close to public transportation, which is a plus."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Pace is really good. The alumni are so sweet, especially in the Honors College where I have met many of my friends."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Pace, and so far I really love it! The only thing I think that I would change is the math placement test policy. All incoming college freshman have to take a math placement exam and an english placement exam, which will put students into math and English courses. The school does not tell you that the math placement exam also determines if you can start taking classes in your major if you are a science major. I took the exam and got put into an algebra course, and was told I couldn't start any of my Biology courses until I took Algebra and Calculus. This would also mean that I would either have to take summer classes or graduate late. When school started, I wanted to leave because I felt as though I was the only person not excited to start their major, because I technically hadn't started yet. This is the only thing I think that I would change about Pace. Otherwise the school is wonderful."
Sophomore,4,The business school and honors college are very good. If you seek help from the many advisors available to you and make an effort you will do very well here. The OSA department could be improved (Office of Student Assistance) as they normally have extremely long wait times and sometimes do not give straight answers to their visitors. If you like having a college campus and sports and school spirit in general this is not the place for you. If you are an ambitious and hard working student you will do very well here.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the education I am receiving at Pace, I have good professors who do not overload me with homework. Since I go to school in NYC, walking from my dorm to class can be a bit tiring on days where I don't feel like walking, but other than that it's great."
Sophomore,4,"With my experience at Pace so far, the teachers truly care about you. They do want you to do well in the class and to make sure you understand the material so you won't be lost in the real world. They are always asking if everyone gets it and always seem genuine about caring about the students. The down side of Pace, at least for NYC campus, is the class rooms don't have any windows. It gives me a sad, energetic vibe when entering a room. There needs to be some natural light coming into the class rooms to brighten up the moods."
Sophomore,4,extremely expensive tuition wise and many of us are taking out thousands in loans. would like to see our tuition dollars towards fixing the disgusting cafeteria food. please fix the cafeteria food. i've noticed some changes and that's nice. nice dorms and area. nyc is worth it. there are some really good professors and some that clearly need to be fired. specially the math department. many students are struggling with the professors and classes.
Senior,4,"I think Pace It's an amazing school, I didn't give 5 starts because I think 1. It's veryyy expensive and 2. the food can use some improvement, but overall, great school!"
Alum,4,"Professors can be snarky and detached. The philosophy classes were awesome. I loved living in New York City, but it can be a distraction from studying for obvious reasons. Just try to keep your school & social life balanced, and you should be good!"
Freshman,4,"Pace is a very welcoming and cheerful community with a strong desire in success. When I came to Pace for Freshman orientation, I entered the school not knowing anyone nor what to expect. I was immediately welcomed by the orientation leaders there, and throughout the tour, I began to understand the community at Pace, and how hard they strive for success."
Alum,4,Great professors and great classes. Guidance available with academic counselors and career counselors. School is expensive.
Junior,4,Pace is a great school with a lot of perks such as location and some wonderful professors in certain departments. I wish Pace had the same quality of professors across all disciplines because certain departments like computer science and math are lacking. Additionally I wish Pace had greater unity between the campuses.
Sophomore,4,Great school if you use all of the opportunities to your advantage! There is a lot of construction which is inconvenient but otherwise the school is amazing it is in a great location in the financial district of Manhattan. Being in the city offers so many opportunities for all students.
Freshman,4,"Being Located in New York City is one of the best features of Pace University. There are limitless resources all around you, and there is always someone to confide in. The campus and people are amazing and it's a guarantee you can find your home here."
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at Pace and I am majoring in computer science, it’s one of the best programs at Pace"
Freshman,4,The admissions process is easy and found staff to be informative. Majors and Minors offered vary and one could definitely find an interesting area to study. Looking forward to meeting new people and experiencing what Pace has to offer.
Senior,4,"Pace University (NYC) is home to thousands of individuals from various walks of life. The university is strategically situated at the hub of Manhattan, providing students with the unique ability to use New York City as their campus, literally. Students have access to internships, volunteer and employment opportunities at an arm's length. However, the university must work on providing opportunities to all majors, even the smaller, lesser known ones."
Graduate Student,4,"Great location, very safe school, and good academic programs. The food is not the best, but is it okay."
Sophomore,4,"Great campus life.  Excellent professors.  Many activities, close knit community. The honors college is awesome and provides many opportunities.  Food could be better, but it's generally the same anywhere you go."
Sophomore,4,"At Pace University, you can easily make friends with someone in each of your classes. The location is great and there are a lot of things to do in and around the school. The financial aid is pretty generous so that's also a big factor as to why I attend the school. There are good professors who will make sure that you understand the topic at hand and they always encourage for students to use the resources available to them."
Junior,4,I transferred to Pace from a community college. It's hard to assimilate as a commuter but there are great resources for students.
Graduate Student,4,"What I liked most about Pace, was the challenging academic curriculum and the friendly college environment."
Freshman,4,"The facilities are great and although it is a small school, the campus is nice. The professors are great and I have had various who actually care about you and your grades, they are not just in it to get paid. Most of my professors are very inderstanding and see that mental health is just as important as physical health. Also, there are many resources and ways to get help if needed, whether it’s an academic issue or personal issue. One bad thing is that the Office of Student Assitance and the financial aid office service is not good. You are on hold for more than two hours at a time most of the time and they don’t really give you the information you need when you are looking for help sometimes."
Junior,4,"I like the location, and my access to internship opportunities. Overall, the adjunct staff has been incredible, and so have a good number of the tenure professors."
Junior,4,"Overall a very good experience, solid connections and professors who are active in their respective fields. You can either be in the heart of NYC next to city hall or in the suburbs of Pleasantville"
Alum,4,"Loved the people at Pace, hated the lack of opportunity for science/medicine students. The administration also was ridiculous to deal with, and the dorms were things of nightmares-- but also made for great stories and bonding."
Freshman,4,"Very resourceful school ! There are ton of things to get into . They always special event for all majors like summers paid internships for everyone at a click of a button. Very friendly staff and student centers. Everything you need is super accessible, so that saves you time and effort. I just transferred from San Diego to pace and so far I’m happy with my decision. Yes, I do plan on staying until I graduate and possibly doing my masters here as well. They offer scholarships for various reasons, so it’s not too difficult to get the help you need . I’m personally on an academic scholarship and it has helped me out tremendously. I would recommend pace over NYU due do to the resources and tuition assistance they provide here at pace university!"
Alum,4,"Great school, graduated in 2013. At the time it was more focused on Lubin School of Business. You could tell the funding differences between that Lubin and the other schools within the university"
Sophomore,4,"As a student who is a finance major, i love Pace university. Pace is located in downtown Manhattan and is very close to Wall street and some other financial districts, it's location opens up more opportunities for students who are business related majors. Most of the professors lectures greatly, they can explain a difficult concept in a simple and humorous way. They helped me to develop an interest in finance. A disadvantage for it's location is pace lacks a real campus, pace university is made up by several different tall buildings. For the students who like a feeling of campus, pace university might not be a perfect choice. But overall, i like my college."
Graduate Student,4,"Great school with excellent learning potential, but lacking on communication skills when it comes to OSA."
Freshman,4,"Pace has a reputation of being the ""poor man's NYU"" which is sort of true, however it's not as bad as some say. The professors (aside from the math department) make classes challenging and interesting. The location is great, the neighborhood is fairly safe, and the dorms are average. The food leaves a lot to be desired but I can tell that they're working on it. The new renovations look nice and hopefully they will continue to update and improve Pace Plaza. 
While there are plenty of things that could be improved, I've found that you get out of it what you put into it. College is what you make of it and if you sit in your room alone and don't do anything then of course you're going to hate it. If it isn't the right place for you, that's okay. It happens. But there's a big difference in a college experience between being appreciative, outgoing, and ambitious as opposed to ungrateful, withdrawn, and lazy. Again: It's what you make of it."
Freshman,4,"not only is the location perfect (lower manhattan — where you can take a subway in any direction or stay within your radius and explore scenic areas), but the staff/faculty and students are welcoming and helpful. Everyone is there to help and learn."
Freshman,4,"The faculty are amazing! I have met many people who have helped me so much and truly want to see you succeed. Moving to a new school, especially college, can be really difficult and challenging. Meeting new people and adjusting to the new environment alone can be extremely difficult. Although the courses were hard for me, my professors always had open doors to those who were struggling and needed help. They really wanted the students to come in and talk to them. Since I do not dorm, it was difficult to make friends as I would go home right after class ended, but Pace offers University 101 which helps first year students adjust to their surroundings."
Senior,4,"All the teachers here are passionate about what they do. The business and science professors are really challenging and helpful with connections if they see you have drive.
However, there are teachers that have a difficult time articulating lessons. Meaning they teach as if they are dealing with graduate level students even when its a 101 class. If you find"
Junior,4,"The Pleasantville campus, and I'd imagine the NYC campus, is a very left leaning liberal school. Though I have met some professors who are in the middle or do learn more to the right, they are rare. I feel the students are babied! Free hugs if you are upset, a stress free room, a nap zone in the library with instructions on how to take a correct nap.... No I'm NOT JOKING!!
I was in the military, and I feel these kids are getting no justice done being treated like they are back in kindergarten."
Graduate Student,4,The staff members here are amazing. They are always helpful and provide many guidance. The school's atmosphere is great. It is very active and provides many student programs and activities to engage students.
Junior,4,"I applied to Pace University for the opportunity to graduate from a well known school full of potential. I love how easy it is to network with industry professionals. I am never nervous while interacting with the specific professionals because I am well prepared by the career center.
Listed above is my favorite quality of Pace. Unfortunately Pace lacks a welcoming atmosphere. Pace's classrooms  are cold, outdated and lacking upkeep. It is frustrating to spend most time and money in a place that lacks appeal and comfort."
Graduate Student,4,"I am an immigrant, when i came in USA i did not think it will easy for me to continue with my education, because i had already two bachelor's degrees from my home country. But, Pace law school made it possible for me. they explain the choices and give me admission. They help me to reach my goal."
Freshman,4,"I like how they have my major and attended to my needs to their fullest ability. Plus, the school is in New York and you can never really go wrong with that. PACE University is a great school for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"The school is overall great-- most professors really care about you and how you're doing in class and the same goes for advisors as well. There are always events going on and lots of clubs. The school is rather pricey though but that's a given since it's a private school. Amazing place for business majors, liberal arts, law and nursing students!"
Freshman,2,"Online learning was OK, but online campus services (such as OSA - office of student assitance) was 0/100."
Freshman,2,My teachers are either very strict about Zoom rules or aren't even teaching. Some teachers are even assigning more work than they would've if we were still meeting.
Freshman,2,"Although the College seemed nice and the people, professors, and academics were good I couldn't help but feel out of place among everyone else. It may have been because it was a business-centric school and I am a computer science major."
Freshman,2,"If you are some sort of theater arts/arts major, you will absolutely love it here. You will fit in very easily and have a great time. Otherwise, I would look for a different college. I was a biology/psychology major and I had the hardest time feeling like I fit in. The science department is decent but not the best. Also the math education system is very poor. If you struggle with math, find a way out of it if you decide to go here. The campus is beautiful and you are fairly close to everything. Lots of opportunities."
Freshman,2,"Okay. If you're looking to go to school in New York City, but you didn't do as well as you'd like to have in high school (aka you want to go to NYU or Columbia but couldn't get in), just go to community college. While Pace gives hefty scholarships, I'm still paying around 30k a semester - that's with loans and grant money. It's expensive and not worth the price tag. Elevators constantly broken, the one dining hall is a nightmare during common hour. Avoid 182 Broadway- Maria's lacks appeal because of the bathrooms but trust me, it's worth the sacrifice. The general atmosphere is either kids who don't care about academics or kids who are tired of this lackluster education and looking to transfer. It's really disheartening. Class and professor quality is average at best. Main building doesn't have windows in the classroom so it feels like prison. There are a couple good professors but generally the education your receiving is not great."
Freshman,2,"I've been here for two months and I've seen so many flaws about this school. It feels so cliquey here, it reminds you of high school all over again. People would leave you out of stuff on purpose or judge you simply because you are in one of their classes. The professors do not care about students success, they just sit back and assign difficult work and do not do a great job in helping students who are struggling. The cafeteria food has its good and bad days, but its the same thing every day and can get tiring. Not to mention I am paying over $60K to be here just to have multiple problems with my dorms and having to go through construction that was supposed to be done months ago. I feel like I am truly not benefiting from being here, and as much as I love the city, I recommend to not go here if you do, because you will honestly end up having a ngative perspective of it when you leave. I am transferring next semester because Pace has not been beneficial to me at all."
Senior,2,"Professors are not personable, and do not care for your future.  Campus life is poor, and advisors don't advise well"
Freshman,2,"The overall school is ok, the facilities are definitely outdated and are in need of improvements. The NYC campus does not have a traditional campus instead its just buildings scattered in the surrounding areas. The main building (1 Pace plaza) has an office building feel. The cafeteria tries to offer a variety but in reality the options are very limited (especially for vegetarians). The caf food is average somedays its good, other days its bad. Classes are good, some classes are small enough to get 1 on 1 interaction with the professors. Being in a huge city, the athletics are horrible. The limited athletic opportunities leads to the lack of spirit at the school."
Sophomore,2,The school overall is  a good school depending on what your majoring in. Students do have to take pointless classes as requirements which is a waste of time but you get these classes out of the way during Freshman and Junior year.
College Senior,2,On campus there really isn't a party scene and the few events that are on campus are lackluster. If you want to really be on the Party scene you have to leave campus and go to times square and other areas of Manhattan where there are clubs and bars to hang out in.
College Junior,2,"Rooms are extremely small, garbage disposal becomes an issue, and the cost exceeds the value."
College Senior,2,Even though I don't live on Campus based on what my friends who do live on campus say the housing is very expensive on top of the already expensive tuition. Even though Pace does have the World's largest Dorm Building besides that there isn't really anything that makes you go wow and Maria's tower another building is not good at all. In my opinion having an apartment and commuting over is better than spending more money with the dorming here unless you have the finance's
College Sophomore,2,"Maria's Towers is literally Maria's Projects, it's an ongoing joke. The bathrooms are always a mess and to get laundry done was a pain. However the social aspect and being close to friends and classes were a great benefit."
College Sophomore,2,"Greeks throw great parties, however it is not an important aspect of the student community."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is not as effective as it should be. More life need to be added in their routine.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I go to the campus in a city, so there is not much going on."
College Student,2,Greek life isn't big at my school.
College Student,2,We do not have sports.
College Freshman,2,Not important for a city school
College Sophomore,2,"Very small, but that's NYC. Costs are outrageous. Better off getting an apartment."
College Junior,2,Living conditions are horrible and no one cares
College Freshman,2,"Almost everybody smokes SOMETHING (either weed or cigarettes) and many people drink, but nobody really cares if you don't do any of those things."
College Freshman,2,"There are virtually no athletics or sports to speak of here at Pace. Occasionally there are basketball games in the gym, but aside from that all sports are on the Pleasantville campus. There's a gym and weight/workout room on the NYC campus, but basically no sports. However, nobody here cares about sports, so it's fine."
College Freshman,2,"For $14,000 a year I am living in a room about the size of a cupboard. The furniture can barely even fit in the room. Granted, I have met some amazing people through my dorm experience but it is still an absolute rip off. ""Non-profit"" school my ass. On another note though the RAs are really great and try to get everyone involved, and people are only written up if they were being super obvious about drinking or just generally obnoxious"
College Freshman,2,"Don't come here if you want to play, watch, or talk about sports. Literally, no one cares. Between the vast majority of people being either women or gay men, you are better off going to a traditional school if you expect to spend your Sunday mornings cheering on the football team (mostly because we don't even have one at the NYC campus)."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't much of sports or athletics since we are a city school, they could really be improved and there is definitely a demand for improvement too."
College Junior,2,"The New York City campus does not have sports; the sports are more important at the other campus, in Pleasantville, New York."
College Freshman,2,"I don't even think that my school has sports teams. I know the westchester branch has sports, but being at the NYC campus no one cares about sports."
College Senior,2,everyone says this is a great school for internship oppurtunities however my career service advisor has cancelled my only appointment and it has been a hassle getting another appointment to search for internship opportunities.
College Freshman,2,"Professors don't give a damn about their students, and basically expect them to learn on their own. As a nursing major, you either dedicate your life to studying or they give up on you entirely."
College Freshman,2,"Way too small for the cost of living there. Having cable is nice, but the people are shouting all the time, with no enforcement. The bathrooms are awful."
College Sophomore,2,Majority of our athletic teams have a losing record. Sports are not well attended and school spirit is almost non-existent.
College Junior,2,"I hate the housing, it is really old"
College Senior,2,"As I said before, Pace is not a party school. Which, can be a good or a bad thing."
College Senior,2,"There is no Pace University party scene. There would be, if they were more lenient about what goes on in the dorms. If you are in college and wanting to party (as any typical college student would want to), Pace is not the place for that."
College Freshman,2,"I would not choose this school again. It has no standards, it accepts anyone. Teachers are not the best, students are stuck up, not much fun things to do on campus. Feels like a job more than school."
College Freshman,2,There isn't much to do on campus and the town is similar. You have to take the train to the nearest city where there is a mall and shops. Alot of students are commuters which sucks because on the weekends there isn't really anyone on campus. And the food sucks! Unfortunately there is only one cafeteria and on weekends only two stations are open. Being a vegetarian it is extremely hard to live here. The servers get mad when you request to use a different spatula for veggie burgers and ground beef. Local places close early or don't deliver after a certain hour which also sucks. If you go here you NEED a CAR!!
College Freshman,2,It' god awful. Really wished I went somewhere else
College Sophomore,2,"The teacher are selfish and the cafeteria sucks. The school is too sensitive when it comes to arguments. They don't take time to listen to the students, and it's a waste of money."
College Junior,2,"Campus security needs to improve greatly. I understand that Pace security cannot be everywhere at all times, but we rarely go a few months without a security warning about something. Security needs to be improved and taken more seriously when something happens."
College Sophomore,2,"It's New York City. Housing is expensive, space is limited, and there are some people so desperate to have a space to call their own that they will try to trick you or sabotage you so that they can get the apartment that you were both after."
College Sophomore,2,"This school lures in students with the idea that somehow the amount of money that they are offering freshman is sufficient enough to pay off their large tuition fees. It is a lie! You can tell by the sheer amount of people who are constantly waiting at the Office of Student Assistance or at Financial Aid, which is like the university's equivalent to the DMV. The lines are long, you don't often get serviced well and there are always problems and hurdles that you have to jump through just to make sure that you stay your balance is in good standing. My experience with both OSA and Financial Aid  are complicated and I do not want to traumatize myself by talking about and reliving my experiences with them. Sorry."
College Junior,2,The surrounding towns are pretty expensive and many students are able to afford off-campus housing.  Plus you need a car because there are no apartments within walking distance.
College Junior,2,"Sometimes they have Pace related parties or concerts with major artists, but other than that, Pace is really not a party school.  There aren't any happening or major clubs or lounges around either."
College Junior,2,The quality of food has been a major issue on campus for over a decade and it hasn't gotten much better if at all.
College Freshman,2,I wish they Pace had a team for the NYC campus.
College Freshman,2,"You have to find everything yourself, little to none are promoted through the school (which is understandable) but it doesn't feel like I'm in a community."
College Freshman,2,"They should provide more scholarship opportunities, be more clear on how much the overall cost is going to cost, and stop making it too obvious that your trying to just make money off of us and taking all of our money (giving honors students better housing, providing them with more scholarship and opportunities). They are the first to take money when you mess up but don't provide those opportunities back with scholarships and grants unless you fit a ""specific requirement""."
College Freshman,2,"I've had so many issues with financial aid and it's only my first year of college. They said I owed money when I didn't and I almost got kicked out of the dorms for a loan that was sent, but they didn't receive right away."
College Junior,2,"I think parking is the only thing I've really seen them be strict about. Park in the wrong spot for too long and you'll have a very pricey ticket waiting for you when you get back, and possibly even a threat to have the car towed. In terms of alcohol and drugs, the school policies are strict about their use on campus, however usually people find a way to get around it and use them anyways. If you're caught you will have to face serious consequences. It's hard for security to keep track of which students are of legal drinking age and who will be throwing parties that could potentially be inviting underage students. It's at these parties that some drugs may get in, but I haven't seen drug use in my time here. The primary vice is alcohol."
College Junior,2,"Pace isn't really known for it's parties, mainly because they're not that great."
College Junior,2,"The food choices appear good at first then you get tired of it all when you realize that it's always the same options available every week. Luckily there are a number of off campus options that students can go to and use a portion of their meal plans for (referred to as flex dollars). Mixing up the off campus choices with the cafeteria food can be a good idea, until you run out of flex dollars. Then you're stuck with the cafeteria food and there will be times you will rather not eat because nothing seems appetizing."
College Student,2,The FA process is a hassle and you don't always get all the help you need when you need it
College Freshman,2,Not really existent or present at the school. I didn't even know we had any.
College Freshman,2,I can't stand eating the food everyday. It all seems to be left out all day and very unhealthy. They are starting to add more salad options but they pretty much just moved the salad bar and but it behind a counter with a guy to do it for you. The cafe is very small with very limited food options. The staff is very rude to you and will take their time. I pretty much buy all my food and cook for myself because the meal plan is overpriced and you could get MUCH BETTER food for the SAME COST ELSEWHERE. The meal plan is simply a waste of money. #welcometopace
College Junior,2,"I do not have experience with searching for off campus housing.  Nonetheless, this area is pricey and it is most likely a better idea to simply dorm."
College Junior,2,"The financial aid office at Pace is unorganized and students spend FAR too much time at financial aid dealing with last minute holds and fees that financial aid failed to inform them about.  My best tip for getting financial aid at Pace is to apply for your FAFSA on time and stay on top of the financial aid administration .  In addition, apply for as many scholarships as possible to lessen to need to apply for private loans."
College Freshman,2,NYC Campus has limited sports activities. Go to Pleasantville campus if it's that important.
College Freshman,2,"I'm not sure about the Pleasantville campus, but non-Greeks are pretty indifferent about Greek life at the NYC campus. There's only three fraternities and three sororities available. If you join it, it's cool and you'll meet a good group of people to hang out with. There's no housing. They hold open parties about once a month. It's just another club."
College Freshman,2,"I lived at the John St residence, and this was definitely a mistake! There is absolutely no sense of community within the dorm residents, and it is extremely hard to meet people and make friends within the dorm or even on your floor. I don't remember even seeing my neighbors. The space was also extremely tight, but I guess that is normal for NYC."
Freshman,1,"Took a non-degree course here but dropped and ran for my life after 3 weeks. Absolutely terrible. Teachers had knowledge gaps and had refused to acknowledge their mistakes. Trying to call the ""Office of Student Assistance""? Be prepared to wait 3-4 hours EVERY time, and you might not even reach ANYONE. Don't do it."
Freshman,1,"awful. they dont care abt commuter students. some of them have to travel over an hour & they mess them up with awful schedules (earliest classes and latest classes, giving them no sleep and no place to go in btn classes bc they dont live there!) they also put hold on fmam registration (doesnt make sense they should b priority), delays scheduling for DAYS giving them no classes they NEED or WANT. u pay thousands of dollars for shitty academics and you waste time taking classes u dont need. dont go here."
Sophomore,1,Hate this school. Currently am a sophomore and have a great group of friends because of Greek life and its the only thing keeping me here. School is terribly run. Campus is small and closed off from the world making it feel like a prison. (Pleasantville  Campus)
Niche User,1,"I'm sorry but it's literally garbage. Everyone is stupid and mediocre. There is no respect for serious academics. It seems everyone here is just here to skim through class, get an internship senior year, get a job in accounting  and that's it. Fine, but there should be options for people who wish to do research or art. The people are nice, but like I said sort of shallow. Everyone I know that isn't Preforming arts is transferring. Including me. The professors are kind and i've had some good ones, but the culture of the school is a huge turn off."
Freshman,1,"This school is a nightmare. Facilities need updating badly. So much renovation occurring with no end in sight. Faculty can be rude and is rarely accommodating. Cafeteria food is horrible. Do not come here if you love the city, you will leave hating it. Transferring after one semester."
Alum,1,"Pace University is too expensive and professors lack student -interactive skills. Nice campus and infrastructure but needs to be more student centered rather overly concerned about comparing themselves to Ivy League schools. Overall I will suggest you look at schools nearby that offer relatively cheap tuitions and offers the same or better educational opportunities than Pace University. Schools such as Baruch, City College, Hunter etc are some good ones available in the NY metro area."
Sophomore,1,"pace is what you make of it, but it’s hard to make anything of it! classes are boring, you have the one or two professors that you love but that’s about it. this school has made a name for itself in the business and performing arts world—but definitely don’t come here thinking you will find yourself. if anything, you’ll be more lost and confused than ever before, and on top of that, will be in more debt than you can ever even fathom. welcome to pace u! thanks! I hate it!"
College Senior,1,It is really irrelevant on my campus and is very mellowed out
College Senior,1,In the New York City Campus there is really no athletics teams with the exception of the Women's Volleyball team having a match maybe once or twice a year on the New York Campus. Unfortunately the school paper doesn't keep people up to date with athletics and 95% of the people are unaware of the different Pace teams. All of the Athletics are in the Pleasantville Campus if you are into sports and the facilities for a D2 school over there is not half bad but the fan support and school spirit is really almost nonexistent and if you want to have any sporting experience in Pace go to Pleasant ville but Pace U is not a sports school to say the least.
College Freshman,1,"Professors suck, they can't teach. Most of the work isn't that difficult if you can teach yourself."
College Freshman,1,"Food prices are crazy expensive, no social life."
College Freshman,1,"The teachers can't teach, students aren't the friendliest, it doesn't feel like I'm learning anything."
College Sophomore,1,"Getting any degree (except acting) is worthless. 

Little to no chance of getting into graduate/medical school."
College Sophomore,1,"Part of the reason I went here is because of the lack of sports, but since actually experiencing it, I miss it. As a high school athlete (Cross country and Crew/Rowing) there's little to do on campus as far as athletics go. The gym is in horrible shape. I have a membership at another local gym, but for the price I'm paying for Pace, I shouldn't have to. Making sure I transfer to a school with a good Crew team!"
College Sophomore,1,"Transferring! Can't believe I stuck around for Sophomore year, but getting out while I can still get a degree at a better school. This place is a joke."
College Senior,1,"it is terrible, out dated except for alunmni hall. Not worth the money"
College Senior,1,There is no greek life at Herkimer College unless you are part of the honors society.
College Senior,1,Quality of the professors varies excessively. If you are coming to this school for physics good luck.
College Freshman,1,"the parties are ASS, and if you go to paulies, you have no life"
College Freshman,1,"Computer science majors are not going to get an internship very fast, the school will even discourage you from it."
College Freshman,1,"We have two sororities & two fraternities; they dont live together, or throw events-- nobody really pays attention to them."
College Freshman,1,"We are located in the middle of manhattan; we dont have sports teams, and gym classes are extremely hard to get into."
College Freshman,1,"After this Spring semester, I plan on leaving this school. It is too expensive, and its not fulfilling my academic or social needs."
College Sophomore,1,"Extremely difficult to be middle class, lower middle class, etc here. Kids walk around in $2000 backpacks and $700 shoes. Kids get their Christian Louboutins shipped to their dorms. 

Kids here are racist. Misogynistic. They make rape and racist jokes. I hold my breath when a foreign exchange student answers a question because I'm hoping that I don't overhear a racist comment being made.

There is extreme tension. There is almost no diversity. There is self-segregation. I only feel safe when I am with other  people of color. I absolutely hate it."
College Sophomore,1,"Like I said before, a black student was shot to death by campus security. Not the safest place for minority students. 

Racism within the student body is ignored and is rampant. There is bullying."
College Sophomore,1,"You'll only get a decent job or internship if you are wealthy and have strong connections. This is not a place where you can succeed through hard work within the school. I've been working extremely hard, outside of the school, with no help from the career center or professors and am doing better than my peers. A lot of students here have a different mindset. Many come here just to party, and they dive into internships in their last year without any experience. This makes it very competitive."
College Sophomore,1,"The classrooms don't even have windows.

The professors and courses are fine.

The students are absolutely atrocious."
College Sophomore,1,"The programs are okay. The main issue is in the student body and the students they choose to admit, as well as the general environment. I feel unsafe as a minority person of color. There is an overwhelming sense of racial tension on campus. Our football captain, for example, was caught photographed doing the Nazi salute, calling himself the ""grand wizard"" (leader of the KKK), wearing 3 confederate flags. A black student was shot to death on campus by campus security because they didn't think he was a student. It's extremely uncomfortable and self-segregated. For a school in the heart of New York City, it's not diverse at all. I was born and raised in New York City. There are maybe 2 people of color in my classes and the rest are wealthy white students. A lot of these students are racist and will appropriate culture and say a lot of ignorant things. I've seen white students wear t-shirts with pictures of Indian Hindu Gods on them. That's like an Indian student wear a t-shirt with a picture of Jesus or the Virgin Mary. It's very offensive. There is a class divide as well. The wealthier kids and the ""scholarship kids"" are separated. The wealthier kids will wear $2,000 designer backpacks and are condescending towards the ""scholarship kids"" (I am one of them.) It's an extremely uncomfortable learning environment. It's distracting."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I have never heard of a school with such little concern for research and top level academics. All the President cares about is money, clearly, and spends more of it ""beautifying"" an already acceptable campus rather than on attracting top professors and students. The only reason students used to complain about the campus is because they charge over 50,000/yr per student, so given that we should have better dorms. That being said, I don't think dorms would be a concern if the education we paid for was worth it. If you just want to graduate barely having learned anything and receiving inflated grades, this school is for you.  I, however, will be leaving this school at least 15 IQ points lower, and that's a whole standard deviation."
College Senior,1,It is not a campus. There is no community.
College Freshman,1,"There is no sports at this school. No one cares, they're all into theatre."
College Freshman,1,"There is no party scene at this school. No one hosts or attends parties specific to this school. You either have to venture out to a club or bar, or you have to go to other schools parties."
College Freshman,1,Financial aid at Pace University is a nightmare! Especially if you're a transfer student. They didn't process my financial aid until the day of my orientation and I had to go in and ask about it. Nobody in the offices know what they're doing. If you're not on them 24/7 they will screw up your financial aid process. I'm still dealing with them know. They might be the reason I transfer out of Pace.
College Sophomore,1,Does Pace even have sports..? Because they just shouldn't.
College Freshman,1,We're not good at sports.
College Freshman,1,"It is extremely hard to make friends at Pace. The majority of the students are stuck up, and it seems like all anybody wants to do is party every night and find some way to obtain alcohol. When I came to Pace, I expected the students to be more friendly and open to doing things that don't involve going to clubs and getting wasted, but I was wrong."
College Senior,1,No greek life on campus. Students do not seem to care either.
College Senior,1,"There are zero athletic departments on my particular campus, so there is not much to say about athletics."
College Sophomore,1,"This school has a very poor English/Creative Writing department. The professors are all very passionate, often professionals in the publishing field, however, they can only be as good as the school will their department to be. If you are not a business or acting major, do not expect much care and attention to be given to you, if any at all. While the professors in the english department I've had so far are very good, engaging and guiding, the department itself is lacking. I did a better job editing the literary magazine at my high school all by myself than the literary magazine team for Aphros. There are a lot, very talented writers in both professors and students, but the unprofessional appearance of the magazine downgrades the content. There also doesn't seem to be much support for the creative arts at all in this school if it's not performing arts. There is one poet invited to the school each semester, but the audience count is always sadly low in number. There are also readings held by the english department which are a delight to attend but they're also so small that it seems more like an exclusive club meeting of the poetry geeks than a poetry reading open to the entire school population. There aren't many resources available for the english major here at Pace."
College Sophomore,1,"Nonexistent. Considering being in the city, most people do not care much for sports at all. There is a basketball court and a few rooms with workout equipment in the basement but it is all very subpar and not very good at all. You're better off getting a membership at NYSC."
College Junior,1,"Because I am in the ABSN program and taking it in the Fall, there are not any scholarships available except for the endowed scholarships by a few benefactors from the Pace alumni association.  This school is private so it is costly and you will most likely have to take out a few loans to help pay for everything along with some grants and scholarships.  I already applied to a few scholarships (including this one), the TAP award and the money coming from my part-time job will help as well so I do not have to take  out too much money.  I am also considering work study as well for minor expenses and commute."
College Junior,1,"I dont drive a car but when I am with a friend that does, they have to PAY ludicrous amount to just park their car for a few hours. You can find parking, you just can't afford it"
College Freshman,1,No cultural diversity.  Everybody is from the same area.
College Freshman,1,There are barely any parties.  If there is any nobody goes.  If you are underage going home every weekend is your best bet of having a good time.
College Freshman,1,No one really cares about Greek Life when you're in New York City.
College Freshman,1,Horrible. Are you dumb? Why would you bring a car to school?
College Freshman,1,"The strictness is not evenly distributed. Noise is tolerated even when students complain, and students can easily get around the rules regarding visitation."
College Freshman,1,There are no sports at Pace. There are no athletic facilities. There is nothing.
College Freshman,1,"Printing is almost impossible on campus. There are almost no labs, and they are often closed. Printers are so often out of order, and the working printers always have long lines of students. Wireless access is slow and a personal computer is absolutely necessary."
College Freshman,1,"Students only go to bars for fun, which means fake IDs and stuff I am not willing to pay for for a night of ""fun."""
College Freshman,1,No study options/areas whatsoever. The registration process is a complete mess and I hated everything about it.
College Freshman,1,"The Psychology program is a mess. Also, classes at Pace are far too easy. There is a lot of busy work, but I have learned nothing. Some professors actually never give As, so I got a B+ when I deserved an A. I have not found any internship/job opportunities through the university."
College Freshman,1,"Nothing is fixed, no one listens, everyone is rude, and there is a bad social atmosphere."
College Freshman,1,"Everyone is mean. When it comes to dating, all of the guys are gay, so that is difficult for the straight girls. My social life has been nonexistent as I have made not a single friend."
College Freshman,1,"Academic programs are minimal. The social scene is awful, as most students are rude and selfish and only go to bars for fun. There is really no ""campus life"" or any unique opportunities for anything."
College Freshman,1,"The library closes very early, most facilities are not open long enough, there are no student/green centers or traditions, there are almost no student events or campus activities, and no student hangouts."
College Freshman,1,"Pace is not at all a friendly or accommodating campus. No one cares about their education, none of the staff or professors are helpful or involved, there are very few clubs and organizations, problems are seldom resolved, and I was miserable every second of every day. I learned practically nothing and would absolutely not return if I could do it all over."
College Freshman,1,"The campus dining is horrible. I can never find anything fresh or healthy, and I just quit going to the café after a while."
College Senior,1,In the NYC campus you can only park in garages which are extremely expensive. No student parking whatsoever.
College Sophomore,1,Barely any money given in scholarships they do give out

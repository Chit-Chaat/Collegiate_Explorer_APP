Freshman,5,It is a beautiful school with challenging academics. All the professors are willing to help you as much as you need. There are many different courses a student can take and you are encouraged to take courses in multiple fields of study.
Alum,5,Did not take online classes so I don't have anything to add here.  The university website seems to be easy to use.
Junior,5,"The teachers and administration have made online learning very easy. Of course there is more work than normal, but the teachers are doing everything in their power to make this semester online as easy as possible."
Junior,5,"Due to COVID some Fall classes are online.  While I'd prefer to be in person for all my classes,  I am learning and getting a lot out of my 2 online classes."
Junior,5,"I am so happy I chose UMiami.  The campus is gorgeous,  it's awesome to hangout or study year round at the gliders, tables (umbrellas) or by the lake.   Intramural sports are fun and there are plenty of clubs to get involved in, too.  Amazing school spirit:  football games are the best, but also love watching basketball and baseball.   Campus activities and movie night are held by Student groups and there's a ton to do off campus, too: Wynwood Walls, beaches, clubs, cuban food.  I've had incredible professors and have taken advantage of so many out of the classroom opportunities - I'm currently interviewing for summer internships and am so proud to share my experiences and what I've learned here at UM."
Niche User,5,I am enrolled in the accelerated nursing program at the University of Miami. The professors are knowledgeable and intelligent in their fields.
Niche User,5,University of Miami is an amazing university. The campus is beautiful. UM just built a new on-campus housing building. The professors and faculty go above and beyond for the students. The university has a lot of school spirit.
Niche User,5,Haven't had an experience there yet because I start soon. I'm doing this review for a scholarship application so just ignore it.
Niche User,5,"Doing this for a scholarship application. I'm only beginning to attend the University of Miami this spring, but it's a wonderful school as far as I understand."
Graduate Student,5,Great school. best in sports. Close to the Miami scene. the students are so nice and helpful. the sports  scene is the best. best football they have on campus.
Graduate Student,5,"I took online classes, super easy and the best. The teachers are so helpful and willing to help out."
Freshman,5,I took two class online and it was good. The teachers where friendly and give you all the information that you needed.
Junior,5,I love my school so much ! the professors are there for you to succeed.after two years you get to see some familiar faces and I am happy that I can call the University of Miami my second home. The tutoring center is hands down the best and has helped me with a lot of my health science classes. If you need help UM is there to help. I am grateful and appreciate everything my school offers.
Junior,5,Great campus ambiance and amazing professors who are experts in their field. I always look forward to going back to each academic year.
Senior,5,Excellent university. Makes everyone feel welcome even if they are not from Miami. The community is connected and caring. Safety and health are main priorities at UM.
Senior,5,"My classes during the Spring 2020 semester transitioned into online classes due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the transition was overall seamless and the professors worked hard to ensure that the students were still able to learn and were able to reach out to the professors. Some classes were offered live and some were recorded previously while other live classes were recorded for students to be able to watch later as well."
Niche User,5,I am currently a recent student that has been accepted into their BSN accelerated nursing program for spring 2021 admission. I love their diversity and high rate of NCLEX passing .
Niche User,5,"I have been accepted into their BSN accelerated nursing program. My decision to apply is based on the universityâ€™s diversity , they connection to the community and their high Passing rate of NCLEX ."
Alum,5,I did not take online courses so i cannot rate this section. However we used blackboard as an online resource.
Alum,5,"Definitely the best university out there. Full of very intelligent people and a great faculty. The campus is very beautiful with a bar and a lake in the center. They have state of the art facilities and good on campus food. Its about 20 minutes away from the beach. There is also amazing night life and you are not far from Wynwood, the art district that hosts art basel every year."
Junior,5,They were so understanding and patient and I am very grateful! They were all trying their best to help the students out and I can't say anything bad about my experience I have had with them.
Sophomore,5,"Awesome college community , great professors all willing to help.  great programs , Student life is THE BEST....any clubs you can imagine, sports are D1.  Campus is so laid back and diverse ...and of course its close to Miami beach!!!..."
Sophomore,5,During COVID 19 classes went online just like everywhere else.  Transition was seamless and easy... No problems whatsoever
Alum,5,"I love the whole UM experience. I met a diverse group of people from every corner of the country, was challenged in my classes, and had an incredible city to explore these past four years. The best part of the U is the vast network that you are bound to meet. 'Canes truly do care for 'Canes and the support system travels off campus & around the world. My advisors became my second parents and my friends became the siblings I never had. I came from a tiny farm town and was worried about meeting new people but the school spirit is so contagious at UM that fitting in was no problem. Our president (Frenk) is the coolest guy ever, and all the high-up admin are extremely approachable and caring. The mentality at UM is definitely ""work hard, play hard."" Everyone studies and shows interest in their courses, but they also know how to blow off steam and enjoy the many beaches, attractions, and nightlife that south Florida has to offer. Campus is GORGEOUS as are all the people in Miami. Attend!!"
Alum,5,"Excellent and diverse student life, amazing professors, beautiful campus, challenging coursework, and overall enriching experience."
Alum,5,"I have not regretted the moment I said I want to be a HURRICANE !! I believe no one can deny that UM has everything to offer to its students, ranging from good professors to beautiful campus and environment. I give it a solid grade of A in all aspects."
Alum,5,"I have no experience with online learning. I heard good stuff about their Cybersecurity boot camp. Overall, I would not be surprised if UM has one of the best online experiences. because it's their natural habit to be in the top tier always."
Senior,5,"So far, I have enjoyed my experience at UM. I am an Architecture student, so I tend to have a pretty heavy work load. However, I am grateful that I have still been able to take part in a variety of other classes and activities at the U!"
Senior,5,"When the pandemic forced everyone to do online classes, I was on a study abroad trip. Inevitably, the trip was cancelled , and we were all sent home. I thought online class would be difficult at first, but my professors did a great job of helping us transition to online learning."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Miami has all the best things that one could hope for in a college experience. Aside from the breathtakingly gorgeous campus, the academics are top tier, the student body is incredibly diverse, and the social/party scene is one of the best in the country, especially because it's next to a city known for partying."
Junior,5,"I would say the online experience was flawless. The professors were great at adapting, the only setback was the glitches with blackboard."
Junior,5,I started going to UM in 2017 and i developed a terrible illness and thus had to take two years off. UM welcomed me with open arms and were so good and understanding to me every step of the way. I am eternally grateful to them. All the professors have been so understanding and i can tell they just want to see me succeed. Most of The classes are small enough where they can take the time to get to know you. I would not have been able to go to this school without the financial aid office's help. This school has been a lifeline to me
Freshman,5,"When the COVID-19 pandemic began the university was forced to switch to an online mode of education, but in my experience, it was close to a flawless transition."
Freshman,5,"The University of Miami has all the best things that one could hope for in a college experience. Aside from the breathtakingly gorgeous campus, the academics are top tier, the student body is incredibly diverse, and the social/party scene is one of the best in the country, especially because it's next to a city known for partying."
Alum,5,I met some amazing people at UM. The professors were extremely personable and Coral Gables is a great area. I would recommend UM to anyone that has the opportunity to attend. Wouldn't have wanted to experience college anywhere else!
Freshman,5,"Excited to start in the fall. I have only heard amazing things about the University of Miami. I know I will be able to succeed here, and so will you."
Sophomore,5,The University of Miami is an absolutely amazing school. The campus is top-notch and the facilities leave nothing to be desired. The school staff is highly knowledgeable and friendly. My only complaint is that the tuition is very expensive.
Senior,5,Absolutely loved my experience at UM and would not trade it for anything in the world. Definitely come here if you can.
Niche User,5,"The atmosphere of ""The U"", as we call it, is always the best. As soon as stepping on campus, I felt welcomed by everyone and the scenery is amazing."
Senior,5,"First and foremost, ALL of my Professors have been outstanding.  They each take the time to listen and make themselves available when needed.  They really do want their students to succeed and will do what they can to ensure a positive and healthy student/professor relationship.  I loved the small class settings as well.  The administrations goes out of their way to make sure that student are taken care of with LOTS of activities to choose from on campus.  The campus itself is beautiful and makes you not want to leave."
Freshman,5,"Miami has my major as one of the highest in field, good program, with good connections. At Miami, I can double major in Criminology and Psychology which I canâ€™t do at other colleges I've applied to. With Miamiâ€™s Cognate Program, the student is required to take at least three courses that share a theme/focus determined by the faculty. I can dive even deeper to my study of Forensic Science and Psychology and be kept on track because Iâ€™ll be choosing to create my schedule and study the interests I choose"
Senior,5,Wonderful. Good classes. Lots of ways to get involved. Very spirited. Beautiful campus. Going to UM has been the most transforming experience of my life.
Alum,5,Wonderful place to get ahead in life.  I will always be grateful to this college.  The faculty is one of the best in the nation with many outstanding professors.  In Florida at least 60 percent of successfully people I know went to the university of Miami.
Freshman,5,Modernized and beautiful with great diversity. It has a great honors program and academic professors. With many opportunities for clubs and study abroad programs.
Niche User,5,"I am attending next fall and am so beyond excited. the people I have met so far that go currently are the sweetest, and the other incoming freshman are nice also. from what I've heard there is an amazing combo of academics and fun. work hard play hard really fits UM I'm so excited"
Freshman,5,"UM has become my home. Iâ€™ve met amazing people from all over the world, and I genuinely enjoy going to classes. The professors care about you and the classes are engaging. Thereâ€™s also always something to do around campus or in Miami, so youâ€™ll never get bored. Wouldnâ€™t replace my experience for anything else."
Freshman,5,"Itâ€™s really diverse and, although I am an international student, I feel at home. People are nice, professors do care about what the teach (of course, thereâ€™s exceptions), and they sought to help me in any wait they could so that I could study my dream career"
Sophomore,5,The diversity and opportunity here is unlike anywhere else. The staff and administrators really encourage you to take advantage of all available resources.
Freshman,5,A rigorous and academics-focused school that is sure to prepare you tremendously for the work field.
Freshman,5,The university of Miami wants you to succeed and it ensures that it provides the pathways for success to be achieved and goals to become accomplished.
Freshman,5,"The University of Miami is an amazing school not just for its beautiful campus, diverse students, and advanced education, but for its welcoming community and support systems that make sure each student has the chance to become successful in what they want to do in their futures. And obviously you probably know the social student life is great for a college in Miami, FL. If you are choosing between a school and UMiami, choose Miami."
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus, it is beautiful and always evolving. The academics are rigorous. The cost of attendance is high compared to other universities but I think the return of investment will pay off in South Florida."
Graduate Student,5,"Great university i had an awesome time, would recommend, completely. Miami life is awesome as well. As a foreigner it was amazing."
Freshman,5,I'm currently a freshman in the school of architecture and I just want to say I couldn't see myself anywhere else. The school is so accommodating and its the perfect fit for me with a balance of party life and academics it was just what i was looking for.
Junior,5,"I literally love the University of Miami. My advice is to not major in engineering there though because the engineering school is not very good. If I could go back in time I would have started in the business school because they have amazing connections and all the teachers are very helpful and have worked in the field. The accounting department especially is awesome, I have the best relations with all my professors. I have nothing but good to say about the University, they have great student organizations. Greek life is great if you are in it, but also it is fine if you are not involved in it. Just a great school, puts money back into its students."
Freshman,5,"The weather matches the environment of the campus, warm and happy. The student life is by far incomparable to any school. The deans do a great job in including all people in different student activities and organizations from different backgrounds. The student housing is not the best, but is improving with the opening of the lakeside village next school year. The campus has its own police department and is located in a very safe community. I would recommend getting the smallest meal plan and finding other alternatives to dinning."
Junior,5,"An incredible experience thus far, small classes, amazing professors and a great campus! I made the decision to transfer here my sophomore year and it's been such an amazing experience that I wouldn't trade for the world."
Senior,5,"Amazing university with amazing school spirit. We party hard and study harder. In one of the most amazing cities in the world, with fantastic academics and a great alumni network."
Junior,5,"In my experience, the University of Miami has been fantastic. I never lived in the dorms, so I canâ€™t speak to that aspect, but the campus is great. A lot of the facilities are being updated and new ones are constantly being built. Iâ€™ve had really great professors and met some really fantastic people. There are always different events and activities happening all over campus, so itâ€™s easy to get involved. I would highly recommend UM."
Sophomore,5,The people and the place make UM the place to be I love every second on campus and it has mad me a better person and offered me so many opportunities!
Alum,4,Miami is an amazing school with a plethora of student options but it is quite pricey and you have to search out what you need to get a return on your investment instead of having that built in.
Freshman,4,Dorms. They are a bit old and the bathrooms are dated. I would like for the school to update the dorms and the bathrooms in each hall.
Junior,4,Doing school online is hard for everyone but the teachers really do put in the extra work to make sure your succeeding in most classes. if you need help they have resources for you and will speak to you in office hours if need be.
Junior,4,We had to do switch to an online platform halfway through the Spring 2020 semester. Professors tried their best to accommodate everyone in the new learning style.
Junior,4,"This school is very diverse and has professors and other faculty that want to see you succeed. Tuition is very expensive, however."
Junior,4,"Online learning was a bit of a struggle, especially since teachers and staff weren't already familiar with the technology used to conduct lessons. The more we used it, the better the experience became."
Junior,4,Love the school environment and all the students!  The professors are very easy to contact and the academics are challenging but worth while !
Junior,4,It is such an amazing and diverse school. The only thing I complain about is the waitlist to switch your major it is not easy to switch you major especially if there is a waitlist to get into that specific one.
Junior,4,"Love the U, have since I fell in love with the university while touring in high school. great campus, stunning views. dorms could be better but they are slowly building new ones. dining halls could be better. club and party scene could be overwhelming to people not great at time management, always something to do. people can be cliquey but thatâ€™s everywhere. awesome experience so far!"
Sophomore,4,While at first it was rough for certain professors overall I had an easy time with the school's online learning. The professors I have had embraced using online tools in classes prior to having to moving solely online. I believe this is the reason why moving online was so simple for me and class continued without extra strain.
Sophomore,4,"I believe choosing the University of Miami for college was the best decision of my life. I have never more welcomed and assisted in my education. From the professors to individual departments such as housing, there is always someone to help. They prepare you for the future as soon as you step on campus and most importantly they believe you can achieve."
Alum,4,"Teachers were a lot more lenient when everything transitioned online. Some of the older professors had more difficulties working the technology of course, but for the most part online classes (due to COVID-19) were alright. I missed seeing people in person, but of course with the safety restrictions that was not possible. Some classes, such as Physical Geography, used lock-down browser mode during exams so no other tabs could be open (to prevent cheating). Other classes cancelled final exams and just had students explain their final projects with powerpoint presentations. Not the same 1-on-1 training as before, but luckily professors still offered ""office hours"" for extra support and clarification. The most difficult online class (for me) was Environmental Field Studies - which I was a TA for. The class simply needed to be taught outdoors with hand-on instructions, so it was not very effective online. Statistics and and Web GIS classes were both just about the exact same as in-person."
Freshman,4,"Due to COVID-19, my Spring semester was taken partially online. Given that many of the professors are from an older generation and are not as adept at navigating technology as they are with their classroom and textbooks, there was a learning curve at the beginning of the time period. However, both students and professors adapted and the curriculum was still able to be taught effectively and successfully."
Freshman,4,"At the University of Miami, students are given a multitude of opportunities to pursue experiences they are passionate about and make the most of their education. With a variety of courses and clubs, several class sections and hundreds of intelligent professors, students are never at a loss of learning and resources. I think the enrollment process could be changed slightly in a way that allows students to take courses outside of their specific school earlier within their four years. However, overall an exceptional experience."
Freshman,4,"The online classes were not a great experience for me. But, that was due to personal problems. The professors, though, did their best and provided a great service."
Sophomore,4,"I've learned that to be a successful distance learner, you have to be self-disciplined and able to work well on your own. Since you won't be physically going to class each week, you can take part in class from the comfort of your own home."
Freshman,4,Love the Microbiology department and all of its professors! They take the time to get to know each of their students and tailor their classes to current events.
Alum,4,Fun school near the beach with challenging coursework and a solid reputation for job hunting in Florida.
Freshman,4,Awesome school. Dining halls are kinda bad and the housing is overpriced. Student life is cool. The academics are really good. I am a business major and all of my classes are really helpful. The professors really care about you.
Freshman,4,I like the inclusivity and the wide variety of opportunities you can find on campus to furthere your education.
Freshman,4,"There are so many great opportunities that come your way when you are a student of the U. Small classes, dedicated professors and faculty that wants to help you in every way possible. I have made my friends for life and being in Miami, the options for us are limitless."
Alum,4,"My time at the University of Miami was mostly well spent. I focused on academics during my 4 years at school and my grades reflected this.
I didn't spend a lot of time partying. And if there is one thing I wish I would have done more of it would have been to get involved in more groups and spend more time with friends. 
The campus and surrounding areas always felt safe to me, but when I experienced sexual abuse there was no support system in place to help me deal with it.
Miami is a great sports school and now a leader in STEM. But because I was an Art Major, I also didn't feel like I had full academic support. I think this is an ongoing issue when it comes to placing a value on my degree. If they continue to not place any importance on the Arts & Art History at the school, did I get the best education for all the money that I paid? And is my degree worth anything now if they still don't build up those departments or academic areas?"
Sophomore,4,"The college experience has so far been developing and maturing as an adult through facing and encountering various people and situations. The university has many resources that the students can address to for need and help to provide you with support. I have gained much help and assistance from the Christian chaplains, the counseling center, the student health center, and the cane success center. The professors are also there to listen to and give you advice.  The campus is beautiful and enjoying a short break taking in the view after focused studying is a great rest."
Freshman,4,The only things I would change about this school is the freshman living situation and the dining hall. We have lots of asian food and not the best quality.
Senior,4,"UM has been a great and wholesome experience. It offered a variety of activities and accommodations as well as a great education. However, the current changes being made to the school are reflecting upon graduating students' tuitions such as the new student housing, investments into the athletic programs, etc. I think UM should pay more attention to providing the students with more resources for academia."
Niche User,4,"I have not yet attended. However, I have gotten accepted. The University of Miami has been so gracious and supportive and I am so excited to start the next four!"
Freshman,4,"This University is okay if you have a lot of friends - you really should only be here for connections. In terms of academics, it is not very hard so far. You may have to chase some of the administration down for help but it is clear that you are cared for while being there and they provide countless resources to those who need it."
Sophomore,4,"Attending the University of Miami has made me a much more cultured, well-rounded person than I was before coming here. If you're looking for a medium-sized, diverse school with a gorgeous, closed campus close to a big city, look no further! You will meet people from all over the world and all sorts of backgrounds here at UM, which you won't get at every private university in the country. Most of the professors I've had here seem very accomplished and well-versed in the fields they are teaching, and overall the academics are challenging but nothing unbearable. There is no lack of school spirit and football games are highly attended on weekends in the fall. The party scene is very good. In my opinion, there's a healthy balance between academics and partying here, but I will say that if you are totally not a partier/going-out person, maybe consider a different school, but I think most people can find a healthy balance. The gorgeous warm weather year-round is also a huge plus!"
Freshman,4,"I really like this school! Amazing professors, amazing people, and amazing opportunities. So much to do around Miami and on campus is so beautiful too!"
Senior,4,I like the fact that every student is active on campus and the college of Arts and Sciences care deeply about their students.
Sophomore,4,"The university of Miami has excellent professors in the wide range of majors and minors. The food is not great. The party life is fine, and everyone is always going out. However, there are a lot of things to do that do not involve parties and drinking."
Works Here,4,"The food at Um is awesome catering is outstanding and the food service management is great  the food court has many options. 
Would like the parking to be free for employees. Always have healthy options available and great at listing ingredients."
Junior,4,Loved the college campus. Great food service. Loved the food options provided. The student programming could be a little more appealing to all students. Looking forward to Fall activities planned. Summer food options are great and creative
Works Here,4,Great place with great education campus life and food great academic and faculty dining halls Ofer great customer service and great food and variety
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I would say that this is an above-average institution. The weather, location, people, athletics, facilities, and overall academics are top-notch. Most of the classes are thorough and challenging without being completely impossible, which is ideal. Most of the teachers and students are kind and respectful of others. The weather and location are ideal for those looking for a school that can provide the perfect balance of party life and academic work. I will say, however, that being in the freshman dorms can get a bit loud sometimes, making it difficult to study within the room.  

Putting these very minor complaints aside, the university maintains a very conducive learning environment."
Sophomore,4,"Itâ€™s quite good university for anyone who wants to study in the urban areas. Also, you can enjoy the beach nearby"
Works Here,4,Great people and atmosphere. Professors care about students and stay connected. Everyone is lively and loves Miami. Overall great school.
Sophomore,4,"Overall amazing school. The area encapsulates all, with a great education. You will enjoy every moment at this school."
Junior,4,There is truly something for everyone at the University of Miami. The student population is a melting pot of people from all corners of the world. The university offers a multitude of resources and clubs to help students reach their academic goals while meeting people with similar interests along the way.
Sophomore,4,"Before attending UM, I was pretty nervous because I thought it would be all preppy kids, but I have learned that the college experience is truly what you make it. UM is so diverse, that there is truly someone for everyone. For academics, good grades do not come easy, so you have to be willing to put in the work. The good thing about UM is when you're done with all of your work, you have the opportunity to explore the Miami city, or just go out to an event with friends!"
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful. The school offers excellent financial aid to students. Freshman housing is very old.
Freshman,4,"The University of Miami is an overall great school that has students from all over the world, making it feel rather easy to network and make connections with people from different places. Academically speaking, it is a challenging school that still allows its students to enjoy their college lives, as it is easy to balance school work and social life. One thing that I would personally like to see change in the university is how hard it is to change from one professor to another after the first few weeks of classes"
Sophomore,4,"I picked UM because I wanted to stay living in Miami and my parents went there. My brother currently goes there now too. We are a full fledge UM family. It's in our blood I guess! The campus is gorgeous. The classrooms are modern. The resources and diversity are endless. Students are friendly and very school spirited. There is much participation and enthusiasm in all regards. What I would like to see change among the student body is the ""rich-kid"" vibe. Seeing as it is a private school, many students come from affluent backgrounds and it is reflected in their sense of entitlement and the flashy brands they are constantly clad in."
Alum,4,I feel well prepared academically. I just wish there was more concern for students financially. Lots of extracurricular activities available. Dining hall food gets old pretty quickly. Dorms will give you respiratory issues. Very accomplished faculty that make the experience worth it.
Niche User,4,"I like about this college cause they have good resources and are organized.
the sports teams are fantastic!"
Freshman,4,"I really feel like this is a place where I can thrive in all aspects of my life. Academically, socially, and professionally, there is no place like the U!"
Junior,4,"UM is a great school with many  great fields of studies. UM is such a lively and vibrant school with a great, social student body. There is always some type of activity happening on campus, that encourage students to engage. There are many different clubs in which students can join, there is something for everyone. UM is such a diverse school, one the best things is that you get the oppurtunity to meet and befriend people from all across the world.  Most professors are nice, friendly, and willing to ensure students understand the material/course work. Campus and Dinning Hall have a good level of cleanliness. Only downside would be the dorms, they could definitely be improved. UM provides opportunities,  great education and a fun time."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at UM has been great! I am a nursing major and have enjoyed all my classes thus far. The professors are very knowledgeable and most of them are very willing to help their students succeed. Academically, the school is incredible. The sports, night life, and campus are also very good. My only criticism is that the dorms are too small, old, and gross and the food in the dining hall isn't very appetizing."
Senior,4,I have had so many great opportunities to become involved. I am in a sorority and on the executive board of two honor societies but am in four. I was able to participate in athletics through the novice rowing team and got an experience I probably would not have been able to obtain anywhere else. I am involved in It's On Us as a student ambassador working to combat sexual assault on campus which our school is becoming more and more proactive about. I have great professors who care about me.
Junior,4,"The education is great. They make sure every major has the best possible professors that can provide the student the tools to be a well-rounded individual. But, it lacks a family environment because it felt more institutional. In comparison to local universities, the professors and faculty did not extend an extra hand. Also, very difficult to be educated about possible financial benefits."
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus, the tour was beautiful and it was what helped to foster my passion for this college."
Senior,4,"UM is an excellent school- beautiful campus, fun atmosphere, it's hard to ever get bored with so many things to do on or around campus. I wish, however, that more money would be invested in academics and hiring some stronger teachers. I've had some of the greatest teachers of my life at this school, but also some professors that should not be allowed to teach. It's a lot of money to be spending on a school with poor academic resources in certain areas of study."
Sophomore,4,"From the start the University of Miami was not my first choice school. It was only after I got in that I even considered wanting to go there and it has been one of the best decisions I have ever made. As an international studies and Spanish major, I belong to two very small departments and that is helpful because I get to know my professors very early on in my college career. Many students over look this factor, but it is something that must be taken into consideration. One downside about the school is the dining hall food. It is terrible. As my freshmen year rolled on, my friends and I found ourselves going to the dining hall less and less. Most of the time we go to the food court, use UberEats or stock up with food from the grocery store. Other than that, I love the school and have nothing else to complain about."
Graduate Student,4,"Such a unique atmosphere, you won't regret the experience. The faculty at RSMAS are amazing, kind, and professional."
Freshman,4,"Nice campus, horrible food in the dining halls. A lot of student orgs and there is always something to do on campus."
Freshman,4,"The people are really nice, and the campus is really pretty. I felt a little issolated by the fact that I am Asian and the majority of people are either Caucasian or from Latin America"
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus, the diversity, the technological advancements. The atmosphere is great! The energy when sporting events take place is very exciting."
Niche User,4,"The campus is outstanding, with something to see or do for any type of person. After all, it may be the most diverse campus in all of Florida. The food options there are plentiful, the classes themselves are decently sized and the professors are there to help. It's in a good city in Florida, Coral Gables, and the options in having fun in the campus may be unmatched."
Junior,4,"Students have incredible access to research opportunities and internships. Ample on campus resources for students to use, latest technologies in study rooms. Would like to see set study rooms for Pre-Health students as other rooms get saturated with students, and access to some is limited to certain majors"
Niche User,4,"The University of Miami's outstanding and fascinating science programs offer a multitude of research and internship opportunities. Furthermore, the campus' lifestyle seems to be vibrant and dynamic, and the diverse student body is a proof of the university's will to welcome students from all ethnic, religious and sexual backgrounds."
Senior,2,"Online courses have taken place via Zoom, which makes interaction with the professors and other students difficult. As a result, the experience is not engaging. In my experience, professors tend to read off of high level slides, so I learn by reading from course textbooks, which is extremely frustrating given UM's expensive tuition. My professors have made themselves available to meet over Zoom when I have questions about certain content."
Sophomore,2,"This school is pretty racist in terms of exclusivity and social life, absolutely horrible within greek life. Biggest mistake of my life. Such a toxic social scene and the school is obsessed with outward appearance, money, and showing off. Pre-med is okay here if you are looking to just come, study, and not interact with people. Almost everyone I met is selfish and very few show empathy and true friendship. Impossible to attend this school with developing depression or an eating disorder. Probably both. I am transferring and absolutely hated the way my mental health deteriorated at this school. Would not recommend unless you are skinny, white, and rich. I am transferring and couldn't be happier. Disgusted by the people I met here and lost fate in humanity tbh. Ofc I did meet some people who made it bearable but isn't worth it for the fat price tag. Skip this school and save your money you are welcome, don't get entranced by the city and party scene. Next caller."
Sophomore,2,"If you think youâ€™re going to get a good college experience here GO ELSEWHERE. The only way you can go out, meet people, and have fun is if youâ€™re in a frat. In order to be in one, you have to be hazed very badly. If youâ€™re not in one, youâ€™re not allowed into any party whatsoever, you canâ€™t even pay your way in. So if you think oh Miami fun party school, YOU ARE WRONG. Besides that the professors are decent, Iâ€™d say above average. Some are good some are awful, thereâ€™s really no in between. Food in dining halls are bad but restaurants are good.  Overall I hope people read this and realize that this school is just blinding you with nice things and a decent rating while in reality itâ€™s not good at all. If Greek life didnâ€™t exist here, Iâ€™d be able to recommend this college to anyone because it would be a lot more connected."
College Junior,2,"I really don't like it. It's time to stop treating college students like rats. I understand that Miami is overpopulated to begin with. But the buildings are from the 50's. They are old. They are small. You will probably hate your roommate by the end of the year. I wish I didn't have to do it again next year. Thinking about it makes me want to cry. The dorm rooms are not big enough to fit two people. The design is very basic. You see the outside of campus and you are amazed. You walk inside, it feels like a mental hospital. It is a glorified box. The UV is great though from what I've heard and seen, but you can only get in as a Junior."
College Junior,2,"The greek life for both genders is getting out of control. Reviews said that it wasn't a big deal at UM, but every year it gets bigger and bigger. The caliber of the people that join are not good either. Frats exclude other guys from coming to their parties, which brings about a ridiculous ratio of 10 girls to one guy. They are mostly an uncomplicated and superficial species. To be a greek girl, you have to act and sound the exact same as the rest of your sorority members. If not, they won't accept you. My friend tried to join one, realized they think they are above the rules and law, and dropped. The friends she made stopped having brunch with her as soon as she quit. They are mostly fake to each other, they are more concerned about image than true sisterhood."
College Sophomore,2,I don't live on campus but I've been to the dorms and they are tiny and extremely outdated and uncomfortable.
College Sophomore,2,I don't feel like I am learning anything worthwhile
College Sophomore,2,The dorms look like prison cells
College Sophomore,2,I feel like the administration does not care
College Senior,2,They take up too much space are barely active on campus
College Freshman,2,It's Miami... drugs are pretty much everywhere and very accessible. Little to no policy enforcement.
College Junior,2,"The U doesn't have the best way of controlling/supervising what goes on in the fraternities.  Lots of issues are caused by the university not recognizing the frat; thus, some of them get out of control.  Several frats are not recognized as a school sanctioned frat, but everyone still will associate the mis-conduct that sometimes comes from them with the university."
College Freshman,2,I am considering transferring after one year due to the bad experiences I have had here. Would not go to UM if I had to make the decision again.
College Junior,2,Don't enjoy it here. Paying so much money for mediocrity.
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone drinks. Everyone. A lot of cocaine, of course marijuana, and a lot of people take adderall and other study drugs. The partying definitely promotes the drugs, and there is a lot of partying."
College Sophomore,2,"Some of the professors I've had don't really care about each student. But, this past semester I had some pretty amazing professors. Basically go on ratemyprofessor before choosing a class because it varies."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life has pushed mass mind sets and removes the individuality of the students who chose to join. I am not a fan of it and they do tend to attract the ""party goers"" who seem to have education set below having a good time."
College Freshman,2,"Social scene is good. Other than that, absolutely horrendous."
College Freshman,2,There was a sexual assault
College Sophomore,2,Super expensive. It sucks. Everything is incredibly expensive in Miami. That's the problem.
College Sophomore,2,"The campus lottery system is okay. The Mahoney/Pearson dorms aren't great, very old, but then most dorms at colleges never really are. People with 45 credits or more can stay in the University Village, which are pretty basic and small college apartments. The dorms do have some social gatherings, but there isn't a strong sense of community in the dorms or strong social atmosphere. They're pretty close to majority of class buildings on campus. Either way, the dorms or UV are too expensive for what you're getting."
College Sophomore,2,I have to work so much in order to pay for tuition.
College Sophomore,2,"I do not think very highly of those in fraternities or sororities, especially the non-ethnic fraternities. Too much has come to light regarding their racism, and sexism, and it makes me wholly uncomfortable. I do my best to avoid the people in fraternities and their parties."
College Freshman,2,There are not many selections available. On campus dining requires major improvements in order to provide healthier food its its students.
College Senior,2,"Restaurants are extremely pricey and I have a feeling they are of very low quality, even tough I never been sick"
College Senior,2,"Chartwells is a terrible choice, the meat is disgusting, e.g. I have never had real beef! Vegetables are tasteless but the staff is really nice and helpful!"
College Sophomore,2,"There is a lot about UM that no one tells you before attending UM, it is advertised different from what it actually is. The campus life is very inexistent after 5pm on weekdays and all day on weekends especially because most students do not live on campus. On weekends the campus is generally dead which leads to a large lack of involvement by the students in clubs and organizations. There is a very superficial atmosphere among the students, it feels like high school has not ended and everyone is still trying to one up everyone else. The high tuition does not translate into many accessible resources regarding internships and future opportunities. Students also seem to not care about their academics and much more with their social life since they are constantly trying to impress one another. There is a very large lacking in school spirit and athletics. It is essential to have a car here; there is so much to do since it is Miami such as South Beach, Brickell, Coconut Grove, Key Biscayne, Bayfront, etc. however you can only get there by car (unless you want to wait for hours for dangerous public transportation). It is a fun school if you are looking for that Miami lifestyle, however, it is not a traditional college experience as most might think it is."
College Sophomore,2,"Dining halls are not very good. As a first semester freshman they are okay but then you realize how disgusting the food is. It does not sit well in your stomach and there are not too many healthy options. They are not open late enough either.

The food court is good, especially Tossed. That all closes very early too. 

They need a Chipotle and Dunkin' on campus."
College Senior,2,"There is a lot of options on campus and they just renovated the food court. Personally, I still do not like the food on campus so I go elsewhere to eat. I do not like that the school requires a meal plan if you live in the dorms after your first year."
College Sophomore,2,Really bad campus life and facilities.
College Sophomore,2,In an isolated suburb. Next to major highway.
College Sophomore,2,"Not ideal. Should be much, much nicer."
College Sophomore,2,It's hard to attend  this school if you come from a low income family
College Sophomore,2,It's very costly to eat on and off campus and the only variety is far from campus
College Sophomore,2,I don't like the local area. It is a very superficial city.
College Junior,2,I'll be honest. UM is expensive and I'm struggling to attend this school financially. Part of it is my fault but the school should have been more open to a tranfer student such as myself.
College Junior,2,"The food that is served on campus isn't great. I've found mold on the buns of my burgers. There is a lot of variety, but most of the food doesn't taste as good as it looks."
College Junior,2,You would think that with the cost to attend this school that the housing available would be more spacious and just nicer. The dorm layouts seem outdated and there is not enough for the amount of students there. Most students prefer to live off campus because of this.
College Junior,2,"Often times, someone is getting robbed nearby campus. However the notification service helps us students know when there is a situation."
College Junior,2,"There is not much variety when you are looking for a quick, affordable meal. Especially late nights."
College Junior,2,"If you have a meal plan, going to the dining hall is convenient, as well as using your dining dollars at the franchises/stores around campus. But Chartwells sucks. They try to make these exotic dishes in the dining hall when 95% of the time they don't even know how to cook rice properly. The food is edible, but mostly unenjoyable."
College Sophomore,2,"Although I am a commuter student and don't see to many student in the dorms partake in alcohol consumption, my freshman friends/peers that do live in the dorms tell me alcohol is a big issue with resident college students."
College Sophomore,2,"Students at my university are are very heavy into marijuana, cocaine, and molly. Music Festivals like Ultra encourage students to try rave drugs. Alcohol is very easy for underage students to access."
College Sophomore,2,Most off campus housing options near my university are over-priced and aren't well maintained.
College Freshman,2,Food is definitely not great but there's so many options you don't have to eat at the dining halls (and really probably shouldn't).
College Freshman,2,"Miami's drug scene is just as bad as any other school that has a slight reputation for being a party school. You go to college, you drink if you want. If not, there's no pressure at all and you will definitely find people who don't want to do it either. Alcohol is almost always around for everyone but the rules in the dorms are pretty strict if you're not of age."
College Junior,2,"I am blessed to be admitted into the Nursing Program at UM. However, they are not very proactive about helping or informing the accepted students. I applied in August and got accepted for the Summer term instead of the Spring term. In addition, they gave me a congratulations letter and barely contacted me after. I was never notified about any orientation, fees, etc. I had to call several times a day to find out this information. I suggest that the Nursing School provides guidelines and to do lists for accepted nursing students and keep them in the loop instead of me struggling to talk to someone for information."
Recent Alumnus,2,I had no idea we had a greek life.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Miami in general has very bad public transportation options, the university has attempted to provide alternative options for the students but it is still lacking."
College Student,2,"Charwells will not work with student government, they must have their way, and the employees are treated awfully by their bosses. But the students love the workers"
College Student,2,"The school only cares about on campus, you can spen $30 on a cab to the airport and they don't care"
College Senior,2,It's bad because it is very expensive and not many scholarships are given out.
College Senior,2,There seems to be drugs at every party.
College Senior,2,"My first week as a freshman I parked in one of the lots. When I got to my car, a huge monster of a gash ran alongside my car. It must have been a pickup truck or a tall vehicle because the damage was ridiculous.
They said they couldnt do anything about it because there were no cameras in the area..."
College Senior,2,"As a non-Greek, I will contest to this.
There's a lot of Greek pride on campus, which as an idea, is nice. However, a good 90% of our student body, including Greeks, come from extremely wealthy backgrounds and Greek status only fuels their egos when it comes to delusions of grandeur. 
Also, if you want to find hard drugs, visit a frat house!"
College Freshman,2,"I cannot sit here and argue that UM is not diverse. There are international students all over the place and many different ethnicities are present. However, it is EXTREMELY segregated and difficult to befriend a lot of people outside of your major ethnic group."
College Freshman,2,"Some professors are awesome, some classes are awesome, beautiful campus, and everything I like about it pretty much ends there. Also, nice gym.

I just don't feel like it's an intellectually stimulating environment, and it's difficult to meet genuine hardworking people here. Lots of superficial people. Generally people are not devoted significantly to anything but partying and then taking lots of study drugs to cram right before finals. If that sounds like you, you will absolutely love it here- I know most people that come to miami have a fantastic time and feel as if they ""grow"" here in a good way, but I think I have fewer brain cells now than I did when I first got here. Generally uninspiring place for me and a hope to transfer soon. There are definitely silver linings, like I said before certain departments (RSMAS!!!!) and professors are fantastic! So if you can put up with the unfavorable conditions then there is much to be gained at this school.

Also classes are really easy."
College Freshman,2,Many people are exposed to marijuana and alcohol that are illegal for their age group
College Freshman,2,"Health center is great! Great staff;easy to make appointments!
Coming from california, I was shocked at how unhealthy the general student population is but it's just different everywhere I guess! People definitely drink unhealthy amounts and then pig out on fried french toast sticks and waffles and chicken fingers. Dining hall food is generally unhealthy to satisfy the demand of the students. Omlette bar is my safe haven :)"
College Freshman,2,"If you like cocaine, go here.
If not it's not an issue but be prepared to be around people that do.

Half of the school is alcoholics, the other half knows how to drink in moderation but goes crazy every once in a while."
Junior,1,This school is nothing but privileged. People here got everything handed to them since birth. If you're middle class or lower don't expect to have anything in common with anyone here. There is no concept of hard work or the value of money. The people that go here are the ones that can simply afford it and they are just here to party and use up their parents' money. Biggest mistake of my life to go into debt with this school. A waste of money
Freshman,1,"$75,000 to hang out with entitled brats, take high school level courses, eat terrible food, and see an administration that really seems to not care. Also the campus may look nice but it's in a strip mall area of town pretty far from the beach and any cool part of the city. The school is nowhere near as diverse as advertised (my floor is 36 white kids out of 38 on it) and truly it's a place where most students have no sense of money or reality."
Sophomore,1,"This school is hyped much more than the actual experience and they offer refer to it as ""paradise"" but I've never been more miserable. As a STEM major, I've taught myself through all of my important core classes, so if you're going into that field keep that in mind if you're applying here. The school is more concerned with the professors research work than their actual ability to teach..And the student body also isn't remotely as diverse as advertised... And the dorms haven't been redone in at least 30+ years and you can tell. But now they're finally building new ones but will charge $10,000 a semester just to live there. They also try to trick the visiting families in the dining hall by serving the best food for that period of time but for the rest of the year, we get served raw meat and the same bland meals. I wish I could go back and pick another school on my list, I would've saved a lot of money and possibly had a much better experience."
Senior,1,"ansferring to this school was a huge mistake. I am unable to understand how a school with such a good reputation can be so poorly run. Most employees are clueless about everything and refuse to help. I was also unimpressed with my professors and choices of classes. Most of my professors suck.

 My advisor  has refused to meet with me for the past four months and I was not allowed switch advisers for some reason. In addition to this, the professional and peer tutors are a waste of time. UM has rules that prevent tutors from being helpful. When asking for help on an essay, they told me that they are not allowed to read my essay unless I read it to them. These tutors are also not allowed to mark things with a pen or pencil. Then what is the point of tutoring?

Overall, I'm treated like garbage, my professors suck, the campus run down & dirty, and the school makes every single process absolutely painful. Everything I was told during campus visits was complete and total bait-and-switch."
Junior,1,"The campus is super small campus that doesnâ€™t promote an college life style... Academically they have a limited course  selection, rude professors, and hardly no opportunity for improvement... Itâ€™s an Average university with a lot of hype and big price tag !!"
College Sophomore,1,Next to nothing kosher on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"I only eat in the dining halls because it's one of my very few options. The food is usually not very good even if it looks good. The only thin that is consistently good is the egg station where you can tell them exactly how to make your eggs, the bacon (because no one can mess up bacon), and the burgers/ hotdogs/ fries."
College Sophomore,1,"Comparing my freshman dorm room with my friends' at other colleges, mine was by far the worst. Cramped and in desperate need of a renovation."
College Senior,1,What school doesn't have housing for graduate students?
College Sophomore,1,You are isolated because of US-1 and suburb.
College Junior,1,"Personally, the financial aid process is the worst aspect of attending the school. The financial aid office does nothing to help you and pushes you aside like you are another number. Trying to get enough financial aid to cover all costs is incredibly hard."
College Senior,1,"I'm not interested in finding drugs, but if I wanted to experiment, it'd be incredibly easy to access any kind of drug. They flow as much as the empanadas."
College Student,1,"No sorority housing, guys are mean and exclusive"
College Freshman,1,"I don't have a car on campus, but when family has come to visit me, parking has been bad. My grandparents are old, and they need to be close to where they are going because walking is hard, but there are no spots near my dorm that they can park in, because a permit is required at almost every parking spot with expensive costs, and visitor parking is nowhere near where we want to be, so we couldn't spend much time on campus, because we had nowhere good to park. It was horrendous."
College Senior,1,"Parking permits cost $475 dollars for the year - what?
My public university friends complain aout having to pay $30 for the year, are you kidding me?
I am a commuter so I HAVE to pay that ridiculous amount - and the permits sell out quickly.
I was once on a waiting list of 400 people when I applied for a change of permit.
However, they do sell only a limited number of permits - as many as there are spaces in the lot so you are always guaranteed a space. But is $475 worth it? I don't think so.

Also, if professors dedicated as much time to the classes than the ticketing officers did in ticketing ALL the cars in the lot, we'd have geniuses stemming out of each classroom."
College Freshman,1,Freshman dorms literally look and feel like a prison. Barred windows that don't open. White walls and hallways. Bathrooms are not nice at all but they keep them clean. I am paying the same for a tiny double as my best friend does for an apartment-style single in downtown chicago. But life goes on!
College Sophomore,1,"Everything is overpriced and generally unhealthy. To get off campus food you must cross US1, which is arguably the most dangerous street in the country. Add the worst licensed drivers in the country, and it is an awful situation with and without a car. Taco Rico is a decent Mexican Food fix, and Pizza is good on and around US1. Akashi is awesome sushi, but is a tad overpriced"
College Senior,1,They do not let you park anywhere close by the buildings. Visitors have to park so far away from the buildings that it is sometimes a 30 minute walk from that point.
College Sophomore,1,Financial adviser was extremely unhelpful. Every question I asked he just referred me to the website
College Sophomore,1,"I am in University of Miami currently and I am very unsatisfied with my education until now. The reason is that the program requires transffer students to retake most of the basic courses again because they cover almost double of other colleges teach for basic chemistry courses. The faculties are very hard to reach. The reason is that there are far too many students and not enough proffesors. Therefore, there are always long line infront of offices and 30 minute wait is usual. Also, during chemistry labs, undergraduate TAs are conducting the course. They tend not to announce needed information properly since they don't have enough exprience of conducting a class."
College Junior,1,The parking situation and UM could not be worse. We pay almost $500 per year just to park out car on campus. We already pay a high tuition cost and parking is only free at certain hours and certain lots. There are only a handful of spots outside the main library which are only free after 6 and no parking permit includes these spots. On top of everything the parking permits you have to buy are in zones and the zones are first come first serve. The yellow zone is the largest and most expensive zone however no classes are close to this and a minimal 10 min walk is needed to get to class. The zones should be sold depending on people's classes Ana where they need to be the most.
College Freshman,1,"No bars, no greek life. Your only option is south beach."
College Freshman,1,"Transportation is a joke, especially for freshman. Taxi's are expensive as fu-- and the metro rail get's sketchy as soon as it hits 8 pm."
College Freshman,1,"The nightlife around campus will get old extremely fast, whether it's the same frat parties or repetitive house parties. Also, The Grove is a popular spot for underclassmen but going to the same bars every week seeing the same people and dancing to the same music is boring to say the least. You have to be 21 or have a fake ID to really have fun in Miami, sad but true. And once that happens, South Beach is the hotspot!"
College Sophomore,1,"It's really not as diverse as brochures tout it to be at UM. The minority groups are big enough to be noticeable, but can also be very clique-based and cold to newcomers. Not to say that all individuals are bad, but as a whole I found it incredibly disappointing to be ignored and/or shunned by people who I thought I would make connections with."
College Senior,1,Very Exclusive and Hard to Get â€“ You get very little financial aid and the scholarships are extremely biased meaning that if you not Hispanic and not from Florida you'll have a hard time getting subsized. Maybe its just me.
College Sophomore,1,"More Trouble Than I Deserved â€“ I had three minor alcohol offenses, one of which involved medical assistance which is the reason I got in trouble. I am now on final disciplinary probation and kids get in trouble even when they go to the hospital. This scares kids of calling for help when someone needs it because they know they'll be punished by the school. They need to implement an amnesty policy."
College Sophomore,1,"Middle Class?  Don't Expect Much â€“ I got a merit scholarship that helped me decide to go to Miami and at the time needed little aid (loans, etc.) from the school.  I used my credit union for student loans.  Then my dad lost his job.  It took multiple attempts for the financial aid office to realize we needed a re-evaluation.  They kept asking for proof of employment or tax information we didn't have, sent repeats of some forms and forgot others.  All new aid I got was in loans--no grants or scholarships.  My payments will be $1000 a month if everything stays on its present course.
Also, do not expect work-study or on-campus jobs.  Even the dining halls employ non-students."
College Sophomore,1,The parking fee is to expensive & there is not enough parking on campus.
College Sophomore,1,"Words Do Not Describe How Horrid the Food Is. The campus dining could not be worse, the B grade that it has earned is inflated more than any grade you would receive in a class, ever.
Not only is it expensive, and the hours horrible, but the food is nauseating. Freshman usually have 14 meals per week, and look to move off campus after freshman year. It is an embarrassment that this food is served at such a prestigious university. I doubt highly that President Shalala realizes how bad the food is, because she would be outraged. Something has to be done, ASAP."
College Freshman,1,"Welcome to Jersey Shore â€“ School's an extension of the out-of-state, mainly New York and New Jersey. Students very stuck up, rich, and think they're on Jersey Shore. 

Girls: Stuck up, rich girls with a ""LOL OMG MIAMIII"" mentality. Very spoiled, so they expect the guys to spend exorbitant amounts of money on them, and expect everything for free. Conversations with them feel very fake.

Guys: Lot of douchebros who think they're hard and tough. At night, look out for cars full of UM kids looking out their windows as if they're tough guys since they think driving out late at night is ""cool."" LOL? If you go to the wellness center, you'll notice how widespread steroid-use is at this school. Willing to spend all their $$ on a girl just to get lucky that night. Unless you're a ""bro,"" don't expect to fit in here as the same ""BRO IM IN MIAMI!!!"" mentality exists like the girls.

"
College Freshman,1,"Lax at Best. Strictness at the Uninversity of Miami is essentially a joke. The R A's will punish you if you're caught out of your room with a beer or other alchohol, but otherwise they ignore it even when they know it's going on in your room. They pretend that there is no stench of marijuana permeating throughout the entire campus, but only act upon it when's there's a complaint of some kind. They do enforce attendence policies and room visitation to the utmost degree, but students really couldn't care less about that aspect. The police on campus really swing the hammer when they are called, but they are actually called at about a 10% rate of instinces where they should be called. There's only so much you can enforce when a large portion of the student body is coming to the school based off the city's legendary nightlife and to cut that off would damage the stream of student coming to Miami."
College Sophomore,1,"Good Luck â€“ The parking is atrocious, especially after 10 AM. The permits are based by zones, with the most expensive ones being in prime-time parking lots. The school is very strict with tickets. Having a car isn't necessary, but it's nice to be able to get away from campus with a car."
College Freshman,1,"I don't have a car on campus, but getting parking is very difficult. If you don't have a pass for a certain zone (parking is broken up into color coordinated zones,) security will ticket you. If you live off campus, it's kind of necessary to have a car, though."
College Freshman,1,"Dorm Punishments Are Strict â€“ If you live in the dorms, you can get in a lot of trouble for underage drinking and drug use. If you get caught twice, you're forced out of the dorms. Most of the time, if you're quiet, you can get away with drinking in the dorms, just don't be loud and stupid. It really depends on the RA you get. Off-campus, it's pretty strict, but not too bad. It's a felony to possess a fake ID in Florida, but most of the time bouncers will just take your ID if it's fake, as long as you don't cause a scene."
College Sophomore,1,Pretty Diverse â€“ Lots of different kinds of people here...but a lot of JAPy white people
College Freshman,1,"Heaven for Snooki â€“ seriously almost all of the guys at UM are juice heads and are probably on steroids. its very common to see guys walking around with their T shirt sleeves cut off, chests puffed out and their shoulders out wide and stiff. PIKE is a frat that is most notorious for having guys like this who take steroids and only work out their upper body at the gym"
College Freshman,1,"Girls : About 1-99 ratio â€“ for every 1 hot girl, there are 99 ugly girls no joke. Not to mention If u find a hot one, there will be 30 guys surrounding her. If you want a girl, get off campus"
College Freshman,1,"Literally Don't Come Here â€“ Honestly I thought this school was going to be fun. The word ""Miami"" is the most deceiving word you will ever here. You're not in Miami. You're in Coral Gables. South Beach is a $50 cab ride, and bars charge you covers so you're basically emptying your wallet on the daily. The bars at the grove, yet a drink is probably $10 a pop. There are rarely house parties and in no way is this a college town. The campus is very small and doesn't feel like a campus in the slightest. Boys-good luck. Frats think they can charge $10 and sometimes $20 for entrance to a party where you can't even find the keg. I honestly wouldn't come to this school unless you are absolutely loaded and don't care about only going to mediocre clubs/bars in Coconut Grove. In all this school does not feel like a college at all, and the academics are only getting stronger meaning the ""SunTan U"" is rapidly becoming a school solely geared toward academics with occasional horrible parties. "
College Freshman,1,Sucks for Freshmen â€“ If you have a fake you might be able to go to the bars in coconut grove if they dont confiscate it. There are some pretty bad house parties around that are overcrowded and usually get busted. There is no partying in the dorms.

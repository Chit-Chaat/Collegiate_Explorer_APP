Alum,5,"What I liked most about UMPI is that it’s size is just perfect. You get to have the one to one interaction with your professor and the administrators that know you by your name! The second aspect is affordability and quality, UMPI has mastered the combination of an affordable education and the quality of a higher education. 
One thing that I would change about the University will be it’s dormitories. They are quite outdated, but plans are underhand to fix that issue. 
Going to UMPI has definitely been worth my $ but also has been one of the greatest experiences of my life."
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy that all of my classes are online. I am a single mother and I work full time, so it really helps. My academic advisor is really helpful and is always there if I have any questions. The president of my college even told me in person that if I ever needed anything that he would try and help!! It been a great start so far."
Sophomore,5,"The classroom environment is very productive to learning. Professors are always there to help, and have very flexible office hours. Tutoring is available at convenient times when students need it, and living in the dorms is much better than other schools I've been to."
Graduate Student,5,I took the phlebotomy course here for a summer semester and loved it. The campus is clean and easy to get around. My favorite part about the campus is it's nice gym!
Alum,5,"For a small school, it can offer a lot. The class sizes are small, the professors are personable with their students, and the classes give you a good, well rounded education."
Freshman,5,"the online courses help to make a transition into college studies, teachers are helpful and the administrative staff is always available"
Sophomore,5,I attended umpi years ago and am currently in the process of returning to complete my degree.  I have always found them very helpful and the atmosphere welcoming.
Freshman,5,I love all my classes and professors; they really care about their students and listen to what they need. Food has many options for every meal and has options for vegetarians. There is now dairy free milk options as well. Presque Isle is very small but has everything a student needs in the Walmart and local stores. There are many off campus food options really close down Maine Street.
College Sophomore,5,"We just started up a sorority this semester including me, and its been a WONDERFUL experience so far!"
College Sophomore,5,"Although he Recreation program just got cut they are now offering a Business Administration in Recreation. Which is a great degree fr myself, because I am looking to be a Park Ranger of some sort, or to own my own guiding services company. "
College Senior,5,"I am an art major, and all of the professors are fantastic, very knowledgable and excellent artists themselves. They all are very willing to help you make your work better, and share their experiences about being working artists. They are incredibly supportive. The art program in general is excellent- it is small and intimate, which facilitates really good critiques and student-professor relationships."
College Student,5,"Gentile hall is the best.  It has an Olympic sized swimming pool, an overhead track, basketball court, rock climbing room, and a weight room.  
The library is very efficient and quiet.  There is always some activities going on somewhere on campus."
College Student,5,"Professors Are Wonderful – When I went to the University for my tour of the campus, I was very impressed.  The head of the Biology dept. chatted with us and told me that the professors were very student oriented.  I now attend the University and found out just how accommodating they really are.  I am playing two sports and my Biology professor has made many acceptations for me.  He would come in the day before I was to leave with the team and have the lab ready for me.  I was very impressed."
College Freshman,5,"Home Style Food – There's always something new at UMPI, yet they always seem to have my favorites. There's not time to miss home-cooked food!"
College Student,5,The weather here is great for skiing.  Not so good for baseball usually.  The last two years have been great with no snow after March.
College Student,5,Parking is ok.  It doesn't bother me because I hardly use my vehicle.  It stays put.  But there seems to be planty for faculty and off campus students
College Student,5,"I personally don't use the computers on campus, because I have my own.  I have been to the labs before and there are plenty of computers.  They are all up to date."
Alum,4,"As an UMPI student I had to take quite a few online courses, and I can truthfully say that the experience has been rewarding. The professors that teach online are dedicated to pay the same attention to the students just like a live course. They always remind you that because you are online that doesn’t mean that You can’t physically meet with them and ask for help at any time."
Sophomore,4,I love the fact that its in my hometown.  I was away in the military for 6 years so its nice to be able to return home and continue with my degree.
Sophomore,4,"UMPI is a growing school. Both in size, and in what they offer for the students. The biology faculty is fantastic, and most professors are willing to work with you, and are truly concerned with your success. As a DIII school, athletics is similar to high school, and UMPI provides a unique experience where you can be on multiple varsity teams, like being on a fall team, and then continuing on to a spring team, but it may be a lot to handle depending on the athlete, and all the programs are building to be better. UMPI is diverse for a Northern Maine school, and is always trying to improve. The food is not good however, and the financial aid is not the best, but better than a lot of bigger colleges. If you can push through the cold winter, UMPI is a nice school."
Junior,4,"My experience has been that it is a very welcoming, tight-knit community. I have really enjoyed my time at UMPI in the Athletic Training program."
College Sophomore,4,Campus is very good at keeping in touch with alumni as well as good at internship placement
College Sophomore,4,I have had a very good experience with the professor's as they are very helpful and caring of the students
College Sophomore,4,"As an RA, I really enjoy the res halls and feel we do a pretty good job creating a fun community environment"
College Sophomore,4,The facility has a lot of great equipment including a huge 2-story rock climbing wall.
College Sophomore,4,"Honestly, I really enjoy going to college at UMPI. It's remote but not to remote so students can stay onn with nature while still having the necessity's."
College Freshman,4,"I would choose this school again due to the fact that since it is so small, it feels like we are all family. Everyone up here treats you with respect making you feel like you matter."
College Junior,4,So long as you work hard academically there are lots of options when it comes to financial aid and scholarships
College Sophomore,4,The athletics are good depending on what team you are talking about.
College Sophomore,4,It's great to be part of a specific major because you get a lot of opportunities offered to you.
College Freshman,4,"Very nice places, plenty of options and cheap"
College Sophomore,4,"I got the financial aid that I needed , the process is long but there is nothing that can change about that. "
College Sophomore,4,"The teachers are there to help you. Not only are they your professor, but they are also there to utilize as editors and as advisers. Even though you are assigned an adviser for your degree any teacher on campus that you feel you need to talk to is usually available."
College Sophomore,4,They have plenty of options for students to chose from. 
College Sophomore,4,"It is always a bit col here, but it is worth it in the views alone. It just snowed today actually and it is only October 28th. It does rain a lot as well here."
College Senior,4,"There are a large number of computers on campus, and we also have a really nice Mac lab. Printing is very easy. The wireless works great pretty much anywhere on campus. It's nice to have your own computer because the labs and library close at 10 pm, but there is no need to bring a printer."
College Senior,4,"There is a lot of variety in academics; it depends on the program that you are in. In general, the registration process is very easy- it's a small school, so it's pretty easy to get into the classes you want. I have never been wait-listed or not been able to get into a class I wanted because of it being full. However, since it is such a small school, many upper-level classes offer only one section so it can be difficult to make classes in different majors fit in together. The professors are great, and because it's a small school student-professor relationships are fantastic."
College Junior,2,"The food in the dining hall is awful most of the time. The food that they put out that the students actually like is rarely served. Most of the time they are trying too hard to put out food that caters to the vegetarian and homestyle food lovers. They serve a lot of weird casseroles and pretentious food that most people don't like. When I have 20 minutes in between classes to eat I just want to be able to go there and quickly find something that I like, that isn't cereal or ANOTHER hamburger. Burgers are the ONLY thing that is always available and somewhat good."
College Junior,2,"Nothing to do when it comes to nightlife if you are under 21 and the only options for those 21 and over are the connection and on campus parties, which usually get busted early if they're not a snoozefest. Too many people who ruin it for everyone else (buying alcohol for minors, or freshman that try to party and get to rowdy and obnoxious)"
College Junior,2,"All we have out here is fast food and a few homestyle places. For fast food we don't have any of the better chains (wendys, dairy queen etc.) just arbys, mcdonalds, bk and taco bell. No good italian or mexican places. Too many pizza places. It gets boring."
College Sophomore,2,"The town and city is okay. There is not much to do for a college town other than ""mini"" bowling."
College Freshman,2,"Really cold, lots of snow. But plenty to do with the conditions"
College Sophomore,2,Besides Taxis the transportation either consist of having two feet and a heart beat. The other means of transportation besides taxis would also be owning a car.
College Sophomore,2,"Not really that many options in northern Maine. there are a few bars, but nothing that screams hey lets party!!! "
College Freshman,2,"In the hall where i live (Park Hall), we have 2 RA's that are basically cop wanna be's and just try to control everything all the time. They don't care about the well being of the floor they just care about whats best for themselves and can definitely be overbearing sometimes, and honestly quite downgrading and rude. I think in the other residence halls though everything is fine and not too strict."
College Freshman,1,There is no party scene. The nearest party is in Fort kent
College Freshman,1,Drinking in rooms that are gonna get busted 9 times out of 10
College Freshman,1,This school hate blacks. But the girls love them. It's crazy
College Freshman,1,Security are the most dangerous people on campus they cause the most problems. Stay away from them and don't trust them.
College Freshman,1,Don't come here. Listen to me.
College Freshman,1,RA's stay up your ass like you are in middle school. They are shady they will smile in your face and plot on you to get you in trouble. Be careful with everything you do
College Freshman,1,What is a greek life?
College Freshman,1,"This school is for people that does not like diversity, creativity, and outspoken individuals. The staff and security mastered the art of manipulation. The security will be sniffing your butt your whole time there. If you like negative vibes and high school drama this is the place for you. If you want to start having anxiety this is the school for you. If you are a gay male this is the school for you because most of these dudes here are undercover homosexuals. If you want to go to court and risk losing your financial aid then this is the school for you. Listen to me it will save you a lot of time and money. PLEASE DO NOT COME TO THIS SCHOOL, YOU WILL GO INSANE."
College Junior,1,"Security laughs at complaints and ignores people in trouble. There has been a person keying cars on campus for months and has not been caught. They say ""oh, it must not have been on campus"". They also do not have many security cameras around and none near the parking lots so it is VERY unsafe for people to travel alone."
College Junior,1,Little variety in the classes. Very biased majors. I was told that a professor did not like me so I have to CHANGE MAJORS. Some of the classes are okay. The criminal justice program is VERY selective and the professor is rude. Class sizes are fairly small but the rooms cannot fit all students.
College Junior,1,"Unless you are a local, forget getting a job in the area. All jobs are reserved for ""Close"" family. Internships are no better. Family is the only guarantee."
College Junior,1,I do not recommend this to anyone unless they are obnoxious and like underage drinking as well as uncleanliness. That's most of the student body in the dorms.
College Junior,1,The few members that they do have are either really creepy or really stuck-up.
College Junior,1,Where to begin? The RAs do not enforce any of the rules. Underage drinking is a serious issue on campus. The meals at the Cafeteria are so awful I get sick every time I go there. The dorm buildings are decomposing as well as the faculty buildings. They redid the library but will not remodel the dorms or clean the bathrooms. The classes are hard to get into because most are not offered every semester. Not to mention the faculty all know that the college is not going to last 10 more years.
College Sophomore,1,It is horrible. Everyone is drinking all the time even freshman.
College Sophomore,1,"It is horrible. You get tickets if you don't park ""correctly"" they say but the thing is the snow covers the parking areas a lot."
College Sophomore,1,"The drinking on campus is horrible! I have heard one person say ""If you go to a dance sober you are a loser."""
College Sophomore,1,"We are in the middle of no where , nothing happens. "
College Freshman,1,"There is transportation from the activities group on campus to various things but no real solid options for general transportation. basically if you dont have a car, you're gonna walk."

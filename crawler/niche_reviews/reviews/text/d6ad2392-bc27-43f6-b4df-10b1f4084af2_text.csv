Freshman,5,"i haven't attended there yet, but looking on the virtual tour, i felt comfortable and you should feel like that when your away from your home."
Freshman,5,"The same thing as on top, i haven't been there quite yet but i felt comfortable on the virtual campus."
Alum,5,I took my last few classes online. They were very manageable. I found them easy to navigate and learn from. The professors were willing to help if needed.
Alum,5,"I attended Frostburg’s satellite campus at USMH for early childhood/elementary education. Not only did this make my bachelors degree affordable, I also received the best education. I would 100% recommend attending this University."
Senior,5,I love the smaller sized school that is extremely challenging and keeps me focused on my career. The diversity is also something that I did not have in my home town and is something that I think is very important and educational.
Senior,5,I believe that the online learning is not very good. The teachers did not transition well to online learning because of a lack of training and technological know-how to be able to effectively teach their students online.
Sophomore,5,So easy they upload all the work ahead of time so you can work at your own pace. They are always available
Alum,5,"I took a number of classes online during the winter and summer intersessions of my first two years at FSU simply because that was my preference. Overall, I had a decent experience in these courses. While the work loads were heavy, they were manageable and timely. I never had trouble navigating any of the required online portals and my grades never suffered as a result of the courses being online. Professors were easy to reach, quick to provide feedback, and usually helpful and understanding in situations that required greater attention. I prefer learning in a normal classroom setting most of the time but had a positive enough experience in my online courses at FSU that I would recommend them to other students."
Sophomore,5,It is a wonderful school I had an amazing freshman year experience I wouldn’t transfer to any other school the professors care about the students if I could give this school a six star rating I would.
Sophomore,5,Frostburg actually prepared for online classes before we left for spring break so I believe we were very prepared.
Alum,5,Overall Frostburg was an awesome college experience and I wouldn’t trade it. I enjoyed my major and the courses. The professors were really good and always there to help.
Junior,5,"I have not taken online classes yet, but I was told it was very easy to understand and learn new content. I would not mind online classes and I am willing to be open to any new academic ideas the campus has to offer."
Junior,5,They have always been very helpful and always keep us updated with this crisis. They always are willing to help no matter the situation. They send alerts on scheduling and upcoming events. They have been working very hard with this crisis going on to make sure I am well aware of deadlines and upcoming events.
Sophomore,5,I enjoyed my experience at Frostburg State University. The staff are very helpful and make you feel at home. The professors are willing to work with you and give you any help you need with school or life situations.
Freshman,5,"Thus far, I have had nothing but positive interactions with the faculty, staff and students at Frostburg State University.  The academics are challenging and the class sizes are small, so I can receive individual attention, when needed."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the University overall, I like the smaller population and there are plenty of things to do outdoors in the mountains. All of the staff are very friendly too"
Freshman,5,People are really friendly. At school i feel we are one big family. There is a lot of  programs you can join. I'm currently in the ECHO Star program its basically a community service program. Theres nothing i would change right now.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy Frostburg State University. The campus is the perfect size; it is not too big or too small. They also have a great variety of classes given.
Freshman,5,Frostburg is very home- like. I feel safe and prepared everyday. There is easy Transportation for all students and the drivers care about everyone's safety (especially in the snow). My professors cared tremendously about my education/ making sure I'm comfortable with the course work. I 100% recommend visiting and applying.
Junior,5,"it is a lovely school, many options for class schedules and the teachers are nice. they will accept you matter where you come from."
Works Here,5,"My overall experience with Frostburg State University is fairly good. I am excited to attend the University after working on campus. I have met so many helpful people to the school, campus, and the area. The professors are very helpful with understanding and organization. The staff members are friendly and help you understand. The students I have met since I have worked there are very friendly and make you feel extremely welcomed."
Senior,5,"Great school with small student to professor ratio sizes. Great professors with a few bad ones, but overall great experience with many of the departments and their faculty."
Alum,5,"I loved FSU, there was so many ways to get involved on campus and the professors were committed to my success."
Sophomore,5,"Frostburg State  offers a diversified academic educational program.  The professor's are polite, friendly and always available to help you with any questions or problems.  Frostburg is an AACSB accredited college offering business students like myself the opportunity to learn more and make our resumes stand out during a job interview.  Frostburg State makes sure that students are prepared for their careers in every aspect and always willing to helps with each step.  I never feel alone or unable to find an answer or help. 
I will be prepared for my future because of my positive experience at Frostburg State."
Senior,5,"Frostburg State University is a great institution with caring faculty and staff, small class sizes, and lots of clubs and organizations to be involved in.  There is a lot of diversity at Frostburg State despite being in rural Western Maryland, and it is easy to make friends.  The professors at FSU are always willing to help during office hours or via email, and free tutoring services are provided for a wide variety of subjects.  I am glad that I chose FSU.  The friendly faces and small campus provided an easy and enjoyable transition from high school to college."
Sophomore,5,What I like about Frostburg State University is the Diversity of the students.  I like this school because it's not a party school and where students are focused on their studies.  They have a variety of activities to get involved in.  The food options are good.
Alum,5,"Frostburg was a wonderful choice for my undergraduate degree.  The class sizes are very small, so you have the opportunity to engage more with your peers and professors."
Freshman,5,"Frostburg State University is a wonderful University ! There University there has so many oppurtunityes, diversity, campus, leadership oppurtunies and most of all SGA"
Niche User,5,My short experience with Frostburg State University has been great! I've learned so much about the campus on my first visit there and wasn't in the least bit disappointed. Every student i had met was kind and helpful in every way. Frostburg had provided everything that it could.
Alum,5,Frostburg was a great school that offered many services for their students.  During my time there I had the opportunity to participate in many of the academic programs and activities that were offered by the University.  Frostburg is a small town and for me that made my college experience better. I felt like I could actually get to know my professors.
Freshman,5,"I'm currently a freshman at Frostburg State University. I enjoy having staff members who put their complete focus on the success of their students before they graduate. Also, this university has weekly events for students to build their network while meeting new people."
Freshman,5,For those who are focused on education it's a great school where there will be temptation but having the right mentality helps in having a great time.
Sophomore,5,"I love frostburg! I love the community and the faculty. All professors are ready to help you learn, and will create a safe environment."
Niche User,5,I like the environment of this school . The cold is something i am custom to and the atmosphere of frostburg fits me 100%
Niche User,5,Staff was very informative and professional.  Facility was super clean and very inviting.  They allowed us to listen to the experiences of other students to help us better understand what all they have to offer.
Sophomore,5,"I love the environment at Frostburg, everyone is so nice and the professors seem to really care about you and your grades. I don't like how some of our buildings are so old, but it also gives the school character that I love."
Sophomore,5,Overall this is a real good university. Located in the mountains of western Maryland. The area is rich with recreation in the summer and winter.
Senior,5,"Transferred here in my sophomore year and haven't looked back since. The dorms are okay, but there are a few renovations and a new building in the works. The professors I have had were all great; really attentive and listen to what you need. The classes are about 25-30 students for average classes. I was a ENV major so many of my classes had about 15 students on average. The cafe is pretty cool and a great place to meet new people. There are always events going on too, so you will never get bored. The town of Frostburg is pretty small but there is a lot to do if you are willing to look. The Allegany bus service is always willing to take you places free of charge as a student as well. Some advice: go out there and have fun, but if you're a bit introverted like myself, no one will judge you or force you out your comfort zone either. All in all, I had a pretty good experience and will definitely miss Frostburg when I leave."
Niche User,5,"As I plan to attend VSU, I have a lot of positive things to say about the university. Their campus is very welcoming, and is becoming more updated. The campus has a lot to offer, with their majors, sports, and organizations, it's just an overall amazing place to get your education. The dorm halls are as good as they get. Of course they're small but there is not much that they can do about that. They offer all types of advisers that will help you with guidance with your classes in order to get the credits you need."
Freshman,5,An affordable traditional college with a diverse and accepting campus population. Great sports teams and many academic and non-academic clubs.
Sophomore,5,I am in love with Frostburg State University. I came here in order to be away from home but too far.
Freshman,5,I love Frostburg State University. There is so much to do on campus including Late at Lane activities and different performances.
Freshman,5,"It was been a blast for the first semester that i have been there. The class sizes are not really that  big, the most people that i had in a class was like 10 or 12 and that was for most on tmy classes.the teachers really want you to succeed. There are a lot of clubs and organizations on campus that you can be apart of. There activities that they have are cool like they bring up jesse McCartney.The football team is good."
Junior,5,"There are plenty of opportunities to get involved and be heard on the University Stage. Also, most professors really care about students and how they do in the classes."
Freshman,5,"The feeling of having a home away from home that wasn't too far away, everyone is family. My first time at frostburg state on my college tour we pulled up to the entrance and then, i knew that was home."
Sophomore,5,"What I loved about FSU is that there is not a lot of distraction in the area. I am someone that get distracted easily. The school is located in a small time with nothing to do, which leaves you with no choice but to focus on your education."
Freshman,5,"Small community, really friendly and helpful. Rolling admission which is really nice, the campus is really cute too."
Freshman,5,"I love it there! The atmosphere is so pleasant, and I think that all people no matter race, ethnicity, or gender will definitely be able to accommodate to this school. A school that feels just like home."
College Freshman,5,Fostburg State University is a very welcoming and accepting campus. I love how nice everyone is and how much everyone cares for one another.
College Senior,5,"When I was in lower-level general education classes, the class sizes were around 20-25 students. The professors were always very engaged in their subject and wanted their students to succeed. Once I started taking the upper-level classes in my Geography major, the class sizes lowered to about 8-10 people per class. The professors are always very knowledgable and try to help students succeed as much as possible."
College Senior,5,Greek life at Frostburg is a great experience and very influential on campus. All of the sororities and fraternities are very inclusive and diverse. Most non-greeks are close friends with greeks and would agree that greek life does a lot for the school and the community around us. My favorite experience was starting a fraternities with some of my best friends that stands for eliminating prejudice and building brotherhood. The last three years of my life in college weren't always easy and my brothers have been there for me every step of the way to help me.
College Senior,5,"While Frostburg is located in a very rural area, the university does a great job of involving its students and the community surrounding the school in cultural events and celebrations. Over the last three years, I have learned a great deal about professionalism and working hard. I have been pushed to succeed while attending Frostburg and I have found many mentors that I look up to. One of the events I most look forward to when I go back to school for the year is the block party that the University hosts on Main Street. The block party showcases all of the student groups on campus and all the resources that are available to the students and the community. This helps all the new students learn the faces of leaders on campus and people they can go to for anything they need while attending Frostburg. I have made the best memories of my life and have learned more than I ever imagined I would while attending Frostburg State University."
College Junior,5,"Greek life at my school is small there are only 3 on campus sororities, but those 3 sororities do so much for the campus and community. They do about 75 hours a semester for community service and are always on campus raising money for one of their philanthropies or for the school. This will help the girl and guys in the future if they take on executive postions and help out around the community."
College Freshman,5,"I attend a small school in Western Maryland. Most wouldn't expect it from such a small town, but my school is incredibly diverse. There are students from all walks of life. One of the most interesting things I've noticed is the the student association that highlights South Asian culture. As an Indian-American citizen, it is incredible to see so many transfer students from India that have bonded together to bring the Indian culture to our school. They hold celebrations of the most important Hindu holidays, as well as holding yoga sessions and cricket matches to teach other students about some aspects of our culture. It is amazing to see so many students learning about India through the Indian-South Asian Student Association."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love most of my classes and professors so far. Most of my classes are engaging and I feel like I'm learning a lot. I don't get as distracted as I usually get. The professors are extremely nice and really care about whether you're learning or not. It's really a great climate to be in.
College Freshman,5,Frostburg's campus is very safe. I know I feel safe with my comings and outgoings on campus night or day. They have the Blue lights strategically placed all through campus with a Police annex located on campus. Smoke detectors and fire alarms are placed throughout the dorms as well all of the buildings.
College Freshman,5,"I have had problems in two of my classes, I went to each of the teachers and asked for help, and each one was able to fit me into their busy schedule and make time to tutor me on the problems in which I was having difficulties in. It definitely raised my opinion of the school and brought home the fact that the motto of the school is true. ""One University. A world of Experiences."""
College Freshman,5,"Obtaining a degree from Frostburg prepares you for you future, life in general and the job market. They have spot interviews for perspective students, and Internship opportunities for their students. A top notch Career & Professional Developement Center that actively supports students to excel, and empower the students."
College Freshman,5,"Sports are very seriously at our school and it is easy to get caught up in the revelry and excitement of any of the games.

Game attendence is  at an all time high which shows school spirit and support."
College Freshman,5,So far I have on;y positive things to say about Frostburg. They have lots of interesting things to do and the teachers and faculty are very helpful. I have contacted about two of my teachers for extra help in two of my courses and they were helpful and flexible with my schedule. I have made several friends while being here and I have joined two new clubs. It is an exciting time here at Frostburg.
Senior,4,Love the art department especially the professors. I wish the school would put more money in it though.
Junior,4,"I personally love the solitude and small vintage community Frostburg has provided to me. As a woman of color, I hope that our fight for Frostburg administration and students to be more aware and educated on inclusion and the forgotten Brownsville community will be worth while. The biggest take away is to try to immediately find an organization and community you're passionate about and use these environments to network. If you're an open minded homebody and can make the best from what you have, Frostburg will be great for you."
Alum,4,"I truly had a fantastic experience at Frostburg State. I was a very involved undergraduate student who completely underestimated this institution from the start. While attending FSU, I was able to study and intern abroad, hold an executive position on the Student Government Association, write for the school newspaper, hold multiple part time jobs, and so much more. This school, along with its faculty and staff, gave me a wide array of wonderful opportunities. However, I could not go without noticing a sense of disconnect between the student body and the administration. I saw students become frustrated with the way in which FSU responded to certain situations and how financial strains and misplaced priorities often led to a feeling of neglect. With that being said, I also know that I was tremendously grateful to obtain an education that I truly enjoyed at FSU. I am hopeful that this university has even bigger and better things on the horizon for its next generations of Bobcats."
Sophomore,4,I had a pretty good experience. The campus is really nice and upcoming. Everyone on the campus is very nice and welcoming. I just wish the campus was a little bit bigger so that I could get to know more people.
Freshman,4,"I must say, I enjoyed the overall atmosphere of Frostburg. It was quaint and quiet, but the lack of stores and places to go did stunt the overall experience. But whenever we needed something to do, we would figure it out. 
A great school. Good teachers. Fun experience."
Junior,4,Frostburg is a very friendly community where it is easy to build good relationships with your professors which in the long run  helps you academically and gives you the drive to learn. The only thing that I did not like about the university is that some administers are rude and the food quality isn’t the best . Off campus housing is always a better choice.
Junior,4,"Besides the bipolar weather, Frostburg State University is a small campus that has a lot to offer. I am apart of the College of Business depart which has provided me with a lot of opportunities i.e internships, jobs info, clubs/organizations, etc."
Freshman,4,"Being a first generation college student in my first year, Frostburg State University does a good job with making the new incoming students comfortable. We are away from home around new people in a new environment so making sure that we feel secured. Another thing that I enjoy about the school is that they have great communication skills. The school does a good job with making sure that everyone is informed with all the school events occurring."
Freshman,4,Frostburg overall is a really great school depending on on you make of it. I’ve had professors who’ve broaden my horizon on subjects I’ve never cared about but now love because of them. And the party is good too...depending on who you have connections with.
Niche User,4,I like Frostburg State University is located close to home because of their beautiful campus and the fact that it located close to where I live. This makes visiting home from the campus during breaks a lot easier. They are also know for their spectacular sports facilities that I visited in the summer in hopes of joining their soccer team in my Freshman year.
Freshman,4,"The atmosphere here at the school is very good, the people here are very friendly, the school tries there best to keep the students involved, and to succeed in the classroom. The only reason i didn't give 5 stars are because of the winters."
Freshman,4,"While I haven't attended the school myself as of yet, the experience concerning the admissions process and payment plans have been both affordable and the staff has been very negotiable regarding when/how the funds for my education are to be paid."
Junior,4,"Despite the cold weather, the community at Frostburg is warm and inviting. Smaller class sizes enable one-on-one focus from professors. There are a lot of clubs and organizations on campus, making it easy to get involved. The in-state tuition is affordable for me. If I could change one thing about Frostburg, it would be the limited variety of food options."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Frostburg State University has been great. Academically, professors do all they can to help you pass a certain course while retaining information you can use for years to come. You are also able to get in contact with professors outside of class times via office hours or email. The campus and number of students attending is reduced. That gives you a great opportunity to develop great relationships with fellow students, staff, and professors. The local area is city like when you travel off campus there may not be much, but you can learn to love and appreciate what is around you. Athletically, you do not need to be a NCAA athlete to participate in a sport because there is intramural leagues, and athletic equipment and gymnasiums that non-official athletes can take advantage of also. Student Life as a whole is well structured to where if you work hard as a student, you will be successful with your career out in the real world."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed everything about my first year as a college freshman. Semester 1 was great, an easy transition, and lots of activities. First semester professors were very kind and patient to help students adjust to the workload shift. The second semester was great as well. While the workload greatly increases, there are many campus activities to attend for a break. There are support groups to help through stressful times and advisors are super helpful when it comes to scheduling for your needs rather than throwing a crazy schedule at you."
Freshman,4,"I major in Wildlife and Fisheries and I enjoy the program here. I wanted to come to Frostburg for the rural environment and small town vibes, and most importantly the low tuition cost."
Sophomore,4,I like the fact that it is not a very big school. I have been able to make great connections and feel a sense of community being here.
Junior,4,"Frostburg is very affordable and I've had a great time! The town does not have dining, stores, etc. that I am used to at home (the options are more limited in Frostburg), but the area is beautiful. Be prepared to bundle up."
Junior,4,"Frostburg State University is a school that is full of opportunity. If you take advantage of said opportunities, you will truly enjoy you experience with the  organizations on campus, lots of connection for future employment, and making life long connections. If you don’t take advantage of the opportunities in front of you, you not only won’t enjoy  your time here, but you would have missed out on something truly special."
Niche User,4,I went on a college tour to Frostburg and it was an amazing expirence. The area was so beautiful in an area i would love to go to school. The campus was pretty to me and i also know a few people who have graduated from there and they really reccommended it to me. It had a great environment and our tour guides were seniors of Frostburg and they were so helpful. I really enjoyed my college tour and i hope i could attend school here!
Junior,4,"I see Frostburg as an opportunity with great potential. The campus isn't large, but that's okay because of the smaller classes and an increased learning advantage. I enjoyed my time meeting new people, trying new things, and receiving quality education. The lack of surrounding stores in the area sucks, but, you learn to manage. The foreign exchange program is excellent! There are many students from different countries that study here and it's great to indulge in their cultures & vice-versa. However, not many American students interact with them, so they miss out on a great experience. One thing to note out about Frostburg is that they hear complaints/issues. Instead of ignoring, they work on ways to improve the overall quality of the school. I appreciate that because no one wants to dislike their school. If there is a disruption, it is addressed, and a solution is developed. I'm excited to see the continued improvement of Frostburg, looks like they're going in the right direction."
Junior,4,"I transferred to Frostburg last year and I love it. It’s diverse, they have my major and overall it’s just a great school and I’d definitely recommend this school to anyone."
Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors really care and want you to be great, they'll guide you and help you figure out a plan. The food isn't that good. The lane center will mess up your stomach. There's not a lot to do since it's a rural area,  but you can either chose to work on your studies or party, basically you have to choose to fail because they have a lot of facilities to help you succeed. Although if you're black the surrounding area is a little racist"
Alum,4,"Frostburg State is a small school with not much to do outside school and school activities. I was an engineering student, and the engineering department there, did not have lots of teachers. But the advantage of a small school with a small mount of teachers is the amount of interaction that can take place between teachers an students. Compared to a bigger school, it is more personal. With a more personal interaction, for some of the classes, there was better teaching. For the other classes, the teaching was sub par at best, and could be improved. Overall, most teachers care a lot about your college career, and will help you out any way they can."
Freshman,4,"I really liked the atmosphere of the campus. It’s surrounded my mountains and feels like a breath of fresh air being up there. Being on a athletic team there is very fun! We are just a big family! The academic side of the school is very good and understanding. The professors there want you to succeed and are very understanding about what people need on campus. It would be nice if the different clubs on campus would advertise more and make it more interactive for students to join. I didn’t really get to see all the options of all the clubs they have at school. Overall it’s a very nice place to get some fresh air, meet new people, have fun, and be academically excellent!"
Sophomore,4,"I love Frostburg! My teachers have been great, and the experience has been great as well! My only concern is the quality of the dorms. My dorm consistently had leaks coming from the bathroom upstairs and on my roommates side of the room, a huge crack developed over her bed. Frostburg seriously needs to make more investments in student housing."
Junior,4,I enjoy the other students here at FSU. The staff and professors are very welcoming and the culture is inclusive.  The only thing I do not like is the distance from a big city.
Freshman,4,"Frostburg State University is fairly low in price, as far as college tuition goes. My experience here so far as been fairly good, but the housing in many of the dorms need remodeling or general repairs. Frostburg is a smaller school and therefor offers many smaller sized classes that allow you to get to know our professors one on one."
Junior,4,"Frostburg State University is in an area where those who attend the University, will have to be creative and come up with something to do. However, once you find something, it sticks. I make what I can of Frostburg. When you do it is not bad. The campus size is in between small and medium. It it just right. Personally, Frostburg State University on campus is somewhat diverse. Although, outside of the university, it may seem other wise. The academics are average. In certain majors classes, the professor teach the topic well. In others, not so much. Overall, the school is well. I have made a family here. The university gave me the experience of college that I wanted."
Freshman,4,"I went on a campus tour.  I like the location and the assessability to everything that I will need.   dorm rooms look clean everything close by for my personal needs.  Lunch area looked inviting, plenty of places to go to study.  Shuttle bus to take you to the different buildings on and off site."
Freshman,4,I like the diversity of Frostburg State University and how well into getting active students are with different groups and organizations to make changes to themselves and others.
Sophomore,4,"I love Frostburg, it's my other home. I hate the cold, but you deal with it after a while. It's a cheap school and a great school. There's nothing to do outside of campus but they have so many events and so many organizations that there's always something to do and there's a place for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"Frostburg is a pretty decent school; the classes are easy to get, there's a decent honors program, everything is accessible by bus, and if you're looking for a small town atmosphere, it's a good college for you."
Freshman,4,Frostburg is a great school for students to attend coming straight out of high school. It helps students get adapted to college life very easy and the professors here are great and love working with the students. The professors here want their students to succeed. The only downside is that students do end up transferring to bigger and better universities about one or two years.
Junior,4,The class sizes are very small which is good. Maybe my biggest classes consist of 20-25 people which really allows the professors to interact with everyone. Professors are great and really want you to exceed. The campus life is okay with limited to do and the food is not the greatest either.
Freshman,4,I am enjoying my first year here at FSU.  I have been able to figure out exactly what I want to major in and got help deciding talking to some of my professors.  The professors here want you to succeed and its exciting to see them get excited when you excel and they help and have options to help in a subject.
Sophomore,4,"-Frostburg State University is located in Frostburg, Maryland 21532

-What I like about FSU is that it is a smaller university that serves the direct goal of educating students, and this university does this extremely well. The primary focus of this university in terms of academics is business and education. FSU has an MBA program for college students pursuing a masters in business. This university is also on the cheaper end, averaging 21000$ a year to attend full-time for in-state students and about 30000$ for out of state.

-Some of the negatives to this university is that it is very bear-bones. There are not a lot of organizations to join, there are not a lot of entertaining things to do, and the room and board are pretty sparse. It doesn't help FSU is located in a town that has also has very little things to do or go to. The Town of Frostburg is more propped up economically by the University and not the other way around."
Sophomore,4,"I have been attending Frostburg State University for the past 2 years now. I think that it is a great school. The classes are very similar to those of my previous high school in terms of size, normally no more then 30 people. This allows you to interact with your professor and receive help fairly easy. A great school and would recommend to a friend or family member."
Freshman,4,I’m a freshman at Frostburg currently on winter break. Overall a good school with dedicated professors.
Freshman,4,"The main thing that I like about Frostburg is the family like  atmosphere. Each of my six professors knew my name by the end of week three. My advisor stayed in contact with all of my professors to make sure I was on track to pass. The dorms are clean, the food is good, and everyone on campus wants to see you succeed."
Freshman,4,"its cheap, first off, like its very affordable and the people here, campus workers, students, ect. everyones not terribly standoffish theyre pretty friendly and willing to help out. as a poc student im comfortable on campus but sometimes, rarely, youll face ignorance or two. that's something the school doesnt tolerate so you feel safe, the police are always canvasing to help you out and keep the streets safe for people who are intoxicated, potential rape victims in an incident. it's a really nice place for being pretty isolated so to speak because it is- in the mountains. love it here. ♥"
Freshman,4,"The school is nice and offer a lot of help as far as tutoring, class sizes are tiny and people here are relaxed so overall my university is good"
Sophomore,4,I loved my first semester at Frostburg. All of the campus resources made my semester a breeze and I really learned alot. I also made the deans list!
Freshman,4,"I just finished my freshman year here at Frostburg State University and I loved it. Compared to the other colleges I applied to and looked at Frostburg honestly felt like home when I first stepped foot on the campus for a tour last year. The feeling of home has just grown since then over my year attending Frostburg. Even though I love my campus there are still some things I would improve to make the university better, the first thing being food at Cafe. Honestly compared to the other colleges I have visited Frostburg's Cafe is one of the worst food I have had Honestly I try not to go there because there have been a few times I have gotten sick after eating there, I'm not sure if its the food or the way the food is cooked. Other than the food everything else is great; there are a lot of organizations and clubs you can get involved in on campus. Greek life is great, I'm not in it but I know many people who are who love it. Finally the connections you make last a lifetime."
Sophomore,4,"I have only attended Frostburg State University for 1 year, and my experience through this time has been great. The professors at Frostburg want you to succeed and excel at the profession that you are studying for.  The social environment is very diverse with many different cultures meshed into one concentrated area. The food options at Frostburg are generally the same as any other 4-year University ( Cafeteria, Chic-fil-a, Subway, etc.), while providing some close but off campus dining options as well."
Freshman,4,Frostburg is a very good school. Its perfect for those who enjoy having fun but when its time to buckle down and do work its a very easy transition.  The environment is great and its just a all around good experience.
Freshman,4,Frostburg is a great school overall.The only downfall is the location of the campus.If you want to go somewhere you will need a car.There's not a lot places within walking distance at all.
Freshman,4,"I honestly feel the best thing about Frostburg State is the instructors and professors. I think the policies are a weird and they have some really odd rules on campus that I think are annoying. I also find the the town of Frostburg which surrounds the university has some weird laws against skateboarding, and with me being a skateboarder this can be a small problem. outside of those issue I find the school to be a pleasant place to pursue higher education."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Frostburg State University has been ok. I would like to see improvements in the residence halls as well or more events for students. Furthermore, I would like to see recycling initiated in the surrounding community."
Freshman,4,"I like this college a lot. there are many things wrong with this school, but many things right also. I think this college gives you a wide range of abilities to do many many things across many fields. there sports are good, they have great activities around campus for everyone. 

   There are a lot of really tough professors here, even in easy classes or classes that are suppose to be very easy. They just really lack the skill to teach a class correctly. Even though there are a lot a hard professors there are just as many great ones. Professors that make there classes fun, and easy to learn while giving you many chances to make up for what you miss."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Frostburg State University is how diverse the school is compared to other schools. Frostburg has many different cultures, types of people, races, and the school allows and pushes everyone to be themselves. "
Sophomore,4,"After my first year at Frostburg, I can definitely say what I like most about the school is the small campus setting. It gave me a sense of community as I never went a day without bumping into someone I knew on my way to class or even to get some food down at the Lane Center. Frostburg is best at making sure everyone feels like they are right at home. There is a lot of campus involvement as many different organizations try to entice students to come out and have fun. "
College Junior,4,There isn't much to do off-campus but on-campus there are a number of events and organizations that help you meet other students and build relationships
College Senior,4,Frostburg provides many good networking experiences for students who are looking to be proactive about their future after school. My advisor constantly keeps me updated with graduates who ended up in my field that might be good for networking.
College Sophomore,4,Staff and networking with employees also play a major role to ensure great years.
College Sophomore,4,The class sizes are evenly proportionate and everything flows well.
College Sophomore,4,Safe school with average local crimes.
College Sophomore,4,Frostburg State is a Division3 school so sports are pretty average here.
College Sophomore,4,"The experience I've had here at Frostburg State has taught me so many valuable lessons in the course of my freshman year. Frostburg is a very diverse school where you take classes with people all over, this school also has a nice curriculum that isn't too strict but rewarding at the same time."
College Senior,4,The athletics at Frostburg are very good. The coaches and students are dedicated and show their support.
Sophomore,2,This school isn’t the worst but could also be better. More prone to depression Because of how isolated it is. You definitely need a car. Kind of diverse but still more white people
Alum,2,"I had various issues with professors throughout the years, and it was always extremely difficult to resolve. One year- I had a professor who gave me a 25 out of 75 in my participation due to the fact that she got ""negative vibes""from me. Of course I went to the Dean, whom when he confronted the professor, made up another reason. He did nothing else to resolve it, and each time I had a problem thereafter he was completely cold and showed no empathy.  After I graduated, I realized I would never donate to my alma mater."
College Sophomore,2,Stabbings. Robberies. Shootings. Drug raids. You name it. It's probably happened here within a week.
College Sophomore,2,The buildings are run down.
College Sophomore,2,"Most buildings are nice, but the dorms are old."
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus is not really a good idea. The walls are super thin, so you can always hear other people, even when they are just talking. The bathrooms are pretty scary, and the water system is really messed up. There are basically two settings in the shower, cold or steaming hot. The buildings are very old, and not very inviting. The location of most of the on-campus buildings are pretty good though. You have a pretty short walk to all your classes. Except the nicest on-campus place to live is secluded from everyone and everything. So you really have to make a tough decision, live in a really nice place and not be close to anyone or anything (even your classes), or live in a nasty place but be close to everything."
College Freshman,2,Be careful don't be quick to drink anything
College Freshman,2,They may take away your aid
College Student,2,Im not getting alot done.
College Freshman,2,"Frostburg State University is a great school, but we are definitely not known for our athletics. We have every sport one could think of and the most popular sport is lacrosse. They have many wins and fewer losses. They have a great practice area inside the Athletic Department and an even better field to play on. Although I am not a fan of lacrosse, many students come out and support the team whenever they have an home game. Sometimes people take a bus trip to watch them play, if its not too far from the school. Fans usually dress up in the school colors, and sometimes paint their faces with their favorite lacrosse players number."
College Sophomore,2,"The Frostburg State community, and also the town of Frostburg, aren't really all that into athletics.  The overall attitude toward it is sub-par.  No one seems that interested.  It is actually unfortunate.  The residents of Frostburg are more into the high school sports than anything else.  Also, the teams at FSU do not perform very well.  This, accompanied with other issues, seems to maybe be why sports aren't all that popular within the community."
College Freshman,2,"I know that a lot of kids party, but it's gotten better through the years and I know much more people who aren't about that party scene than I know that are. Frostburg's reputation as a party school is largely hyped up in my opinion."
College Freshman,2,On of my scholarships was denied.
College Senior,2,The campus police are not very nice
College Sophomore,2,"Due to the fact that we are in a very remote location there aren't many places to eat off campus outside of ordering pizza or chinese, or eating mcdonald's."
College Sophomore,2,It happens more often than the campus lets on.
College Sophomore,2,One burned down last semester.
College Freshman,2,"The snow is ridiculous so it's often very dangerous to drive. I'm a local though, so it is nothing I'm not too used to."
College Freshman,2,"We are right next to the town of frostburg which is very small and quaint. Cumberland isn't that far away, about a 30 minute drive but realize this school is in the mountains."
College Freshman,2,It's way to cold for me and it's boring.
College Junior,2,financial aid is frustrating and hard to understand.  
College Junior,2,"The local atmosphere in the city of Frostburg is fairly remote.  There is not much of a nightlife or a city life.  However, it gives off the nice small town vibe and has GORGEOUS views of mountains, trees and open space.  "
College Junior,2,"The dining hall is a buffet style, and even though it may seem like there is a variety of food, the food never tastes good.  Basic (easy to make) foods, such as vegetables, pasta, pizza, and soup are always bland and provide no flavor.  Also, if a student runs out of meals for the week, the prices are on the steep end, especially for a college student.  The best places to eat, is take out or restaurants (but again, it's pricey).  "
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really know too much about the Greek life. I see a few a round campus daily. The ones I do see are pretty friendly and act just lke everyone else, they do not make or break the atmosphere."
College Sophomore,2,Most of the facilities are good. Nothing exceptional or notable though.
College Junior,2,I feel the strictness is about average. The school is not too strict but not too easy on problems they may have. The school takes pride in their academics and wants their students to succeed. If another student is preventing a student from getting the education they deserve then the school will intervene and give the student disciplinary actions.
College Sophomore,2,"The cafeteria food always makes me feel sick. My friends and I always joke that they lace the food with laxatives. They usually change your eating options daily which is nice and their late night dinners are usually a lot of fun. When they have wings at late night the lines go out the door. The food at Lane is pretty good but it begins to get old after a while and if you aren't careful you can spend way too much. I recommend getting a bobcat card rather than a meal plan because that money can be used at places off campus, including Sheetz, grocery stores, and McDonald's."
College Freshman,2,"There are a few parking lots that are big and open, but are far from where most of the classes are held. The parking places close to the buildings with classes in them have very minimal parking for students."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not qualify for much financial aid, although I need a lot.  It doesn't make sense when I am the one going to pay for my college, but yet the financial aid is based on my parent's income.  I could have use some good counseling with this."
College Sophomore,2,"It snows a lot in the winter and early spring.  Other times of the year it is quite windy.  Classes get canceled occassionally inthe winter, which is nice."
College Freshman,2,Some people are involved in Greek life but not the majority. They help sponsor a lot of events but even if you're not Greek you can still go. It doesn't really make a huge impact.
College Sophomore,2,free parking for on-campus students. parking is decent but sometimes crowded.
College Senior,2,"There is a lot of snow usually and the weather has a mind of it own. One day is can be 65 and sunny, and the next day there will be 3"" of snow on the ground. Class doesn't get cancelled too much- unless you find the right professors- but it really is not a bad place to be. I love it out here."
College Freshman,2,"Frostburg State University has a very unique scene, considering it is located high up in the mountains. The faculty members, and professors do what they can to help students to do their best in college. I also like the fact that this school offers many programs that help benefit us for the future. However, the stores are not within walking distance, and the weather is a lot different from what I'm used to in the city."
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms at Frostburg State university are not great at all, even the upperclassmen arent up to par."
College Sophomore,2,"The cafeteria is pretty hit or miss most of the time. The online menu will help you decide if its worth eating there, but it usually isn't. The other dining options are Sub Zero, which specializes in subs and a limited variety of fried foods, and Appalachian Station, which has more fast food options."
Recent Alumnus,2,It usually snows before Halloween every year. Due to Frostburg being located in the mountains of Western Maryland you can experience all four seasons in one day kind of reminds me of the weather in Colorado.
College Sophomore,2,Not Big on School Spirit – Football games receive the most attention. The crowd can range from large to small.
College Sophomore,2,It's Good It's Bad – Depending on where you are on campus really depicts how much drug activity you will be surrounded by. But for the most part its not bothersome
College Sophomore,2,"When you come from a city where there are plenty of places to have fun with many malls,movies,and places to eat Frostburg is very small. It is a small town where the biggest thing there is a super walmart and their mall is not very big and doesnt have many popular store that you would be used to seeing in a much bigger mall. But if you stay on campus at Frostburg you will always have fun"
College Junior,2,"THis weather is very random. I remember one day when it Snowed, was 80 degrees and rained all in the same day."
College Freshman,2,Allright but Quality Can Be Better – The food is not all bad but sometimes i feel like their can be more variety with the food choices. Also the food seems similar to cafeteria food back in high school and in my opinion the quality should be better than that since students and their parents are paying for it out of their pockets. and thee food still leaves me hungry leading me to snack on unhealthy food options
College Freshman,2,"Excessive Stirctness Within the Dorms – Many of the rules reguarding what is and isn't allowed within the residence halls are easily understood and followed but the way they are inforced by the different RA's and RD's can make it difficult to know what is and isn't allowed.  Within my first year at Frostburg, I have encountered RA's that are lenient with the rules about quiet hours and will give you warnings, while there are others that will give you a noise violation for walking to loudly by thier doors.  Having such a broad spectrum of what is and isn't tolerated can make it difficult to follow the rules and cause tensions to get high between residents and their advisors.  I have encountered many occasions where students have gotten in trouble for doing something because a specific RA was on duty, while they did the same thing the day before and the RA on duty did not mind.  It would be helpful if the rules were made clear and enforced the same way with all of the advisors and directors."
College Junior,2,"Living on Campus – Living on campus is expensive and strict. It is a much better option to live off campus, not only is it more affordable, but it is also a great opportunity for a student to know what it's like to be on their own with responsibilities."
College Senior,2,"I Love History! I have been jerked around so much on classes needed, transfer credits, and trying to get classes are a nightmare! Most are offered once a school year and if you don't get enrolled before all seats are taken then you're held up until the class is offered again, in a year. And with most being ""variable"" even though required it can take longer."
College Junior,2,"I came to Frostburg State University as a transfer student.  I was not informed about the scholarship application until after the deadline had already passed, so I was unable to get any scholarships.  The rest of my financial aid covered the cost of school, but it was mostly loans.  Frostburg, being a small school, has a very limited amount of aid money to give out."
College Junior,2,"The only on-campus dining I really use is the Lane University Center.  There are some options (not very many), but most are unhealthy and overpriced.  For example, when a burrito was 99 cents at a Taco Bell in town, it was $1.59 at the Lane Center Taco Bell.  Also, the hours are limited.  They close early on Fridays, so if your classes go long, you have to go off-campus to eat.  The dining hall has extremely limited hours as well and sub-par food."
College Junior,2,"Not Sure – Unfortunately, I do not receive financial aid so I am not sure at all how that whole system works."
College Junior,2,"Frostburg has the weirdest weather I've ever experienced. All in one day you can get snow, rain, sun; back to back to back. You may leave out the house in a big coat, and by the time you get out of your class you wish you would have worn sandals. But the worse thing about Frostburgs weather is the wind. It's not always freezing up here, but once that wind blows you may not even want to step outside thats how cold it gets. The wind blows so hard sometimes it will literally move you. 
On a good note though, it does get warmer than most people suspect. When the weather channel says it may be 58 degress, when the sun is out it can feel like 70. So there are times we get alot of heat and sun. As I mentioned before, the week may start off with a couple inches of snow, and by Friday people are wearing shorts."
College Sophomore,2,"A Little Variety Never Hurts – There are a few restaurants off- campus such as pizza shops, italian, and the typical Mc Donalds, BK and KFC. Some of the prices in these restaurants are a bit high but not too bad."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Much Going on – Frostburg State is the center of the community. There isn't really much to do in the surrounding area but W.V and Hagerstown are both about 1 1/2 hrs away, where there are better malls and places to go."
College Freshman,2,"The weather is unpredictable. One day it is 70 degrees, and then the next day it is snowing."
College Sophomore,2,"Cops are serious about violations and parking tickets. The campus is supposedly strict about not smoking on campus, and yet I see countless students AND faculty smoking on campus grounds."
College Sophomore,2,"Some of the food is amazing, but there are a lot of times where the food is questionable. We cannot tell what it is some days."
College Junior,2,"Extremely cold, thats the only major downfall about Frostburg. After all, it is called FROSTburg. People already know what to expect before they come."
College Sophomore,2,"Rains and Snows a Lot – It rains a lot, which is annoying you can't really enjoy the weather. Towards February it snows a lot, which causes class to cancel.If you live up campus classes are closer to the dorms. When the weather is nice especially in the summer everyone stays outside for a longtime."
College Freshman,2,"It is cold in Frostburg more than it would ever be warm or hot. The snow and freezing rain is unpredictable. It snows A LOT. It snows from December till about April. And when Frostburg gets snow, it gets about 4 feet. It's not like high school where if the snow is bad, school is cancelled. At Frostburg State, the only time classes are cancelled is if our Dining Hall (cafeteria) is closed, but that rare."
College Freshman,2,"Not many clubs for 18 and older, only bars for 21 and older. Their are house parties but not all are safe. Pick and chooses where you want to be. We have Safe Ride for free transportation for students which is a plus."
College Junior,2,"To be honest, the weather in Frostburg is rather sporadic, or as the students call it ""bi-polar."" You can witness hail, rain, snow, sun, and extreme wind all in one day! The winters are extremely wintery seeing as though we are up in the mountains, but the city of Frostburg experiences BEAUTIFUL weather during the Spring and Summer Seasons. This affects my campus somewhat. Walking to class in the brisk cold rain or snow can be hassle, but I knew what I was getting myself into before I came to the school, so I cant really complain much. When it is nice outside, many people spend their days outside and campus becomes a beautiful place for social interaction."
College Sophomore,2,"Athletics at Frostburg State University are not what I am use to. The team themselves are not very athletic, we don't win many games or championships. Our football team can't win games let alone make it to the playoffs. Therefore, the school spirit is lacking. Barely anyone comes to games. The gym is nice, but is nothing spectacular."
Junior,1,"Only class I found useful was macro so far. They don’t test these classes to see if it’s worth the cost to the consumer because the consumers don’t care about the cost, they just want that piece of paper. It’s not a place of education, it’s a place of high egos and blind testing. You better have enough money to hire a tutor, because the tutors and teachers here have the mindset of a 9-5 factory Worker."
Junior,1,"Garbage school in my experience, never seen an institution so frugal and incompetent. They 100% do not test the product they’re selling. They also have no idea what employer are looking for, the only why you’ll get through it with benefit is to join their professional fraternities so that you can get carried into a decent job. Not based on your skill but because of the people you suckerd up to. 
Good luck, I hope they shut down this scam."
Alum,1,"According to the president of the university he promotes a family oriented situation. However, there is nothing family about this institution. Dorms are severely dates and filthy, no support in times of crisis, and anyone with authority refuses to talk with you. At no time was counseling offered. When Covid-19 sent everyone home, the school did not have adequate technology to support students. I do not believe that teachers were versed in technology or using their own canvas system that has been used for years. They closed on multiple occasions to try and teach professors how to use the system. Professors can do as they please the the school will support unfair practices. I could never in good conscious recommend this institution for anyone."

College Freshman,1,"The financial aid process at my school has been the worst experience that I have ever had with any school. I move to Maryland from Missouri mainly because I wanted to attend Frostburg State University. Before I moved to Maryland I called and asked the financial aid office if all my expenses have been covered, they reassured me that everything was fine and that I did not need any further assistance. However, when I arrived to school and tried to buy my books they told me that my account had insufficient funds and that I actually owed the school over 7,000 dollars. I come from a single parent household with no college fund saved up, so paying 7,000 was not an option. So instead of trying to figure out how i was going to come up with 7,000+ dollars, I had to lower my credit hours to half time and pick the cheapest meal plan but I still owed the school 3,000+ dollars. To help with that, I had to take out another loan and that only gave me 2,000 dollars, so I still owed 1,000+ dollars. I now have two jobs so I can save enough money to pay off my balance."
College Freshman,1,The dining hall doesn't have real home foods.
College Freshman,1,I had a huge issue with receiving my financial aid. It caused me to not be able to register for the spring
College Freshman,1,It's kinda boring unless you are really involved in programs or know a lot of people. 
College Freshman,1,The weather at  Frostburg can fluctuate from -15 to 30 degrees in a week. It may snow one day and be beautiful and sunny the next. To add to all of this the wind is absolutely ridiculous and can be 14 mph at times. 
College Freshman,1,"The weather here is crazy! One day it will rain, the next snow, the next be sunny, the next be windy and cold, and the cycle repeats."
College Junior,1,The school is pretty strict on their policies. They want everyone to be able to live in a safe environment. Students get find for underage drinking and get a letter sent home about the violation.
College Freshman,1,It is almost always cold at Frostburg. The wind will just about knock you over!
College Sophomore,1,"It is very cold once winter is here, hence the name FROSTburg. The weather can change like 5 times through out the day. From sunny to windy to couldy to rainy all in one day. Be prepared!"
College Senior,1,"We need taxis at FSU! Basically, there is no public transportation in the area. The only taxi service went out of business over a year ago. The mall is in the next town and impossible to get to without a car. There is a bus that takes students to Baltimore every now and then, and the campus shuttle is reliable. However, it snows a lot here and if you are planning to walk most days, you better have a good pair of boots! The lack of transportation fails to keep students out of trouble. Parties in the apartments surrounding campus are wild. Perhaps if students could go out, they would tone down the partying while some of us want to study."
College Sophomore,1,"One day it's cold, the other it's hot. Monday it's clear and 70 degrees, tuesday it's snowing and below 20."
College Senior,1,Sports Are Awful – The football team isnt good.. Basketball is ok but we definitely aren't known for our sports teams.
College Freshman,1,Crime Doesn't Pay – The police and resident assistants are very strict.  If you are doing something you shouldn't you will more than likely get caught.  My RA became power crazy during the spring semester.
College Senior,1,"Most History classes are listed as ""variable"" making it extremely difficult to take classes that are required. Independent study is frowned upon. The professors don't often encourage students to gain more info than is presented in class & generally push their own political views as the only acceptable ones."
College Senior,1,"What? Are You Kidding Me?! The campus police are hardly ever to be seen unless the alumni or regents, etc. are on campus. Any complaints about this are met with: Oh no they're everywhere. This is a lie. I spend a lot of time in my car in the main lot & literally days can go by without seeing any campus police."
College Senior,1,"Not Enough Working Labs – The labs are rarely available in Pullen Hall because they use them for classes & the ones in Ort Library are normally taken up by students on facebook, myspace, online games, etc. Have your own computer & printer because the wait to use the labs is ludicrous."

The classes aren't as stressful as I would've thought a few years ago. The academic advisors are very very helpful when I need advise on certain topics. This is really a great school and I couldn't think of anything as of right now that I would change. They have yet to do anything to make me want to switch.

I didn't know where to start or how I would end up finishing my degree, but through a co-worker I found out about CSU. I was hesitant because I didn't know if finishing school online would be the best choice for me but it turns out I couldn't have made a better choice. From the start (2013) everyone at CSU was extremely friendly and helpful (and they still are). They made sure that I understood the process and they are always prompt with emails. I attended my first Bachelor's graduation ceremony in Orange Beach, AL and I could truly see how happy the staff and professors were for us. I loved this experience for it's ease and affordability."
Sophomore,5,"From what I have experienced at Columbia Southern University, it is a great establishment for the working student. They are easy to talk to in the financial aid department. They really want you to succeed and you don't get the notion that they just taking your money. When I applied for this college I had  two cousins that raved about the school one graduated and one is almost finish. All three of us work in the plant so this was a no brainer for me . They work on around your schedule so you really don't have to quit working they make it convenient for you. You don't feel rushed you know your deadline it doesn't change its there for you.

A lot of students are experienced professionals obtaining their degree to progress and are always prepared to supply you with information to help you in your educational journey.

I've attended CSU for four years now and they have always been very organized with not only my academics, but my financial aid , as well. My professors have all been approachable and helpful. CSU has been a very positive, rewarding experience. I would choose them again in a heartbeat and I recommend CSU to ANYONE of ANY age wanting to further their education!  (Did I mention, I just turned 50? You're never too old to go back to school!)"
Junior,5,The Staff has been extremely helpful and understanding of the life of a student that is also a full time employee.  My Professor is extremely knowledgeable in his field and structured his class in such a way that you can't help but learn and enjoy  the process. This is the best experience I have ever had with an online class and look forward to the next.  They also don't have differential tuition for in or out of state students and it's less expensive than my local community college.

Freshman,4,My only issue would be resources. I wish they helped me more with getting set up financially for college.

Senior,4,Columbia Southern University is a completely on-line University. I have learned alot at my own pace at this school. That is the one great thing is you can do all of your studies at home. That can also be the most difficult thing is you have to be very self motivated.
Senior,4,I began my journey toward my BS in Occupational Safety and Health in November of 2017. I had a lot of credits from different schools and CSU really worked with me to ensure I got the credit I had already worked for. The courses are very rigorous and require discipline. Writing in APA format is mandatory. Most professors interact with you and will do everything they can to assist in helping you succeed. I have 30 more credits to go graduate.

Graduate Student,4,I went to Columbia Southern University for my Bachelors. The process was very good for me. I got to take courses at my pace and apply them to the field I was currently in. The access to other students was great because even though I was on line I still felt like I had people there who were going through what I was. It was hard at first to keep myself on track and do my assignments on time. I feel once I got used to the school/work balance I hit my stride and it went really smoothly. The teachers always got back to me with a question or issue. If I had a work problem and I was late or missing work they always gave me a chance to make it up or give me small extensions. People sometimes think that online is easier but I have to tell you that it is NOT. I alone was accountable and had to work twice as hard if I had a problem.
Senior,4,Overall good college!  Columbia Southern University is a good college for working adults like myself.  
College Senior,4,It's a wonderful school for those of us who work full time and are trying to get a master's degree

Single parents, military, or students who want the education but simply do not have the time of major funds will love this school.

Recent Alumnus,4,"My interaction with other students was difficult because i completed my courses online, but we were able to communicate in group forums. I gained more confidence once i knew there were other professionals just like me who wanted to better themselves. As a criminal justice major we were very diverse, some students were law enforcement, military, law students etc. GThe workload was not demanding but required more thought, because this was an online institution most of the resources listed above I was not fortunate to take advantage of."
Recent Alumnus,4,"With my profession as an active duty service member and parent, this institution provides the time needed to accomplish my professional duties while pursuing my education. During rough deployments my teachers and counselors emailed and adjusted course timelines to insure that I had he required time needed. I have attend many schools this by far is the best ."

The courses are aggressive so a fair amount of due diligence is required. What you put in will be what you have in the end. I feel the class is not so large that your professors can't identify with each student on a personal one on one relationship."
College Senior,4,"Southern Columbia University provides a student with an extensive list of topics of choice for any degree that one could desire to ever achieve. I can not say what the future will bring, but I wouldn't hesitate to use Columbia Southern again in pursuit of a higher degree."
College Senior,4,"I chose Columbia Southern Universitity online course electing Occupational Safety and Health as my major of studies rather than to attend the only university from my home state of Maine that offers the same major. I live close to 200 miles away from this school and it would be impossible for me to either drive the 400 mile round trip, or stay at the campus dorm. Any way you look at it, when I do pass and receive my associates degree, it will mean exactly the same thing regardless of which state it was learned in."
College Senior,4,"The instructors are very clear what they expect for you to accomplish. Its not a ""walk in the park"" would be accurate. It is a demanding schedule for sure, I'm not totally convinced that it could be done if the student was working and supporting a household, I am disabled and after 40 years of being employed in an industrial setting, my body is totally worn its self literally out. My mind though, is as good as or better than it has ever been. I have had a long time plan of achieving at least an associates degree as no one else in my family had ever gone any further than high school.The my courses here at Columbia Southern University are such that I am able to keep up with a demanding syllibus and will be able to obtain my goals for my future."

College Sophomore,4,I just finished my second class with CSU and this class was super and the instructor has reasonable expectations from her students
College Senior,2,I wish I was eligible for financial aid. I have applied and have been turned down. I also wish I was more familiar with grants for adults returning to school because I have had a hard time finding good information on how to apply for those
College Sophomore,2,No help and I have to use the internet to research stuff that should be provided to me as a student.
College Sophomore,2,"I have no idea, no one is in my circle no help on how to socialize thru the internet with other students."
College Sophomore,2,They take your money and leave you to figure things out for yourself.
College Sophomore,2,"They do not offer much for the student, most of the time have to use outside sources."
College Sophomore,2,Not much in helping the students.
College Junior,2,Seems like its a hassle
College Junior,2,I don't agree with the class load that they require in order to use your pell grant money.
College Junior,2,The professor are not very understanding of adverse situations.
Junior,1,"I was enrolled in their fire/public safety program earning a bachelor degree, and after not being able to enroll again due to personal reasons I tried to start again. When I went to enroll in classes I had to be reevaluated and was told that I needed more classes to earn my degree. This is the second time they have done this to me, and on the classes needed have nothing to do with my area of study. Tried to talk to everyone I could and got no help. Tired to appeal this and got no where. This place is a rip off, the professors don't give any real feed back and I haven't really learned anything of importance to the fire service. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else like a real university with real accreditation so you can have more opportunities."
College Freshman,1,CSU does not have any form of Career Services for their students. They will help a graduating student find future educational programs to continue further their education.

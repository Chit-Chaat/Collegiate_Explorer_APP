Junior,5,Appalachian is good at communicating and informing their students. It is easy to find information you need by calling and talking to staff.
Alum,5,I love the tight community feel and how small that classes are. Very intimate and welcoming. I enjoyed how the professors recognize you and treats with respect and dignity.
Alum,5,"I did not take any classes fully on-line. But all of the online portions of the classes were wonderful, organized and easy to navigate."
Niche User,5,"I haven't gone there yet, but if I get accepted I would be extremely happy! I took an online college tour and I wasn't disappointed. I can't wait to step foot on the campus."
Niche User,5,"Beautiful, if I get accepted there I am going to be extremely happy, the campus is absolutely breathtaking and it has an amazing theatre and creative writing program."
Junior,5,I love Appalachian State University because everyone here is so friendly and welcoming. The campus is beautiful and gives good vibes. I love the mountains which is a big bonus.
Sophomore,5,Just transferred to this school and I'm loving it so far. The atmosphere is amazing and you never run out of things to do. There's plenty of places to meet people and study.
Sophomore,5,With covid-19 all my classes are online and most of the professors have done a great job communicating plans for the fall semester.
Senior,5,Beautiful campus and atmosphere. Weather is very nice during spring and summer. Winter and fall can bring snow.
Senior,5,I have taken a few classes online and they went well. The professors post audio lectures going through each powerpoint as they would in class. They try to keep videos at most 15 minutes so they are easier to watch.
Senior,5,App State is an awesome school! I am in the online program and my professors so far has been exceptional. They don't use distance as an excuse or barrier for your education or assignments. They challenge you and they are there for you every step of the way ensuring your success.
Senior,5,I like that App State is a diverse University. So far everything has been easy to access and follow online. The online distance learning program is exceptional.
Sophomore,5,"Love this school! Great community, school spirit, and strong environmental focus. So glad I decided on this university. Enjoyed my first year, lots of community building and support especially  if you are part of a LLC."
Sophomore,5,Great experience with online learning. The professor was very involved and I learned a lot. Much better experience than the online college class that I took during high school.
Alum,5,"App State is an incredibly unique college located in the heart of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The professors (much like the sports) punch above their weight and this 'underdog spirit' resonates through campus. I have no regrets attending! Take advantage of the many resources available to you and enjoy the Nature; Vastly underrated. Majored in Psychology, went on to get a Master's from Northeastern, currently live in NYC. Deeply miss my time in Boone,it's a special place."

Sophomore,5,Online class was great. Professor very accessible. Definitely an improvement over an online class that I took during high school.
Sophomore,5,"Such an amazing school! Great living learning communities, friendly atmosphere, lots of school spirit. Couldn’t believe how nice my freshman dorm was and I got a suite. Very happy with all my profs and my classes."
Sophomore,5,"I have loved my experience at this school. Excellent resources, wonderful lifelong friends made, fantastic teachers and classes."
Sophomore,5,This was an interesting transition but nonetheless it’s discipline that helps one prevail. as far as online classes that were always meant to be online as long as you discuss any questions with your teacher immediately and find other students to talk with and ask questions then any online class should be a breeze.

Freshman,5,"I start off as a freshman in the fall but I have many friends that go there, and have visited the campus several times."
Sophomore,5,Appalachian is a great school with a family like environment. There small student to teacher ratios make learning easy!
Sophomore,5,I have taken a few classes online and the quality compares great to in person classes. The professors also really care.
Alum,5,The students are great and very open-minded. Every professor that I've had has been caring and genuinely concerned about their students. Not to mention that the campus is beautiful. This is a great place to go to school!
Freshman,5,It is a very enjoyable time. The school is the perfect size. It isn't to big and it isn't to small. Everyone on campus is very friendly and so is Boone.
Freshman,5,Everything got moved online due to COVID-19. Professors were very caring and supportive of the students and took certain things into consideration. Very easy learning experience during these hard times
Sophomore,5,This school’s atmosphere makes me feel important and not just a number. I feel like I belong here. Students and professors are incredibly kind and inclusive.
Freshman,5,I just finished my first year and I loved it. I was super sad that the second semester was cut short because of corona virus. I loved my classes and I love the department I'm in. I'm a dance major and the program has so many good people working hard to make it all come together. I've met wonderful people through the dance program.
Senior,5,More Parking and Graduate Degree programs. I am a second degree seeking student as an adult. I love the area.
Freshman,5,I love it here at Appalachian State. I love that I wake up and look out my window to see the mountains. The professors are very invested in the students and are always available for advice or guidance.
Alum,5,"If you've lived in Boone, there are many iconic things you take with you after you leave. You'll have a favorite hangout on campus, a favorite hangout downtown, a favorite hangout in the woods or on water somewhere, a favorite outdoor store, a favorite place on the Parkway... And you won't regret a moment of being there. ASU life is a wonderful, supportive environment from student life, to health services, and the general community. Small classes, students and professors who know you by name, great residential options - all of these things work together to make it home-away-from-home."
Freshman,5,If you want a school that feels like home and has a excellent atmosphere then App is perfect. Boone is the perfect college town.
Freshman,5,"I love this school! Great atmosphere, beautiful location, professors who love to teach.  The school spirit is amazing.  I can't imagine going to any other school."
Sophomore,5,"Appalachian State is an absolutely amazing university! The mountains are so beautiful and so different, considering I grew up in a beach town. The class sizes are good and it's such a big campus but has a very small community feel to it."
Graduate Student,5,"I love Appalachian State university because it is devoted to promoting academic and personal success. It is devoted to diversity and giving all students equal opportunities to succeed. If I could change one thing about Appalachian State, it would be the parking. There is an overflow of students and not enough parking spots to ensure a space for everyone."
Sophomore,5,"I love App State!! I am currently a Sophomore here and I am sad to say that theres only two years left. If they had a Graduate Program for what I am doing I would stay! The town of Boone is amazing and the locals are great. Weekends are filled with football games, hikes and tons of out door things to do."
Sophomore,5,So far I have enjoyed my time at Appalachian State University. It is in a great location. It is surrounded by the mountains which allows for lots of outdoor adventures. It is also a small town which I love. The students and professors really make campus a great place to be. I love how inviting students are and no club/organization is better than another. My professors also go out of there way to help their students and give them a sense of worth. I think the school could improve by being more diverse and allowing more opportunities for their students including; more on-campus housing and financial aid.
Sophomore,5,"I love the location of this university.  Growing up on the beach, the mountains were a great option and change of pace for me.  It is also the perfect size for me.  The community that this university creates reminds me of home."
Junior,5,"I was relatively unsure about coming to Appalachian, but it was cheap (for college) and about an hour from home. The first couple weeks were an adjustment, even overwhelming at times, but I began to notice a school spirit and pride that I had not seen in my (much smaller) high school. The sound of thousands of students chanting during a football game is something I won't soon forget!! Every single professor I have had so far is fully dedicated to helping their students succeed, and this is manifested in many different ways. The campus is absolutely beautiful (especially during the winters), and the entire atmosphere of the town of Boone makes me feel calm, at peace, and at home in a way I did not expect. Appalachian is a wonderful school and a memorable experience you won't ever forget!"
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy being at App, because of how close it is to my home. It is only 30 minutes from my hometown. I really emoji the athletic atmosphere and how much athletics mean to the school."
Alum,5,Appalachian State University is an incredible university. It is in a beautiful location that offers a variety of activities. Many of these activities are used as PE in school. The professors are very kind and helpful and the class sizes are perfect.
Freshman,5,"I just applied to Appalachian and I would say that it was an easy and painless experience, the process was very easy and tolerable. I had a good experience at my tour and with my counselor."
Sophomore,5,"Appalachian State University is a majorly diverse college that contains many different groups of people that would accept any person into their arms with happiness. In my experience, I have been able to find what it is that I love to do and establish myself into a group of close friends that enjoy most if not all of the same things that I do. As long as the weather is nice I will always be able to go out and meet new people on campus and create relationships that will last a lifetime. 
     There are little to no things that I would change about the university itself. The classes are all small and create a welcoming environment. The professors know that we take several hours worth of classes and make sure not to make the homework loads too unbearable. I have a set homework time and a set free time that allows me to focus on studies while still enjoying college life."
Sophomore,5,Appalachian State University has tons to offer. Lots of majors to choose from as well as a beautiful campus. All of the teachers that I have had are amazing and are very passionate about what they do. Overall an amazing experience!
Niche User,5,"I love the campus of and scenery around Appalachian State University. My brother attended a few years ago, and loved every second of it, and I am very excited to embark on my own journey there. The opportunities offered on and off campus are unmatched. I enjoy the close-knit community atmosphere while still getting exposure to things on a large scale. The academic rigor is top notch with amazing professors and advisors. All the faculty has an individual's best interest in mind. Appalachian state offers an excellent overall experience."
Sophomore,5,I enjoy the location and people. I have become more active and involved. I have made many friends and learned many things in my short time here.  There are many clubs so you can find things that interest you and learn about different cultures without taking classes.
Graduate Student,5,"It is a very welcoming and friendly school. Although the university has 20,000 people it feels like a smaller more intentional community."
Niche User,5,"The people, location, and scenery are amazing. Both of my parents went there and now my sister and I are planning on attending there. The campus is large and filled with lots of friendly people that make the college experience worth every bit of college debt."
Niche User,5,Appalachian State University is unlike any school that I have ever visited. The students genuinely want to be there and the smiles reveal that. The clean mountain air clears the lungs and makes me excited to be there. I love this school.
Junior,5,"I love being a Mountaineer! The people at App are so down to earth and friendly. The professors are helpful. I love all of the amenities on campus. Boone is an awesome little city to live in, and I always feel safe on campus."
Niche User,5,"Appalachian State University is full of the kindest people I have ever met. Compared to other colleges I'v visited, I felt  welcomed when I first entered. I am currently studying Psychology and Art and I am very impressed."
Niche User,5,"I have not attended Appalachian, but my sister did and I plan on going here. Beautiful scenery. The people have been so nice and helpful to my sister and I when I go visit. Also, Appalachian feels like home. I have never lived in the country, nor want to, leading to an even bigger reason that I want to go there. I also have been told by any people that they have good veterinarian classes, and I want to be an animal science teacher."
Junior,5,The professors Appalachian State are one of the best things about the school. They understand the content of their classes and make the class engaging and easy to follow.
Alum,5,"I loved my time at Appalachian State University. The small  mountain town was beautiful and there were always so many things to do. The school gives you several opportunities for studying abroad, internships, and career fairs. The professors really care about helping their students out as well. Definitely the place to be if you love the mountains."
Junior,5,There is a very strong support system at Appalachian State University available for students. Campus facilities are well-placed for students living on either side of the campus. The educators are (for the most part) willing to work extra to make sure students are able to succeed.
Junior,5,I love Appalachian State University. It has been the perfect fit for me as an undergraduate student. The way the professors treat you as more than just a number in the system makes it easy to feel at home away from home.
Freshman,5,"Appalachian State University is incredible! I walk around campus every day in awe of how beautiful it is there. Walking to class surrounded by beautiful mountains and sometimes snow is a dream come true. Also, all of the professors are incredible. I have not heard one bad review on a professor my friends and I have had. Every student you cross paths with at Appalachian is very nice. Everyone is always willing to help you out if you need it, or just start up a conversation with you."
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy the school so far. The campus is beautiful, and teachers and staff seem to overall be pretty nice. It's just an all-around nice place to be."
Sophomore,5,Great school has a lot to offer. Students for most part treat you well better than most schools. Teachers truly care about there students.
Junior,4,Online is better here than other schools I have attended because the staff knows what they are doing.
Freshman,4,"App State is a great university that gives its students multitudes of opportunities while still maintaining a more intimate setting and tight-knit community. Campus is the perfect size, where everything is within a brief walking distance, but also sprawls enough that students can move about freely. The surrounding community is incredible, with several shops, restaurants, and other places for students and locals to hang out. Beautiful scenery is partnered with a variety of hiking trails and swimming spots for an amazing natural experience also. The athletic programs are phenomenal, especially the football team, so there is always an athletic event to attend. Clubs and organizations abound at App, so students can find pretty much anything they are interested in here. While ASU does promote diversity and inclusion, I would like to see more diversity in the student body and in faculty, as it is currently a predominantly white institution."
Freshman,4,"The online learning experience has been going well, especially since both professors and students understand this is a new primary learning format that will have many technological issues. Professors have been receptive and willing to help with any issues, and there are several study spots on campus that offer a variety of environments to settle in and work."
Freshman,4,"I love the campus and what it has to offer to do around school after classes, but with covid restrictions it has made it hard to meet new people. Most of my classes are online which isn't that great, my I love my class that is in person."
Sophomore,4,I transferred to Appalachian State from Pennsylvania State - University Park campus and I feel so more at home with the App State community. I feel that Appalachian State has a more diverse population of personality which I enjoy emensly.
Niche User,4,"Appalachian State University is a welcoming environment with good academic programs. While ASU is not known for the rigor of its academic courses, it is certainly a wonderful community."
Sophomore,4,The transition to online classes was difficult when corona started but all of the professors I had made it work and I actually bettered my grades because of their help. I also took an online summer class so it was one that was meant to be online and again it was very helpful and now I don’t have to take it during the school year.
Freshman,4,I loved going to the games and the overall environment of the school but the diversity was unfortunately lacking.
Alum,4,"All of the classes were switched to online for the last half of the spring 2020 semester, and all of the professors did their best to make it work for all students. It wasn't easy on anyone but my professors went above and beyond to make sure the transition was as easy as possible."
Junior,4,"Definitely one of the best campuses, especially if you want to teach. The only “bad” thing is the difficulty of walking everywhere but you get used to it after a bit of time."
Junior,4,"We only got two weeks to move online but overall, it was excellent how the professors handled everything."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I think that there are good and bad parts to the university but I think the good outweighs the bad. The campus has alot of activities that are very open and I love how friendly the campus is to the LGBT+ community. The bad things are either small or completely unchangeable, for example all the stairs lol. Probably the best university for those who are active or want to be more active."
Sophomore,4,"During the spring semester all classes went online after spring break. Most teachers managed to conduct the class very well, while others struggled because either they were older and didn't know how to use the internet or it was a class that was extremely difficult to teach online. Note: dont take a gym class online."
Junior,4,"The faculty and staff at Appalachian State University are always there to assist any student who has questions about Admissions, Financial Aid, Housing, and every other opportunity provided by the school. The way Appalachian State has been handling the COVID-19 pandemic is also very thought out and they are guiding their student body to the best of their ability."
Freshman,4,App State has such a good feel all around campus! Somehow you manage to feel like you're attending a small college while still having all the amenities of attending a big public university!
Junior,4,I have met amazing people through all of their resources they have provided. Appalachian has many opportunities to meet new people and promote inclusivity amongst its students.
Freshman,4,"Well, I will start to go to App State in August of this year, but they have treated me well so far. I would recommend someone who wants to go to this university because it is a good school for people who are undecided about what major to get into."
Sophomore,4,"Very beautiful school, with pretty great academics. I would highly recommend this school to others because of the scenic and welcoming environment."
Freshman,4,"App is a great school. I love the scenery - it's located in the mountains. The weather can be iffy - changing multiple times per day from sunny and warm to windy and cold to downpour. It's located in the town of Boone, and when Fall and Spring semesters are in session, the population of the town doubles, making social life much more interesting than what Boone ""normally"" has to offer. Although I'm but a freshman, my experience thus far academically hasn't been negative. The professors actually care about the students - they want you to do well. Confused? Asking them for help during their office hours will make their day."
Freshman,4,"Transfer student here, current professors are all great and approachable. Most of them are very open to work with students."
Junior,4,"Although this is only my first year at Appalachian State University, I could not have asked for a better experience. Everyone here is so welcoming and nice and they want to see you succeed. There are many opportunities to be involved on campus and in the community. This year they have made it a priority to build new dorms to expand and meet the needs of incoming students."
Freshman,4,"The school is beautiful and I thoroughly enjoy the campus. I have some great friends and some really great professors. My biggest reservation though is everything about app's finances. Scholarships are insanely selective, so good luck getting any financial aid. Also if your having a problem with student accounts, don't call them. I have been trying to reach them over the phone for 2 days and still can't but I don't have time to go between class. Solid choice, but I hope you're financially stable."
Junior,4,"Appalachian State University has been a home away from home for me since my first step in my dorm hall freshman year. Now I live off campus, but the community and people are so close knit and welcoming. I love how experimental and open minded the university is, they never turn down an opportunity to do better, go greener, or become easily accessible for all individuals on campus. Although everyone is ready to discuss any topic on the agenda that needs change,  one issue I would like to see reconsidered  is money distribution. The arts do a fantastic job at creating beautiful pieces with that they have, but art is no match for lack of funding. Our programs are being shadowed by the new facilities and shiny shoes our athletic teams receive monthly. The people should respect the way art makes them feel true human emotion and behavior. App State wants to support us artistic spirits through our journey but that does not make feeling less equal to athletics or higher academics any better."
Sophomore,4,"I have been very satisfied with how much the community in Boone where Appalachian state University is housed, values the importance of the environment. It became a major college of interest for me when I heard it was a sustainable campus. My interactions with the transfer staff and administration have been very pleasant and they were able to quickly solve my problems."
Sophomore,4,"I have enjoyed Appalachian.  It's a university but has a small campus feel.  It is centrally located in Boone, so it's easy to as I don't drive.  The professors are really good about meeting after class and making a personal connection with their students.   There are plenty of things on campus to visit and experience.  It's never boring."
Junior,4,The academic aspect is phenomenal for a variety of programs and the departments are all very professionally staffed. The student living and campus activities offer a huge variation too.
Alum,4,"I took classes through a distance education cohort. This is the reason I can only rate four out of five stars.  As a participant of a cohort, the selection of professors and classes are predetermined.  As a whole, the professors are knowledgeable and I would recommend them to students if they are available at the main campus."
Junior,4,Appalachian State University is a welcoming and fun school. It has over 150 undergraduate degrees and 70 graduate programs. There's bound to be something that someone would love to major in. There are always events around school and the community to bring students together. The best part of this school is also the beautiful scenery around it. You can see the beautiful mountains right outside your campus dorm or classroom window. If you like a more calm and quiet scence with a ton of great options then this is the school for you.
Freshman,4,The campus is beautiful and the vast majority of staff are always willing to help if you ask for it. My only problem is the outdated residence halls.
Junior,4,"This school is wonderful and I wouldn’t change much about it, It could be more diverse and once the dorms are finished being updated that aspect will be much improved!"
Freshman,4,Appalachian State University is a very nice college to attend.  The people here are so welcoming and nice.  The campus is very beautiful especially when the sun is setting.  Coming to Appalachian State University was a probably one of the best decision I have made.  I have made lifelong friends here and I have enjoyed every time I am able to walk around campus.
Senior,4,"I love this University as a school; the professors are incredible and the material is very thorough.  The location is amazing and the types of people who attend here are all very open minded and thoughtful.  I hate the college as a business though.  It often caters more towards the tourists than students when it comes to things like finances, opportunities, and parking."
Freshman,4,"Watauga residental college, apply to it if you can. Hands down the best way to experience campus. How ever it is pretty far from the academic buildings"
Junior,4,Appalachian state is a stunningly beautifull university located in the Appalachian mountains where there are countless things to do and see. The university itself has provided some excellent professors that are concerned with the future of their students instead  of their paychecks.
Freshman,4,There are lots of activities to be involved in at this college. They help you every step of the way if you don't understand something and when you call any office you always get an answer.
Sophomore,4,"After my spending my freshman year at Appalachian State, I can say for certain that there are many good things about this school. The campus itself is easy to get around, the food at the dining halls is very good, there is a lot of outdoorsy stuff to get into in Boone, and for the most part, the professors do know what they are doing and care about the students' success. 
 Of course, there are outliers. During my second semester at App, I had two professors that after being in their classes, had me thinking, ""I could probably teach this class better."" Granted, two out of the many professors I have had so far have been poor, so I would highly recommend using rate my professor during registration."
Sophomore,4,"My first year at Appalachian State University was rocky at first but as the year went along I learned to love the college that I was attending. The social life was great, I have developed many friendships throughout my first year and I'm honestly ready to go back this fall. Not only that but the quality of education is exceptional as well. I had great professors who were to help their students succeed in each of their classes. Also the advising staff at Appalachian State University was helpful when it came to helping students find out which career path to take. I can say I changed my major about three times but my advisors helped out and kept me on a great path to success. I loved my first year at Appalachian State University and I cannot wait to go back."
Graduate Student,4,"Beautiful campus, fun downtown, free public buses that cover everywhere you need to go. Tons of stuff directed at students in town, lots of free things the university offered to students such as the health clinic."
Sophomore,4,"I think Appalachian is great! They seem to try and tend to each student as best they can, and provide tons of resources. The small college town has its pros and cons. I come from a city so adapting to the lack of shopping centers, smaller roadways, and snow was a challenge. I would say the availability of things off campus and things to do for someone who isn't outdoorsy is pretty minimal. The parking is also a hassle as is traffic in general at times. Overall, it is a great school!"
Sophomore,4,I love it here! Awesome community and staff. The school offers so many opportunities for students to get out. I highly recommend attending this institution if you want to change the world!
Freshman,4,"Appalachian State University is a beautiful school. The campus is gorgeous and accessible and is so close to a wonderful downtown area. I have only been here for a year but I've had amazing professors who have inspired me and help me choose what I want to do, and learned so much in an efficient way. Though m ratings for food or dorms aren't that great, its going to be that way at every other college in the state except ASU has such an amazing student life that makes you feel connected to one another and gives you so many opportunities to volunteer, be in nature, and contribute to society in a meaningful way."
Freshman,4,I love Appalachian State because the professors and advisors make sure that you do not fall behind on your studies and are always willing to help. The campus is awesome and there are lots of activities available for you to get involved with. I would recommend to the college to please update the dorm rooms and make sure the heat and air work when they are needed.
Freshman,4,"The people at Appalachian State are incredibly nice. The campus is beautiful, although a fair bit windy in the winter and spring. Every professor I've interacted with has been extremely helpful and a great teacher."
Sophomore,4,"The environment at App State is fantastic. The people are so nice and the professors are willing to help. They want to see you succeed. The weather has been a challenge to get used to. If you do not like the weather just wait five minutes and the weather will change again. Overall, it is a great school!!!"
Sophomore,4,"I love the beautiful campus nestled in the mountains. Appalachian State is in a great town full of activity. However, a lot of the buildings on campus are older and not accessible. There are many buildings that need to be renovated for an accessible design."
Niche User,4,"I am currently applying to grad school at app state, not yet attebnding.  I fimd that the course offerings are not as plentiful as other universities, but the price is significantly lower.  That is great for me on a tight budget trying to advance my education and ultimately my career.  Also, the fact that many of the programs are online is huge in helping me reach my goals.  I can't really travel to school on a regular basis due to my familial committment.  Great for me as a single mom with limited funds and resources."
Sophomore,4,"Love the feel of the college town of Boone and just being on a family-like all around outdoorsy campus. The only thing that gets old is all the snow and strong piercing winds that accompanies winter and into spring, if it is above 40 degrees you'll probably see some sporting shorts because that is considered ""decent"" weather. Football Season is a must go-to here on this campus, basically the pride and joy of the University and the whole town of Boone (Go Neers!). Student life is fun here and even though it is a considered a big campus, everywhere you go, you will see and be greeted with a familiar face."
Niche User,4,"In looking for colleges to apply to, I was looking at the one my sister will be graduating from. I have been to the Appalachian Mountains to visit her at school multiple times before and have taken in all the sights and listened to her talk about how school was going for her."
Freshman,4,"I love the location of Appalachian State's campus, as well as the welcoming atmosphere created by the staff and students. Transitioning from high school to a university can be daunting, especially when you move four-five hours away from your hometown, but the vibe of this campus creates a feeling a home away from home and is always nothing short of wonderful."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at ASU thus far has been excellent! Boone is a great college town. On game days especially, one can really feel the “mountaineer pride”."
Junior,4,"App state is a really good school, especially for the cost of attendance. As a business major I have found the resources, and effort put in by the faculty and staff have made a significant impact on my personal, and professional development. Despite some rather below average dining hall food, and dorms, the rest of the campus more than makes up for it with beautiful locations, and a super dedicated group of professionals who care more about the students than the research."
Freshman,4,"App State is an excellent university if you like the cold. Barring the weather, the 18,000 students here will all agree that there is something for everyone here- from sports to a cappella to theatre to dance to research to politics, the number of activities on campus just keeps growing. The professors are all very invested and the education for its price is of great quality."
Alum,4,"The experience was great! I was not excited to attend Appalachian State, but after getting to have one on one experience with many professors and experiencing the culture on campus, I loved it. It felt welcoming, and I was able to challenge myself constantly throughout my time. As an alum, I still have great relationships with the university and honors college."
Sophomore,4,It has great academics and amazing people but needs to work on diversity as well as engagement between the student body and the chancellor.
Sophomore,4,"It’s very beautiful and spacious. There’s many organizations and clubs to join, as well as numerous majors and classes to study in."
Freshman,4,I really like the school as a whole. There is a lot of things to do and many ways to get involved on campus. The food here decnent but there aren’t that many options. The walks to and from classes are relatively short and you can get across campus from anywhere no more than 20 minutes. I am a freshmen and I am very excited about the next four years!  The professors also want you to have a personal relationship with each student which I find very comforting and resourceful. Overall I love this school for everything that’s here!
Junior,4,Its a beautiful campus with a very caring community. However traffic is a nightmare and the surrounding town offers little in the way of entertainment.
Junior,4,"I love the fresh air and all the activities available. The town is adorable and fun to walk around. I have had both negative and positive experiences with professors but most were good. My freshman year was very difficult as I felt I did not fit in, but it got better once I declared my major and found cool people I could relate to. Overall App is a good school and in my experience inclusive."
Sophomore,4,"Appalachian state University is located in the mountains.  It is a beautiful environment. The dorm I was living in was located right next to a lovely park which had lots of benches you could sit on and take in the beautiful scenery.  
I also loved the classes.  Some of them were more difficult than others, but I can honestly say I learned something in each one. 
The dorms were nice; you did have a roommate, but that's to be expected.  I liked how accepting the Appalachian community was.  Neither race, religion, gender, nor sexual orientation mattered. Everyone was very nice.  
Campus food is one of the few things i would criticize.  Most of it wasn't too bad, and some of it was really awesome, but it was all more costly than what you could get off campus.  And as freshmen are required to be on a meal plan, that meant spending more money than I would have otherwise needed to."
Senior,4,"I thoroughly have enjoyed my experience at Appalachian State University.  Most professors are friendly and in my experience quite knowledgeable about their area of expertise.  Vibrant student life on campus with hundreds of extracurricular organizations and clubs ranging from archery to civic engagement.  The general opinion is that there is something left to be desired of the food, but I personally haven't had much of an issue with it.  Some dorms are more spruced up and renovated than others.  Lack of diversity deprives students of valuable learning experiences -- although this is something that the university has been trying to improve for the past couple of years."
Senior,2,Overcrowded and way more interested in adding students than caring for the ones they already have. Chemistry and Physic's programs are a joke.
Junior,2,"The experience is very cold and majority of the year I do not like to leave the house due to the conditions of the weather. But in the summer it is beautiful and feels great, I'm just never there for the summer. If you like the snow and cold then it's the place for you. The views are beautiful and highly recommended."
Freshman,2,"School is great, loved everything but housing. Beautiful campus and lots to do. Food is pretty yummy. Lots of school spirit. 

However: If you are disabled don't go here. Housing doesn't want to work with you. Spent my only month here practically miserable."
Niche User,2,The administration has done very little to help/assist/guide me during the application process. They keep talking about how great their school is and how badly they want to bring people in but they’re slowly pushing me away more and more.
Senior,2,"If you are a non-traditional student it is a very difficult school to navigate. I was in the Psychology department and became just a face in very large classes. Appalachian also milks your money by making up all kinds of excuses not to accept many transfer credits. If you are in high school, want to live in the mountains and don't mind bitter cold winters, then the school is great. If you like the party scene, the school is great too. But if you are a transfer student, I would look elsewhere."
Recent Alumnus,2,"My particular field with film, writing and Spanish is simply a very unique field, and it is quite difficult to ascertain a legitimate career out of a degree in these fields. That being said, it is quite difficult to find the means to get the necessary experience for my future, intended career without getting very creative and collaborating with my professors. There are career fairs for each semester of school, but none of the businesses that attend the career fair attend for any organization that would represent my interests."
College Junior,2,"I honestly don't know anything about Greek life.  I didn't join a fraternity nor did I care to.  In my opinion I believe its a waste of time and money to just meet people, when you can get involved on campus and meet those same people who have the same interests as you."
College Sophomore,2,I think the things they do are terrible.
College Freshman,2,I had one bad experience but other than that okay
College Freshman,2,One of my friends was sexually assaulted and her complaint wasn't even acknowledge until a semester later.
College Senior,2,None of the sororitys have a house due to local rules
College Sophomore,2,It's hard to get the help you need.
College Junior,2,"It's not the worst school, but it is a very poor representation of what a place of higher learning should be. Most of the teachers are middle class white red-neck type that are decently educated but always have the same point of view. The lack of diversity really killed the experience for me. It was a constant source of frustration. Aside from the lack of diversity, I was a chemistry major, and as state previously on this website, the chem department here is an absolute joke. I am transferring to NC State and never looking back. 

This school may still be a valid choice for non-science majors, but when your in a state like North Carolina you should probably just go with NC State, UNC, or even UNCW. All of those are much more well rounded schools."
College Sophomore,2,"Horrible weather, and I wish I had chosen a harder school/a school with a better reputation. I don't like the town and I feel like there's nothing to do there."
College Junior,2,VERY VERY CONFUSING. I constantly receive messaging I have unsatisfied requirements went I sent them in already it's just a headache.
College Freshman,2,Our health services are absolutely ridiculous. No one knows what they are talking about and give wrong diagnosis all the time.
College Freshman,2,Very few scholarships and financial aid is a nightmare
College Freshman,2,It took forever for it to actually go through and after spending all that time I didn't get any financial aid.
College Senior,2,"The system is very unorganized, the financial aid staff often have mis-matched data, and they are impossible to reach.  You are not allowed to speak with a financial aid counselor on the phone when you call even if they are available - you have to leave a message and you will be called back or you can wait in the office during their limited office hours.  Advice would be to start as early as possible to give them time to work out all of the kinks in their paperwork system."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is getting bigger at Appalachian and I am not a huge fan of it. Too basic.
College Sophomore,2,"Considering how many students get caught with alcohol and drug charges, I don't feel like the options available help any of the students. Police in this town are outrageous and I personally feel like they're out to fine all of us college students."
College Sophomore,2,"My father makes too much money for us to receive financial aid, but not enough to pay for school (especially for four kids). I had to take out loans that I will be paying for for a long time, and I got zero scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,"Not enough options for those who want to eat healthy or are vegetarian, and the last few years, our school has increased very much in size, making it very difficult to find somewhere around lunch time (11-12ish) to eat fast, or even to find somewhere to sit down and eat. Prices are crazy expensive. Definitely not 10 dollars a day. I'm down to 70 dollars and I still have a month left of school. Two weeks worth of groceries=one day at on campus."
College Sophomore,2,Nothing really has flavor unless its from Mcalisters or Chickfila
College Freshman,2,"I like choosing my own friends for their qualities, not for their letters."
College Freshman,2,"I did not get financial aid and I need it, it is going to be difficult for my family without aid next year. I have applied for scholarship after scholarship but nothing. I am active in student government, and I'm a video reporter for the student paper l, plus on the Dean's list my first semester."
College Sophomore,2,"High cost, low availability in proximity to campus"
College Freshman,2,"Cramped dorms, especially those on the west side of campus. Most dorms don't have carpet and a few don't even have A/C."
College Freshman,2,Lots of sexual assults on and around campus. Doesn't make for a safe feeling when walking to class.
College Junior,2,Difficult to navigate the system at times
College Freshman,2,"I applied for financial aid and got none, same goes with scholarships and it was very frustrating for me and my parents."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not many options, and most places close before 8-9 pm on King Street."
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, the school is not very diverse. Most students come from North Carolina and from a common class level, but we do have a great variety of religious beliefs in this school."
College Senior,2,The school has mainly white students from diverse backgrounds.
College Senior,2,Housing is terrible at enforcing rules and the process of getting people to follow them is so long that by the time they are actually fined it's the end of the school year already.
College Senior,2,A lot of students drink at this school.
College Student,2,"There are very limited spaces if you don't pay, and enforcement is strict. Walking or the bus is the best option."
College Sophomore,2,"So really, unless it is after 5 or 7 depending on the lot, there is NO place to park on campus. Even if you want to buy a parking pass, there is Stadium Lot (hella expensive), and that is the ONLY lot (for all students who are interested!) that is even remotely close to anything! Now Appalcarts are saviors, because most people just ride those. The other lot close to campus is Greenwood, but you take an Appalcart. Statefarm Lot? No one uses it except to store your car until you go home for breaks.

I'll cut some slack though, there's only so much space for App to expand, and I'd rather have extra dorms and facilities, but parking is just terrible... Tons of free space after 5 though! (Unless you want the library parking lot, in which case, forget it)."
College Sophomore,2,"It is expensive to park on campus during the day with a pass. In the evenings and weekends you can for free but you have to find a spot. You can never get away with parking without a pass without being towed or ticketed. Off of campus, it can be hard to find spots for longer periods of time."
College Junior,2,"The weather can be really good sometimes, but the winter months suck."
College Freshman,2,"The heath services here is very basic. If you are very sick, you should seek help at the urgent care instead. Safe Ride is a service provided to students to get around campus safely, however they are very bad at answering the phone."
College Freshman,2,The weather here changes constantly. It could be shorts weather on Saturday and turn into snow and in the 20's and freezing by Thursday. The wind gets really really bad.
College Freshman,2,"There is not really any diversity on campus and it's really sad when you don't have any variation. The university is very accepting, there is just no diversity."
College Freshman,2,"It is a little difficult to have fun when underage. There is a very strict no alcohol on campus rule, and RA's WILL call the police if you come in intoxicated. Transportation to off-campus parties, which they all are, is very easy but not free. It is still cheap, usually two dollars per person each way, and transportation is always available through the app state beeper facebook page."
College Freshman,2,I don't really like the greek life here because most of them are rude
College Freshman,2,weed is a huge things around here.  really the only drug you hear about
College Freshman,2,"As far as I know, the best parties happen far off campus. Parties meaning small to medium get-togethers. Clubbing is limited to one location on campus called Char, which is a restaurant during the day, and takes anyone 18+. I think you have to travel pretty far to find actual night clubs when you're in this area. We have a large system of Beepers (payed students who are willing to drive you just about anywhere for the right amount) and they also have a facebook page that is really helpful for getting back on campus. I don't think a lot of the students here come to App for the nightlife, and that's one reason why it may seem lacking. There is always someone throwing a party though- it's just all about finding a ride. Also, during the summer months, many App students leave and the town of Boone doesn't need 100 clubs for the vacationers who come to the area. People who like to hang out will find other people who like to do that too- there just hasn't been too many ragers that aren't broken up by the cops within an hour."
College Freshman,2,"Alright, so I suppose you could say this is one of the major problems Appalachian State has faced. We are not only in North Carolina, but we are in the mountains. And historically, not much diversity besides Irish immigrants settled in this part of the country. I only notice it sometimes; because my high school in Florida was very diverse. But for the most part, diversity is something App is working on. When it does come to diversity acceptance at school, there is no problem. You're always going to have one or two people who have been brainwashed with their parents beliefs, but luckily I haven't ran into those kinds of people yet. This goes with politics, religion, and sexual orientation too. I don't think it would be a stretch to say the ideals of people in the surrounding area of Boone (i.e off campus) are not as liberal as we are. I love being surrounded by people my age, interested in the same things as I am, and for the most part holding the same views. App is an affordable and beautiful place to go to school, and I haven't seen any discrimination of people for their beliefs by other students here"
College Junior,2,"there is no club scene, but a lot of live music"
College Freshman,2,"The housing options are usually very small, and the ones on West campus tend to be much older. The worst part about the housing is that it is very difficult to secure a spot as an upperclassman, and housing off campus is very expensive."
College Junior,2,Needs more parking places.  There should be free parking for the weekends when family and friends visit.  There should also be a visitor parking lot or lots.
College Freshman,2,"In order to park on campus, students must purchase a parking pass that costs a ridiculous amount of money. So it is usually best just to walk."
College Sophomore,2,"The process is slow, stressful and usually you only receive loans which most people do not want. "
College Freshman,2,"The weather changes from hour to hour. It goes from snowing, to being very hot."
College Freshman,2,The cost is very high and the parking lot is very far away from the campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Our public bus transportation, AppalCart, is fairly unreliable. Oftentimes it's late for pick up or will skip stops. It only runs every half hour so if you miss it, you will probably be really late for wherever you're going. We also have Safe Ride which gives students rides on campus between 6pm and 2am so that we don't have to walk alone at night. It's a great idea but is also not always reliable. Sometimes it comes right away but can also take up to 30 minutes for it to arrive. "
College Freshman,2,"As I've stated before, some of the officials who are supposed to regulate underage drinking and drug use have been caught in the act themselves. The policies and rules set in place to prevent drug use and underage drinking are very rarely enforced."
College Freshman,2,"There is pretty much no town without the university here. It's a very small mountain town with very little to do outside of winter activities. And there is one mall, relatively small. There are no recreation centers outside of the university, in fact, the only 2 childcare centers in town are owned by the university and run by students."
College Freshman,2,"Academically the university does a fine job. But given the extreme lack of diversity and lax attitudes of the officials that are supposed to regulate the parties, drugs, and alcohol issues, I think I may have made the wrong choice in schools. "
College Freshman,2,"There are policies, rules and regulations in place to prevent drug use, underage drinking, and to promote an efficient college experience, however, this is not enforced. In fact, on more than one occasion the people delegated to enforce these rules have been caught violating them themselves."
Alum,1,"I studied Recreation Management at Appalachian State. I wanted to be an outdoor leader/guide.  I found this major to be nearly useless.  The one or two classes I found helpful, I could have easily learned from a number of other outdoor educational institutions for much cheaper and at a much higher quality( NOLS, AMGA, OBS) We would spend months planning for a 3 day backpacking trip.  Even before my education at ASU, I feel as if I could have planned a three day backpacking trip in about an hour.  The culmination of all of our hard work was a 5 day trip.  For a program that claims to be a leader in producing outdoor professionals, this is a pretty unimpressive course curriculum.  I am very disappointed in my education from App and I truly regret my decision to attend."
College Junior,1,"Greek life is obnoxious on my campus. The men and women that participate in Greek life are not always, but usually the individuals with the worst personalities on campus."
College Sophomore,1,I was left homeless during a university break because the housing people refused to work with my situation.
College Freshman,1,"Jesus christ. Terrible pricing, very unhealthy food. I don't know how student athletes survive. Meal plans are a joke! Luckily, there is an Earth Fare close to campus."
College Freshman,1,"There are practically zero scholarships available here. Very odd. It varies from department to department but for the most part, you'll have to take out huge loans."
College Sophomore,1,I was unable to get any financial aid.
College Freshman,1,Did not get any financial aid that I thought I deserved.
College Senior,1,"The dining website says they have great vegetarian and vegan options. They have AWFUL options and they never vary. If you're trying to keep kosher, you'll starve. For a school this big it is pretty strange they don't even offer gluten free anything unless you bring your own bread to the sandwich station."
College Senior,1,Financial aid constantly makes mistakes and you have to keep double checking everything they do.
College Sophomore,1,"Majority of the time its either raining, snowing or windy. It can get very annoying."
College Freshman,1,"Everyone smokes weed, you're in the boonies."
College Freshman,1,"This school is very strict about underage drinking and partying. If you are caught, you will get ticketed and possibly arrested."
College Junior,1,THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SPOTS. It is the worst thing ever trying to find parking.  No parking is allowed on campus during the school day unless you are a senior or want to pay an excessive amount per semester to park in the parking deck on Rivers Street.
College Junior,1,I HATE FAFSA!!! And it's almost impossible to get financial aid as a middle class white girl with stable parents with stable jobs. I have only ever received church scholarships.
College Junior,1,"There is not enough parking. Period! You have to get to campus at least 20 minutes before class/ whatever event you are going to in order to find a parking spot. Then, your parking spot will most likely be nowhere near your destination, so save a good 5-10 minutes for just walking. Another parking inconvenience at this school is that everyone has to move their cars to random places on/off campus for game days. I find this to be inappropriate considering that everyone has to buy a pretty pricey year long pass that should allow them to park wherever they want, anytime they want. I love this school, but parking is something that DEFINITELY has to be reevaluated."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is AWFUL. There are only 2 dormitory buildings that allow students to park their cars in the parking lot. No matter where you park, it is $300+ for the semester, even the parking lot that is over a mile away from campus. For people like myself that work night shifts, it is absolutely awful. Either you park on campus and risk a $30 ticket/towing, or you park where you have a pass and risk being alone at night trying to get home.

I had to buy an off-campus parking pass this year, which is even worse. There's no public transportation to or from my parking lot, and they charged me $375 cash only. (COULDN'T EVEN TAKE A CREDIT CARD)

Bottom line. It's absolutely ridiculous."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no parking in Boone in general. Mostly downtown and on campus you have to pay to park, and for a limited time. Parking passes range from 250-850. The meeter maids and campus parking staff are always checking cars to catch someone, and ticket or boot."
College Senior,1,Parking is very limited at Appalachian State and it is very hard to find a spot on campus unless you want to pay to park at the parking deck.
College Sophomore,1,The weather is crazy changing all the time it will go from snowing to raiining to sunny all in a span of a few hours. This makes it hard to dress correctly for the day when you never know what to expect.
College Sophomore,1,"Some students do drugs and whatnot, and they seem to be pretty lenient towards it. As long as you aren't ridiculous about it, like making lots of noise or attracting attention to yourself, it shouldn't be that big of a deal."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek Life seems pretty minimal here, not much going on."
College Freshman,1,"The police suck! Watch out while driving anywhere on campus, especially if you are an out of state student. The police will target out-of-state license plates far more often than N.C. plates."
College Senior,1,"There is little to no parking on campus. On the weekends depending on what side of campus you live on and if there are social events occurring, sometimes you have to drive around for 30 minutes to find a spot. There are places to park, but most of them call for a long walk. During the day you have to have a pass unless you park in the deck and that costs 5 dollars a day."
College Senior,1,"The reason why it is so terrible is that it is costly to get a parking spot, and there is not enough handicapped spots."
College Freshman,1,"Most dorms on the West Side (Coltrane, Gardner, Justice, Eggers, Bowie)are dumps.  The good ones are App Heights, Mountaineer (up a large hill, pretty far from everything) and the best(location wise) is Newland.  Most of the East side has been remodeled recently so they are all pretty good."
College Junior,1,"Lame. I'm tired of house parties, but I'm under 21. From what I hear the bars aren't that great either, so I don't have much to look forward to. Summer is more fun in Boone because although everyone goes home, you can enjoy the outdoors. At school time, main street is dead except for a few talking smokers outside of Boone Saloon, and there isn't much to do or explore. Very repetitive."
College Sophomore,1,There is no parking in Boone at all so parking as a student is impossible unless you are a senior. Football weekends are a nightmare and 20+ cars get towed for each game day. Luckily the town is small so getting around is easy on foot if the weather is okay.
College Junior,1,"There are a few different dining areas available, but the food choices are still very repetitive and just not that interesting.  Plus, it can be hard to find an option that isn't either gross or fried.  There are vegetarian options, which is nice, but they kind of suck, and often still don't seem very healthy -- someone needs to introduce these people to some good tofu recipes, or maybe Indian cuisine.  The ""ethnic"" selections are a joke.  I've only actually seen Mexican and Asian, but they're not very good; the Mexican is okay, but the Asian is horrible.  There's usually ""stir fried"" beef and chicken, both of which are dry and also super sweet.  Yuck.  It's also really hard to find anything that's not loaded with carbs.  I have a medical thing that makes it hard for me to have too much bread, pasta, or rice, and while I know that my issue is not the standard, the sheer amount of carbs that are often the only thing that is available is not healthy for the general population either."
College Freshman,1,"absolutely none what so ever, all white "
College Freshman,1,it sucks. the dorms are s***. they smell like s***
College Sophomore,1,"The parking at school is a nightmare. As a freshman, it's awful trying to get to your car. It costs a fair amount of money and when they are out, they are out. Other people sell parking passes but they can get pretty expensive. It is also terrible at football games. Appalachian State needs a lot more parking. Tickets are given out constantly."
College Sophomore,1,"Freshman have to walk over a mile to the parking spot, and if you leave your car on campus for more than a few minutes you will get a ticket."
College Sophomore,1,Not Much to Chose from – Parking on campus is very limited! You have only a few places you can park without getting a ticket. The campus and everything about the school is awesome but this is its biggest downfall.
College Sophomore,1,"One Word: TERRIBLE – On-campus parking is extremely expensive and limited, and not available to freshmen anyway. Freshmen have to park a mile and a half away from campus and take a shuttle back. Parking in Boone is also pretty much non-existent. Enforcement is strict. On-campus, you may be ticketed or booted. In town, they'll tow your car away without hesitation."
College Senior,1,"It Sucks – there is very little parking around campus, and what is on campus is very expensive. they tow a lot and boot people all the time."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not the Greatest – Off-Campus Housing is quite a battle, they're expensive many of the landlords aren't that great. You have to put a lot of research into the options giving before making that transition, I waited four year and am finally happy with the choice I've made. my previous option turned out to be quite horrible for my friends that decided to sign on with that management company. But a lot of places offer great parking and are close to campus if not the Appalcart route."
College Sophomore,1,Off Campus Nightmare – My sister had to call her brother and be removed from her apartment. The roommate had guys from the football team over and were doing naughty things out in the open.
College Freshman,1,"Ticketing and Fines – Parking is quit a hassle. I have had two friends with thirty dollar paking tickets and one who has been towed twice. It is very inconviniant to have to find free parking. Mostly, free parking is out of the way Monday through Fridays from 7 to 5 in the evening. But at least weekends are entirely free."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is a nightmare.  Students can only park in a few dedicated lots during the week.  Once the weekend starts, almost all lots are open, but it is still hard to get a spot, and when its time for parents to come, its so crowded your family is lucky to even be on a street with their hazards on."
College Freshman,1,Parking Is Intense – It's hard to park anywhere on campus without getting fined for it. Everywhere there are limits to where you can park and most of the time a cop is always out to mark your tires if you stay in that spot too long.

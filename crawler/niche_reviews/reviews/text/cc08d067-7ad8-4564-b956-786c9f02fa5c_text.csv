Sophomore,5,"Swarthmore has a beautiful campus and accomplished faculty who are very welcoming. Many students have a strong sense of justice, and you are encouraged to tailor your career interests to solving world problems."
Alum,5,"Excellent academics; diverse and intellectual student body; disproportionate number of students from my class year went into PhD programs, medicine and law. Don't come here though if your goal is to party and get by on grade inflation."
Alum,5,"stellar academics; student body is diverse, and largely intellectual ; keep in mind that people come here to study though, not party;"
Senior,5,I think that it prepared me for any jobs that I want to apply to. Especially for medical school. Lots of research opportunities with your professors. Also You can get really close to your professors
Sophomore,5,"Swarthmore has some of the best people on earth, seriously. Almost everyone I meet has something unique to share. Students are driven and passionate, but very down to earth and approachable, same with professors. Although the party scene is not massive, there is always something to do that's open to the whole campus and not-exclusive, which I think is very unique. Students do have to be prepared for rigorous academics, but I think most would agree that academics are very rewarding and uncompetitive. At the end of the day, Swarthmore has given me more friends than I ever could have asked for."
Freshman,5,"Swarthmore College is certainly a unique place to be, whether you're looking at its student body or academics. It is a little diverse, certainly not as diverse as I hoped, but then again, Swat is located in a little nook in PA. However, the majority of the students I have met there so far have been quirky in their own unique ways, nearly all of them loving seeing their friends and fellow classmates at Swat so frequently, especially since the campus is not very big. Swatties definitely are a studious bunch, each enjoying their own little niche (or big niche) hobbies. 
Academics at Swat are tough, true to their reputation. However, the professors are very kind and genuinely want the students to learn, despite grades."
Freshman,5,Swarthmore is an excellent small college with outstanding academics. The people are very friendly and it is a welcoming community.
Niche User,5,"Stellar academics, and an intellectual environment that will nurture the mind and the soul. Students are intense, nerdy and quirky."
Freshman,5,"Swarthmore College has a very warm environment with knowledgeable professors who are truly willing to help. Students are unique and intelligent in all sorts of ways. Of course it isn't perfect here, but overall the learning and living experience is wonderful."
Freshman,5,"This school is diverse, highly achieving, inclusive, and a great center for students to learn and grow. The atmosphere is positive and supportive. There are many incredible resources available for students to help guide them through their education and early adulthood."
Freshman,5,"Love the community, the rigor of the courses and accessibility of the faculty. 
This is the type of institution you come to to change your life by changing the world around you."
Alum,5,"Among the best undergrad programs on earth.  The combination of intellectual students, excellent professors, the beautiful campus, and close proximity to Philly is unbeatable.  Attending this college really feels like you're going to Hogwarts.  Don't get me wrong - this is a rigorous school that will test you at every level, but comparably to other famously rigorous schools you'll likely have a lot more fun and it's 100% worth it.  The undergraduate education that you get here (if you do it right and take interesting classes that fulfill your requirements) is highly multidisciplinary and truly prepares you to think about any subject deeply.  The Quaker tradition, the history of this school, and the culture of critical thinker/intellectual students makes this a unique and valuable place - and one of the best educations around."
Alum,5,"First rate small school, intensely focused on academics.  Gorgeous woodsy campus.  Classmates are almost all very high achievers - won't find slackers here.  Was life changing experience for me and many of my classmates say the same.  One classmate transferred out to Princeton because the work at Swarthmore was too hard. .. ."
Alum,5,"I liked the close relationships I was able to develop with professors. At a small school, I got to know a lot of the students, faculty and staff which made my experience most enjoyable."
Niche User,5,"Swarthmore has always been portrayed to me as a heaven for the intellecutal types and those that love to learn. Uptown Swarthmore has limited options for going out, limited to Hobbs, the coffee shop and Renato's, however the train station provides transportation to and from many different areas and that allows students to go out more."
Freshman,5,"Swarthmore is a truly unique place filled with the kindest, most interesting people you will ever meet."
Sophomore,5,"Academics are intense, professors are world-class and almost always available. Great school to attend if you plan on pursuing graduate studies of any kind. Best feature is the quality of your peers. Everyone is interesting and insanely smart or talented in their own, unique way."
Freshman,5,"The College is great! It is academically challenging , but very rewarding. I would receopmend it to any ambitious high schooler. Esspcially those who like STEM and the liberal arts."
Junior,5,"Swarthmore is a hard nut to crack. The students are not one way or another; they all come from different backgrounds, each with different experiences. But they do have one trait that is common among them: they like to think! And not just about the everyday questions that we come across in daily life; we like to think about why things are the way they are, even to the point that we're sick of thinking about them, and the campus supports this 100%. Swarthmore College truly is a unique place, and if you take the time to appreciate it, and are a genuinely ""thoughtful"" person, you will fall in love the same way that I did."
Freshman,5,Come here if you are serious about learning. The academics really aren't as crazy as you might be led to believe.
Freshman,5,"One semester into Swarthmore and I feel as if I am a completely different person. I have just grown so much here and been forced to think in ways that are much different than the ways high school necessitated from me. I discovered that I am actually more of an extrovert and less of an introvert; This epiphany dawned upon me after the realization that I could, at Swarthmore, engage in deep and lengthy conversations with other students. While individual achievement was emphasized at my High School, I've managed to develop new networking skills with the principle of never working alone and achieving together. Another thing that stands out about my experience at Swarthmore is that I haven't had the chance yet to operate once again under a cynical mindset, everybody is so nice here. I've learned to trust people again!"
Senior,5,"My biggest risk ever taken was the decision to leave my hometown of Snellville and attend Swarthmore College on a generous financial aid package. That was the first time I'd moved to another state, physically left my family for a semester at a time, and survived on my own in a strange place. But after over 3 years, Swat has helped me find knowledge, community, solidarity, my politics and philosophy, new mentors/professors and best friends, and a better sense of myself. I am sure that the connections I forged at Swat will continue to enlighten and support me in the future. I am ineffably glad that I did choose to go to a small liberal arts college in Pennsylvania instead of a university in Georgia over the objection of some family members. I would definitely do Swat again if I could."
College Freshman,5,"Swarthmore looks after each and every student and makes sure all needs are catered to. The atmosphere is warm, liberal and just amazing."
College Freshman,5,Swarthmore is very active about spreading awareness about Sexual assault. Consent is very important here and students can feel safe and free.
College Freshman,5,"I've been here two weeks and I already feel at home. The people are amazing, the campus is wonderful and the college makes sure that students are happy and looked after."
Recent Alumnus,5,I am not afraid or worried about getting a job or attending an internship. Swarthmore has an incredible alumni network for students to use and shadow other alumni.
College Senior,5,It's what I came for. Has not disappointed.
College Senior,5,The academic experience is the best part of swarthmore.
College Senior,5,Students have been very successful post-graduation.
College Senior,5,"I have grown so much as a person at this school, in part because the campus climate is so wonderful and partly because there are plenty of opportunities to get involved on campus."
College Sophomore,5,Even those who complain about the workload admit that they really love Swat and wouldn't want to be anywhere else.
College Sophomore,5,"I chose Swarthmore over a larger research institution, and it's one of the best choices I've made. While Swarthmore's name might not be as widely known outside of academia, the academic atmosphere is excellent. The spirit of collaboration is well and alive in the student body and provides a refreshing alternative to stories of fierce competition between students in the sciences."
College Junior,5,"One of the highest med school acceptance rates in the country and Fulbright winners.  This school is academically very rigorous, and employers know and are attracted to that."
College Junior,5,Professors are experts in their field.  They push their students hard but it results in intense learning and intellectual growth. Class sizes are extremely small.  The seminars at this school are amazing.
College Junior,5,Housing is a blast.  It's a big part of the campus social scene; hanging with friends late into the night.
College Junior,5,Swarthmore is an extremely rigorous academic environment.  I have learned so much here and it has played a major role in developing my intellect and professional life.  I am getting my medical research from last summer published.  I would not have been able to do that if it weren't for Swarthmore.  Attending Swarthmore opens the doors to accomplish anything.
College Freshman,5,There is a lot of diversity in terms of residential and economic background as well as sexual orientation.
College Freshman,5,"The workload is intense, but there's so much support available to me that I do not feel too stressed out."
College Freshman,5,Swarthmore does a good job of matching students with the right fit of internships and externships.
College Freshman,5,The academics here is awesome. Very intense but manageable with the support of professors and SAMs (student academic mentors)
College Freshman,5,"I've had an amazing experience here. The professors are extremely approachable, the classes are challenging and thought provoking, the students are very passionate and come from diverse backgrounds, and the campus is serene and beautiful. I love how Swarthmore has the good characteristics of a liberal arts college (small class sizes, tight knit community, close relationship between professors and students etc.), while the problems often associated with liberal arts colleges (limited number of courses, stress from being in a small community etc.) are resolved through the consortium with Bryn Mawr and Haverford, as well as Swarthmore's proximity to University of Pennsylvania."
College Sophomore,5,"Swarthmore was the best decision of my life. I've met people and had experiences here that changed my life, and for that I'm incredibly grateful. I love that students and faculty are refreshingly genuine and passionate. However, be warned, the academics are overwhelming. Swarthmore is consistently ranked as one of the most academically rigorous undergraduate institutions in the country and this is mentally demanding on students. One thing is for sure, Swarthmore is not easy."
College Freshman,5,"This school is absolutely amazing. The balance of challenging academics and mellow and intimate social scene creates a perfect college experience. You will meet the most amazing people, teachers, and other faculty here and experience memories in and out of the classroom every day"
College Sophomore,5,I love Swarthmore's atmosphere and the students that go there. Everyone is so intellectual and open-minded about everything. There is a greater sense of fulfillment and happiness that is achieved just by sitting in your dorm room and chatting with friends about anything. It is a perfect blend of rigorous academics and social learning that can prepare you for life's challenges.
College Junior,5,I love this school a lot.
Recent Alumnus,5,I loved it and am very grateful.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I found a job easily after graduating, and networking with an alumni got me another job offer."
Recent Alumnus,5,I received a full ride to Swat.  It was great.
College Junior,5,"Our engineering department is pretty graduate school focused, but as that's the path I want to take, I think I'm going to be extremely prepared."
College Freshman,5,"I live in Wharton with a lot of other freshman, and my room is pretty nice. I only have one roommate, and we have plenty of space for both of us. There is a kitchen in the basement of the building if you want to do some baking/cooking, and bathrooms are kept clean by the EVS techs."
College Freshman,5,"Just installed blue lights, pubsafe is always on duty, and they always answer the phone. We're always informed of local issues through email as well."
College Freshman,5,"Only 5 minutes from center-campus and right next to the train station, the Ville is home to pizza and Chinese restaurants, a cafe, barber shops, a grocery store, and a joint Dunkin Donuts-Baskin Robbins. It does take about 25 minutes to get to philly by train, but it only costs 12$ round-trip. Also, about 15 minutes walking-distance away is the Springfield Mall, where there is a Macy's and a spacious two-story Target. Its local attractions and closeness to a city are pretty unbeaten among other small colleges, and stack pretty well against the average university."
College Freshman,5,"It's pretty safe here, but I wish the nature could be a little less dark at night--it's more unsettling than scary."
College Freshman,5,"Biology is pretty big here, and it's generally accepted as our strongest major. The biology classes, especially Bio 1 in freshman year, force you to think critically, and often assume most students have a solid high school understanding of biology. Our facilities for biology are great, boasting a laboratory building that is strictly meant for biology. Unfortunately, research with professors in the biology department is limited and competitive, so many majors do research in chemistry or biochemistry, or do research off-campus. Almost all research is done during breaks."
College Freshman,5,"The academics here are truly top-notch, rigorous enough even for valedictorians to notice the thought and preparation needed in studying for a test and writing a problem set. Some professors can get lazy and be overall boring and disorganized, but such is a sizable minority of professors at any top college. The average Swarthmore professor is very wise and can clearly explain complex concepts. The workload is tough mainly due to the school's resistance to offering easy courses. Electives are generally difficult (not ""joke"" classes), and introductory courses, except Introduction to Education, are likely to pose challenges, even if you learned all the major concepts beforehand. Success with the workload requires a lot of self-determination and time management skills, but by all means, is certainly doable. The workload is more quantity-based than flat-out difficult, except for some upper level math and science courses with some very hard-to-grasp concepts. While we are pretty renowned for Bio, PoliSci, and Econ, you should consider this place if you are an engineer, as we rank #11 in engineering among schools where a bachelor's is the highest degree offered, losing out mainly to hard-tech schools. On top of that, we rock in all the standard liberal arts departments."
College Sophomore,5,"Professors truly care about the students, and the time I spent in the office hours were the best times."
College Freshman,5,Great wireless and there are desktops in almost every dorm.
College Freshman,5,Cant really get more diverse.
College Freshman,5,"Cold winter, hot summer, temperate fall and spring, typical mid-atlantic weather."
College Freshman,5,"The Campus Police are always courteous and are definitely not ""out to get you."" They're there to make sure everyone is safe. "
Sophomore,4,Most class discussions transitioned seamlessly to online meetings because of the endeavors of the faculty and commitment of the students.
Freshman,4,Online classes are pretty good. It was a little rocky in the beginning but once everybody was acclimated things got easier and smoother for everybody.
Niche User,4,"This parent was impressed by Swarthmore's academic and intellectual environment.   Sadly, Pub Night  and all fraternity life is gone.  The fraternities threw the best theme parties. The social environment is now dominated by hostile social justice warriors who diverge from the Quaker ideal.   It will be interesting to see how Swat synthesizes fun in 2019-2020.  It will take more than holding candles in the amphitheater to attract work hard - play hard types."
Senior,4,"Great professors who are always very accessible and accommodating, made a lot of good friends, administrators very frustrating and in some cases corrupt (there are some good ones), and internet and printers never work (the last of which is really frustrating after four years)"
Niche User,4,"I visited campus in March. Their campus was beautiful, as was the community. It also has a really cool consortium with Haverford and Bryn Mawr that I would definitely love to take advantage of if I went there."
Sophomore,4,"Swarthmore College offers a great amount of academic opportunities, and has a remarkably beautiful campus. Students are passionate and driven to succeed in a collaborative environment, and will be challenged to think in new ways. The train station on campus makes it easy to travel, as well as explore Philly."
Junior,4,"Swarthmore is a great college, with renowned professors and extremely intelligent and interesting students."
Niche User,4,Swathmore has a great campus. Really vibrant and mature incorporated. The dorms are beautiful and student life seems awesome. Only thing I would change isn't the diversity and food which were the only areas it lacked in.
College Freshman,4,Students are connected with alumni and are exposed to internship and job opportunities from the beginning. The college makes sure each student is prepared for a life after graduation.
College Freshman,4,Dorms are spacious and well-located. Often have large windows with a great view of campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Swarthmore feels like home to me. I didn't expect to find a college where I am so happy and comfortable with. Even though classes are very difficult and the workload is stressful, I have never felt competition between my classmates and everyone is very collaborative. Professors are incredibly helpful and most are very engaging and passionate about what they do."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Public Safety (PubSafe) is always roaming around campus and are extremely friendly, nice to talk to, and comforting to know there are people around to help if anything happens. They are there 24/7 on campus and I feel safe."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Swarthmore is an intense and rigorous school academically, yet incredibly rewarding. You are pushed to your limits in class but you reap the benefits of becoming experts in your field. Socially, the people I've met at Swarthmore have been the most unique, caring, and hardworking people I've ever met in my life. There are a lot of review saying that the Swat social scene is ""Swatkard"" and weird but I found people to be just insanely unique and very quirky, in a good way. Don't be afraid to step outside your comfort zone and get to really really, know people. You'll be surprised at how awesome the students are here."
College Senior,4,"Can be difficult for conservatives, otherwise pretty accepting."
College Senior,4,"Swarthmore has made safety a top priority since the start of its title IX investigation a few years ago. As an RA on campus, I have seen this effort on behalf of the administrators first-hand. It is too soon to tell if the policy changes have worked yet, but the administrators seem to care deeply about confronting the issue."
College Senior,4,"Campus housing is very good in my experience. Some dorms are not great (Dana, Hallowell, PPR) and some are far away (ML, Strath Haven) but are not much farther than dorms at other schools. The newest dorms are fantastic (APDK, Danawell) and most of the old dorms are nice as well (Wharton, Mertz). Willets is also nice for people who like the more lively environment (I don't)"
College Sophomore,4,You can get a good college experience.
College Sophomore,4,"I walk alone late at night on campus frequently and have never felt unsafe. There are shuttles that run to the off-campus dorms, which is convenient and keeps us safe and dry."
College Sophomore,4,There are Swarthmore alums at prestigious institutions everywhere.
College Sophomore,4,"On-campus housing is great for first years, juniors, and seniors. Small halls like those in Wharton, Mary Lyons, Danawell and Mertz typically have great hall life."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a student-athlete is a lot of work but provides a academic balance that other students might have more difficulty getting. Coaches are flexible and know that academics always come first, and professors are willing to work around athletic commitments as long as they're clearly communicated."
College Junior,4,"Robberies never occur here.  I leave my laptop in the library if I leave to get coffee and I never lock my dorm room door.

Sexual assault is a big issue here.  Not because it happens any more than at other colleges but because we are an extremely aware community that makes these issues known.  We are working on this difficult issue and we're doing our work to foster a culture in which it is not likely to happen."
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I personally always felt safe, there were issues and a lot of controversy about support for victims of sexual assaults. In general it is a safe atmosphere and people look out for each other."
Recent Alumnus,4,"They do a good job of balancing keeping the law with not intruding too much. It is not hard to drink on campus without fake ID, and this keeps people from going to Philadelphia to bars. On the other hand they have cracked down more in the last few years, underage people can no longer get booze at college sanctioned parties."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There is one main dining hall, Sharples. There are always choices, plus a big and great salad bar, and wok/ pancake stations. There are bigger rooms and smaller rooms with more privacy, in general it is a fun social scene. There are other places on campus you can use points to buy meals/ coffee/ whatever, but sharples is where most people get most of the food."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are a wide variety dorms with difference social characters, and different plusses and minuses in terms of the physical spaces. In general they are all clean and comfortable, with some lovely and full of character, some new and spiffy, and some that are neither."
Recent Alumnus,4,The campus was very chill and it was dependent on the students to making it feel safe and secure.
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's really nice for on-campus housing.  And everything is so close, coming from a city, so I didn't complain."
College Junior,4,"I'm happy here, but I think I could be happier."
College Junior,4,"I've always felt safe on campus. I never lock my door, leave my laptop out in the library, never had any problems."
College Freshman,4,Easy access to Philadelphia gives students the ability to enjoy city life.
College Freshman,4,Financial aid at Swarthmore is generous compared to other schools.
College Freshman,4,"The party scene is defined by Pub Nite Thursday and some frat party Saturday. There is a large fraction of students who pre-game and party, and students from Haverford and Bryn Mawr often come to our parties. Swarthmore partiers stay on campus to party, unless they go to philly or UPenn. The scene has more drinking than hooking-up, probably for good reason, due to the campus gossip. The parties are fine--some partiers think it's too small, some non-partiers find it too large. You won't get a university party scene here, but there are many people here who actively want to have a fun time, which can really make the difference."
College Sophomore,4,"We are a D3 liberal arts college, there is not much to expect."
College Sophomore,4,"Alice Paul and David Kemp are the two most recent dorms, and have very nice, clean facilities.

Wharton has big rooms, and great hall life, but a disgusting laundry room. 

Willets and Worth are the party dorms, and it has a faint urine smell that is ever-present. The walls are thin, so combined with being a party dorm, it is often that you can hear people having sex."
College Sophomore,4,"There's terms of diversity, there's much less political diversity than the average college. The conservatives are relatively liberal, and the liberals are social justice warriors who assume that all men are rapists."
College Sophomore,4,"Currently, students are pretty unrestricted in terms of using/drinking alcohol. However, the campus police have become more and more strict, and have begun to search rooms and frats for drugs. They are no longer as lenient as they were in the past."
College Sophomore,4,The facilities are easily accessible and available for students to use freely.
College Sophomore,4,"Swarthmore is pretty known for having diversity in thought and interests, though maybe considered not so diverse ethnically."
College Sophomore,4,"The admission program was the set academic admission process. For me personally, it was not abnormal. It was important to have good grades and have made impact on the world."
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy it because of the fantastic professors that had made the experience of learning ever so pleasant and interesting.
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus definitely has its negatives, like mice, but that is true for only few of them. People are generally nice and nice to live with."
College Freshman,4,There is palpable tension between greeks and non-greeks. Swarthmore claims to be a non judgmental community but there are a lot of generalizations regarding fraternity members.
College Freshman,4,"Its quirky and liberal if thats your thing. Not mine, the progressiveness can be too much at times."
College Junior,4,"You are worked hard, but I guess it's all worth it. Professors, curriculum and workload all vary with department. Science majors should expect to do only school work, while social science and humanities majors seem to have a little more flexibility."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a definite drug presence at Swarthmore, but it's mostly just marijuana. There are certainly people who use harder drugs, but it's a niche population and no one ever gets hurt. Alcohol is also quite present and easy to come by, but by no means does everyone drink, and the social scene that doesn't involve drugs and alcohol is strong. For the most part, people are way too busy to get heavily into alcohol and drugs. Public Safety acknowledges that drinking and drug use are going to happen, so they do everything they can to make campus a safe environment for us. As a result of our safety net, visibility is pretty high, but most students are respectful of those who choose not to partake and, for the most part, no one gets hurt."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I studied within the three major divisions; a major in psychology and double minor in biology and English Literature (Social Sciences, Physical Sciences, Humanities respectively).  The only problem I had was that I had spread myself too thin.  I noticed many peers having tremendous relationships with their professors, but I barely knew many of mine as I had little overlap between classes.  Regardless, I felt that I could approach any professor at any time and receive the help I needed.  That was a good feeling."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I received an excellent amount of financial aid, given my circumstances.  I was, however, disappointed that the move towards no loans occurred during my senior year.  Therefore, I only received that benefit for two semesters.  Today, Swarthmore does not include loans in aid packages, which means less debt for students.  There are merit-based scholarships available, too, but I did not receive any."
College Senior,4,"I always feel safe on campus and in the dorms. I walk home late at night, whether from the library or a party, and I never feel unsafe. Despite the campus being an 'open campus,' I have always felt safe because of the town we live in and because most people are respectful in keeping doors shut and in alerting public safety of suspicious people. We do have a lot of high school students from the Ville (town of Swarthmore) that can be annoying and harass students sometimes. This is something that many students have complained about, but there's not much we can do."
College Senior,4,"Diversity defines Swarthmore. It is an institution that prides itself on the myriad of religions, opinions, race, ethnicity, background, sexual orientation, etc. It is really evident on the campus how much the student body values diversity and respects most people. The college, though, is very liberal and conservative beliefs tend to be shut down or not listened to, which is unfortunate. Most students try to be considerate of everyone's economic background, though it is surprising how many upper middle/upper class students attend the school. Many people try and hide their higher economic statuses."
College Senior,4,Swarthmore is not strict at all. Students are generally respected as responsible adults.
College Freshman,4,"Most classes are awesome. The material is fascinating, and the professors are really nice and want to talk to you! I've had a few classes that I wasn't completely happy with because of how they were organized and taught, but they weren't horrible either."
College Freshman,4,I plan on getting an internship this summer. My school does a good job of sharing possible ones to us.
College Freshman,4,"I am just a freshman, so I do not have a ton of experience, but so far I like it. The workload is extremely high, but then the outcomes are very satisfying."
College Freshman,4,I feel like Swarthmore will give me one of the best preparations for life.
College Senior,4,"The honors program is definitely an unique aspect of Swarthmore's academics. I have found the honors program to be an incredibly challenging and rewarding experience and I highly recommend that anyone who comes here gives seminars a shot. The small, intimate class environment as well as the depth of the reading, writing and discussion allows you to really formulate your own, unique world view. You really feel like a scholar! 

The social life here is definitely not like most other schools and, as someone who likes to go out, it's better this way! While we may not have wild ragers 7-nights a week, the two popular going out days (Thursday and Saturday) are more than enough! Thursdays are Pub Nite and, in my opinion, the best night of the week. Basically people sit around tables playing a variety of drinking games and then it eventually devolves into a huge dance party. Saturdays there are usually events at the Fraternities and a couple of dance parties. What is nice about the Swarthmore social scene is that the administration, RAs and Public Safety do not bother students at all unless they are very sick or are causing trouble. People are free to have get togethers in their rooms, or even in the lounge, as long as they are being respectful and most of the time they are. This freedom is really nice and prevents people from getting into dangerous situations by trying to avoid getting help if there is a bad situation. 

Campus life in general has varied events and lectures that students are free to go to if they so please. There is always a nice variety of lectures, art exhibits and student-run events so one should never feel bored, even if you don't like going out at night. On Fridays, there is also usually a music show in Olde Club, a small music venue on campus. They usually get indie performers from all over the country to come in and perform which is pretty cool."
College Senior,4,"The weather here is typical of any place in the Mid-Atlantic. We have four seasons and it ranges from being very hot in the summer to pretty cold in the winter. Classes are almost never cancelled on account of snow because all the dorms are close to the academic buildings and most professors live right in the town. In the Spring, Swarthmore is one of my favorite places to be. Besides the ridiculous allergies I get by virtue of living on an arboretum with every type of pollen in existence, the campus is so beautiful and you will often find students reading and sunbathing out on Parrish Beach."
College Freshman,4,"It's no secret that Swarthmore is a small school, but many people would be surprised by the diversity of majors that it offers.  Additionally, if Swarthmore DOESN'T have what you are looking for, you are free to take classes at Brynn Mawr College, Haverford Collge, or the University of Pennsylvania for major credit.  Transportation is provided between the schools.  The vast majority of students will not have trouble finding classes for their major."
College Senior,4,"Racially Diverse and Leftist – This is the most culturally/racially diverse I've ever experienced at school; you can look up the exact figures at Swarthmore's website. Some of my best friends are from international schools or across the country; you can find all sorts of people here.
However, the majority of students tend to be from mild to wild liberal and left-leaning. There are conservatives here, but they tend to be in the minority."
Alum,2,"Really a beautiful campus and a wonderful education. I met some of my best friends here and had a wonderful time playing the sport that I loved.

But the students here are bananas. The campus is full of liberal lunatics who are absolutely clueless on how to act or how to change the world. I thought I was pretty liberal, but I am accepting, and there is no way to reason with them, no way to get through to them. They pretend to be accepting of all but are absolutely ignorant towards anyone who doesn't agree with them. If you have an ounce of privilege, you will be marginalized here.

I don't fully regret my decision to go to Swat, but if you have any sense of privilege or any sense of normalcy, you can do better. I promise. The administration and athletics department are great. The classes and professors are good. The campus is nuts, not worth the other positives. I'm an alumni, I probably won't hire you if Swarthmore is on your resume, there is too much potential for baggage."
College Freshman,2,"Not too prevalent on campus, although most parties are at the frats."
Recent Alumnus,2,"For anyone who is looking for a college with a great Greek life, SWARTHMORE IS NOT FOR YOU. Greek life here is a joke."
College Freshman,2,So many underage students drink and/or try marijuana. It's very present.
College Junior,2,"Most of our teams aren't great, but athletes definitely have a presence in campus culture."
College Sophomore,2,There are only three sub-par places to party at. The parties are often small and not conducive to hooking up.
College Freshman,2,"The library and athletic center are outdated, the new Matchbox building should be a great addition to the athletic facilities though."
College Freshman,2,"Phenotypically speaking people are different. However, we hear the same damn annoying voices speaking up and crying about the same damn thing. Most people here are liberal and if you don't fit that, don't come if you don't like being attacked. IRONY!"
College Freshman,2,"Strictly average.  There is only one dining hall on campus and a couple cafes scattered about.  Many students complain about the low quality of food, but I've never found it particularly subpar.  The isn't a great deal of variety though.  My biggest complaint is that there are NO places on campus to get food at night."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Very Little of Interest Within Walking Distance – Unless you have a car, there are very few options available to students.  The town of Swarthmore has a few small byobs that are OK (it is a dry town), a pizza place and chinese restaurant.  On the opposite side of campus, there are some chain restaurants at the mall that service alcohol.  If you have a car, the town of media is a 10 minute drive away, and offers tons of fun dining options that are great for a night out."
College Junior,2,"Small, Not Much There – Swarthmore (usually called the ville) is very small. There isn't much else except a good pizza place, a terrible Chinese place, and a Dunkin' Donuts. It is safe to walk around in, and the residents are kind. There is also a convenient train station to ride into Philly just at the edge of campus."
College Junior,2,"Only Two Frats, No Sororities – There are only to fraternities on campus, and they hold open parties so all students can attend. More than half of the campus parties are thrown in the two fraternity buildings. There are no sororities, although students have gotten an okay from the administration and are currently trying to create one. About 10 percent of males participate in fraternities. They don't influence campus life in a large way, but they provide much of the social life on the weekends."
College Junior,2,"Not Much Selection – There are good looking people at Swarthmore, but they are not very common. The school is small so there isn't a large selection. Also, if you hook up frequently, everyone will know and you will likely acquire a negative reputation."
College Freshman,2,"Swarthmore has one and a half frats, one official, one not, and the parties they throw are open to the whole campus. Swarthmore honestly doesn't really have Greek life in the traditional sense of the term."
College Freshman,2,The percentage of students on campus is relatively low since the majority of students live within a mile of campus. It's convenient to be able to walk everywhere in less than 25 minutes (and it only takes this long is you get oh so lucky to live in Mary Lyons). For those who still feel the need to bring a car have fun with the people that administer the parking permits. You have to give a REALLY REALLY REALLY good reason that you need to park on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"I thought that coming from New York I would have no problem with the weather at Swarthmore, but it is REALLY COLD! I still can't get used to it. Now that I live off campus, it will be even more difficult to get to campus. Since the shuttle is so unreliable, I usually have to walk to class. This is a really difficult and agonizing thing to do in the bitter cold, and it will be even worse when the sidewalks start getting icy. Even when it rains I can hardly get to school without getting soaked to my knees since the sidewalks are so uneven and susceptible to flooding."
College Sophomore,2,"Need Work – The academic buildings are great. However, the dorms are really dilapidated and in need of major renovations. Among the dorms I have lived in or visited, all of them have moldy bathrooms, filthy carpets, and generally dusty or dirty atmospheres."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life at Swat is essentially non-existent. The two frats we do have hold parties that are open to everyone and are generally pretty good and fun, but if you're looking for a rampant Greek life in college, you're not going to find it at Swat."
College Freshman,2,The parking spots are given out using a lottery system and even if some of the parking lots are practically empty there are no more parking passes available so it's kind of hard to have a car.
College Junior,2,"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCLZWERgzhc

We got rid of football."
Alum,1,I was constantly harassed and discriminated against based on which student organizations I was apart of. The food is hardly edible and the school requires you have a meal plan if you live on campus. The party scene is basically non existent.
College Junior,1,"Greek life doesn't really make sense at a school like Swarthmore, but the fraternities have a lot of parties. The sorority doesn't have a house."
College Junior,1,"The main reason I hate the meal plan is because you have to pay the same amount regardless of how many meals you get, which is a complete rip off. The food is mediocre at best."
College Sophomore,1,There is only one dining hall that is readily available to the students and virtually no other restaurants around.
College Sophomore,1,There are only limited parties available and no bigger options available.
College Freshman,1,sub-par to say the least.
College Freshman,1,"If you do not have a car, the campus can feel very isolating and claustrophobic.  The town of Swarthmore lacks and the Baltimore Pike is a hefty walk."
College Freshman,1,The food selections are limited and the meals are repetitive. Look forward to pasta bar every Wednesday and Saturday night for four years. With one of the country's biggest per capita endowments the food is unacceptable.
College Freshman,1,I feel like Campus Safety is almost an enemy of the student body. They dont work for us but against us. Unwarranted drug busts and absurd party guidelines are evidence of their over-compensation for failed efforts in the past. I.e miss management of sexual harassment
College Sophomore,1,barely edible. pretty much the chefs poop on plates and serve it for dinner
Recent Alumnus,1,"One, Mediocre Dining Hall – There is only one dining hall on campus (Sharples) and it is, at best, mediocre."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Dorms Tend to Be Old and Some Can Be Isolating – In general, the dorms are not very modern or clean.  However, some dorms (specifically ML) are far from the rest of campus and can result in students feeling isolated.  Also, Swarthmore has problems with mice and cockroaches, which the administration often blames on the students.  In the past, there have been issues with privacy violation when the administration attempted to prove that students were the cause of the pest problems."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There are two frats at Swarthmore and no sororities, so there is hardly any Greek life."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I spoke to the financial aid office on multiple occasions and was given information that turned out to be false.  Had the financial aid officers been honest from the start, I likely would not have attended Swarthmore.  As a result of my experiences with them, I have over $150,000 of student loan debt, some of which is through private lenders with interest rates above 10%.  The financial aid officers did not provide me with adequate information about Swarthmore's financial aid process or about student loans in general."
College Junior,1,"Repetitive, Gross – The main dining hall has very little selection. What it has is not normally very tasty, and it closes very early. There is a snack bar with sandwiches open later into the night, but eating there gets very repetitive. By the time you are a sophomore, you will thoroughly hate the food."
College Senior,1,There are no bars in Swarthmore. The free alcohol at the school parties just gives people a disincentive to go to good parties at other schools. You'll see the same people at every single party sticking with their same friends. Lax bros at swat like to pretend to be real athletes but they're posers.
College Freshman,1,"We're Pretty Much Used to Losing – As students, we are not very interested in supporting the teams. We are almost always overloaded with work, so unless someone you really care about is on the team, you won't really go to the matches/games. 
I find student athletes here very admirable because I'm not even on a sports team and I have to try very hard to catch up with classes. Perhaps the teams here are not very good because students athletes are overloaded with work too and they must be very tired."
College Freshman,1,"Two Frats – There are only two fraternities at Swarthmore. They throw some parties and some people decide to pledge, but other than that, the frats at Swat are really quiet. They are not part of the scene at all really."
College Freshman,1,Almost Non-Existent. There is only one off-campus apartment complex and very few Swarthmore students live there.
College Freshman,1,The ville is the only place to really live off campus and it's tiny.

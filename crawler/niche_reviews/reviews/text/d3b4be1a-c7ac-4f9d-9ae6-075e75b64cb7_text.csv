Junior,5,"This long, difficult, strenuous, humbling, soul searching and beautiful road to find the right college was a tiring one. I started out my freshman year of high school with a list of 5 colleges all over the greater massachusettes. Over the next two years, I cut that list in half, then down again to the final two that I would eventually apply to. I never actually visited any of the colleges on the list except for one. Cambridge college sent three representatives to my job and gave us a speech about what cambridge college could offer me. I have never once felt a college would ever do so much for a student, let a lone an average student like myself. Because cambridge college did this, I knew from that day forward that I had found my next home. There was no need to see any more colleges because I had found what I was looking for."

Graduate Student,4,"I love the dedication that the professors and my adviser show me. There is an intimate feel, being it is such a small cohort, and the teachers are passionate about what they teach and do in their counseling careers. I like how a lot of the professors graduated from Cambridge College and are teaching there now, while also pursuing their counseling careers. It gives me hope and excitement to be able to be in that same position some day. The financial aid office can sometimes make mistakes and be hard to get a hold of/ mistakes settled.

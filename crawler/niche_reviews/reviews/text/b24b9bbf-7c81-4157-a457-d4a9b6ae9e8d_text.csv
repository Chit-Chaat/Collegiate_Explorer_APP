Sophomore,5,"Thiel College is the perfect school if you're looking to go into education, business, and neuroscience. There are more majors, but these majors stand out the most because they have at least 100% job placement after graduate school acceptance. The campus is small, which means you'll get to know the campus in no-time. Thiel is a Division III College, so you can still maintain playing a sport and keeping ahead of academics at the same time. This is a great college if you're looking for something smaller."
Senior,5,"Thiel College is a beautiful campus in the quiet town of Greenville. I have been a student here for the past 3 and a half years and have been afforded many opportunities I would not have had at a larger institution. In high school I was hesitant about going to college. I had the grades to, but never really saw myself having the motivation to get a four year degree. Here I am graduating in only seven semesters because of all the support I received from the Thiel College community."
Senior,5,"I've had the best college experience at Thiel.  I feel like I'm met my forever friends, and my connections with faculty and staff are unparalleled.  When people say it really is a ""home"" here, they're not lying. Obviously, it's on me to find a job once I graduate, but Thiel has been helping me my entire college career to prepare me for the next phase in my life."
Senior,5,"For being in a global pandemic, I can't believe how accommodating and helpful my professors are with online learning (when we're online).  Thiel still has most of its classes online, so for the part, I'm still in class."
Alum,5,"Thiel College truly became my home away from home! The small campus allows for a range of opportunities that are more difficult to experience at a larger university. There are so many activities to be involved in and to help expand your resume! The educational and leadership opportunities are essentially endless. The professors are amazing!! You are not just a number at Thiel. They genuinely care about their students and are dedicated to their success. The faculty and staff value the opinions of their students and are eager to listen to students' suggestions. There have been many improvements to campus over the past several years to continuously enhance student success. 

No matter where you choose to attend, college is what you make of it. Thiel provides you with a never-ending supply of opportunities to achieve your educational, athletic, and career goals. Seek out and take advantage of these opportunities because it will make all the difference during your collegiate experience."
Alum,5,I took several classes online at Thiel College. The professors are very helpful with helping to navigate the technology and online resources. I felt that I have gained a strong understanding of the material throughout the duration of the courses.
Alum,5,Did not take any classes on-line - they just started offering them because of the Chinese Virus.   No need in the past - it is a residential campus.
Alum,5,"A life-changing education, both inside and outside the classroom.  Outstanding professors who take the time to know their students and work with them to develop the student's potential.  Easy to get involved in activities and make life-long friendships.  Am one of 17 in my family to go to Thiel and all had great experiences.   Beautiful campus and accessible.  If you are looking for a great education and a place that works with you throughout your four years - and beyond - Thiel is the place to go"
Junior,5,"I love how personable the College is. It is small, everyone knows everyone, i just feel conformable being on campus"
Freshman,5,For me a small campus was necessary for my stability and enjoyment. Thiel is just large enough so I don't have to see the same people everyday but small enough to really know the people around me.
Niche User,5,Fantastic small college that I feel comfortable and at home at. Facility and students are extremely welcoming and very knowledgeable.
Freshman,5,"Thiel is an amazing college! Everyone is so involved and friendly, they make you feel at home! I am definitely going to make Thiel College my top choice!"
Freshman,5,"Thiel College is a great 4 year private institution. Amazing professors, great classes, tutors willing to help you at all times for any class you may be struggling with, somebody on stand by at all time if you're struggling with something going on in you're life and just need somebody to talk to. There's always different activities going on to entertain you and make you feel like you actually belong there."
Sophomore,5,I love the teachers. they are our home away from home. They help us with our grades one by one. the people in office makes us feel like were safe in the thiel community.
Senior,5,"Thiel College, though may be small, is quite mighty. This college is what you make it as a student, therefore my advice to you is to get involved! Once you get your name and face out on Thiel's campus, this college will be giving you so many opportunities, events, and friends."
Freshman,5,"Thiel College has given me the opportunity to discover what major best suits me, and its faculty have been very helpful and encouraging toward me as I have worked to make that decision. Coming into college, I had no idea what major to pursue. Within only a few weeks here at Thiel, however, I had made a rather concrete decision and feel confident now about my choice. The dorms, facilities, classrooms, and study areas are great and are easily accessible. Most of the dorm buildings are very close to the academic buildings, and classrooms are easy to find. Professors are helpful and willing to work with students, and most of them are excited to be teaching and provide effective learning environments. Located in the small town of Greenville, Pennsylvania, Thiel is a small and a rather quiet school, which is part of why I love it and would highly recommend it."
Freshman,5,Thiel College was one of three schools within a few hour radius of me that offered a three one program for mortuary science. I will graduate from Thiel within three years with a business degree and then go to the Pittsburgh Institue of Mortuary Science for my final year.
Alum,5,"I achieve a lot of success attending Thiel College, it was truly a very rewarding academic endeavor."
Freshman,5,Enjoy this college. Was skeptical at first about going to school. Feel very comfortable in this environment. Good class sizes. Professors interested in you as a student and person. I would recommend this college to someone.
Freshman,5,I like meeting new friends on the campus and on the the football team.  I also like the support from the faculty staff for all of my needs. I have meet people in the  community and they have been very inspirational. I was at Walmart and I was asked if I attended Thiel College? I replied yes. Then she told me she had two daughters to graduate from Thiel College and to stay focus on my education. She didn't know me but she gave me positive words to motivate me.
Freshman,5,Thiel college was a peaceful environment. Ive meet several people that I known since middle school. The facility was chilled everyone doing what they do learning growing and developing themselves. Thiel college is a place where you can make new friends and socialize with other and have fun.
Sophomore,5,"My first year at Thiel College was amazing! The school as an whole is just wonderful. I have never met such an caring and connected environment. The people here are so nice and considerate. The professor are just astonishing, from the way they teach to how they go out of their way to make sure your learning needs are being met. The class sizes are so small that not only do the professor know you be first name but so does all of your peers. Everything on campus is great, from academics to student life even sports. I would give this school ten golden stars!"
Freshman,5,"As a transfer student, I was already familiar with different schools and different ways on how this are handled. Thiels admissions made sure of my acceptance as fast as I could get in and did all they could do to help. The professors are more helpful and friendlier. Living on campus has been a great experience for me and everyone is more welcoming and see it as a community and not just about one person. My experience at Thiel has been nothing but greatness."
Freshman,5,Ilove Thiel.  The smallness is the reason so chose this college.  We are all off big family and I recommend this school to everyone
Junior,5,So far so good! I think that this website is very helpful in allowing students to apply for scholarships. 
College Sophomore,5,I love my school and have made many new friends.  The faculty and staff go out of their way to make sure everyone is comfortable where they are.  Class size is relatively small and all of the professors are approachable.
College Sophomore,5,Thiel has a very high success rate for job placement and graduate school acceptance.
College Sophomore,5,Crime is not an issue on campus.  Campus police patrol the campus frequently.  Free transportation is available to anyone on campus that needs it.
College Sophomore,5,I did not enjoy living in the dorm my freshman year so I moved into the frat house.  It is a longer walk to class and for meals but it is quieter than the dorm.
College Sophomore,5,I live in the Kappa Sigma house.  My brothers are my family but I am also friends with many students who do not participate in Greek life.
College Sophomore,5,"Facilities are new and up to date, coaches are approachable and athletes are not on ego trips."
College Sophomore,5,"Students, faculty and staff work together for to bring out the best in the students.  Everyone is willing to help."
College Freshman,5,Greek students are viewed as amazing students that have the best grades.
College Freshman,5,Thiel always show support for their sport teams.
College Freshman,5,The professors are amazing. They want all their students to have success.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus. Public safetly is always driving or walking around.
College Junior,5,"The small classroom sizes make it a lot easier for the professors to actually know you by name which in the long run makes it easier for them to give you one-on-one help if ever needed. Thiel offers so many different types of activities that it is almost impossible not to find something that fits your needs. The majority of the students there are also very accepting to the different groups that are one campus and no one really judges the your choice of organizations to join. The campus is beautiful despite the extremely harsh winters but that is expected. The financial aspect is a little confusing at times but the financial office does really well with helping you find alternatives if you are struggling. Overall, I have not really had anything bad to say about this school. I think the professors really care about the wellbeing of their students and really go above and beyond to help them with anything. It is definitely a place where people need to come ready to learn and work towards a future."
College Sophomore,5,To much partying down campus and frat houses. This should not be allowed. School should be drug alcohol and smoke free
College Freshman,5,The financial aid process was quick and painless.
College Freshman,5,I degree from Thiel will be beneficial in my job field. Receiving a Religion degree from a religious school is really important to me and hopefully employers.
College Freshman,5,Internships are mandatory and I like that. I think my future internships will be very beneficial to my future endeavors.
College Freshman,5,They want to make college a good experience for us.
College Sophomore,5,Academics is a huge part of college. Thiel makes sure everyone has the best experience
College Sophomore,5,The academic programs are very good and provide the best solution for students
College Sophomore,5,I really have enjoyed my time at Thiel and hope people will come here to get the Thiel Commitment
College Sophomore,5,Greek life is a big deal at Thiel. If you do not join it would be the end of the world.  They all are cool and enjoy meeting all people.
College Sophomore,5,"The College provides a ton of majors based on the size.  The application process is simple, and college advisement is supreme."
College Sophomore,5,"The administration is very personable, easy to get a hold of"
College Sophomore,5,The safety and security of Thiel students is top priority
College Sophomore,5,"The campus is so diverse.  We have international students from Korea to China to Japan, Belarus to Pakistan.  The economic background and political beliefs are just about in the same boat as being that if you do not tell people, they will not know.  Thiel is a Lutheran college and we have a chapel on campus but not only does it serve Lutheran services it also holds mass for other denominations too.  Different sexual orientations are accepted on campus.  I mean yes you will always have those few people who do not like people for one reason or another but overall I believe that Thiel is a very accepting college for everything."
College Sophomore,5,"Academics push you to strive to do better, but are not overbearing."
College Sophomore,5,Greek Life is a major component of student life on campus.
College Senior,5,we are great when it comes to school spirit 
College Freshman,5,We got laptops which are included in tuition which are awesome and brand new
College Senior,5,greek life is big here at thiel college
College Freshman,5,There have been no issues here with crime or feeling unsafe
College Sophomore,5,There are many 24-hour computer lab equipped with printers. every dorm building also has a printer. Every student is given a laptop upon enrolling.
College Junior,5,Athletics at Thiel College are awesome. Its a great way of meeting people. I grew up in a town where sports were very big and it still brings our town very close together. I love seeing that at Thiel also!!!
College Senior,5,"Greek life is one of the best aspects of Thiel College. Many students are involved and love it, including me. Whatever Fraternity or Sorority you choose, they help you meet new people and get involved in campus activities. Many Greeks say that Greek life is what has kept them at Thiel because of the friendships they've made."
College Sophomore,5,guys are guys girls are girls not sure what to say
Sophomore,4,"When COVID-19 spread rapidly, it was hard getting comfortable with the new way of learning online. At this time, I was just a freshman in college, so I was still getting used to college life. My classes were all online right after Spring Break of 2020. I personally had a hard time with learning online compared to learning in person, just the idea of online learning is hard because some students may not even look at their assignments/forget about it, and being in person, I personally feel more comfortable being in the presence of the other students and professors. Experiencing in person definitely wins. But Thiel has been keeping an eye out for students who may be in quarantine and they make sure that the students stay on task. Most professors I had at the time, had a hard time using Microsoft Teams or Zoom. As time went on, we all learned how to use these online platforms and to this day, several professors are comfortable enough to have online classes through the semester."
Senior,4,Thiel College really only began offering some online courses due to COVID-19. The few classes that I have had to take remotely went pretty well. I am glad that Thiel is committed to having in-person classes because online learning is difficult.
Senior,4,"Thiel College is not a huge institution but that's one of its best qualities. You are not a number here. You matter from the day you set foot on campus. To the day you're two years into your career. They will always keep up with you. They have the resources of a large institution thought with their own radio station, TV Studio all available on the first day you set foot on campus."
Senior,4,They have adapted well to the current state of the world and have made it seamless as possible when it comes to online instruction
Sophomore,4,It was very smooth transition and helped me make the Deans List. Not too difficult and professors were very helpful.
Sophomore,4,The best part about Thiel College is the size. The college is laid on 135 acres with a student population of about 750 students and although quite small its very comforting to know everyone you see around campus and know all of your professors as well making it very easy to work with them and learn the material better.
Freshman,4,Thiel College is a very personal school that is very interested in your future. The school has a small campus so that mean everyone knows everybody not matter what goes on. So that mean teachers know if your a hard worker and if your a student-athlete your coaches has a very close relation with professors.
Freshman,4,"Thiel is a great school for people who want a small campus. The professors are great and very helpful. If you would like the partying scene maybe Thiel isn't for you. However, it is a beautiful campus and Greenville is a nice little town."
Freshman,4,"Thiel college is an interesting liberal arts school. The professors are motivated to see their students succeed. The resources available for those who need help are diverse, if anything. The writing lab would have to be my favorite. As a campus resident, I eat in the cafeteria. There are good days as well as bad when it comes to food and quality of taste. The meals would be the only I would change about this college."
Senior,4,The professors do their best to get to know their students and help them when they need it. The food is not all that good but it is not truly bad either. The staff do their best to make sure that you complete all the classes that you need to and have every chance to get an internship if you want it.
Alum,4,"A quality liberal arts education provided by a caring and involved faculty.  The small environment allowed us to develop friendships which will last for a lifetime.  A chance to get seriously involved in a variety of extracurricular activities including Student Government, Athletics, Musical organizations, Science Clubs, Greek organizations, Religious activities, etc."
Freshman,4,Thiel College is a good school that focuses on your academics and wants to help you in the future. I am finishing up my first year at Thiel College and I have had a good time and met some great people and friends.
Sophomore,4,What I like about thiel college the most is the small class sizes and how the professor actually engages  in the classroom. I like the small campus because it's easy to get around and you know everyone on campus. I would love to change the dorm rooms on campus and make them more up to date (suite would be lovely). 
College Freshman,4,The school works with you to get an internship or job in your field of study.
College Freshman,4,They  are mostly nice people
College Freshman,4,People get really into the games
College Junior,4,The professors that I have experienced while attending Thiel have all been extremely helpful and knowledgeable. My favorite study spot is anywhere in the library.
College Junior,4,"There are a variety of courses offered. Most of the classes are lecture based, but there are relatively small class sizes. Some general education classes can have upwards of 50 students. However, some of the upper level, major specific classes range from 6-12 students."
College Junior,4,There is a small force specific to campus that constantly patrols and is available for student needs.
College Junior,4,"This was not my first choice for schooling. However, you get out of what you put into the experience. The small campus allows for students to know their professors. I never feel like I'm just a seat number in a class, which is one of the most important aspects for me. The small campus environment also encourages students to get involved in multiple different groups, clubs, and activities. For me, being a part of the Greek life on campus has been one of the best decisions I have ever made."
College Junior,4,I am able to focus on my studies.
College Senior,4,"Thiel is a pretty small school with a population of about 1,200-1,300 students. The overall quality of the education is decent, but I think there is some room for improvement with a number of the academic departments. As an Education major, I feel somewhat prepared for student teaching this year and have learned a lot about best teaching practices. The food is ok, but then again we just hired a new head chef for the cafeteria last year. There are a number of food options in the cafeteria, as long as you aren't a picky eater. My number one takeaway from attending Thiel? Join activities! We have over a dozen clubs, sports teams, and Greek Life organizations. Those who study hard might also get the chance to join honor societies. If you are looking for a small school environment where you can connect with people in times of trouble or to broaden your horizons, I suggest checking out Thiel College."
College Freshman,4,"The college that I attend is a small college and about half the college's student body are athletes, so sports is a very important aspect of this college."
College Freshman,4,"I personally am not much of a party person, however there are a lot good parties that occur on campus."
College Freshman,4,There are a few options to choose when comes to off campus dining.
College Freshman,4,In each hall within a college dormitory there are resident assistants and all of them enforce the rules.
College Freshman,4,The bistro usually has the same menu but as for the cafeteria the menu changes from day to day. When I am in a rush I prefer to go to bistro to get a quick meal. But when I have more time I go to the cafeteria and they always have different variety of foods to choose from.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus has been great, I've gotten the chance to meet a lot of good people and do fun activities. The best about the campus is being in close in proximity to other academic buildings."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is wonderful, everything is within walking distance, and what isn't we have a shuttle, everyone is very kind"
College Sophomore,4,It is always good to get off-campus food sometimes.
College Sophomore,4,"Dorms aren't always the greatest things, but it is the experience I love."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is a dominating force, most of the honor students, most of the class officers, and much of the student population is in Greek life. It's generally a positive atmosphere, other organizations supporting each other and non-Greeks supporting Greeks as well."
College Freshman,4,"The new Pedas Center has much improved the campus technology. Overall though, the technology is average. It's nice that every student gets a laptop, so that everyone is on the same level coming in and has access to a personal laptop."
College Freshman,4,"You have to live on campus unless you live in Greenville, or you have extenuating circumstances. Living on campus is nice because there's almost always stuff going on, I love hanging out in the lobby of Sawhill Hall and doing homework. The dorm buildings are older, but they're not too bad and the heat doesn't always work, but the RA's let us have space heaters. It's kind of pricy, but I don't think I've met anyone who hasn't gotten aid. It's pretty easy to switch room or even halls with someone, especially if you have it already planned out, it just makes the process easier for the people in charge of housing."
College Freshman,4,I have only personally had a few problems where I had to call Public Safety because the smell of weed makes me physically ill.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus, on the upper part is wonderful! You can make your classes in under 5 minutes and everything is right there, living down campus is about a 15 minute walk to your classes."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is big here, but I'm a non-Greek and still manage very well."
College Freshman,4,A nice amount of options for my taste. Pun intended.
College Freshman,4,Probably as good as any other school out there.
College Sophomore,4,The Accounting program is awesome. The professors know what they are talking about and are very helpful.  The programs set you up for the real world.
College Sophomore,4,They are very generous with scholarships
College Sophomore,4,"The campus housing is nice, but I needs some upgrading"
College Sophomore,4,They are different from your usual athletes. Very Nice
College Sophomore,4,There are many different options for food within a good distance
College Sophomore,4,"Most students who do not know much about Greek Life think that people in sororities and fraternities pay for their friends.  This is not true.  Yes, you may pay to be a member but it goes to different types of dues and things like that so many people look down on sororities and fraternities.  Sororities and fraternities play a big part on campus, not only do they house some fun parties but they hold great events to support their philanthropy."
College Sophomore,4,All of the professors are dedicated to helping you succeed in all you do.
College Sophomore,4,All of the professors know you by name and are looking to help you succeed.
College Sophomore,4,They have a lot of international students and have an Organization of Black Collegiates.
College Sophomore,4,"Public Safety may take a while to get to you if you have a minor issue, but if you have a major problem, they will certainly be there."
College Junior,4,Help is always there if needed
College Freshman,4,The programs are very well put together. There are many opportunities to do well. 
College Freshman,4,The academics are great for the location. The professors are very willing to help. 
College Freshman,4,The computers and technology are reliable at most times. 
College Senior,4,people and staff are very friendly
College Senior,4,one will have a great experience if are involved in a sport.
College Freshman,4,Its a large part of Thiel but no one is judged either way 
College Freshman,4,You can have a car but don't need it often finding a friend who has a car.
College Freshman,4,High value in the academics here
College Freshman,4,Great program with good amount of work and many options for help and to move forward
College Freshman,4,Its college and there are always ways to break the rules
Freshman,2,"Thiel is a great college to attend, I like playing football ball for the school. I would like if the college would offer Pell Grants for no resident."
College Junior,2,There is a lot of emphasis on athletics by the administration but not liked by the student body. The current administration had put a considerable amount of money into athletics instead of putting the funding into more student backed projects.
College Sophomore,2,"The college is constantly raising the tuition, which was expensive to begin with, but they don't match any of our scholarships. I feel like if they want to keep raising our tuition, they should increase scholarships too, especially Merit awards."
College Freshman,2,"The shuttle seems to barely work, it seems that people wait for long periods of time, and it also seems that half the time that the shuttle doesn't run. Having a car is very beneficial, or at least having friends with cars."
College Junior,2,Many dorm buildings need to be remodeled.
College Junior,2,The school would rather overlook sexual assault issues than solve them.
College Sophomore,2,mostly everyone lives in some type of campus housing because its too much of a hassle with cost and transportation to make it to class and to even have it worth it to going.
College Sophomore,2,"The town is very small, there are not many things to do.  One of the biggest things to do on campus is to go to the local coffee shop and hang out."
College Sophomore,2,"Thiel College is in the middle of the snow belt so as they say; when it rains, it pours.  The winters are pretty bad but it is just something that you have to suck up and get used too."
College Freshman,2,"The winters can get pretty bad.  Because most of all students live on campus, classes are rarely cancelled which means you must walk through feet of snow."
College Freshman,2,The parties are terrible and usually just end up in people getting into trouble.
College Freshman,2,There is nothing really to do around here. 
College Senior,2,financial aid it not that great do not get that much of money
College Freshman,2,"Be prepared for cold, rain, and snow which is snot the best combination "
College Freshman,2,Parties consist of dance parties and room parties with friends
College Freshman,2,There is literally nothing to do in Greenville but Thiel makes has many events to keep you active.
College Freshman,2,Greek life helps out very little.
College Freshman,2,I am not old enough to drink.
College Freshman,2,The local atmosphere is worn down and out of date.
College Freshman,2,The people are weird and awkward.
Alum,1,Horrible school do not go here. I regret coming here. There is no school spirit because this school loses and underperforms in everything it does. They have no fun activities and shut down any parties you may try to have. The town of Greenville is vacant and dying. The administrators don’t listen to any student requests and choose to treat the student body terribly. The facilities are old and falling apart with plumbing problems. If you need something fixed in your room they will not fix it. Food is terrible and caused a massive virus at the school that made the news. The football team is so bad that a coke commercial made fun of it. And at the end of your four years of terrible conditions they try to tell you that you are ungrateful if you don’t donate to Thiel. Do not go here I wish I hadn’t.
Sophomore,1,"I spent three semesters at Thiel, and it was a terrible decision. My teachers were nice, but hardly qualified, when I transferred to a real university, I struggles because my credits didn't transfer because they considered Thiel a sub-par University, and I had to re-do an entire year. Worthless completely worthless to attend. Still paying off the loan. The worst decision ever. The school was falling apart, and they spent no money to try and keep it up, Nearly broke my ankle on one of its broken sidewalks and the schools response was ""you should be careful"". Well okay, where should I walk then? 

Dorms are disgusting, attending other universities, I never realized just how terrible they were until I left. Plus, the town is so small it hardly can support the admittedly small school."
Alum,1,I really have very few good things to say about this school. I graduated from here so know the place inside and out. You get a community college experience for the price of an ivy league school. They show you the best facilities when you tour but little do you know that these are rarely used. The real facilities are in utter disrepair. Tour days the food is the best it will ever be and yet it is still pretty bad. No way to op out of the meal plan. Upperclassmen housing is very bad.
College Junior,1,Lack of healthy food options.
College Senior,1,we not have off campus housing 
College Freshman,1,Dorms are old and out-to-date.
College Freshman,1,Facilities are dirty and out-to-date.
College Freshman,1,Technology is lacking to the extreme.
College Sophomore,1,Not much is done to prevent these problems. Authority figures usually step in after it is too late
College Senior,1,"Unless you're in a Greek organization or a sport its kinda hard to find a place to hang out. The town of Greenville isn't exactly the best Saturday strip. The food places are good though, ranging from Mexican to pizzarias to classic diners. Its a very small campus so there isn't much to do on campus unless there's an event. I suppose it's because the faculty is just now trying to make the campus more fun and could use a little help from the students. But the the students are either not spirited enough to care or are so hell-bent on making it better for them or their organization specifically. It's kind of a bummer for individuality"
College Student,1,"The night life is basically non-existant.  There are maybe two or three bars in the area, and most of the time they are just filled with the old locals.  There really isnt anything to do for 18 and under students unless you drive 15 minutes to Hermitage."
College Junior,1,"There is no off-campus housing unless you are a commuter that lives within a certain radius of the school. If you aren't a commuter you pretty much have to stay on campus because you are still required to have a meal plan and pay for housing. There are a few theme houses, apartments for different groups, that are technically off campus but still close to the school, but it isn't guaranteed you'll get in."
College Student,1,Horrible Every Year – I have had problems with financial aid every year i have been here. They always tell me I am good and then mess up later and I have to sit down and fix it or they don't count everything I recieved. It is a lot of headaches and frustration dealing with them at the begining of every semester.
College Sophomore,1,"Money Issues – I mean its incredibly over priced for the education you get, the financial aid office is pretty good about finding you money, the only problem is, they take it away. You will be in debt up to your neck as soon as you step off campus. that being said, they are pretty good about honestly finding ways for you to attend the school"
College Freshman,1,"TOO Overboard – I know some people that were ""caught"" with just having EMPTY alcohol bottles in there rooms up as decoration. The cop wrote them up and then reported to the dean of housing and the RD that there was a party and underage drinking going on. The two got in trouble and were supposed to attend AA meetings with the counselor. Seriously?! The campus security is WAY too uptight with their punishments and need to chill."

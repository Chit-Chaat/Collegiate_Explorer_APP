Junior,5,My classes weren't originally going to be online but because of the COVID-19 pandemic most of my classes have been online or hybrid. I have enjoyed having some classes online because I drive about an hour everyday to school and back. We have had a few issues switching to online but we are getting the kinks out.
Junior,5,I have enjoyed my time at SIUC. I have met some amazing people here. I love my teachers and my program. I have had a pleasant year and a half at this college and am excited to spend another year and a half here.
Freshman,5,"I've been attending SIU for a couple weeks and love how helpful the staff/faculty is to the students. As a freshman, I feel very welcome and feel like they truly care about our success here."
Junior,5,I like Southern Illinois University because they give me the ability to pursue my education while maintaining a full-time job. The admissions counselor was very helpful and extremely nice and easy to work with.
Junior,5,SIU uses the same platform I used when I went to Illinois Central College. It's easy to navigate and helps me stay organized and on top of tasks due.
Freshman,5,"The online course system is easy to navigate. We also get a lot of assistance if there are any problems with the network or course system, so It's easy to report a problem to the school if the online system starts acting up. But there are rarely problems."
Freshman,5,Everyone is so nice and understanding at this school. So many people and administrators provide resources and support and the scholarship process is also very easy.
Alum,5,"I loved my time at SIU. I attended from 2007-2011 and while it wasn’t the party school it was known for in the 90’s, it was never short on entertainment. From tailgating football games, pregaming for basketball games, and night life; Carbondale was quite the experience. Classes and professors were probably pretty average but accessible and helpful. Summers in Carbondale were the best!"
Alum,5,I didn’t have many online classes at SIU because I enjoyed going into classes on campus each day. ..
Freshman,5,"Great experience looking forward to another year.  By going there I have learned how to be more responsible, and the faculty is easy to communicate with.  I would recommend this university to other students looking for an easygoing school and great campus"
Freshman,5,My online experience was not bad. All of my classes ended up being online. My professors ended up minimizing the work load we had to make online easier.
Freshman,5,My experience at SIUC was great! I met great friends and had awesome professors. I liked how diverse the campus was; with the people and their clubs. What I would like to see changed is the food.
Junior,5,"It felt like a weird transition at first, only because this situation is new to everyone. Professors made learning the material available right away and were very understanding toward students who have a difficulty with online classes, such as providing audio lectures, extended due dates, and open availability to ask questions."
Junior,5,"Southern Illinois University Carbondale is a wonderful school that offers amazing opportunities to all students in all majors. You have the chance to make wonderful friends, receive support from professors and all faculty members, and attend interesting lectures that can take place in a lecture hall, a lab,  or out in the field!"
Junior,5,"Helped me grow as a person, find out what I really wanted to do with my life. Great school with lots of opportunity for those who seek it."
Graduate Student,5,"SIU is a really underrated  university. It is known for multiple nationally ranked programs such as aviation, criminology,  forestry, journalism, psychology, speech pathology, and zoology. We also have law and medical schools and a research library with 4 million volumes and 53,000 periodical subscriptions. Add to that living on the edge of a 500,000 acre national forest!"
Junior,5,"Awesome school with great teaching staff and phenomenal teaching facilities. As an engineering student, the class sizes are relatively small which makes for the learning easier. SIU provides a great student life experience for all ."
Senior,5,"Get alumni support, and many opportunities for students in RSO's. Great facilities and updated equipment, fun environment."
Graduate Student,5,Graduate student with a wonderful experience especially in the physician assistant building which is located off campus.
Freshman,5,I like so much the campus the people are was one very kind my tour on campus was excellent people very knowledgeable and friendly
Sophomore,5,"I am currently working through my 3rd Semester in the Workforce Education and Development Program and I love it.  I apply the things I'm  learning on a daily basis into my place of employment.   Through the combination of online classes and seated classes, I will be able to achieve my BS in a third of the time."
Niche User,5,I enjoyed the open house that they had. That was always my first school choice and every time I visit there it makes me understand why I need to be there. Such a beautiful school with breathtaking views and a lifetime of experience followed by lifelong friends that I will run into when I first step on their campus.
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at the Southern Illinois University Carbondale. During my first semester I stayed in the dorms on west campus. The buildings were fairly nice and accessible.
Freshman,5,The college is amazing. There are many places to find resources necessary to study.  There are fantastic graduation ratings.
Niche User,5,"I have not started at SIUC, but I will in Fall 2020. The school is incredible. I went on a tour over summer 2019, and I was astounded. I saw myself there; it was the only place I could see myself at. It had the major I wanted to study and many other opportunities."
Niche User,5,Visiting the school was one of the best experiences I have had in my life. The staff and students are very nice and friendly and provide a comforting atmosphere.
Niche User,5,"I really like how much diversity is on the campus. SIUC is also extremely affordable! The graduation rate is up which implies to me that there is a lot of one on one communications with students and faculty. The acceptance rate is also up in the charts, which means that they are accepting of all types of backgrounds."
Freshman,5,"The school is very accepting of all people and offers a wide array of job and career opportunities on or near campus. The student body is welcoming, and provides its students with volunteer and job opportunities that are beneficial while living on or near campus."
Sophomore,5,I actually love this school so much! Academics are great! The hands on experience is great!! Facility is super nice !!
Freshman,5,"SIU is a beautiful campus. Everyone is easy to talk to and communication is never a problem. All the advisors, all the professors, they care. The campus itself is environmentally friendly and overall beautiful."
Senior,5,"I have really enjoyed SIU. The campus is beautiful and it is very easy to find your way around. The staff is very helpful, when it comes to finding a building or helping you understand the materials. I have never had a professor who was not helpful or willing to give extra help if needed. They offer a ton of clubs or activities for students as well. I met my absolute best friends here because of the organizations they have offered. They even have alarm systems for students so they feel safe in case someone is walking home alone in the dark. Overall, I love the staff and feel this is a great place for someone to further their education."
Sophomore,5,"I love SIU! The area is amazing, ESPECIALLY if you love the outdoors. Tons of delicious restaurants and great art/punk scenes. Very diverse and full of interesting people. Enrollment is down, but it doesn't have an impact on the quality of my experience. It's a really great school--perfect size, pretty affordable, and a quality education."
Freshman,5,They are very friendly and have lots of majors and classes to choose from. The campus is LGBT friendly and has many organizations and opportunities for each and every student. The staff is more than willing to help out with questions and more.
Freshman,5,From the moment I first stepped on the campus to visit I felt it was the place for me. I am supper excited to begin fall 2019
Sophomore,5,Southern Illinois University is a great school! It has a lot of different majors to chose from! It has different opportunities for housing and for classes
Freshman,5,My overall opinion of SIU is that its a small college town with the full big ten experience. We have all new stadiums as well as state of the art facilities. You know everyone in your major and its the perfect amount of student whether you are in a lecture hall or a small classroom. Everyone gets the same attention as the next person. SIU has had a few bumps in the road by becoming one of the first colleges who teachers have gone on strike. Even though it didn't last long it had a huge impact on peoples decisions whether this is a stable college. There are always rumors of the school shutting down because of money issues but those are rumors. This place I consider my home for the next 4 years and I am blessed to have met and enjoy the company of my colleagues.
Freshman,5,Great school with great atmosphere!  Campus is beautiful and facilities are nice.  Sports facilities are excellent and the rec center offers all kinds of extracurricular activities including paddle boats on campus lake.  There is literally something for everyone.   The mascot is a Saluki and is certainly a main focus of this university.  Tail gates at football are fun for the whole family.
Niche User,5,"The best thing about Southern Illinois University Carbondale is their Mortuary Science and Funeral Service program. Finding this program in other local colleges is impossible, and this school is very well accredited. I am very excited to enter the program in the fall due to the welcoming community as well."
Alum,5,The original party school that other schools look up to.  Outstanding academic programs and professors.  I loved every minute of my university experience!  If you choose SIU-C you will be well educated and ready for the future.
Senior,5,"SIUC honestly feels like home to me. I love being on campus and mostly everyone is super friendly. Some things i would change, though, would be campus safety. I would like to see more university police around."
Niche User,5,SIUC is a wonderful college. THey have gorgeous pathways to walk to get to class or even to sit and hang out in. There is a pond for students to go boating on and fishing. The food court is beyond amazing and has a bowling alley on campus.
Junior,5,"Campus living is exciting, housing is affordable, instructors that i have had so far seem to care about their students, lots of volunteering opportunities, robust leadership program"
Junior,5,"I really enjoy the beauty of the lands. The students are very friendly and make conversation and are very helpful with information of classes or they have taken and information on steps to take .The professors are very nice and helpful. Some of the professors check up on you to see if you need more assistance. The tutor program is very helpful for me..which i struggle in since i was young.That makes me feel better that thei is assistance when i need it..which is often.The schools food is not bad,but we also have tons of resturants in the area. Main street has everfor shopping..ything you need that is minutes away from the campus..food..clothing..stores for all kinds of shopping."
Alum,5,"I have not yet begun to attend Southern Illinois University but I will in fall of 2019. I'm really excited. The campus is so pretty and so far, every one has been so helpful."
Junior,5,"Great school, beautiful campus, dedicated teachers, and overall great experience! I recommend taking a tour of the campus ASAP!"
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy my college experience at my college. It has been very challenging, but not so challenging that I couldn’t  achieve my goals. The food is okay, but I really need to broaden my  pallet, I know that not the correct spelling. But I’m very happy with my experience st my school."
Senior,5,I am taking distance learning classes at community college of beaver county from southern illinois university. It is a 16 month program and It is a very enjoyable time.
Junior,5,Very great university and has amazing professors and I am blessed to be on a path to receive my bachelors degree in agribusiness economics. The students here at SIU are great and are very nice.
Sophomore,5,So far Carbondale has been an amazing place for learning and personal growth. They also helped me in one of my darkest hours. I've also learned many fantastic lessons from the various teachers here. And after a lot of thinking I know that I'm on the right path for success!
Freshman,5,"The campus is gorgeous, it is very forest like with a beautiful lake on West Campus. The dorms are pretty nice and spacious. The professors are amazing and very helpful and amiable. The professors make being in a classroom/ lecture hall setting very comfortable and entertaining. The food in the dining hall is pretty good as well. There are also a lot of events that happen around campus for many minority groups. There are also a lot of parties that happen with the black fraternities and white fraternities."
Niche User,5,"I like this college because of it's beautiful campus, small class sizes, and genuine professors. There really isn't much that I would like to change. It has a great meal plan and awesome opportunities."
Niche User,5,"I absolutely loved everyone I met at Southern Illinois University Carbondale. I mean this literally, but everyone I had gotten the chance to meet and talk to, was extremely welcoming and friendly.  Some of the nicest people I’ve ever met, always willing to help. I had an amazing experience at SIUC and it is because of everyone I got the chance to meet."
Graduate Student,5,Excellent campus life! Many things to do. Lots of opportunities. Beautiful campus. Sports are a very big thing.
Sophomore,5,What I liked about Southern Illinois University Carbondale was that everyone at the University was so nice and helpful. If the teachers saw a student struggling they would pull the student aside and set up a plan so they could succeed in their class. The teachers were always available even outside of their office hours. I really enjoy the school and glad I'm a Saluki.
Alum,5,"I love siuc, my grandpa worked there, my other grandpa went there, and now i'm an graduate of the university. I was extremely pleased with my classes, not moving out of the area have decreased my return on my investment, but otherwise a great experience. Siuc is known for the saluki shuffle, so if you are planning on going there, you will have a lot of running around to get things accomplished."
Freshman,5,I enjoying the school so far. Even though everything is hard. Just had to deal with the hard things I got here at SIU. I have friends here and we get along great.
Niche User,5,"I have found SIU to be an amazing experience! I love being surrounded by nature and having tons of local wineries and breweries close by. The party seen at this school is pretty good and has a strong tradition here. My professors always go above and beyond for me whenever I have a question. Another aspect of SIU is that they offer special dietary services in their dining halls. A friend of mine had Celiac Disease freshman year and I was amazed to see how much they provided for her so that she could feel comfortable eating. She told me that they even have allergy kitchens on both sides of the dining halls! Overall, I loved my time here as a Saluki and would recommend this college to anyone and everyone!"
Junior,5,"Southern Illinois University is amazing, and Carbondale is beautiful. There are around 20,000 students at this university which seems like the perfect size. There are tons of activities and restaurants at the Student Center. There are tons of trails and sights to see in Carbondale. The campus is just beautiful in the fall. The Instructors at this university are excellent and the students are very helpful. I have enjoyed my past two years as an automotive student at this college and would recommend this university to anyone."
Graduate Student,5,The campus environment is very inviting to graduate students.  The faculty is extremely professional and helpful.  Financial Aid Services are on point with providing excellent customer service.
Alum,5,I enjoyed the critical analysis and scientific methodology and field research experience that acquired in my field of study. I would set up a platform of communication between different fields of study to break free of specializations and sub-specialization that become rigid doctrines unable to perceive the ever changing organism of science.
Sophomore,4,Southern IL University has been a very positive experience for me. The campus and instructors are very helpful and welcoming.
Junior,4,"You can tell this university is losing students and faculty. This is tragic however, because it is an exceptional campus and is really well centered for the life sciences."
Freshman,4,"It could be a little better, but I understand the difficulty with everyone trying to use remote learning."
Junior,4,"Once I understood the D2L platform, it is easy to navigate. So far the classes have been easy to understand online but I have not fully completed an online class with them."
Junior,4,"So far, it has been a great experience. The staff has been helpful in my enrollment. However, their website is hard to navigate."
Junior,4,"Environment is nice and the people I met there are great, there's many opportunities to interact with other students and several school events to appreciate."
Junior,4,Southern Illinois University Carbondale is a growing community with lots to offer. The school does a fantastic job of attempting to get students involved in various activities. The local community loves the students and offers them much to do and see. The only problem is that parts of the campus are very outdated.
Sophomore,4,"When I first got to SIU I was nervous and didn't know what to expect from the school, I was afraid I wasn't going to make any friends and the campus wasn't going to look as nice as other out of state colleges but, when I got there it was absolutely breathtaking and there was a lot of nature and I made a lot of friends who were all very welcoming and accepting."
Senior,4,"Due to COVID 19, I was forced to finish my Spring 2020 semester online, as were many students. I had a great time learning online. My math teacher took to making his own teaching videos for us to learn from. Many of my teachers, though no prepared for this shift, made the best out of the opportunity and worked with us to the do the best for our education experience."
Alum,4,"For a public institution in the Midwest, I thought SIU was great! I believe that intellectual conversations do happen inside and outside of the classroom. SIU does have a big sports culture, but I was not impressed with the success of our teams (but hey, we still had spirit). SIU student are very politically active and do encourage others to get involved. I usually felt safe on campus. People are known to partake in alcohol and drugs on weekends, but it's not a giant party school by any means. The professors are generally pretty accessible and do care about student success. Greek Life is alright, I guess. SIU also does provide plenty of opportunities for students get involved in the Arts and Volunteerism."
Junior,4,I have had a positive experience overall at this college. The administration has been very helpful in making sure we are taking the correct classes and that we are performing well in our classes. The tuition is not bad for a public university. There is a lot of on campus and off campus living which it is nice to have the options.
Freshman,4,"I like how friendly and helpful everyone is.  It was easy to make friends and I did well in my classes. There are a lot of resources available. Also, many groups to join."
Senior,4,"I have had a pretty good time overall. There were many issues within the admin, but it didn't have a huge effect on me personally. Many staff members really want to see students succeed, and there are lots of great resources at our disposal. Lots of events and student groups, and they really empower the student groups (i.e. funding for events). The student health center is an A+ facility, and the rec center is awesome as well. Dorms aren’t the best, but maintenance was always prompt. Lots of improvements to be made, but the first thing that comes to mind is restructuring the parking division. Enrollment has decreased, and NONE of the parking lots are ever full. We should be paying less for parking or get more privileges to park in different places without fear of getting a ticket. There should be more short term parking, especially for those who have 90% of their classes off campus and who need to come to campus for short periods of time to turn something in or pay a bill, etc."
Niche User,4,I enjoy Carbondale's campus and student life. The campus is diverse and has many professors who have a lot of experience in the field you want to go into.
Senior,4,The experience I have had at SIU has really been positive. I am a non-traditional student and I have been able to attend classes on campus and succeed. The instructors I have encountered truly care about their students success.
Sophomore,4,My experience here is not as fun as I thought it would be. The professors and the classes are pretty decent as long as you show up to class. This school use to be know for their parties but that went away. The campus food is pretty good I can't complain about it. Carbondale is a nice scenery especially if you take a walk around campus at night it is  beautiful. You can feel a little scared walking so maybe you should walk with a partner. The campus police are always out so you don't have to worry about your safety because it will always be an officer nearby.
Graduate Student,4,"Overall, my experience at SIU has been good so far.  I got my undergrad from SIU and am working on my Master's degree currently.  Carbondale is a nice town with lots of good food and shops.  SIU has a wide variety of majors to choose from and is highly diverse."
Freshman,4,"I really do enjoy the oppurtunites as well as resiurces provided for the LGBTQ+ community, which I am a part of, as well as their mental health resources. However, I do feel like there could be more oppurtunities and resources for people of color on campus."
Alum,4,"Carbondale has a great ratio of staff to students. I feel that once i got into my major courses i had a fantastic educations, however, the general education classes were sub-par. Also the parking division was a complete mess."
Freshman,4,So far the school is welcoming and helpful. They offer a lot of benefits to improve your academic status. SIU really wants their students to succeed and it is proven through the staff and their encouragement to give it your all.
Freshman,4,I liked how everyone that I interacted with at the university were very nice and cooperative. The dorms and classrooms were decent and manageable. I like how everything is spaced out and how everything is walking distance.
Senior,4,I like how student are willing to help each other out when it comes to class work and how the professors are willing to help out when you need help during their office hours
Senior,4,"Overall I love this school. The campus is pretty, though some buildings could be cleaned. There are some professors that I personally wouldn't recommend, but that is common among all schools. There is a lot of campus involvement and generally everyone is friendly."
Junior,4,"Southern Illinois University at Carbondale is a college which provides the student with opportunities equal to the effort they put in, more so than most. There is a large undergraduate research present at the college which provides those students who take the time to become involved the ability to have hands on experience in the fields they are planning on working in. However, if the student takes no effort to become engaged in the community, SIUC will seem a boring college."
Freshman,4,I like it because of the community that gives. Everyone is nice and is willing to help one another. The teachers are nice and helpful to whatever we need. Everyone here wants to see us grow in every way shape or form.
Sophomore,4,"The experience here so far is amazing, the people are really friendly and extremely helpful; the instructors for the most part are willing to assist with any issues one may have and the administration is available to contact when one is in need of assistance.  I have contacted my head of department several times with any inconveniences and she has been very helpful in assisting me in solving the issue. The dining hall supplies decent, enjoyable food most days of the week; it also is an enjoyable place of work.  Overall, I highly recommend this institution of higher education. However, with it being located in almost the middle of nowhere, there isn't much to do off campus; to counter balance this (or at least I suspect this of taking place) the fraternities on campus hold parties pretty much every weekend."
Junior,4,I'm an online student - some of the instructors are great for online courses - others leave you stranded with just a textbook and exam dates.
Senior,4,"I am a returning adult earning my certification in Special Education. Since I work full time at a community high school and have a young daughter, attending classes on campus was not a possibility for me. SIU offers degrees at a number of Extended Campus locations, which allows me not only to keep working and raise my daughter, but earn my degree with instructors who have worked in the field and are highly knowledgeable in the study of Special Education."
Freshman,4,"Great university! As an aviation student, I could ask for a better place to be! the staff and faculty at the airport are absolutely phenomenal people and the facility for the university at the airport is state of the art! The planes used for flight training are kept in great condition and look great!  Also, SIU has some great connections in the aviation industry with American and United Continental Airlines, so that unique internships and job opportunities can be yours for the taking if you wish.  I would highly suggest joining some sort of aviation-related organization here as we have the lot to choose from.  Dorm life is very fun, but a complaint would be that the rooms are quite small and there is not a whole lot of storage so beware!  Overall I love coming down to Southern Illinois University Carbondale as it is a great place to be.  GO DAWGS!"
Freshman,4,"Carbondale is a great little school with in depth classes. All of the professors, save a couple, are super invested in your success. All around a great school!"
Sophomore,4,Southern Illinois University is an AWESOME school the one thing ill tell anyone that isn't from the area would bring all your favorite food from your hometown.classes are small so the teacher actually helps you with any questions you have. many of the students are very nice! apply for WORK study you'll  meet many people i promise
Graduate Student,4,"Southern Illinois University is an excellent university that allows students to prosper. Entering my freshman year of undergrad, I was uncertain of what I’d like to major in. Due to the universities vast list of majors, I decided to major in CDS. I’ve learned to also network with others, join many clubs, and even became a founder of a club on campus. The diversity is very good and the campus is beyond beautiful. People who enjoy the outdoors will love campus and the surrounding towns. The professors are always helpful and attentive to students. I am now a grad student at SIU because I enjoyed my experience here and the education I received."
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student, and I believe this university is a much better fit for me.  With its beautiful campus, safe community, tight-knit student body and wide array of academic studies, Southern Illinois University caters to most students.  Apartments are decent, and there are many events and activities throughout the school year on campus.  Professors and academic advisors are willing to work with students to make sure they are on track and still enjoying themselves."
Niche User,4,I loved the campus when I went there! It absolutely is a wonderful place to be. The campus holds many historical attributes along with some really enriching courses. It is a perfect place to be if you want to be a teacher. Their business program is so unique and practically unmatched.
Junior,4,"Overall the univeristy isn't all that great. It is a lot more expensive than other state universities and they overcharge you for almost everything. Also attendance is going down significantly every year. The only reason I am attending this college is because of the phenomenal automotive program they offer. As far as the auto program goes, it could not get much better. It is a family environment and there are so many opportunities for internships and full time positions after graduation. The instructors are wonderful and treat all the students as if they were their own children. It is just a strong supportive environment for students to thrive in."
Niche User,4,I like the many activities and sports that they offer.  I think that many of the classes that they offer are good choices and the campus food is very excellent.
Junior,4,"Hi, i am currently going into my junior year at southern illinois university carbondale and i can honestly say its been a journey. No one ever told me this, it was something i had to learn but college is not hard at all. If you want to succeed you have to put in the work yourself,  yeah their maybe some shortcuts sometimes but college takes a lot of focus, and preparation. You got to tell yourself you want it bad enough and put in the effort to get it. No matter how many times you fall down always get up! failure should never be an option for anyone. Being here at SIUC i have learned a lot, and is still learning. Being in college, time management is  very important when talking succeeding. If you don't manage your time well from school, RSO's, work , and etc you will be lost and stuck."
Sophomore,4,I love the campus! I feel like I'm at home. I've made so many college friends and hopefully turn into life long friends. If you like southern country boys then this is the school for you! The education and staff is amazing! will recommend to others!
Senior,4,"Southern Illinois University is a fairly small, public university. It is presently under-funded, as are many schools in Illinois. However, this has not stopped Southern Illinois University from doing its best to provide a quality experience for its students. The College of Agricultural Sciences especially has continued to offer many exceptional programs. The COAS has continued to grow in a time when many of the university's colleges have seen a decline in enrollment. I am very grateful for the quality experience they have provided me with.
However, despite my great experience, there are aspects of the university that could be improved. Emphasis is placed on research, and those who participate in research are clearly favored. Unfortunately, the opportunities to get involved in research have continued to dwindle. Furthermore, recent administrative turmoil has caused further stress on the university, and it has been reflected in its operations."
Sophomore,4,"You can literally find a party everynight if you want to. If you arent into parties, there are plenty of other ways to get involved on campus and find your people."
Junior,4,"Overall, my experience has been excellent. The instructors seem to really care about my well-being and academic achievement. I would like to see more of the professors and department heads care that much as well."
Sophomore,4,"I love the school, but unfortunately they are going broke. Enrollment is way down and they started to shut down the towers."
Junior,4,"Being that I am a student that is from the area, Southern Illinois University Carbondale was close to home. The campus is gorgeous, especially in the fall and spring time. The organizations that a student can become a part of is endless. The class sizes are just big enough where you don't necessarily get lost in the crowd, but you can still get the one on one help if you need it."
Freshman,4,"SIUC is an amazing community. I feel like I belong here and I am actually learning, so overall my experience has been excellent so far. However, this school is broke and the Chancellor currently is worsening the problem."
Junior,4,"I like the surrounding area, small town but still enough business to not be inconvenient.  I have had an enjoyable college experience here and I feel very at home."
Freshman,4,"SIUC is a great school, I am an aviation student here. Their programs like aviation, auto-tech, and many others are some of the best in the country. It is a great school with very few setbacks."
Senior,4,I would like the University to spend their funds a bit better. For instance the program I'm currently in (Aviation Flight & Technology) is using curriculum that is good but equipment that is outdated and getting closer to retirement age. It would be nice if the quality of the teachers and other faculty (excellent) would match what they have to use to teach.
Sophomore,4,Large Campus but easy to find classes. Class size range between 20 or less or a larger classroom setting. Diverse. Always activities.
Junior,4,I started college here this past fall and I really like it so far. I really like the layout of the campus my environment in general. Where I live is really close to the campus lake and overall it's a very woodsy area which I enjoy viewing. I another thing I enjoy about going to college here is the convenience of the dining halls and the other restaurants located in the student center. There are some things that could be improved about the campus and SIU in general as a college. The one main thing that I think should be improved upon is tuition/college affordability. I think the prices are too high and should be lowered. We are losing students simply because they cannot afford to go here.
Freshman,4,"I love SIUC. Everyone is so friendly and everywhere you walk, you'll see so many squirrels it's amazing!! I have made so many friends being here so far, and it's only my first year! I love it here, and I think you would too!"
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed the college life and the people I live with.  The campus is beautiful with a lot of nature.  Only reason I give it a 4 and not a 5 is because personally I am looking for a bigger college and I am not a fan of my chemistry teacher.
Sophomore,4,Its a very diverse university and very accepting. There's always something to do on campus or in town. They offer shuttles for free for students and are great about student safety. They offer police to escort students across campus during the night if they don't feel safe alone.
Junior,4,I enjoyed the resources the school provided such as silent floors for studying in the library and the recreation center which is free to students. The professors were great and encouraged students to ask questions.
Senior,4,Southern Illinois University Carbondale is a great college. It offers so many degrees and is in the heart of Southern Illinois making outdoor activities plentiful and fun. The teachers are good and it gets you prepared for life after college.
Junior,4,So far I have been at SIU for a semester now and I really enjoy it.  The school has an amazing education program.  The teachers are pretty friendly for the most part. I have had a few issues with one or two teachers.  By that I mean his tests were pretty out there and didn't follow his lectures at all. I love the environment along with the library and rec center available for students.
Freshman,4,Southern Illinois University of Carbondale has changed my life for the better. It has showed me that I need to use my resources better and better my time. It has also showed me that you can not take things for granted.
Niche User,4,The campus is beautiful with many activities to do. The professors are great too. You'll love everything about this school.
Freshman,4,My experience at SIUC has been well. The best thing about the university is all the free resources they offer such as tutoring and the writing center. They also have saluki express which is the local bus service which is free for students. It is very convenient.
Freshman,4,"I was surprised with the diversity of the student population, not just with ethnicity and race but with moral backgrounds. I have come to love SIUC and have learned to really appreciate my time spent there."
Freshman,4,"As an international student at Southern Illinois University Carbondale, I have never felt homesickness. SIU has been my home away from home. Overall, I'm satisfied with the academics and the housing facilities provided in the campus."
Sophomore,2,"I am taking several online classes due to the pandemic and I find it very difficult. I really hope we can do in person classes soon things like math, and science classes are especially difficult."
Junior,2,This isn't the fault of anyone in particular but more of a sign of the times. Many faculty and students appear out of their element and one cannot blame them.
Graduate Student,2,"In the past few years this college has declined in many ways. First, there is an internal struggle for power with those that work and run this institution. Second, financial elements in the college are handled poorly and inside sources relay information to me that it has gotten worse. The parking division is a joke. They follow people and single them out just for an opportunity to write a citation. I did some investigation into citations on campus and have seen documentation of them giving numerous citations to the same students in one day. Parking areas are not all clearly labeled either. A pure racket. Lastly, if a student is not on the same agenda as a professor then be prepared to be treated unfairly and not be able to take action through the dean or assistants. They blow off students rather than listening to the problem. Does anyone want to be accountable at this school....for advising too?  What a joke."
Senior,2,"Horrible, terrible location. education is alright and students are kind but anywhere fun is far away from anywhere"
Freshman,2,"I had a really bad experience here as a freshman.  The campus is depressing, the faculty members are decent but the curriculum is certainly sub-par.  They aren't preparing students.  The funding for this school is going downhill, and the rate of employment after is declining as well.  The name brand is losing its touch."
Niche User,2,The teacher were of goos quality and variety. However I don't think the schooled put their students first. I hope to see that change in the future.
Graduate Student,2,"I recently enrolled at SIU.  I started the summer semester and was informed there was a change in my program, new core courses were required.  The core courses went from 3 to 8!  Also, after further investigation, my entire degree area had been done away with and no one even told me! Not a good first impression.  They also have a ridiculous number of fees on top of their tuition.  14 fees in total on my bill this semester!  Also, they used to be a huge party school and have gone extreme in the opposite direction in an attempt to fix that.  You cannot have more than 2 unrelated people living in a house, and alchohol is not permitted at school events or sporting events."
Junior,2,"It was ok at first but the longer your here the worse it gets.It isn't really safe ,there is a racist town very close and they come around very often. School is just like highschool and there it's much to do and ever year they keep saying the school might shut down soon."
College Junior,2,"Super average living...lots of bug problems throughout the year. No privacy, no security for the closet, and kinda small living space."
College Senior,2,Basketball and football aren't very good. Fees are wasted on them.
College Junior,2,Dorms are old and hot and not clean.
College Freshman,2,"The bathrooms are always disgusting in University Hall. I think it only gets cleaned about once a week which is definitely not enough. On the 2nd floor, there are 6 stalls meant for about 40 students. And only about 6 showers. The floors in the showers are peeling, there's mold on the shower wall and the shower curtains are old and disgusting. There are only three soap dispensers and one of them stopped working the second week of school and hasn't been fixed since and there are only 3 months left of school. When the toilets flush, they splash water all over you, as high as your waist down to your ankles. Also, some of the toilet seats look old and scratched up and gross"
College Sophomore,2,"I don't really think the school cares all that much about the issue. at least 10 times a month a student is sexually assaulted on campus and all we get are emails from the chancellor saying that it happened in a certain building, which is not helpful at all. There is never a follow us on the evens."
College Freshman,2,"Courses are okay, but the professors do not care if you pass or fail. Go to class and maybe you will pass. Half the teachers are foreign and impossible to understand."
College Student,2,"For the most part, Greeks are made fun of."
College Senior,2,There are a ton of crimes every day. Anything from Shootings to vandalism. I have never been in serious danger but I know a ton of people who have. Even I have been in several bar fights.
College Senior,2,Our school seems like it is not invested at all in our sports. That is too bad because some of the most fun I have had has been at student run tailgating. The school could have easily doubled that by making an effort.
College Freshman,2,No one really attends the games and no one really knows about them either. There arent any tryouts for other students to join.
College Freshman,2,"the housing office is horrible, I was being harassed by my roommate ,and it took two months to move. I am a special needs student and the refused to move me when I asked like they advertised."
College Junior,2,The campus tries to do what they can to keep students safe but it only seems like the policies do their job
College Junior,2,its not enough choices to eat and the dining hall makes bad food. It seems like they are wasting food and time make nasty food.
College Freshman,2,"I don't know why campus security is so strict on stupid things like parking when there's drug use and underage drinking all over campus. They are extremely lenient on drug use and drinking on campus or even in the dorms, but if you're five minutes late on moving your car to the correct lot, you get ticketed."
College Freshman,2,It's not very diverse here in terms of who people hangout with.  People normally don't branch out of their ethnic groups if they don't have to.  Most of the people here are ignorant to other races too.  This campus is horribly racist.
College Freshman,2,The academics here aren't on par with the price tag.
College Freshman,2,The academics here are the kind that you could probably get at a cheaper school.
College Freshman,2,This school doesn't give out that much aid to begin with so be prepared for loans or to have a job.  When you have anything over 1000 dollars you can't register for classes and after this year it'll be 200.  If you have a personal or family situation it's pretty much impossible for them to budge on anything.  So be warned.
College Junior,2,School is not accessible or affordable.
College Junior,2,"The education department is insane, when I was a freshman my education teacher physically hit me in class. most of them are either EX kindergarten teachers or broken souls who wanted to make a difference in the world and discovered that education in America is a horrible bureaucracy and they are just mere pawns"
College Junior,2,it's bland and unhealthy most of it makes you have to go to the bathroom immediately after
College Junior,2,"most of the houses are decrepit and full of housing violations, the community refers to the local group of landlords as the slum lords of carbondale"
College Freshman,2,Our football team is pretty bad. We hear about it but its not a big deal
College Freshman,2,Outside of the campus looks a bit run down.
College Junior,2,"There is a ton of crime. Rapes, assaults, thefts, burglaries, and robberies are huge."
College Junior,2,"The science department is underfunded. If you take a biology course you will soon realize this. The microscopes are so old a converter box must be used before plugging them into the wall. They can't afford certain slides and had us shake up dish soap in a bottle to show what a certain type of cell looked like. There are some periodic tables that are so old they are missing elements discovered in the 60's. The instructors do not know how to teach. The science department is clearly underfunded. The first place I would look as to why is the fact that the University President gets a salary of $425,000 a year."
College Freshman,2,"During the day I feel safe on campus. At night, however, there are not many police officers driving around and there are many sketchy characters walking in the dark. This semester alone there have been several sexual assault cases reported and action has been taken."
College Sophomore,2,you get tired of eatting the same things
College Sophomore,2,i'm not a party type of person.  lots of drunks and loud music.
College Sophomore,2,Someone recently die while away at school.
College Sophomore,2,They serve the same food almost every week.
College Senior,2,On campus I have never felt threatened. Off-campus however the community is heavily populated with homeless people. The crime rate of robberies and car break ins has since increase since I have attended. The police I feel like are not very reliable and conspiracies have recently developed over a possible cover up of a murder of a previous student last fall.
College Senior,2,SIUC over programs the Greek members. The greek life is not as big as it should be for the size of our university. With minimal numbers the amount of work that  is required out of each member each semester is equivalent to whole years worth of chapter goals at Mizzou. The work load required out of greeks make it harder to retain members and recruit members.
College Sophomore,2,"There is only one place I like off campus (New Khala), but it's not convenient nor reasonably priced. Other than that everywhere else does not have good quality food. Like greasy Sam's Cafe."
College Junior,2,"During my senior year of high school, I applied for the full-ride scholarship and the only other academic scholarship on campus. After I received my financial aid letter, I found that it was filled almost entirely with government aid and loans. I tried calling the financial aid department on several occasions, but they would not discuss the matter with me or explain why I had not received any further aid. My parents tried to intervene on my behalf and the department would not discuss it with them either. In the end, a highly esteemed professor within my department went to the head of financial aid to get some answers and later told me that the department waited to put my academic and financial information into the computer until the deadline had already passed, even though they had had it in their possession for over a month. I also found out that they had lost my application for the scholarships, but agreed to give me the smaller scholarship which would only cover part of the cost and last for two years.

I am now entering my third year at the university and have contacted the financial aid department about providing more aid since the scholarship ran out. There aren't any university funded academic scholarships for continuing students with a high GPA and even though I have a 4.0, I can't get the aid to stay in school. The department continues to offer me a high amount of loans for which I am eligible, but I do not want to come away from school with an overwhelming amount of debt.

My advice is that anyone applying for aid at this school should continually keep tabs on the department. Contact them constantly and make them work for you."
College Sophomore,2,The food is shady at best. Especially the Mexican cuisine options
College Sophomore,2,"Monsoon season in the Spring... if it's not icing, there is a tornado or it's wicked hot."
College Sophomore,2,"They mark lots, so students get ticketed for EVERYTHING."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus housing is terrible. The dorms are dirty, smelly, and you meet lots of new bugs. People are noisy and are loud at all hours of the night."
College Junior,2,I have heard about the parties in Carbondale. it normally end up with a fight among the students at the end of the night. I do not got to parties so I would  not know much about them
College Freshman,2,It's very boring. There's always a lot of people out but there's never anything happening. Whenever there's a party going on it's  never really fun. It's just loud music playing and people standing around outside
College Freshman,2,some people are very disrespectful
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of people that drink, do drugs, smoke weed. Yet it is very rare when someone gets caught for drugs and weed. Most people get caught for alcohol mostly because I think that's what most police workers look for."
College Freshman,2,The dorms are old but they aren't too bad of a school.
College Sophomore,2,"The few ""known"" fraternities are known either because they are actually a group of good guys or the complete opposite. It seems that anyone can get into a frat that tries as I've seen some really awful people, who are very different that what the initial standards of the frat seemed to be, accepted. Then come the couple of frats that roofie their drinks every night."
College Sophomore,2,"There are two sides to campus when it comes to housing. West and East side. Just as it would be for a big city, these two sides constantly criticize the other. West side is very loud and busy (it is where the three 17 floor housing towers are), while East side has multiple buildings of 3 floors, along the campus lake, and is pretty quiet. No two dorms are the same when it comes to (appearance of) cleanliness, size, and comfort. Bathrooms are suite style, so we don't have to deal with community bathrooms and showers, but the actual size of our rooms and the space for storing belongings is very little. The dorm life is extremely uncomfortable. If you HAVE to live in the dorm for at least one year, do yourself a favor and be sure to live off-campus the rest of your college career.

As for the quality of the housing and dining, the price unreasonable and unfair. Especially for dining."
College Sophomore,2,"Bars typically do a good job of kicking out trouble makers who are too drunk or simply just there to seek out a fight. Most of the time, however, underage drinkers are able to get drinks through friends who are of age and hold onto them with no question unless police arrive to scour through the bar. Outside of the bars, at house parties, drinking can sometimes get extremely out of hand and dangerous."
College Junior,2,"I am not a wealthy person at all. When you have to pay $159 dollars for one semester to be able to park by your apartment is upsetting. Also, for all the people that live at the apartments, it doesn't seem like enough space. 

Even at campus, I take the bus because the parking lots are always jammed packed with cars and even when people are driving around to find spots, it tends to be over crowded."
College Junior,2,"I do not know much on the off campus housing. 
What I have seen is a lot of old, not clean or taken care of homes all around the campus area. 
I wouldn't want or tell someone to live there. They are also not located in the best of places in Carbondale."
College Sophomore,2,Financial Aid department is the least helpful of all the departments at this school.
College Junior,2,"My building is extremely busy, apparently, so finding a parking spot after 8 am is almost impossible. There's other parking about a mile away, but you have to get to school about 20 minutes early just to make the hike. Parking for the year is about $100, and any kind of ticket is $35 per violation."
College Junior,2,"From what I've heard, this year has been very troubling for campus residents. We've been a large class for the college to accept and there's not been very good space to put them all in. Fortunately I'm not a freshmen so I encourage living off campus if possible. Find someone in your classes that you could room with and live in an apartment away from campus. "
Sophomore,1,Not good at all. Professors take forever to get back to you and some of the material is hard to get ahold of.
Alum,1,"Terrible, overpriced school. The administration is corrupt pulling in multiple salaries while professors barely get a salary. Then they complain about not having enough money and, in response, raise tuition, housing, etc. Some professors actually want to see you succeed but others don't seem to care and rush out of the classroom as soon as class releases and never reply to emails. If they do reply its generally something along the lines of ""contact your TA"". The city of Carbondale is suffering from increased crime from the people that come down from Chicago. Sexual assaults, shootings, etc are fairly common. Emergency Service sirens are referred to as ""the anthem of Carbondale"" since that's all you hear around the clock."
Freshman,1,I came to this school because of low tuition and no out-of-state tuition.  This college has no Greek life and has low expectation. They make you pay for very unnecessary items and the dorms are very far if you choose University Hall. The dorm food is very bad and you must have low expectations once you come here. No vegetarian items nor do they help you about it. They do have a great party life.  I don’t recommend this college unless you live around here.
Niche User,1,Ended up being too much of a party school for my liking. It also always felt very unsafe due to high racial and socioeconomic tensions. Farmers do not like inner-city Chicago kids and vice-versa. I always carried pepper spray and still didn't feel safe. There were also 3 reported rapes in one of the towers in one semester.
Freshman,1,"The WiFi sucks. If your roommate moves out, they'll force you to either pay more for your room, find a new roommate, or be assigned a random new roommate. The tutoring services are a joke. There's no Easter break. It's just an awful awful school hahah don't go here"
Sophomore,1,This place is a trash heap. And it is run by idiots. I find myself wondering why anyone goes here especially for as much money as they dooped us into paying. Carbondale is nice. Siu ruins it.
College Freshman,1,I think the housing is gross and outdated on campus. The staff hired to clean do not bother. West campus is better than east campus for sure. It is way to expensive for a dingy old room where things are falling apart. People are loud and rude. My experience so far has included people vandalizing my dorm room door. If you do not have to live on campus I honestly would not.
College Freshman,1,I don't like living in the dorms because people dont respect your privacy and its like living in a hotel.
College Senior,1,Complete and utter scam if you live in the towers or Thompson. Thompson is slightly better.
College Senior,1,"I would not recommend the BAT online program at Southern Illinois University to anyone. I have an undergrad and Master's degree from other schools. I was hopeful about obtaining my next degree from SIU, but now that I am in the process, I am shocked at their lack of professionalism and organization. The Behavior Analysis and Therapy online program is disorganized, with unhelpful and rude professors and TA's. Please do not waste your time and money on this program."
College Sophomore,1,"This is the worst school I have ever been to ,in fact the only thing about this school I think is okay is the gym."
College Senior,1,"This school pursued me, a lot. Mail every week, calls to my house just as often. And yet no one had the stones to tell me that they didn't offer what I was looking for. So now. 2 semesters away from graduating I have no choice but to transfer to another university. One that better as hell not lie to me and waste 2 years of my time and money. 

From the get go the university housing hasn't cared a lick about me. Ignoring preference profiles, waiting over a month to move me out of a legitimately dangerous roommate situation. 

Some of the teachers are lovely, but good luck finding them. 

The advisors are atrocious. They act like they don't want you to succeed. I however was one of the lucky ones. I was assigned to what seems to be the only quality advisor who helped me with all kinds of problems."
College Freshman,1,"Honestly if you aren't coming here to get drunk or do drugs you aren't going to enjoy it here. They have religious groups such as intervarsity but not everyone fits into the dynamic of the group or its just not their cup of tea. Vine church is great and very welcoming. RA's dont really enforce quiet hour so when people are screaming and blasting music at 3 am you have to suffer in silence. My math teacher doesn't care that nobody can read what he writes on the projector screen. My health teacher yells at people for yawning because they aren't "" in their bedroom"". Its just not a good environment for me."
College Freshman,1,administration is unfair and extremely biased.
College Freshman,1,I found a used band-aid in the crouton container..
College Freshman,1,"Living on campus in the dorms are one of the worst experiences of my life. The people are terrible, the housing staff is terrible, and the rooms are terrible."
College Freshman,1,"I really do not like it here, it's not a very good place overall."
College Freshman,1,"Would not recommend to come here at all -100/10 in my opinion.  I'm transferring as soon as I can, most of the faculty do not care as you are just another paycheck to them.  The school doesn't care for the wellbeing of the students that much.  The last snowday we had was only because someone got into a accident on the day prior when the school neglected to close down even though multiple schools in the same area were and the city was telling them to."
College Freshman,1,"I honestly do not like it here, but maybe you'll have a better experience than me.  The professors don't really care about their students and only about their paychecks.  Administration has no clue what it's doing most of the time and even when they do you don't ever get a straight answer.  I understand it's a public university but this college truly does not care about it's students.  The most recent snow storms that we've had there was ice on the ground and every other school in the region was closed except for us.  The only reason we were able to close the next day was because someone had gotten into an accident on their way to class the day before.  I also had a friend who went through hell when her roommate was stealing her Vicodin and the RHA refused to help her no matter what she said.  I'm transferring out of this place as soon as I can."
College Junior,1,"If you are coming from a large city (like Chicago) the food in Carbondale is the WORST. If you like Taco Bell and Burger King, you might survive. BUT, if you like to try different food local to Carbondale, expect the restaurant to stay in business for 3 months, max. There are hidden gems, if you have a means of transportation. Murphysboro is solid."
College Junior,1,for the education department the counselors rarely care about you finishing your major they show little interest in helping you. Half the time when you call the receptionist will say they are out of their office when they are really sitting at their desk. horrible.
College Junior,1,majority of the staff pulls everything out of their ass none of them really know whats going on half the time
College Sophomore,1,Sharing a room with somebody sucks.
College Freshman,1,"taxis are awful, and the free bus for students takes forever to get anywhere"
College Freshman,1,"The boys aint shit at all. Only seen one nice looking dude so far and he still wasnt up to standards. Girls let this be your warning, coming here you will have to lower your standards SIGNIFICANTLY if you want an at least decent boyfriend."
College Junior,1,The professors of my major are awful. they are not helpful
College Junior,1,"I do not like anyone in my cohort, no one seems to be decent. "
College Junior,1,They are very bad about attending to the sidewalks in snow.
Recent Alumnus,1,"SIU keeps on letting go of facility when our departments keeps on growing. I would not go to SIU if I had to repeat, goals are to be a park ranger, conservation officer, YMCA administration   "
Recent Alumnus,1,you can decided but the SIU is in termoil and I would go elsewhere 
Recent Alumnus,1,"They are out there for your money and not here to educate you. STAY AWAY, Tuition keeps on going up each yea. "
Recent Alumnus,1,no computers unless you have you own 
Recent Alumnus,1,"What parking, you have to walk 1-2 miles to get to campus because of parking"
Recent Alumnus,1,There are more international students than Americans  
Recent Alumnus,1,They all have the same food and the new ones that have just open are horrible. stay away. 
Recent Alumnus,1,its hard to find a spot and the permit cost isnt worth it.
College Senior,1,"Lots of houses near campus have been trashed and are unmaintained. There is a significant amount of crime throughout the year.  In my experiences, the landlords have been ok."
College Senior,1,"Financial aid has always been a process I dread at SIUC, the workers are very rude. the school hardly ever sends out emails or letters giving advice, and there is always a ""problem"" when trying to apply"
College Junior,1,"Parking is okay on campus since all students can buy a parking sticker, but parking off campus is an absolute nightmare! There is virtually no public parking."
College Junior,1,"It's only not an F because they allow anyone, even freshmen, to buy parking decals. Decals cost at least 60$ no matter which sticker you get and while some of the parking lots are well placed they are only for faculty or seniors. Having a job and living on campus was a nightmare. I'd be standing on my feet for up to 7 hours and then have to walk a mile to get back to my room."
College Junior,1,Loads of Alcohol. Everywhere. Little bit of smoking and it's not all tobacco. You only really run into it if you go to parties or live on campus.
College Freshman,1,In the Cinema and Photography Department I had to send in 20 photographs displaying exactly what I can do. I got no feed back at all until I was already signed up for photography 3 and they told me I should take photography 2. Instead of just putting me in photography 2 they kept me in photography 3. There is literally no communication between anybody in the communication building. Doesn't make much sense if you think about it.
College Freshman,1,"Southern Illinois University of Carbondale

Cinema and Photography

I love photography but the Cinema and Photography department at SIUC is not receiving funding from the school which brings it down. The equipment there is very old, run down and glued together. For a week I was standing in water in order to develop photographs which is very dangerous. After sending a email explaining what was happening in this department the Dean did fix the problem. But still I transferred here hoping to further my education and not have to fight for what I deserve in a college.

They do have a Hope which develops color photographs. This is a very rare process because the parts for this machine do not exist anymore.

There are up and downs. Its a very inconsistent college and honestly it is not worth the amount. Overall I am very disappointed on them not being concern in the decrease of students. The Chair, Dr. Metts told me that there use to be 300 students in that department and now there are only 77. He acted as though this was normal."
College Junior,1,"The drugs in this school are really big. Drinking is something most students partake in-- a LOT of underage drinking and partying. There is a lot of marijuana on campus, too. Bars are always packed, and loud. A lot of parties."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is difficult to find, and considering that, the price they ask for a parking permit is outrageous. You're better off to count on only using your car for things such as going to the store or going places on the weekends and not trying to drive and park for class. It's not worth the hassle."
College Freshman,1,"I would not recommend this school to anybody unless your major isn't available elsewhere. The campus safety is questionable, and off campus is much worse. All of carbondale is a seedy area filled with meth heads and ex cons. Parties are common at the beginning of the school year, but die down after a few weeks. Resident Assistants will consistently infringe on your rights, as will the university police. if you don't know your rights, they can and will do whatever they want. Classes themselves are huge, and even when you have a smaller class (my smallest was ~35 kids) the teachers all act as if they are the popular kid everyone wants to talk to, and often play favorites. Overall, my current experience has been pretty bad, and even though this is the only college within 1000 miles with my major, I'm still considering leaving. "
College Freshman,1,"In the past few years there have been many bomb threats, robberies by gunpoint in the dorms, riots, and shootings at apartments off campus. Security is very bad at SIU."
College Freshman,1,The towers are just falling apart and the elevators never work
College Sophomore,1,"There is diversity in Southern Illinois university of Carbondale but you do not see much of it happening as far as, different colors of people coming together. They need to do a better job in that area."
College Senior,1,I do not like the program that I chose here. If I could do it all over again I would. The programs here are really bad.
College Sophomore,1,"Makes Me Hate Technology – The wifi at SIUC is a royal pain. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. The wifi in the dorms is different from the wifi used on campus and in the library. It takes hours and hours to download every requirement that their system needs and in the end it feels like a big waste of time."
College Sophomore,1,"Dilated Pupils – At SIUC, no matter what class I am sitting in, the smell of weed fills the room. Sadly, it seems that every there is at least one student high or drunk in every class I attend. Police are walking throughout the campus 24/7 but I honestly do not think that they do anything besides walk in circles. The university needs to take a closer look; the problem is pretty easy to see."
College Junior,1,"Southern Is the easiest place to get accept into but the hardest to finish from.  I wanted to attend summer school but, Its to expensive so I will have to either take only one class or owe 1,080. Furthermore ,if your bursar is over 500 you cant enroll for fall. I just want to finish."
College Junior,1,"Not Much – You can find all the usual college crap food-pizza, mexican, ethnic.  But it is difficult to find fresh, healthy and varied food choices.  There is one vegetarian place and one organic grocery.  There is also one ethnic grocery.  Very difficult to find seafood.  One bright spot is the farmer's market from April to October."
College Freshman,1,"Room for Work – Athletics at SIUC has been on a downhill slide recently, but as with any team, as the athletes continue to play together and grow as a team, their ability will increase. With the hiring of a few new coaches recently, I see a definite rise in SIUC athletics in the near future."
College Freshman,1,"Drugs and Alcohol on Campus – Many people consider this a party school. You will see a lot of drugs and alcohol. Weed and alcohol are very common. If you are caught, though, you could get kicked out of the residence halls or campus police will give you a ticket."
College Junior,1,"Greek Life is a small population even though they are always recruiting. There is only one sorority house left on campus, all other houses are off campus now."
College Senior,1,"Parking is a huge problem here.  All my professors and TAs complain about it, and people complain about the tickets.  My complaint is paying the highest price for an on-campus sticker, and not having the right to park on campus in a ""15 min parking"" spot between the hours of 7 and 4 pm.  Ridiculous."
College Senior,1,School is racist - This is just sucks and its very racist!
College Senior,1,"Public Safety – The SIUC staff will call the police on anyone that is black. You don't have to do a crime or anything. I guess in major cities they dont have time for bull crap. In Carbondale, IL the police and grown adults at SIUC have nothing better else to do."

Alum,5,"This is one of the best colleges in the U.S. The care of your fellow classmates is rivaled by that of the professors. People just want to get to know you. They. Care. The community is terrific. You are challenged heavily, but, as we say, strength rejoices in the challenge. You are quite prepared for every circumstance if you really listened to what was going on. No one will tell you what to think, but, in a philosophical way, you will develop an understanding how to take in and articulate information. Self-government is crucial. It isn't for everyone, only those who are ready to take on a ""philosophical habit of mind""."
Alum,5,"The professors guide you step by step through your journey. They will point you toward truth and goodness. I loved most of my professors. They aren't perfect, but nothing is perfect. One of my biggest regrets of college is not getting to know them better. They are ready and willing to pour into you. You just need to go out and get it."
Sophomore,5,"The professors are incredibly invested in making sure the students flourish academically, relationally, mentally, and spiritually. I appreciate their involvement in all aspects of my life."
Sophomore,5,"All of my teachers had a different style for online classes, and all of them did a wonderful job. They made themselves very available for help and office hours either over email or phone. They all put a lot of work into making the experience better for students."
Alum,5,"provides classes to the public that are not for credit, lectured by some of the best professors at the school - but I did all classes in person"
Alum,5,"the best school in the country, incomparable teaching staff, wonderful students, wouldn't have chosen any other school for undergrad"
Alum,5,"Hillsdale College offers rigorous academics and an excellent campus environment. Professors are top-notch and actually know their students. Hillsdale students are highly ambitious, yet they also prioritize cultivating lasting friendships during their college years. My time at Hillsdale challenged me academically and gave me some of the best memories of my life."
Niche User,5,I personally feel that I will academically excel at Hillsdale College because of the wonderful teachers and the atmosphere. The liberal arts education at Hillsdale College is very special.
Niche User,5,I loved everything about Hillsdale.  It is the perfect small-town campus with great academics and athletics.  Would highly recommend to anyone and everyone.
Alum,5,"I will forever be indebted to Hillsdale College. This school taught me not only the lessons needed to thrive in medical school where I am today, but showed me what kind of person I could and wanted to become. It is due the the close relationships formed with my classmates and modeled by all those around me, the hours poured out to me in office hours with infinitely caring professors, the time in music practice rooms and library nooks and science labs that taught me persistence - all of these things and more have made me who I am today and taught me how to continue down a path of selflessness and compassion. My time at Hillsdale was a beautiful, beautiful challenge that I wish every young person could experience. It is not for the faint of heart; it is for those who desire truth and value learning and are open to being molded so that they can willingly and happily walk towards the Good."
Senior,5,"I have absolutely loved my time at Hillsdale. The academics are tough, but it’s insanely hard to get in. So, if you can make it in, you can handle the challenge typically. People say the party scene is lacking but every one of my friends that has come from other state schools has been unable to handle the parties at Hillsdale. Because the school is so small, everyone practically knows everyone so people go to party for fun, not to impress people. 10/10 would recommend for a school or even just a weekend party."
Sophomore,5,"Hillsdale College is incredibly rigorous, often taking 80+ hour work weeks. The professors are excellent, the classes are informative, and it has been a fantastic experience. While the core curriculum is a few courses too long, I could not recommend it enough."
Junior,5,"There is no other college out there like Hillsdale. The community is incredibly close, the professors care, and the student opportunities are endless. It's not without its administrative issues, but the good far outweighs any bad. Don't worry if you don't come from an extremely conservative or religious background, because there is truly a place for everyone here, and the political/religious culture is not at all dominating if you don't want it to be (i.e. you have to seek it out). You can be a part of many different communities and organizations both on and off campus. The classes here are rigorous but doable, and professors genuinely care. The relationships I've built with professors, the involvement I've had in my department, and the leadership opportunities I've found on campus will all aide me in applying to graduate school and out in the real world. On top of that, the friendships and memories that I've made have given me the college experience I've always wanted."
Niche User,5,Hillsdale college is a very well kept and safe college. As a student looking at colleges I always bring up this college when people talk to me about what college I want to attend. The dorms were well kept unlike some other colleges. Every Freshman dorm hold up to 4 people and have there own bathroom. This is a very big deal considering most colleges have large bathrooms for every floor of the dorm building. Hillsdale has great values and is a great place to learn.
Niche User,5,"Hillsdale has the most charming campus, each season is displayed beautifully.  The professors are dedicated to their work, which to them takes more time than just one class hour; it extends to outside the classroom.  The student body consists of kindest people...they exemplify the connection we all have to each other through humanity"
Junior,5,"The friends you make are phenomenal and the professors are dedicated, gracious, and so willing to work with you and encourage you in your studies and goals."
Freshman,5,"I love this school! The classes and professors are outstanding and really push you to your limits. It is incredibly engaging and fascinating every day and I can honestly I was never bored in my classes.  The professors are so kind and caring and invested in their students. Office hours seem a little daunting at first but as soon as you start talking with the professors you feel all the anxiety fade and take part in wonderful and enlightening conversations. I really do love the majority of the core classes here at Hillsdale because they allow you to experience just about every major area of study and open your eyes to new subject you never knew you liked. I cannot say enough good things about the school except for the food which is not quite as amazing. That being said, all other aspects of the school are truly outstanding in my opinion."
Sophomore,5,"Hillsdale is a college like no other, as they put it, ""what college is meant to be. Don't be fooled by the press; here exists a haven of open and diverse academic exchange. It will push you, it will challenge every belief you currently hold, and you will come out stronger if you let the struggle do its work in you."
Freshman,5,"Amazing education, environment, and teachers. They truly care about who you become and that you’re completely being educated. The students are for the most part studious yet very fun. The culture is great. It is also in a beautiful location. There is a lake nearby with trails for hiking, running, biking, etc. You can rent canoes and paddle boards for the lake. While it is a small school, sports can be very exciting and the school has a lot of spirit. Overall great experience. Would completely recommend, just as long as you go there expecting to be challenged. Expect to work hard. You will be rewarded. The teachers take time to get to know you personally; you are not just a number in the books. Some of the classes are also based off of student participation which adds a great element to learning."
Sophomore,5,Hillsdale College is a school that offers an amazing community to grow in as well as an incredible education.
Niche User,5,"Hillsdale College is a phenomenal choice for any student devoted to higher learning.  The course load is rigorous so anticipate that the high school GPA which you have gotten used to will take quite a hit once you get on campus. Nevertheless, the top notch professors and well crafted curriculum makes all of the late nights and early mornings seem worthwhile.

Hillsdale is not a “party school”.  You can still have fun on Friday and Saturday nights, but don’t expect to find any state-school-level darties come springtime.  With the amount of time you will spend studying in order to maintain a decent GPA, you would be lucky to go out two nights a week anyway.

Hillsdale is a unique school to say the least.  From the fact that it has one of (if not the largest) core liberal arts curriculum in the country to it’s trailblazing history of government independence, a strong sense of pride exists among the students and faculty for belonging to such an institution as Hillsdale College."
Niche User,5,I love Hillsdale because of the vibrant student life and the stellar academics. Anyone who receives a Hillsdale education possesses the tools to become a very successful person. The town of Hillsdale is a lovey little town and the residents are friendly to the students and there are many employment opportunities for the students.
Sophomore,5,"Hillsdale College is providing a stellar, mind-broadening education for me and many others. The community and academics are both wonderful."
Sophomore,5,"Great school. Very different place in that it’s secluded and tightly govenered. You have your students and then your athletes. Both very smart, but very different people!!"
Alum,5,"Hillsdale changed my life for the better.  There is no other college out there like Hillsdale.  If you want a quality education that will make you a better human being, look at Hillsdale. The core curriculum and the rigorous study in and out of the classroom provides students with the tools to be agile critical thinkers that will be productive members of society."
Alum,5,The liberal arts education is exceptional and on par with Ivy League colleges. The professors make every class a journey into the nature of man and what it means to be good.
Freshman,5,"Hillsdale College prepares students in every way to become independent, successful, disciplined, and well-rounded citizens who engage in their communities and are life-long learners. The academics are rigorous for all students in any major, and faculty and advisors are invested in helping students meet their goals. The College provides an excellent climate for diversity, which is present and will hopefully continue to increase. Hillsdale is dedicated to its mission and turns out alumni who are passionate about encouraging future classes."
Freshman,5,"The college is small but that makes everyone know most everyone else, so everyone is very nice here. People always smile at you when they walk past, even if they don't know who you are. It's known for it's academic rigor, and it really can't be overstated how hard it is here. Some of the athletes don't study all the time, but for the most part, everyone is focused on academics. That makes for a pretty good party scene since people want to unwind after a long week, but there are tons of other options if you don't want to go out on the weekends."
Niche User,5,Hillsdale is an amazing school! I went on a high study aboard program in June to England. I got to stay on campus an experience life as a student. The professors were so incredible and a treat to be able to talk with. Everyone was very friendly.  
College Junior,5,Hillsdale College is highly respected and valued in employers.
College Junior,5,"Greek life is pretty significant. It is definitely unique from many other schools, but still a ton of fun."
College Junior,5,"My experience has been incredible. I love the small student body, small classes, and tight community.  Everyone knows everyone and know how to have a good time."
College Freshman,5,"My favorite aspect of Hillsdale College is the student body size, small classes and discussion style lectures."
College Freshman,5,Hillsdale College is widely known for their investment in students and the quality of its graduates.
College Freshman,5,The college did a wonderful job of fulfilling my housing request and roommate matching.
College Freshman,5,Hillsdale College makes an incredible investment in the academic and personal success of its students.  I experienced the support as a prospective student.  Their investment was readily apparent at Freshmen Orientation and meetings with my student advisor during the first few weeks of the semester.
College Senior,5,"Without a doubt our professors care deeply about their students. By in large the professors are also very excellent in class. Office hours are very helpful, even crucial to a good Hillsdale experience"
College Senior,5,Great connections and help from the school. The only way it will get better is with time as students continue to spread out across the country and world.
College Senior,5,Safest place on earth. There have been no student thefts in about 11 years. People save their spots in cafe/library with macbooks and wallets
College Senior,5,I loved living in Simpson dorm my first two years. Great community all around. Tons of fun (and shenanigans)
College Senior,5,"The commitment to the Liberal Arts at Hillsdale College, i.e., understanding what makes us human and therefore how best to live fulfilling lives, and the way in which all of my studies speak to this question, is what makes Hillsdale unique. The professors are also incredible. I have had 3 hour lunches 1 on 1 with my professors in our cafeteria; I meet with them regularly in their office; I have even had a beer with my German Professor at a local bar. The students. The students here cap off why attending Hillsdale is one of the most enjoyable and fruitful experiences of my life. They are friendly, helpful, challenging, intelligent, and always pushing me to new heights."
College Freshman,5,The school is unlike any other school in America. This school is a small liberal arts college focused on the betterment of the men and women enrolled. The core is what makes Hillsdale College stand out. You read historical texts and great books in detail and have enlightening discussions both inside and outside the classroom. The social atmosphere is one of maturity and intelligence while at the same time being extraordinarily fun.
College Freshman,5,"It's extremely safe, I don't even lock my doors..."
College Freshman,5,A Hillsdale degree sets you up for the future like no other.
College Freshman,5,I play a sport here and it's probably the best part about being here!
College Freshman,5,"All of my classes and professors have been excellent so far. Professors are required to teach all classes and hold regular office hours. In my experience, they are eager to teach and discuss in office hours -- they're truly passionate about their subjects. Class sizes are pretty small -- my biggest class had about 20 or 25 students and my smallest had 9."
College Freshman,5,"Hillsdale provides a high-quality, rigorous education and a warm, vibrant community of students and professors. It's highly academic but also provides many opportunities for social engagement and volunteer activities -- overall, it fosters a great environment for students who want a well-rounded college experience. Its small size allows it to provide unique opportunities to a large percentage of its students -- e.g., as a freshman I was able to write for the student newspaper and take a class with a famous journalist. Professors are top-notch and teach all of their classes (which are generally small). This was my dream school, and it's exceeded my expectations."
College Junior,5,"I would have never participated in Greek life at a state school, but at Hillsdale you get what you want out of your participation in Greek life. I want it to be a big part of my college experience, so it is, but for others it's less about the social aspect and more about the philanthropic or academic aspects."
College Sophomore,5,It's the people. Hillsdale is an amazing place with so much to offer both in the classroom and around campus. I am so glad to call the place home!
College Sophomore,5,"I love Hillsdale College. As a school, what makes us unique is that Hillsdale doesn't accept any federal funds, so we're able to do more of what we feel is best in providing a great education. Our core curriculum involves delving into a variety of different subjects so that we can better understand the world around us and learn how to think in different ways. One thing that I love about Hillsdale is the people that you meet and the community that is formed. I've been able to grow as a unique individual while learning how to build lasting relationships. Hillsdale isn't just about the studies so that one can get a job in the future, we're about the people and learning how to better develop ourselves so that we can make an impact in this world."
College Freshman,5,Its the right balance because it's not too crazy but its definitely not boring.
College Freshman,5,"The campus security here is great. They are always driving around at night, and they will come help you out if you forgot your keys, or if your nervous about walking somewhere at night, they'll come and give you a ride. The campus is also very brightly lit, making walking back to the dorms at night feel a lot safer."
College Freshman,5,"We have an Honor Code. It's strict, but students totally respect it. It makes for a safe environment, and a good time."
College Freshman,5,The school is super generous. Great donor team!
College Freshman,5,"Bon Appetite is delish! Great variety, great people."
College Freshman,5,The community and social experience is incredible. No division between classes. Everyone is friendly. No regrets.
College Sophomore,5,"Hillsdale provides a wonderful variety of classes. As a liberal arts college, there is a focus on the (required) Core classes that provide an insight into all areas of expertise. However, Hillsdale is recognized mostly for its great courses in History, Political Science, Politics and English."
College Sophomore,5,"This campus is run very carefully and strictly. Students flourish under the regulations, as they know they are being taken care of and are watched over for their own safety."
College Freshman,5,"You can find alcohol if you want but you have to look. Drug users are asked to leave the school if caught which I find attractive because there is no pressure to start burning. Again, you can drink but it's not recommended given the work load."
College Sophomore,5,"Campus is the way every mom and dad should be. The rules are there to keep you safe. They tell you why the rules exist and enforce them accordingly. It's not a military dictatorship but if you misbehave you will get in trouble. That being said,  as long as your fun doesn't risk your safety or that of someone else or school property, they really don't care. They don't police everything you do, and you don't get in trouble for stupid stuff every time you turn around. But if they see you doing something harmful you'll get in trouble for your own protection. It goes with the general overarching principle that governs campus: it's all about personal freedom within the limits of the common good. That sounds really corny, I know, it sounds like the website (which is ALL about impressing the donors and completely not an accurate representation of the kids that go here, btw), but it's true. It's the Hillsdale way. It's about keeping everybody safe and happy. They're strict but not oppressive."
Sophomore,4,"Students at Hillsdale College have an opportunity to get a great education and become better wo/men. Although academics are very tough and you are not always having fun, it is definitely worth it."
Sophomore,4,Hillsdale College is one of the best undergraduate educations anyone could receive.  The strong liberal arts value in the core curriculum teaches the student how to think and articulate his or her opinion.
Sophomore,4,"The core curriculum is very heavy, but it exposes you to many different subjects. All facilities are well maintained and it is easy to get around campus. Dining on campus is very limited."
Senior,4,"The professors really care about their students, and that's why I chose Hillsdale. My professors have truly mentored me and gotten to know me, and I don't know if that would've happened at a larger college. The conservative Christian atmosphere is overbearing but you can find your people if you're not conservative–it's just a little more difficult."
Freshman,4,"I have attended Hillsdale for almost a year now, and it has been great! The professors sincerely care about the students' education and are always there for them. Since it is a small college, the community is tightly-knit; students can hardly walk across campus without saying hello to at least one person, students have movie nights and mixers together, and sometimes will even be invited to dine at professors' houses. Hillsdale is academically challenging, which creates an excellence that allows students to self-govern, and discover how to think."
Freshman,4,"I didn't know if I would like it, but I gave it a chance and I'm glad I did. Small and conservative, totally not me, but I'm found The right people and it's so fun. Couldn't ask for a better place to spend 4 years. Strong classics education and wonderful people and professors."
College Junior,4,"Drug scene is very minimal, alcohol use prominent, but safely done.  It is popular, but not required."
College Junior,4,"The campus is very safe, and people are very respectful of others' property."
College Junior,4,"Everything is close, people are very chill."
College Freshman,4,"We're DII, but people still come out to watch the football games and some come to other sporting events like volleyball and soccer. We only have 1400 students, but we still get a lot of fans (many of them are townies). The athletic facilities are actually great, especially for non-athletes (the weight room isn't that big but has a ton of equipment). The athletes get lots of free clothes and free laundry. Homecoming week is also really big and people go all out."
College Freshman,4,"Hillsdale is small, which I like because it's easy to walk everywhere and I know many of the students that I pass when walking. Most of the classes aren't as hard intellectually as I expected coming in, but they assign a lot of homework which is where the stress comes in. Most of the students spend most of their time either studying or at their clubs or sports practices."
College Freshman,4,Our safety and security building is very visible and centrally located.  We can call for a security escort anytime we have a concern.
College Freshman,4,Those involved in the Greek life seem eager to include all students and provide a service to the campus community.
College Freshman,4,Tickets for our college sports are included with our fees so it is easy for most students to participate.
College Senior,4,"I love the location of Hillsdale- it's far away from distractions and helps me really get to know my peers and my professors. I really like how safe and nurturing it is, but it can be difficult to access things like shopping, transportation, etc. The people are very kind and welcoming, but I do think there's a lack of diversity and worldly discussion. In general, people agree on the same things, live similarly, etc. I think it would be good for the whole campus to be more exposed to different cultures, point of views, opinions, etc. rather than just reinforcing what most kids already come to the school believing. I do get a lot of help from my professors, which I had a hard time finding at the state school where I transferred from. Overall it's a great school, I absolutely love the snow and the new experience coming from the west coast, but I think it could benefit from some diversity."
College Senior,4,"Pretty high student involvement. Almost everyone either plays a varsity, club, or IM sport."
College Freshman,4,"For being a small liberal arts college with 1400 students, Hillsdale College competes in Division II of NCAA Athletics. Students rally behind basketball, baseball, volleyball and softball. Football is supported but does not carry as much as those previously listed."
College Freshman,4,Once you find you way and niche of people on campus it is so much better than any state school or other private institutions.
College Freshman,4,"The newer dorms are fantastic, the older ones are pretty average. There's a great mix of people in the dorms."
College Freshman,4,I generally enjoy those in Greek Life. There's a fraternity or sorority for everyone here.
College Freshman,4,You're going to have your tough classes and then there are the classes that you will really enjoy. There will be a week where it'll be a grind and you will struggle a bit but other than that the course load is very manageable. Most professors are exceptional.
College Freshman,4,"Hillsdale's small size allows it to offer students a close network of alumni, donors, and friends of the school. It has a vibrant internship program in Washington, D.C. and several study-abroad opportunities. The career services center is very helpful -- the staff really gets to know students and frequently hosts (free!) lunches for students to learn about an aspect of applying for job or internship -- e.g. how to write a resume, how to prepare for an interview, etc."
College Freshman,4,"I've only lived in one dorm (McIntyre), and it's been a great experience -- free washing machines (not true in all the dorms), spacious rooms, two full-size kitchens and two kitchenettes for cooking. This dorm was just renovated over the summer, so admittedly not all the dorms have these amenities."
College Freshman,4,"Greek houses put on several fundraisers and charity events per semester. About a third of the student body participates in Greek life -- generally there is some prestige in joining, but no pressure to do so."
College Freshman,4,"Hillsdale participates in Division II sports (impressive for its small size). Some varsity teams are top-notch (e.g. women's cross-country), others not so much (e.g. football). School spirit is pretty good, and the school makes an effort to boost fan support by hosting rallies, bookstore discounts after a victory, etc. Hillsdale also has a variety of intramural and club sports."
College Junior,4,We have security monitors that rove around campus almost all hours of the day that make you feel very safe.
College Junior,4,"I would appreciate some more different class offerings, but most classes provide a great classical education."
College Junior,4,Most professors really care about students progress and participation in class.
College Junior,4,Many employers recognize the school name and appreciate the students commitment to learning and hard work.
College Sophomore,4,Hillsdale College provides a fantastic and unique learning experience that will help you understand and commit to change the world around you for the better.
College Junior,4,"I have felt at home at Hillsdale from the moment I got on campus. The people are delightful and warm, the professors truly care and there are lots of opportunities for involvement and leadership on campus. The only thing I can complain about is a slight lack of diversity. Most students are similar in their views, and while there are many differences amongst the student body, it would be nice to see some more quirky, different students."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There's not a ton of variety as far as ethnic food goes, but the food we do have is really great. There are a lot of mom and pop type places with excellent food. The best burger is at pub and grub, Finish Line has excellent breakfast (and super cheap!), and Johnny T's has nicer food if you want to get some good, free food when your parents come to visit."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Living on campus is fine. There are lots of options for different styles of living. The Suites may be the best in my opinion. It's set up like an apartment with 4 rooms for 4 people with 2 bathrooms, a living room, and a kitchenette. The building is clearly cheaply made, with very little sound proofing, but it's comfortable to live in and a nicer option than many of the regular dorms if you want your own room. The freshmen dorms for girls are McIntyre and Olds. McIntyre is 2 per room with a shared bathroom between two rooms. Olds has community style bathrooms. Both are nice freshmen dorms."
College Freshman,4,"Several small restaurants are within walking distance of campus. Some are open very late to accommodate college students, which is convenient."
College Freshman,4,The financial aid advisers took my family's situation into consideration when giving me a loan. It was a reasonable amount considering my other scholarships.
College Freshman,4,"Many of the dorms are old, but several have had recent upgrades. Most do not have full kitchens, but the college is beginning to implement these, starting with Olds Dormitory. The rooms are on the small side, but the community in each dorm is fantastic."
College Freshman,4,I had no problems with the financial aid process.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus is very convenient. All the dorms are close to campus and are kept reasonably clean. The RAs are helpful and nice.
College Freshman,4,"The football games are always well attended, and the students show good school spirit. The sports facilities are very good, with a gym for average students and athletes alike, and a climbing wall was just put in, with new tennis courts in construction right now."
College Freshman,4,"The financial aid application process is very simple, and the college is really great about trying to help students with finances because Hillsdale College doesn't accept federal loans from the government."
College Freshman,4,You can avoid the bad stuff if you want. Swing club is the best. Great discipline.
College Sophomore,4,"Hillsdale is blessed to have received many donations to provide a state-of-the-art athletic facility, track, indoor track, basketball courts, rock climbing wall, etc."
College Sophomore,4,There are many options that BonAppetit serves the students. There are new meals every night and a mix of 6 different stations of freshly cooked food.
College Sophomore,4,"Parties are held by the individual fraternities and sororities. Student Activities Board puts on many events, as well. All are carefully watched and students are assisted if necessary. All are taken care of and made sure they are safe."
College Sophomore,4,Men and women are studious and hard working; they respect one another and support each other through the academic rigor of Hillsdale.
College Sophomore,4,"Hillsdale College is founded upon religious freedom at a college. The school is comprised of students of many races, beliefs and religions, all accepting of one another and grounded upon the ideas of our country's founding: liberty, virtue, and hard work."
College Freshman,4,Security has a pretty big presence here and does their job very well
College Freshman,4,They redid my dorm this summer which was really nice and there are plans to redo some of the older dorms in the future
College Freshman,4,This process went very well and I interviewed for a leadership scholarship.  Contact people and they will be very willing to help you out
College Freshman,4,Very surprised at the amount of vegetables. They really have great food.
College Freshman,4,Lots of Greeks but they keep to themselves mostly.
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are pretty good. They're a little tired, but there's some renovations going on right now so that might improve. There's usually a kitchen, albeit an extremely small one. The dorms are really secure, people almost never lock their doors and there's no theft. All the dorms have wifi. There are toasters, microwaves and extremely well-stocked vending machines. There are visiting hours in place in all dorms for visitors of the opposite sex, although they are reasonable (until 12 or 1 most nights). All dorms are single-sex. I really like the Hillsdale dorm culture, it's a great place to live. You can be social if you want, but if you want a quiet spot to retreat and have your space there's that too."
College Senior,4,You can get what you need.
College Freshman,4,"The housing on campus is actually really nice. After visiting some other campuses, I found that the spacious rooms of the McIntyre dorm were rather comfortable. Also, each dorm tends to have a close-knit community."
College Freshman,4,"Hillsdale has a bunch of neat events to go to in the evenings. Especially with the Improv Club held on Friday nights last year, the Zumba classes, late night movies and other events."
College Freshman,4,"The campus computer labs are great--there are several both for macs and pcs. One of my favourite things is that you can check laptops out of the student union front desk, so if you're not going to need the computer for a lot, that's a great option! I could survive fairly happily without my own computer, but I like the convenience of being able to take my computer wherever I want."
College Freshman,4,"I've been somewhat surprised by the diversity on campus--Hillsdale puts forward a very unified front, and while a large percentage of the student body is conservative, there are a fair number of liberals, and the religions differ widely. Most of the campus agrees on just enough issues to show how different our beliefs really are."
College Freshman,4,"I don't party, so my definition of nightlife may be wonky, but I personally love the ability to walk into the student union late at night, run into a group of friends, and have a great time talking, playing cards, and eating ice cream."
College Freshman,4,"I have personally never had any safety concerns. It's generally a good idea not to walk back to your dorm late at night by yourself, but security is really great, and will be happy to give you a ride if you call them! Campus itself is extremely safe, but definitely use caution if going into town late at night--don't walk by yourself."
College Freshman,4,"I highly recommend the Hunt Club. It's really close to campus--not more than twenty minute walk--and the food is not only really good, it's fairly inexpensive, and the atmosphere is extremely welcoming and friendly. It is not a fast food restaurant, so make sure you have time to wait, but it's worth every minute."
Recent Alumnus,2,"They are in general a pretty strict administration and very controlling over your everyday life. In many of the dorms there are very strict visitation hours, such as only on Wednesday nights and the weekends for women's dorms. It's to the point that it's pretty ridiculous."
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of school spirit but the facilities are awesome. Athletes keep to themselves.
College Freshman,2,Almost exclusively fast food. Nothing special at all.
College Sophomore,2,"If you want to party, you can, but you have to actively go out looking for it. Most of the really wild parties happen at off campus houses. That being said, I know such houses exist, but I couldn't tell you where they are. TYou will *never* be pressured to come to a party. The partiers pretty much know who they are and keep to themselves. You will never see drunk people wandering around campus. Ever. Except maybe Centralhallapalooza. I once talked to someone who'd been going there for three years and didn't believe Hillsdale partiers actually existed. Well, they do. But you have to know where to look."
College Sophomore,2,"Hillsdale is a tiny little town in rural Michigan. All the on-campus dining options close around midnight, and there is exactly one place to get food, a sit-down pancake-type restaurant, that I know of that is open after midnight. It is so frustrating, especially during finals week. There is Little Caesar's and Subway and McDonalds. I think maybe Taco Bell somewhere. Limited options within extremely limited time frames."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid application process is just fine, not a pain at all. However, they tend to be really stingy with giving out grant money. I got less than half of what I was offered at other schools. I didn't qualify for need-based aid, so I don't know how they are with that. I know people who have struggled and got a lot of help though."
College Freshman,2,There is not much around except a few fast-food.
College Freshman,2,It's really just not great. The food is plain and repetitive. Everyone is forced to get a food plan which is pretty expensive and not great value. It's best to get a block plan so you can use Charger Change at AJ's which has good caffeine drinks and pretty yummy food. 
College Sophomore,2,Bad food. Horribly expensive. Buy groceries
College Freshman,2,"Many people are similar in their religious/political beliefs at Hillsdale College. 
There isn't much racial diversity either."
College Freshman,2,The nightlife sucks because Hillsdale is in the middle of no where.
College Sophomore,2,"Between fraternity and off-campus parties, there's something every weekend, but not really on weeknights.  There's one bar/restaurant in town, but for actual clubs you're going to have to drive pretty far."
College Freshman,2,"The police force is not overly strict from what I have experienced, however the College is way more strict. You also have RA's to be concerned that will report you to the house mom and or the deans. The College is fair with their dealings with anything illegal, just be aware that there maybe a warning that you must take seriously so that there will not be any too serious of consequences."
College Freshman,2,"Saga food is not the best, slowly but surely you'll be able to pick out the food that is good to eat and what to eat ever. Aj's is a great alternative for food, just be sure to sign up for the 200 bock meal plan so you have some money put aside that you may use at the cafe."
College Freshman,2,"Campus Dining is not good. SAGA food has a tendency to get very old. Often if you ate something for lunch one day, it will end up ""redone"" the next day in a new, disgusting form. The food is bland, and as a freshman, you eat it all the time, for almost every meal. Also, SAGA owns AJ's Cafe (which is MUCH better than the SAGA cafeteria) so they are the only name on campus. There is quite a monopoly and no room for different food types. 

However, I give SAGA credit - cooking in bulk is not easy - it just makes eating miserable for students."
College Sophomore,2,SMALL TOWN – There is NO where to shop other than a kroger or walmart. Not much to do for the nightlife scene other than campus parties. The only sports events we can attend are our own teams' events.
College Sophomore,2,No Variety – Hillsdale is a small city and there rally isn't a lot of options for college students.
College Sophomore,2,"It Is a Small Town.  That About Says It. There are plenty of mellow hang outs in town, coffee shops etc.  This is a study school.  I am new to it so I really don't know all of the ins and outs yet, but from what I saw upon visiting, it is really campus focused.  There are plenty of activities and events on campus, a great gym and sports network.  I am not sure about the parties yet.  Transportation seems to be lacking as it is a rural area.  I think all of this is overshadowed by the education you get.  It might not be a party school, but it is very strong in many areas and if you are a laid back type, you might like the small town feel."
College Senior,2,"Clubs Nonexistent – As far as city/town nightlife goes, Hillsdale doesn't have much to offer. There are a few bars and more than a few great restaurants to hit, but as far as dance clubs or hookah bars or any other ""nightlife"" places, Hillsdale doesn't have any. However, on-campus parties definitely happen! The difference between Hillsdale College and other schools is that the students are fun and responsible."
College Sophomore,2,"When It Rains, It Pours. It can be very cold in the later parts of the year with a lot of rain and ice. However the walk to class isn't very far and it's nothing a good coat and umbrella can't handle."
Senior,1,"Many of the courses has great materials but they also had a political bent that went beyond the facts. If you are not politically right in your thinking and anti-government, then this is not the college for you"
Freshman,1,"If you do not have a religious background and religion is not a big part of your life, then Hillsdale is not the place for you. Religion is everywhere you go and it seems to be the thing that everybody wants to talk about. The academics really are not any better than if you went to a public state university, the school is only rigorous because the professors love to grade things harshly. There is never anything to do on campus, nobody really goes to the football games or any sporting event. There is nothing to do in the town except for some fast food places. The rules for the dorms are way too strict, with visitation hours and rules about having the opposite sex in your room. If you are considering this school, I would highly suggest you don't come here because you can have a lot more fun, get a better education, and get a proper college experience at any public state university."
College Freshman,1,parties are not really the thing at hillsdale. You can find them but they aren't prevalent
College Senior,1,"We have about 3 african american people on campus - one of which is the Assistant Dean of Men. Although the school is not technically affiliated with any religion, everyone is some kind of Christian and if you are not, be warned: you will be considered some kind of heathen and constantly bombarded with people trying to convert you."
College Freshman,1,"There is no drug use that is seen on campus. Drinking occurs, but moderately and only on weekend nights typically. Students are so focused on studying that only 1 out of the 7 nights of the week (Saturday) is usually ever used for a break from academics."
College Sophomore,1,Hillsdale is a horrible town to go to college in.  There is very little to do in the surrounding area.  Not much occurs off campus.
College Freshman,1,"There is very few ethnic diversity here at Hillsdale, and for being one of the very few hispanic students here it was slightly uncomfortable at first. However, the students here don't have any focus on race and are not racist in any way. The economic background is varied and not full of wealthy students as many have been mislead to believe. Most of the students and professors are strongly conservative but open to other political perspectives About 99% of the students are Christian and some are very particular to which church, being Lutheran, Baptist, or Catholic, you are a parishioner in. Typically religion is not an issue but there are quite a few students that are religious zealots, which leads to not many people having a different sexual orientation than heterosexual."
College Sophomore,1,"The Law Is the Law – No drugs for sure, the school only goes so far as to say it will be in accordance with Michigan law.  Michigan allows medical drug usage, but I do not know if anyone is testing this theory out."
College Sophomore,1,For It Is Written – Hillsdale is a really moral based campus which is great in a lot of ways.  Students say they can forget their laptops and come back and they are still there.  I really like not having to worry about things of that nature.  The honor code was really stressed as I was applying so I am assuming that they do not tolerate mistakes on that very much.
College Sophomore,1,"Not Much to Do – Hillsdale is TINY. The townies are nice (albiet sketchy), but the reality is there is not very much to do outside of campus. Students often go to Baw Bees (a nearby beach) when the weather is warm enough. Also Ann Arbor and East Lansing are each abot 2 hours away for those seeking shopping or more culture."
College Junior,1,It's cold and snowy for most of the months spent at school. On top of that Michigan weather can be unpredictable. Some days I ask myself why I choose to attend a school in Michigan...
College Senior,1,"Out of Control Strict! The administration knows ALL about you.  House mothers have been known to sneer at you, while leaving the dorm in the evening on Fridays or Saturdays.  One house mother ran after girls when they were in their halloween costumes because they were ""not modest enough."" They are most likely more strict and in your life than your own parents.  Students get in trouble for ridiculous things.  There are strict visiting hours in each dorm for the opposite sex, and they are CERTAINLY never allowed over night.  Even they are cracking down and enforcing visiting hours in the fraternity houses.  It is something that has to be accepted, and off-campus housing can be really really relaxing at times."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Only to the Airport for an Expensive Fee – The only transportation the school offers is a shuttle to the Detroit airport. It's schedule is spotty, and it's way expensive for the drive."

Freshman,5,"What i like about averett is that, their campus is wonderful, they have really amazing food here, great staff, and wonderful RA's!"
Freshman,5,"This is my first year here, but  some of the online learning experience is a little stressful, but i think i can get the hang of it.I feel like the professors knows what they are doing and teaching us the right materials. The teachers are very helpful when it comes to online classes"
Sophomore,5,My experience at Averett University was great ! I enjoyed the campus and its staff along with students. The teachers were awesome and made you really feel apart of the school academically . The Campus as a whole was beautiful and diverse with a family running it to become the best successors they can be!
Sophomore,5,Yes I did take some classes online due to the pandemic this year . The teachers were awesome with switching from a in the class type of teaching and online teaching. They worked really hard to get the materials you needed to succeed.
Niche User,5,"Averett University is a really nice school, I went there for tour a few months bachk and I was really amazed on the school environment and the students there were really nice and the football teamm is really great and i ust cant waint to attend this fall"
Senior,5,"I love Averett,  I am currently a senior at Averett majoring in Sports Medicine and Coaching. Averett is a great place to call home, its full of leadership opportunities, ways to advance in career development, and build outstanding relationships that will last a lifetime. Averett has helped develop me into a better leader, and person. It has helped me in many ways that no other bigger university could. If there was anything that I could change about my time at Averett, would be to go back and relive the best moments I have experienced there. Averett will always be a place I can call home, and I would never go back and change the decision of going there for my higher education."
Freshman,5,I’ve only been at Averett for a couple of months and it has already become a second home for me. I love the small classroom sizes and the connections I have with my teachers. I currently play football for Averett and my team has brought me as one of them. I wouldn’t trade my school for the world.
Junior,5,"Averett is a great college. The campus is small so you get the experience of interacting with not only the staff, but the president and dean of the school. There is help all around campus for traditional and international students. I would like the campus to expand the food variety for the students."
Sophomore,5,"Averett University has become my second home over the past year and a half. I like Averett because it is very easy to get involved with club and organizations in campus and it is also very easy to make friends and get to know people on campus. What I would lile to see change is the food and arranging for restaurants to be on campus and being able to use meal swipes in the restaurants. It would be easier to use meal swipes instead of our own money due to the fact that if we did not want to eat cafe food, we have more than the school store in the student center."
Junior,5,"Averett is an awesome campus! I've only went to their orientation, however, everyone there is very nice and helpful. Although the campus has a lot buildings, they do have a lot of programs and stuff that is beneficial to anyone that needs it!"
Freshman,5,Averett University is like my second home and it is very easy to meet new people when you arrive to the campus. I would like to see more student activities available for major events an more students involved.
Freshman,5,"Small classes allow for more one-on-one with professors, they care more about how their students are doing in the class. A lot of student involvement and activities available to students as well as a lot of help for writing/upcoming exams."
Freshman,5,I like the one on one connection with the teachers. Everyone is so helpful and wants you to be engaged on campus.
Freshman,5,"My experience from Averett University was really eye opening , by them being a small private college they have an family oriented atmosphere.They welcome you with open arms and purse you as if you were there own flesh and blood , they will love and care for you and give you great hospitality they have an amazing sport programs also theater etc.I wouldn't change anything about Averett they are very diverse and have an amazing education and high graduation rate."
Freshman,5,Averett it's best place to be. as a intenational student i feel myself very comfortable and everything is very eligible.
Alum,5,"I couldn't have better things to say about Averett University. Let me be clear - if you want a huge state school where you can walk into the cafeteria and no one will recognize you, Averett is not for you. But if you want to speak to almost everyone you pass on your way to class, have professors who take time to get to know you and will ask if y'all can catch up after you graduate, have the opportunity to take on leadership roles in your extra curricular activities, and become a part of a FAMILY, Averett should be your number one choice.

The professors and advisors are phenomenal. If you're wondering just how close of a relationship you make with the staff at Averett - my advisor has a picture of us hanging in her office from my senior pinning, and when going through a hard time in a leadership role, the president wrote me an encouraging handwritten letter. The relationships you make with the staff are exceptional."
Sophomore,5,"Averett University is a university that is all about big dreams and bold futures. For international students atleast, they create a loving atmosphere for their international students coming from all walks of life with open arms ready to teach and students ready to learn. I am now a sophomore at Averett University and i would recommend this to anybody."
Freshman,5,Averett University is a great school in a small area. They care about you as a person no matter where youre from. They make sure you are taking care of according to your needs and they will give your parents a peace of mind.
Senior,5,"The best thing about Averett University is that there is a close relationship between the student, the program of study, the advisors, and the instructors.  They are exceptional at making student specific adjustments so that a person can graduate on time.  There is a lot of support for students who are taking difficult classes like Calculus.  There are also a lot of very good transfer options for students who come from the community college system which saves a lot of money.  

The only problems I see with Averett University are related to the size of the school.   At around 300 students graduating per year, the undergraduate head count is probably around 1000 students.   Add in grad students and the entire school probably has no more than 1600 students at any given time.   This makes class availability something you must plan for.  Larger schools offer classes every semester rather than just once per year."
Senior,5,"What I liked:  Reasonable class sizes, lots of personal assistance when needed from staff and professors (try taking calculus III in a 200 seat stadium class compare to a class at AU -- it is much better).  If you do your work and make an effort you should get a valuable degree in 3-5 years.   AU works really closely with community colleges which is a great way to save a lot of money and end up with an Associates degree and a Bachelors which can be nice.

What I disliked:  Danville is a little 60 years ago.

Overall:  If you major in Education, Computers, or Business you will have no trouble finding a job.   If you complete a liberal arts major then you need to be very good at marketing yourself.   There are a lot of opportunities for grads from AU especially in Greensboro, Roanoke, and other nearby areas.   The school has a good local reputation."
Sophomore,5,Averett University is a great place to attend college.  I love the small class size. Professors are incredible always willing to provide one on one help.  Averett University has a lot of athletic programs to choose from.  The campus food is wonderful.  Campus security is every present and vigil there are more than adequate number of call boxes through out the campus.  Averett University is an multi nationality campus.  Many local events in Danville that happens near Averett University through out the year.
Sophomore,5,"Overall great school. I love the atmosphere, friendly staff, plenty of activities going on. The café has good food. Small campus, but still plenty going on to entertain students. Offers many academic programs and administrators are very willing to help you succeed."
Freshman,5,The students are friendly and welcoming. The professors are knowledgeable of their fields. Classes provide hands-on experience. The campus is compact.
Freshman,5,I HAVE BEEN THEIR ON ORIENTATION 3 TIMES. THE PEOPLE ARE GREAT.  THE CAMPUS IS LAYEDOUT IN A FRIENDLY ATMOSPHERE AND PARKING IS AMPLE AND FREE.  THE CAMPUS LAYS IN THE HEART OF DANVILLE.  THE PROFESSORS THAT I TALKED TO ARE PEOPLE FRIENDLY AND WANT THEIR STUDENTS TO LEARN AND AT THE SAME TIME HAVE A GREAT EXPERIENCE.  I CAN NOT WAIT TO GO THEIR IN JANUARY.
Recent Alumnus,5,"This will be my first year at Averett University.  However, my siblings attended Averett and are now very successful.  I am looking forward to my own experience."
College Sophomore,5,Have not heard of any drug or alcohol abuse on campus.
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone there are very friendly  and willing to give a helping hand when you need it. The staff there are eager to encourage you to keep pushing through, no matter how bad the struggle is."
College Sophomore,5,I haven't heard of anything bad happening on the campus
College Sophomore,5,I have had the most amazing time this year at school... yes I have struggled with my classes but my advisers have been wonderful.
College Sophomore,5,The classes are challenging and I love the athletics.
College Freshman,5,"We have a center for career advancement, and they are super helpful with landing internships and jobs and working on resumes. Weekly emails and Moodle updates provide us access to jobs and internships in the area."
College Freshman,5,You are treated like a family member
College Freshman,5,This school is really what YOU make it!
College Freshman,5,I don't see diversity at our university everyone is equal.
College Freshman,5,As an athlete the fields are great
College Sophomore,5,There are a ton of international students
College Sophomore,5,"Yes, you get to student teach in surrounding schools"
College Sophomore,5,If you graduate from Averett with an education you are guaranteed to be hired in school in the community.
College Sophomore,5,Professors are concerned about the students' education and there is many opportunities for tutoring if needed.
College Sophomore,5,"If there's one thing Danville has, it's restaurants. In addition to a variety of fast food restaurants and sit down chain restaurants, there are so many local restaurants that just can't be beat in just about any type of food you can think of."
College Sophomore,5,"If you like a small (southern) town where people are friendly and personable, you will love Danville. There are things to do here but if a college student is looking for nightlife such as clubbing you will have to drive to the NC border, which is at most 25 minutes away from campus. There are really good restaurants here and some nice shopping centers. Danville is small though, so someone used to a big city atmosphere might find it more boring."
College Junior,5,"It was very easy to get into my program. I needed to provide a resume, registration fee and transcripts and I was immediately signed up."
College Junior,5,"Averett University communicates with its student and staff via email and text messages. In the event of hazardous weather conditions, school is delayed or cancelled. This is great because it shows AU cares about our safety. Thus making my campus experience exceptional."
College Junior,5,"AU is a safe campus, throughout its satellite campuses."
College Sophomore,5,"The process of financial aid went smoothly. School is a little expensive. If there were more scholarships offered to help out the people in need, that could benefit the students here. Also, if there were more scholarships for students who maintain a 3.0 that would also benefit the students. Students could stay in school and not have to sit out for a semester to work and then come back."
College Sophomore,5,"To sum up my overall experience, there isn't a day where I absolutely hate this school. Whenever I'm feeling down in my classes or on normal days, there is always someone here to encourage me and lift me up. My favorite experience here at Averett is that I get to meet new people. Everyone here is nice and sociable. If I could choose all over again, I wouldn't change my choice of coming here because we are changing as a community."
College Sophomore,5,The campus is very accepting of many students. No one will treat anyone differently. Everyone is considered equal here at Averett University.
College Sophomore,5,Averett University has the best non-athlete and athlete program which causes students to enjoy extracurricular activities.
College Freshman,5,Not much alcohol and drug use at averett
College Freshman,5,Ive never seen so many computer labs in a school like  this school
College Freshman,5,Very diverse at this school
College Freshman,5,"The classes I have taken so far are excellent and the teachers are very understanding and easy to get along with. I like that they treat you like adults and actual college students. And while I may not like them when I'm studying, the tests are worthy of COLLEGE students."
College Freshman,5,"Averett University was by the far the prettiest and cleanest campus I had ever visited when I was college hunting.  Everything is close by and the facilities are in top notch condition.  When you arrive you think to yourself ""Wow I could really call this place a second home"".  There are plenty of clubs and groups to join and Averett does a good job of introducing the incoming freshmen to these clubs and groups through a club fair they host at the beginning of every semester.  There are beautiful green areas for students to lay out on the lawn and the groundskeepers do an amazing job of making the campus look incredible to not just the incoming students but to the students already there.  There are plenty of places for students to hang out such as the front porch tot he Main building of the school."
College Freshman,5,"There is just about every single kind of person on campus.  We have plenty of exchange students from many countries like England, Sweeden, Finland, Jamaica, and many others.  All sorts of personalities and groups to join as well, but its not divided.  Its a good collective group."
College Junior,5,"The staff at Averett were very helpful during the process of coming back to school. I was nervous, as an adult coming back to school, and I was just really thankful for their help."
College Sophomore,5,something unique about my school is that they have an aeronautics program.
College Sophomore,5,mostly everything on campus is very clean and helpful and easy to reach.
College Freshman,5,"There are all sorts of different people here; city, country, and all in between. I have made friends from this state, boring states, vermont, and other countries. It is a very diverse school. There are a lot of southern girls though!"
College Freshman,5,"Classes are close to the dorms, and the weather is pretty mild. It was a little sticky and muggy in August, but it wasn't to bad for a VA summer. So far fall has been really nice, breezy and a little chilly, but perfect hoodie and jeans weather, nothing to cold, and its a nice change from the heat."
College Junior,5,Very Nice – I recieved a financial package within weeks of submition of my application.  I chose this school because the scholarships were incredible and the process to get it was simple and there was always someone there to help point you in the right direction.
Freshman,4,Its great! Classes aren't big so professors know you and can help you a lot easier and all the administrators and people in office are nice and helpful.
Niche User,4,"The staff takes time to get to know you on a personal level. I like how all students get to have dinner at the president's house, it makes you feel more like a person than a number. I also really like the small classroom sizes, that way professors are able to form a bond with each of their students and help them where they see fit. The campus is small but has a cozy feel so it's not too overwhelming for students. I also liked the diversity. When I took my tour, my guides were foreign exchange students, which I liked."
Freshman,4,My experience at Averett University has been the most fun school year I’ve had. I love how it’s small and easy to get help with your work and actually learn. Another thing is the little activities they have to make you more social and make friends. Mostly everybody I have met was friendly. They all say hey and ask how are you doing and I love that. I would recommend this college to anybody because I think it’s a fun college.
Senior,4,"When I first came to this school, I just knew it was my school. It is where I belonged. Averett University is a small college with the most welcoming people. The teachers want you to succeed and they encourage students to reach their goals."
Sophomore,4,Averett university is a school where you can come and know you will be safe  can relax when the school work is done and make many friends because everyone is so friendly.
Freshman,4,I think Averett is a very good school. I think they are always trying to find ways to get their students involved and they're always trying to come up with new programs and activities for students to engage in.
Freshman,4,"What I like about Averett University, is the teachers and the classroom sizes. I also like that Averett want to stay connected with their students. The faculty and staff are very helpful and want to see that all students go after their dreams and turn them into careers. If I could see Averett change I think I would want the dorms to change."
Freshman,4,Averett is a great place with a lot of great people. The teachers really care about the student's success. The class sizes are small and provide a more intimate setting. Campus life is fun and there are always events going on. The fellow students are very personable.
Sophomore,4,Great professors and amazing programs! It's a dry campus which is problematic. The atmosphere on campus can be uncomfortable for certain students but groups such as the Freedom Alliance and the Black Student Union are trying to change that.
Recent Alumnus,4,"People are people, no matter what their ethnic or racial background is.  We are all Americans and all Americans deserve to be treated with respect, when earned."
College Sophomore,4,I don't know of a party scene. I am a parent.
College Sophomore,4,The academics are wonderful at my school.
College Sophomore,4,No one looks at anyone like they are different. Everyone is accepted.
College Sophomore,4,The students at averett seem to always find a job right when they get out of school.
College Sophomore,4,From what I know the housing is safe and good. I live off of campus.
College Sophomore,4,The athletics are very well known and very respectful.
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy attending Averett University very much.  It's a small school, so the students have a better relationship with their professors/advisers.  The faculty and staff of the school are very welcoming and motivational.  I would choose my school over again due to the bond between staff and students.  In my opinion, it makes the experience more enjoyable and less stressful."
College Sophomore,4,I have never felt unsafe on campus. Campus security are always visible.
College Sophomore,4,The alumni seem very interested in student success and want to help in the future.
College Sophomore,4,Courses are challenging but professors are available for help.
College Sophomore,4,I love the athletic programs here.  There is a One Team mentality for most sports.
College Freshman,4,"I've been here for almost a year and have yet to hear of or witness any crimes on campus. My only safety concern is regarding yikyak and anonymous bullying and hatespeech, but no one has acted upon anything said as far as I know. Security is always on call and super nice and helpful. I feel mostly safe on campus. My only problem is that faculty are required to report sexual assaults to the police (due to federal law, I believe), and many police officers don't take those accusations seriously enough. We are also a dry campus, but many sexual assaults occur while intoxicated. Because of these two things, many are scared to speak up about being assaulted."
College Freshman,4,"Class sizes are mostly small, which is great for individualized learning and getting to know your professors. Most of my professors have been super kind and accepting, and I've made a lot of friends through my major and through other friends. I love the theatre program here, and the honors program is small but strong. There is no truly gender neutral housing, which is a definite downside for me as a transgender student, but I love living in Fugate. In my experience, most of the students I've met have been moderate, and most of the professors I've had have been liberal, but there are plenty of people on any point of the spectrum. The strong Christian past of the school did worry me at first, but the religious life on campus is definitely a positive force, and even if people don't necessarily agree with you or accept you, the vast majority are nice to you."
College Freshman,4,"It depends on where you live. Some rooms are much larger than others, even within the same building. The older buildings don't have built in air conditioning but do have heating, while the newer dorms have central heating and air controlled by each suite or apartment. The variety of options available are great, and the communities in each building aren't always super close but are definitely comfortable."
College Freshman,4,"I love this school. It offers a lot of opportunities if you know where to look, and it's very focused on helping the Danville community. Sometimes it's a little too conservative for my taste, and the housing options vary greatly, but I've enjoyed my experience here. The theatre, equestrian, nursing, aviation, and business programs are all very strong here, and all majors offer a liberal arts education and professional opportunities."
College Freshman,4,the campus its soelf does a great job but they cant fix the community
College Freshman,4,"professors care, they are kind"
College Freshman,4,they help find jobs and internships through connections and research
College Freshman,4,the equestrian program is great and the teachers in that department are excellent.
College Freshman,4,The teachers really care about you as a student
College Freshman,4,I feel that most of the professor treated us equally.
College Freshman,4,There are a huge diverse groups of students. Many of them are international and that is very cool to get to know them. I even met my boyfriend there and he is international. He is Swedish. Averett is in a African American community and the racial card is played a lot.
Recent Alumnus,4,Our security is always around. They are there to help with anything.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Danville is very small, but the school does its best to start us off."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The athletics at my school are pretty great. We do not win much, but the school spirit is most important."
College Sophomore,4,this school is great for those that was a small setting and close net program
College Junior,4,"Classes fill up quickly. If you don't have someone in your corner right away, you will be forced to wait until there is another opening. It's annoying. But once you're in, you can progress effectively. Patience is not one of my premier virtues."
College Freshman,4,The administration is very kind and helpful.
College Freshman,4,there are a lot of choices to choose from from fast food to a sit down restaurant
College Freshman,4,they are very good and nice. They try and help everyone out they can.
College Freshman,4,its good and clean they make students keep it clean
College Freshman,4,I love staying with my friends off campus
College Freshman,4,"Olive Garden, Red Lobster, San Marcos, KBJ's"
College Freshman,4,Most teachers work with you when you need help
College Freshman,4,It's as fun as you make it.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus really helps you interact with other people and makes you make new friends. I feel that living on a hall is a better chance to have a social life more so than living in a suit or an apartment. They work with you as much as possible through the process and room you with the best person they feel you will get along with.
College Sophomore,4,I live here so I know we have plenty of options to choose from.
College Sophomore,4,You have to have a 3.0 in all education classes to be accepted into the one year master's program
College Sophomore,4,Averett was my favorite school out of all the others I visited. Everyone is so friendly and personable. It is expensive but they are very good about giving scholarships.
College Sophomore,4,"In my experience, the advisers at Averett are so overly helpful and will spend as much time as needed with you to figure out what classes you need. Most of the professors are very helpful and will help you one on one in class or provide tutoring sessions outside of class. If not, it is free to get tutoring for any subject in the Student Success Center."
College Sophomore,4,"I like the elementary education program at Averett because you take classes that truly benefit your major, not classes that seem completely pointless to your future career. I chose Averett because it offers a 5 year program in where you can graduate in one year with a master's degree instead of two (as long as you're accepted into the program)."
College Sophomore,4,"As long as you don't go wandering around downtown Danville at night, you'll be fine. The campus is very safe and I don't know of any incidents that have taken place there."
College Sophomore,4,Averett is a dry campus but they don't search your dorm for alcohol. There are only two room checks a year and you know when they are in advance. You are allowed to have visitors and they don't care about co-ed visitors. They do care about attendance though; this isn't the type of school that you can skip classes all semester and then show up for the exam. The professors take role daily.
College Sophomore,4,You pretty much get the roommate and dorm you choose as long as you talk to residence life. Each dorm is very conveniently close to classes and generally students are close with their suite mates/hall mates.
College Sophomore,4,"There is one local sorority on campus that is small, but in return the girls are very close and have a true sisterhood which may not always be the case in larger sororities at state schools. The sorority is involved in community work, club fairs, attend conferences/workshops, and regularly hold sisterhood events. They occasionally hold mixers in which in order to attend you must have an invite from a member. There are currently no fraternities on campus, but there have been in the past and hopefully there will be an interest in the future to bring more Greek life to campus."
College Sophomore,4,"The North Campus, which includes Averett's gym and athletic fields and classrooms for p.e. credit classes is very new, beautiful and clean. Main campus is definitely older but some classrooms have been redone and include Apple tvs and dry erase board walls, while others look like a typical classroom. A new theater has been built and is absolutely beautiful. The student success center, a place to study and be tutored is new and very nice. The Caf is a new building as well and is very pretty. The bottom floor even has a Starbucks."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not a student athlete, but many of my friends are. Sports are very important at Averett and there is a huge emphasis one each individual sport having a ""one team"" attitude across campus."
College Senior,4,The school is okay with a lot of things but they will not tolerate drugs and alcohol on a dry campus.
College Junior,4,"I received many scholarships from the school, although the price is extremely high and I still have to take out lots of loans and hunt for other outside scholarships to completely get it paid off."
College Junior,4,"There are lots of international students. Most people on campus are non-judgmental, promoting diversity in all areas of life, especially sexual orientation and religion, as I've personally witnessed."
Junior,2,Averett is great if you love high school. It’s just a big drama scene. Especially because it’s a small school. If you don’t want anyone in your business you should either live off campus or not talk to anyone. Because everyone here will stab you in the back.
College Junior,2,"The city where this is school is not the safest, and it is starting to affect the are around the school. Security will take their time to address an issue on campus."
College Junior,2,Not many students can get an internship. Career center is helpful.
College Junior,2,"All the money in the school goes towards athletics, by the looks of it. The residence halls only dream of getting repaired and renovated. Sports are big but only few actually make a name for the school: tennis, basketball and women's volleyball."
College Junior,2,"Do not attend this school. It is not what is pretends to be. Sports are a top priority at this school while academics seem to be last. You will not get your money's worth. They will make college life non-enjoyable. Many people transfer after their first semester, some even before that. Which leads to a retention rate that is very low. Do not fall for the amount of aid they will provide. Also they act as if they are a religious institution. For the last time, do not waste your time and money by attending this school."
College Freshman,2,There arent many security cameras around except for looking into the success center. The security guards are not typically active around campus unless they hear of issues happening around campus.
College Freshman,2,Most of the student here are athletes but there are not many fan supporters for the sports. Mens Basketball is the main focus and every other sport has very little support. Golf and Soccer have the least amount of people that come out to cheer them on. They must keep their grades up which is a great motivation for them but lots of them go out and party rather than study. A lot of them are kicked off the teams from what I have seen.
College Freshman,2,"They made the school seem better than it actual is to drag more people into it since it is so small to begin with. I enjoy the small class sizes and the one-on-one with professors, but sometimes choosing courses you have to choose a filler-in just to get up to 15 credit hours. I would not choose this school again and would much rather go to a community college first if I had a redo. The scholarship given was the most helpful and positive thing about this school too."
College Freshman,2,We have security but they do not really Take action. They sit around most of the time smoking
College Freshman,2,Not many opportunities and mainly focused on sports
College Freshman,2,Old school and cannot really be updated.
College Freshman,2,"Boys basketball is most supported by the university. Their football team is not the best and 21st ganes, the students rarely cheer them on nor have chants for them. Most of the girls sports are limited with attendance by students except volleyball and occasionally basketball."
College Freshman,2,they clique and exclude others. snobby and annoying
College Freshman,2,people want to attend but performance always disappoints.
College Freshman,2,Some of the rooms are smaller than others and 2 people cannot live in there
College Freshman,2,My work study never came through for meas promised.
College Freshman,2,Outside of the one residence hall they have drug deals all the time and are always smoking. Most guys are high and act very disrespectful towards females. Many people drink lean. (Sprite and. Codeine) and sell it  out of their dorms.
College Freshman,2,Most parties are busted and full of preppy people who just ruin it all. Mainly the fraternities and sororities make it so preppy and not enjoyable.
College Freshman,2,"The nightlife at Averett is a joke. They is none and if there is a few parties they are on the weekend and they are off campus. Most of the parties get busted and of they don't then the people get in trouble. I'd like most nightlife and more parties would be nice to experience, I like to go out, but I'm not really s party girl . Not very many bars near the college."
College Freshman,2,"My first semester of college was very hard and I did not do as well as I hoped. I tried to get help and no teachers would help me in what I needed. They tell you to go to the success center for tutoring and I did, but the tutors are the students and they did not even know what I was doing in my classes so they did not help me at all."
Freshman,1,"I paid a deposit for the enrollment of my daughter and Covid-19 hit and I lost my job.  The college refused to refund my deposit even with the pandemic.  They kept money when services were never rendered.  I tried speaking with several different people.  Most of the time I did not get a response and the 2 others I spoke with denied my refund request. POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.  My daughter will NEVER go to this crappy college.  Additionally, their dorms are TERRIBLE and for the amount this place cost's, instead of lining pockets they should put money into renovations. Im sad I ever considered this place for my childs college education.  Thank goodness she didnt attend. Only good thing to come from Covid-19 yet!"

Freshman,1,"I hated this school and the entire city of Danville. The focus is on the sports programs and they can't be bothered with you otherwise. Most teachers were not interested in helping you out. One even told me that it was like that on purpose to weed out the ones who couldn't make it. I did have one good one that gave me a great recommendation when I finally had to transfer out of here to a college that was a better fit for me. Besides that, someone got into my dorm room and stole some things and when I called security about it, they blamed me for it! As for the city of Danville, I couldn't stand going anywhere there. It was too slow and I didn't find the people all that friendly. If you asked anyone for anything, they always looked mad that they had to do something. I never felt safe either.  I couldn't wait to leave. I didn't even make it here one year before I got out! It always hurt because this was my first college experience. Luckily, the next college I went to made up for it."
Senior,1,"I received a much better education at Virgina Western Community College. I selected Averett because tuition rates and financial assistance they offered. Additionally I was sold that the GPS program for Business Administration was flexible and I'd receive the same education while balancing work. The education I've received isn't worth effort I've put in. The curriculum is sole self taught out of a textbook. The professors are more interested in serving them selves by crunching typically 18 week course to 5 weeks. Thus, leaving a tremendous and torturous burden on the student to teach themselves the content. If you email your professors your lucky to get a response, forget about calling them. There is zero accountability, and coordination for a cohort. So many of my peers are gone and few remain. It's depressing and this education is worse. I'm invested now and can't turn back. Run and do not apply!!!"
College Junior,1,The apartments and Fugate are the best options and should be the only ones. And even those need some help. All other halls need to be fixed. They should have been fixed like 10 years ago.
College Freshman,1,"The cost is a bit too high for how small these ""residence"" halls are as well as how old the building is, with almost no renovations done in the past 100+ years. The bathrooms are also not the cleanest except maybe in the music building and Frith. The floors and ceiling are caving in especially in the gym under Davenport (which is where I live). There are always bugs crawling everywhere and the rooms have tons of holes with paint covering them as well as mold in some rooms."
College Freshman,1,Only one or 2 greek lives available. Very small
College Freshman,1,All students must live on campus unless a senior.
College Freshman,1,There are no on campus parties.
College Freshman,1,we only have one sorority and they don't do anything.
Recent Alumnus,1,i dont believe in political affiliation
College Freshman,1,"We are supposed to have ""quiet hours"" at Averett, starting at 10PM on weekdays and 12AM on weekends. That doesn't happen here. On my hall (a girls hall), especially on the weekends, there are usually at least 20 people (mostly men) in the hallway. Music is blaring, people are running up and down the hall banging on doors and screaming, and most of the time these people are drunk. All of this happens during ""quiet hours"" which is for students like me that uses this time to sleep, do homework, or study."
College Freshman,1,"As a past vegetarian, I have to say that the dining hall is a bit disappointing. The ""vegetarian"" section is usually just vegetables or some sort of veggie stir fry with meat. They rarely have tofu, and when they do you can tell that they do not know how to cook it. I understand that I am in a southern university, but vegetarians need plenty of protein. I have to have 55 grams and I haven't been getting it here. I ended up getting really sick and had to go to the hospital; it turned out it was because I wasn't getting enough protein and I had to go back to being a pescatarian."
College Senior,1,I am a cheerleader and the students are not into the sports and our fan base is very dry. The athletic department is focused mainly on academics.  Our football and basketball teams win very few games.
College Freshman,1,"There is only two frats on campus, but they do not have a frat house they just meet I guess. They really don't do very much on campus. A sorority is being talked about, but nothing set in stone yet."
College Senior,1,Better Off in a Tent – You have to have a lot of money to stay in a nice place on campus.  I did not.  I lived in Bishop Dorm.  It sucked
College Senior,1,"Boring town, NOTHING to do in Danville! No nightlife what so ever."
College Freshman,1,The food seems like it has been sitting out for a long time. They should use the cafeteria money for juts cafe.
College Sophomore,1,"You have to drive at least 35-45 mins. away from campus and on campus the nightlife is dead. We have a couple of clubs for eighteen and older clubs, but most are twenty one and up clubs!"

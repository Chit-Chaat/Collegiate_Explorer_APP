Freshman,5,"My online experience is different but nonetheless good. Even though the we’re doing online learning, the professors are doing everything we they could to ensure that we’re comfortable and makes it feel as if we are in the actual classroom."
Freshman,5,"Barry University is a great school! It makes you feel like you’re at home and all of the professors are friendly! I wouldn’t change anything about the school, it’s great the way it is!"
Graduate Student,5,The staff is very helpful friendly. Everyone wants you to succeed. The campus is really big and everyone is nice. People speak with you even if they do not know you. The campus is located in a really nice neighborhood and it is safe. I have lived near the campus for most of my teenage years and I have always admired watching students walking by looking eager to learn and get an education. I want to say that most of motivation came from just that experience. The application process to apply to the school is straight forward and advisors may call you along the way for support. They all show willingness to help and they follow up on your needs. Whenever I send an email with questions someone calls me within 48 hours to address my concern either by email or by a direct phone call. The admission process seems effortless. I would recommend anyone to apply to Barry University.

Senior,5,"This is a tough category to fill out. Online learning is drastically different in comparison to its counter part. I've only recently experienced an online learning platform, in large part due to COVID-19 situation that has literally put everything to a stop, if not at least a hard pause. I believe my rating of 5 stars is fair given the fact that the Faculty, Staff, and Students alike only had days (literally) to not only ""figure out"" how to switch to an online platform, but also basically change the course to accommodate for the change. It was almost like starting school from scratch. There were the fair share of difficulties in the adjustment period from face-to-face teaching/learning, to ""remote learning"". I cannot in my right mind fault the Faculty at all for these difficulties. I am in the education field, myself, and I know how difficult it can be teaching a face-to-face class, let alone an online platform. Educators definitely don't get the credit we deserve for all we do!"
Senior,5,"Barry University is an exceptional University. I had no prior knowledge of Barry until one of my professors from MDC mentioned it. I am very thankful he did. I am 100% certain I made a wise choice in choosing to attend Barry University. I truly believe that Barry University is a hidden gem. I love how ""small"" the University is in comparison to the larger ones within the state. I believe it really does help foster a warm and welcomed learning environment from not only the Faculty/Staff, but the Students, as well. Professors are more than accommodating, and understanding any and all needs the modern student requires. That is another fantastic thing about Barry University. We pride ourselves in our inclusive atmosphere. I don't know of many Universities that have as diverse of a student population, as well as faculty. We have students from literally all over the globe. This is definitely NOT a ""party school"", so if you're serious about your studies, Barry University is the place for you!"
Junior,5,"So far they are flexible and willing to work with you to be a good student.  Professors give fair grades and limit the homework that you do, knowing a large portion of the students are adult learners."
Sophomore,5,I am currently attending Barry University and although I live almost two hours away from the school I drive there everyday and the passion that this school makes me feel is like no other.

Freshman,5,"Barry is a fairly small university that provides one-on-one attention with professors and faculty, and guarantees a close-knit relationship with the alumni. The campus itself is beautiful; there is life everywhere and relaxation spots scattered across campus. Merit scholarships are easy to come by, so financial help should not be an issue."
Freshman,5,The campus was very beautiful and the staff was very welcoming. Went on an open house tour and was treated well. The only problem I had was with the size of the dorms. They were a bit smaller than previous colleges I visited but that still does not take away from the beautiful campus they have.
Freshman,5,"I haven’t been able to attend yet, I’m still deciding which university to attend but I will say the amount of help and advice they’ve offered me has been very beneficial. The Barry University members have answered my questions, provided me financial aid, and aided me in my journey in becoming a freshman in college, hopefully theirs!"

At the same time, it has comfortable and small classrooms, providing an opportunity for better learning.

Graduate Student,5,"The faculty is very nice, the school of social work offers students cookies, tea, and coffee every day!"
Freshman,5,"I’m a freshman in my third semester at Barry University and I am very successful. The professors really do care about their students and are always there to help.

Overall, Barry is a great place to be especially since it is in Miami."

Freshman,5,"I am a transfer student at Barry University, for the the two days I've been going there to ask more information about enrolling into their nursing program, the staff has been really nice to me, and patient. The nursing adviser I last seen had a lot of great information for me, just by her character I can tell shes a good person, and she wanted to me to join this university, she told me all the requirements I'm missing and she was willing to help me and explain everything without a rush or any frustration."
Senior,5,"Transferring to a new university in a new state was absolutely scary for. I was worried I wouldn't make friends or branch out of my comfort zone. Being at Barry however made all my doubts diminish as I so greatly love it here. The teachers are approachable, the classes are interesting (I took a comic book- I mean how exciting is that), and it's so rich in diversity as you meet people from various cultures. I love my time here at Barry and am so glad I made the decision to attend."

Alum,5,"I love the small classrooms and the professors are so knowledgeable, experienced, competent, patient, hard working, and understanding.

Sophomore,5,I enjoy the small community and diversity. It isn't a party college but they do very well in preparing for the future.
Freshman,5,"I just started attending Barry University and so far it's been a great experience.  My guidance counselor was very helpful, the student affairs office helped me with all my questions and my professors are very knowledgeable.

Niche User,5,"I am currently a junior in High School and I haven't had the chance to review Barry University yet, but ever since I was in the 8th grade Barry has been my dream college. I discovered the college when I was researching colleges and once I found Barry, I instantly fell in love with it. Prior to the research, I had already knew a bit about it because my uncle went there and graduated. He speaks so highly of it and he is thrilled that I'm looking to go there. Barry has the two majors that I want to work in, psychology and nursing, and my uncle is a nurse so what better way then to get some advice and study under him. He really influenced my interest on Barry but when I actually sat down and looked over everything myself, I knew it was the right college for me. I can't wait to visit there and attend it so I can prove to myself that dreams really do come true."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Barry University is great so far! There is no other school that I rather go to but Barry. There are so many opportunities that any student in any major are able to achieve after graduating.
Alum,5,I received my Doctorate of Nursing Practice!  Worked full time and it was definitely do-able!  I advise all CRNAs with Masters Degrees to get their doctorate!  It is going to be mandatory for the next generation so might as well get it before they start arriving!
Junior,5,"Barry University is a great school, small classes, one on one with professors and it is in a quite area and everyone is friendly. I am an international student and being at Barry University is a dream come true, one of the best schools in the United States."
Freshman,5,Barry University is a wonderful university to attend. The atmosphere is wonderful. The student to teacher ratio is amazing. All your teacher s know your name. There is numerous places to eat on and around campus. We are conveniently located 20 minutes from south beach. The overall experience is magnificent. Barry has various majors and minors to offer anyone who decides to come. Whether you are staying on campus or off you would have a wonderful experience. 
Freshman,4,I love so far the teachers really care about the students and really get to know the students which is very important in my opinion. I see that the school provides a lot of help foe the students which is really good. I love how small the classrooms are it makes me feel comfortable. Overall a great school.
Junior,4,So far Barry has provided a quality education for an adult learner like myself.  Generally professors are flexible and willing to work with you on assignments.
Sophomore,4,Because if COVID-19 I was forced to take online classes but nonetheless my teachers treated our online classes no different than our online classes so there was little need to stress.
Sophomore,4,I like the school and the diversity within it. Everyone I have met ar polite and nice and the advisors are helpful and easy to talk to.
Sophomore,4,"During quarantine, I had to do the rest of my semester online, but I didn't think it was bad. During my time with online learning, I didn't feel overwhelmed or pressured and could move at my own pace."
Junior,4,I believe their  covid response was very professional and i can appreciate the patience they had with the students
Junior,4,My online experience wasn’t bad it was just a different environment and a different experience than what I’m used to doing on camp
Freshman,4,I would say that my experience at Barry University was defiantly a time to remember. The professes were nice and engaging and seemed to really value their students.
Junior,4,"Is a good school but some teachers are not the best. I am currently doing my bachelors here for nursing program and have enjoyed clinical , lab, and extracurricular activities. I've had to work during the program so it was tough but doable. All in all good place to do your nursing career."
Freshman,4,"It is very diverse and inclusive of everyone. It has one of the most beautiful campuses I have ever seen. The campus is big, but the classes are small and intimate.   Due to the fact there are small classes, the professors are truly invested in students and their success. One of the best colleges in Florida."
Senior,4,"I am a new student here, and I have truly felt welcomed and accepted. The school is a very comfortable environment and the students are great as well. The professors are very nice people and are willing to help whenever you need. The only issue is that this school is not cheap and financial aid might not be enough to cover it."
Freshman,4,I love that the classes are small and the professors want to learn the students names. I don't like the fact that the university makes you take classes that don't have any correlation to your major. I am in my second semester of my freshman year and I am only on my second biology course and my major is biology. All of the other classes I am taking are requirements for graduation. I feel as it is a waste of my time. The environment is great the classes are great as well as the professors.
Sophomore,4,I loved how helpful staff and professors were. You felt like you can talk to anyone about anything and get a good non-judge mental response.
Junior,4,So far  the staff at the school has been more than helpful and accommodating. The staff was knowledgeable about all aspects of the enrollment process and linking students with various opportunities to brooding their educational lenses.  The program director was a great advocate and very attentive to the needs of the students that they are over. The staff was inviting and open about changes and steps that need to be made for progression in the program.
Freshman,4,"As fart as my first semester in college, I have encountered many memorable and unforgettable experiences in Barry. Beside the amazing weather and outstanding campus, Barry has plenty of resources I have encountered that have helped me successfully pass all my classes with A's. There are also times when I feel very lonely as I am far from my home. However, Barry offers plenty of clubs and organization in order for me to come across new relationships with others. I am excited to finish off the year at Barry and come across many new things and opportunities."
Freshman,4,"With excellent academic instructors, Barry University continues to excel in academics with top instructors as well as advisors to lead you into the right direction of graduating."
Freshman,4,Barry has been an interesting experience so far for me as a freshmen. I originally wanted to attend the University of Central Florida but decided to experience Miami instead. The professors and advisors I have had have been amazing. They have so much experience and knowledge that I genuinely enjoy learning from them. The classes that I have had are just right to where the teachers know your name so it helps you develop a relationship with them similar to what I did with my high school teachers
Freshman,4,"It's a good school, but the price per class is way too high. They didn't tell me they charged by credit and not just by the overall class. At four hundred and change a credit with 3 credit classes it's costing nearly 5000 for just 4 classes."
Freshman,4,"I love the area, I love the weather and the campus is really pretty. It’s a high division 2 athletic school. There are many events. People are very nice. Food is good. The gym is nice and the courts are pretty. There’s a lot of diversity in the school and international students, especially playing sports."
Junior,4,"Barry have been very resourceful to me, had provide opportunities for my major in social work. I am the historian of SSWA. I love how they pull you out of your comfort zone"
Freshman,4,"I love Barry University. I think that the Academics exceed my expectations, the demographics are outstandingly diverse, and the security really ensures the safety of the students. Some weaknesses that the school does present, however, is the lack of athletic teams they offer, the average student life, and the surrounding area is a bit unsafe."
Freshman,4,As A freshman at Barry University I can honestly say it is diverse and give a lot of scholarship but tuition is high since it is a private school. First year I would recommend not staying on campus because you should honestly safe money but its a safe and friendly environment.
Niche User,4,I really liked the Diverse Community that was within the school i really enjoyed the location and the amenities that the campus had to offer. however i would like to see more sports and more clubs added.
Junior,4,I love how Barry University has such a beautiful and inclusive environment. There’s people from everywhere internationally and you get to learn so many different cultures by meeting new people. I also love how Barry University has such a good class size and I feel I can learn better with the small of amount of people since the professors can be more personal with the students.
Freshman,4,Barry university is a great school. The professors are amazing and actually help you. They are easy to access and make themselves available to the students. The classes are not filled with a bunch of people its very similar to high school. Barry is very diverse and you'll meet people from everywhere there. The campus is nice they keep it clean. The area is actually nice to and its really safe they have security everywhere and at all the gate entrances day and night. The party life on campus is pretty dead but they school is in Miami so everyone basically does their partying off campus. The student life is good everyone very friendly and cool and there is much to do or get involved in on campus. The dorms aren't bad but they aren't the best.. they're kinda old and needs some work done. The food on campus isn't bad either. Bucky's cove actually has really good food my faves are the wings and the burgers.
Sophomore,4,"I believe that Barry University is a perfect fit for myself. It's close to home and I have never had an alarmingly negative experience at the university. Though the classes are great and most teachers know what they're talking about, there are a few small annoyances. There is not much college life on campus and safety has been an issue as well. However, my greatest annoyance is the parking situation, there is no parking and punishment for trying to get to your class."
Freshman,4,I loved the campus life and location.The pool was great and the student life isn't as bad as I thought it would be
Senior,4,"Barry University is a small private school that are filled with amazing and caring staff member. I believe with a small population, students and professors are able to build better relationships for success."
Freshman,4,"Barry University has allowed me to open up to others on campus whether it is to classmates, teachers, or advisors. The people here are very supportive and caring which is why I now have a large group of friends who have my back. It can get very stressful as a college student. However there are many things here on campus that can relieve the stress like lounging areas or the pool where you can sit and relax. The teachers here care a lot about their students making sure there is a connection. I never had that in high school. There are a lot of pros about Barry but also cons. Many students complain about the food on campus. It is not horrible but many people believe it can be better. I believe that I am just so used to having home cooked meals which is why it is not the same. However I am grateful for what I have. The security here is also not as attentive as they should be. Overall, I have had a good time here even though I have noticed both pros and cons about Barry."
Senior,4,The school is nice but wayyy to expensive for students. Financial aid department needs to improve there's no help when looking for scholarships.
Niche User,4,I haven’t visited yet but that’s where I’m planing on going to because I believe that it’s a wonderful school and you get a chance to stay on campus
Sophomore,4,"Barry University is much smaller than many universities due to it being a private school. With this being said, you are given the opportunity to grow very close bonds with those around you. This includes professors, staff, and classmates. The student is always in the best interest of the school. The only con to attending Barry University may be if you are a person that is, perhaps, more introverted. Building connections with others at Barry University is inevitable."
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Barry University has been an interesting one. For starters, the school is very diverse and makes you feel right at home. From the friendly faculty and staff to the workers in the coffee shop. The classroom sizes are quite small, similar to a classroom size you would see in high school. I personally think this allows a better connection with your professors and other students within the class. It is a Catholic school, meaning there may be certain religious classes such as theology that is required for everyone to take even though it has absolutely nothing to do with your major. The university is quite okay."
Junior,4,"I will officially be student as of August 27th. Therefore I have no review on the school for my personal opinion. However, other students who’s currently students, have attested Barry is a great school to seek highe education."
Sophomore,4,"As a freshman, I experienced a great first year at Barry. All of my professors were committed to helping me understand the class material and seeing me improve in their classes. The overall environment is fun and energetic. The campus is very open and beautiful."
Freshman,4,It's my first year at Barry University and my ide experience in the University has been a satisfying one.  The faculty is one that can be easily reached and available when needed.  The campus is easy to get around and you can experience different cultures on campus.  I have found usefull resourses on campus which facilitate learning in the major I selected.
Senior,4,"More affordable housing options

Better Greek Life

Junior,4,The small classroom sizes are ideal for better learning along with the diversity present at the school.
Freshman,4,"For a small university, Barry has a surprising amount of small cafes with latin food. The school overall is good with fairly academics and professors that are motivated to teach. A small issue is their strange way of choosing classes for new students. They base everything off SAT scores, and if you don't do well on English, they'll put you in introductory classes such as English 095 or Math 091. I might transfer out of it, but don't be worried; I just prefer a colder climate in the north. If you love the warmth and weather of Miami, consider choosing this school. Have a look at their website too. Barry.edu"
Junior,4,I love how quiet and peaceful the atmosphere is. The classroom size is small and that's what I like about Barry.
Freshman,4,Small campus and class sizes makes learning much easier but campus life could be better considering the costs of attendance.
Junior,4,"Barry University has many great faculty and staff members that are easy to engage and interact with. This is furthered extend to the teacher that are approachable and knowledgeable about the subject being taught. Beyond the personnel, school spirit is barely visible to the students."
Freshman,4,My favorite thing about Barry University is the class size. Teachers get to focus on every child. You are not a number
Sophomore,4,Everyone is very helpful and only wants the best for you. Barry U thinks about their students and always strides to provide the best environment they can. There is always something going on around campus so there is always chances to get involved and show your pride.
Senior,4,"its a good school overall good campus, diversity is very high and the professors try their best to help you throughout the courses"
Junior,4,"I haven't been attending for too long. I'm literally two days into my first semester here as I type this, Since I haven't been here too long, I can't have a rating for too much but so far, it feels like I will benefit from attending this university. How I rate is dependent on what I've seen so far, and for those that I havent experienced, i will provide an average rating."
Freshman,4,At Barry faculty/staff and students are very helpful when needing to find something. Most of the students are very friendly when approaching someone new.
Junior,4,The professors are great. Student life is okay.  The campus is old. The school has a great catholic tradition. It has been around for decades.
Junior,4,"Barry University is awesome. What I like most about the University is the meeting people from all over the world, the community service, the small class sizes, and the different organizations at Barry. I also like that there is a math lab and writing lab for the students. What I would change about Barry is having the organizations at an earlier time in the day, not in the evenings.  Another thing is to have more variety of foods. Also, Barry is not a party school."
Sophomore,4,"I love Barry. It's small and I think that's a great thing. As a commuter, I know I have a different experience than those living on campus. I love that my classes are interactive and hands on. My professors know my name and will notice if I showed up to class or not and they're all consistent with updating my grades. The faculty is great. The campus is real pretty too."
Recent Alumnus,4,athletics is a big part of the school but a lot of people sometimes don't go out to support certain teams
Recent Alumnus,4,The experience of a small campus and student ratio is great when it comes to learning and meeting new people.
College Freshman,4,The professor are always there when I need them. They always take there time to teach the students the lesson!

College Freshman,4,They have a great volleyball team! Student always go out and support their school.
College Sophomore,4,"I am not in one, but one of my peers is are he told his process was pretty quick and simple."
College Sophomore,4,"Out of my first 5 professors, only 4 of the 5 were helpful and willing to hear what the students have to say."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers i have had so far have been very helpful and have helped me learn in a way thats actually useful for me
Niche User,2,The PACE program was great when I first started. High turnover with academic advisers and poor communication has drastically changed my opinion.
Alum,2,"I'm grateful I did not have to spend more than 8 months at this school for Social Work. The professors are wonderful and they will challenge you to be the best. However, the program is highly unorganized. Numerous of people started intern extremely late and they were expected to get the same amount of hours as the required even though them being behind was no fault of the individual person's. For the advanced standing I would recommend them."
College Freshman,2,No way to get my book homework already given so stressed
College Freshman,2,"The greek life is almost nonexistent. There are a couple different chapters on campus, but they don't have houses or do much on campus in general. Sometimes they do some fundraising for something, but other than that and their demonstrations every once in a while, the don't have much of a presence here."
College Senior,2,Has not prepared me for success in my prefession.
College Senior,2,Did not cover information that will assist me in passing national boards and be successful in my profession. Did not response to requests for more help in needed areas. Director is not helpful or concerned with student success.
College Senior,2,Our schools is not respected in the community.
College Senior,2,"Many of the classes were not useful. They have not prepared us to pass national boards. They had one main topic to cover and teach us, on a practice test over 70% of our class failed that portion! Our request for more interaction and hands on went unheeded. The director of the program actively dislikes students.95% of my learned was self directed or co-student directed!!! A huge disappointment!"
College Junior,2,"No parties on campus, after classes everyone just leaves and finds stuff to do. The student experience is hindered by this because it divides people and can be dangerous for people who live on campus and have to drive back under the influence"
College Freshman,2,It's the same food all the time. And it's always spicy and unseasoned.
College Junior,2,"The school is just so expensive and doesn't seem to be worth the cost. Housing is way too expensive along with the meal plans. People are always seemingly tricked into thinking they received good aid, but it is literally nothing. The international students hardly receive any aid ether."
College Freshman,2,"Barry will get you with so many scholarships first semester but then as it goes along, the costs seems like they get higher and all the scholarships that ""cover"" you disappear. Many students take out loans for bummy rooms and nasty board."
College Freshman,2,"The female guards barely pay attention and the male guards have many times hit on the female residents. During the day safety isn't an issue, but at night it can get really sketchy."
College Freshman,2,There are very few places close to campus. A car is necessary to get to the really good off-campus dining. Mama Jenny's is the best and closest to campus. There is also a Chinese restaurant in a gas station that is surprisingly good.
College Freshman,2,Nobody really pays attention to the Greek Life. Those that do choose to join usually isolate themselves from the rest of campus. They tend to be basic.
College Sophomore,2,They are helpful and cooperate.
College Freshman,2,Greek life here barely exists.
College Senior,2,I don't see much of greek activity on campus.
College Senior,2,I did not come in with a high GPA and was not offered more when I gained a high GPA.
College Sophomore,2,i have had personal property stolen from me from my wallet to my laptop.
College Junior,2,"Honestly there is very little to non reliable public transportation in this area. If you do not have a car your pretty much stuck on campus unless you want to pay 25 to 40 dollars each way in cab money. The busses run every hour or so, I would much rather take the mini bus (Haitian bus) which is only 1.50 although it is always packed with more people then they have seating and it usually has a foul oder, but hey thats public transportation for you."
College Junior,2,Without a car you pretty much have no off campus choices. Everything is at least 7 minutes away in driving distance.
College Junior,2,"The best options of dorming, must be the upper class man buildings such as Dominican, Benni, and Kolasa, but they are only for sophomores, juniors and seniors. The worse has to be Holly house, which is an apartment styled dorm located four blocks away from campus, but it is seriously run down mold in the bathrooms, kitchens and sometimes rooms. The showers, toilets and sinks have to be at least 30 years old, it just disgusting! Not only that but it is located in the worse part of the neighborhood, with barely any security. not safe to walk around after 7 only."
College Sophomore,2,you basically need a car especially if you want to go to downtown miami
College Sophomore,2,all they care about is if you are insured by the expensive terrible low quality insurance they care about.
College Sophomore,2,I do not like how they are very strict with the guest policy. It is extremely irritating and feels like we are on lock down.
College Sophomore,2,there is not a wide variety of places to dine.
College Sophomore,2,"not much greek life at all, and they do not throw parties"
College Sophomore,2,"The teams do well ranking wise, but students in general do not attend sporting events except for homecoming week"
College Junior,2,Security just sits around looking like they are waiting to get off their shift.
College Junior,2,As a vegetarian it is hard finding options for food.
College Junior,2,It is best to bring your own car.
College Junior,2,You have to know specifically what you want and if it is not offered here you are better off at another school
College Junior,2,You can smell weed  every where you go on campus especially by the dorms.
College Junior,2,Attending Barry as an undergrad is not the best choice. Attending this university as a graduate student is a wiser choice because you are more established as an adult.
College Freshman,2,"Barry is expensive for no reason at ball. It feels just like high school except for the far that it is far more expensive. The book fees should be covered at least a little bit, my first semester I spent over $500 on books alone"
College Junior,2,Its overwhelming and they make it almost impossible to graduate on time with this major
College Junior,2,Not very predominant on our campus.
College Junior,2,"For the amount of money we pay for this horrible school, we should have Mac computers all over campus, yet we're still working with Dell software with un-matching monitors and broken keyboards, meanwhile all of our tuition goes to landscaping."
College Student,2,A lot of guys have said that freshman girls are really easy here. I don't know personally but I do trust my friends and they've shown proof to corroborate this.
College Student,2,Mostly fast food places. You have to drive anywhere if you want something.
College Student,2,Not a very diverse school. Only bit of diversity you'll find here are the few people who are not from New York or Boston. It's not a bad thing that they are from there but just know that most of the student body is from the Northeast.
College Junior,2,I know the we have a few options for greek life but at my school it is not a huge deal. 
College Junior,2,I do not like the actual city of Miami Shores that the school is located in but I could see myself living in some of the nearby places. 
College Junior,2,The school does not provide a lot of options but there are a lot of different options outside of the school. 
College Junior,2,"I go to school in Miami, Florida. When I first came here I had no experience dealing with a hurricane season and had some days that classes were canceled around the time of Hurricane Sandy. "
College Student,2,"Professors care, adviser's don't. A lot of essays but easy two page essays."
College Student,2,Many specific majors are hard and take a lot of your time. Hard to balance everything
College Student,2,"It's alright. Wish they had transportation to bus stops, airports and train stations."
College Student,2,"It's alright. South Beach, night clubs"
College Sophomore,2,greek life is kind of a joke but the people are nice 
College Sophomore,2,too many guys that are rude and not motivated to do well 
College Sophomore,2,The area of this school is average priced. I'd still rather live at home
College Senior,2,Drugs in Miami period is a scene
College Freshman,2,"I don't receive any financial aid, but I am elligible for a scholarship that cannot cover my tuition cost . A couple of my forms will get lost in the shuffle, so I have to stay on top of things. I suggest making regular in-person appointments with your financial aid officer to make sure things will go  smoothly."
College Junior,2,"Dining at Barry are a hit or miss. There are barely any options and the quality of the food is not too great. They have ex cons working the cafeteria which is a little questionable but whatever gets the job done, I guess."
College Junior,2,"There is a big lack of school spirit at Barry. Especially with the upper class. No one really attends the schools parties. However, since we are fairly close to south beach many student tend to flock to all the clubs over there."
College Junior,2,"It is very difficult to find a parking spot on campus, especially if you do not get there early in the morning."
College Junior,2,The Pre-Med concentration at Barry is not very well put together as other schools.
College Junior,2,"As a biology major, I was unhappy with the required curriculum. I decided to change my major but I first got advice from students in different colleges around the campus. I found our business school to have a great program with excellent teachers and many internships are offered."
Niche User,1,My best guess is that Barry University is a scam. I signed up for a virtual camp and never received any information to join the camp when the time came. I have written countless emails and received no response and I haven’t been able to reach anyone on the phone.
Niche User,1,"I didn’t have the opportunity for a learning experience, so I wouldn’t know if the learning experience is good or bad."
Freshman,1,"My experience at Barry was awful. I wish I could give Barry 0 stars because 1 is too many in my opinion. The university's security team and police department handled a situation I had in the worst way possible which resulted in me getting attacked (in my dorm!) by a person who doesn't even go to Barry. Most of the food is not good, unless you like eating the exact same bland thing every single day. The freshman halls are gross, but the upperclassmen halls are a little bit better (Dominican is the best by far). The professors are okay, nothing special, but because of the small class sizes you have the option to get personal help if you're struggling with the material, so that's a plus. Also, there is no party life on campus, like literally none at all (the B- party scene score is a lie, it's more like a D-) and the Greek life is pathetic. If I had to do it again I would not go to Barry. They offer enticing financial aid, but don't fall for it. Go somewhere else."
Freshman,1,"Barry U enticed me to attend with a scholarship. After I started taking classes, I was actually told by one of their department reps to look at different schools. There is a reason for their nearly 50% transfer rate. 

Their administrative and financial aid teams are horrible. And I believe that they prefer to target overseas students because they receive more funds from them. 

Barry U will do whatever it takes to collect money and whatever it takes not to return any to the student. I wish I had read the other reviews before attending. There are other options out there and I would recommend you do research before deciding to attend Barry U."
Freshman,1,"Horrible. Just horrible. They will not reply to emails, lose documents, transfer the blame, not even review your administrative submissions before calling to discuss them. Very unprofessional."
Freshman,1,"Just finished the semester at Barry as a freshman...went with the intention of a scholarship award and financial aid ended up in debt to the point where I can not receive my transcript nor go to another school period because they stopped giving out unofficial  transcripts which a college asked from me and i guess they stopped doing it because of the high transfer rate and they do not want you to leave. On the bright if you like the area and campus and school i say go for it (Miami shores campus) just know what you’re about to walk into. Thanks for coming to my ted talk !

P.s 

     And by the way security is not even security they are friends with people also on campus let anyone in and do not guard anything as well the gates being left open 24/7 only closed on weekends anyone can walk into campus literally."
College Junior,1,"Campus food is disgusting, from the presentation to the taste. There is no quality food, nothing that catches your eye. Everyday the line for the deli gets longer and longer because the cheeseburger and pizza station is tiring not to mention artery clogging and the main entrees are usually horrific. Everything is constantly recycled on a 3 week basis; who wants the same meals for 3 weeks?"
College Freshman,1,Internet goes in and out. Annoying when you're on the phone or trying to do homework on the computer to be inconvenient and go to the library.
College Freshman,1,"Sandwiches and pizza are served daily. They do every other ""theme"" except for Black History Month."
College Freshman,1,"Freshman better hope they get a room in Browne or Weber. D&D halls are too small and they always place you with a roommate who is your complete opposite, making it hard to get along."
College Freshman,1,"The Dunspaugh dorms are absurdly small, loud all nights of the week, and have problems keeping the bathroom clean. Other dorms tend to be better in quality, especially if you're an upper class man."
College Freshman,1,"The food in the dining hall is the worst on campus. The food is often undercooked and rarely offers variety. Bucky's Cove offers better food, but is more expensive and does not participate in a meal plan exchange."
College Freshman,1,"Financial Aid is very stressing for me because in the beginning I was told that I was covered fully but then in the middle of my semester, I was told that I was not being covered by financial aid and owed a huge fine in tuition. I applied for more aid and loans and according to my school, they don't cover my loans 100% which is highly unheard of. this school tells lies to get more money out of poor people and doesn't help when it is needed. Tip - Apply to as much financial aid and scholarships as possible and early as possible, and make sure your school gives you the aid when needed. If not sure, talk to people who go to the school you want to go to and ask them about it because you never know when your school might be lying to you."
College Freshman,1,theres only fast food around :(
College Sophomore,1,"Students do not get enough money for this school. Only people who get everything paid for are athletes who the majority of the time get other people to do their work for them. The regular, non-athlete student body works hard for good grades and do not get financially recognized for their work. It is an expensive school and over 90% of the student body struggles to pay for their attendance."
College Junior,1,"Honestly although Barry offers greek life, it is very limited and not as most people would imagine greek life to be. It is very easy to get in, anyone and everyone can pledge for the 7 fraternities and sororities we have on campus. You could not even tell the greeks apart from the regular students, expect for the kappas, everyone knows the kappas and they always throw the best parties."
College Sophomore,1,Wasn't able to leave the campus because every thing is a mile away
College Sophomore,1,The greek life options are terrible and they do not offer any good chapters.
College Sophomore,1,They do not have much to offer. The apartments that are close are not safe.
College Junior,1,No one pays attention and mostly sport teams go to each other games because they get points for their team to when things for their team at the end of the year.
College Junior,1,The food is absolutely horrific
College Junior,1,"Barry University is amongst the worst school options. My initial motivation to go here came from the notion that the majority of my tuition would be paid through grants and scholarship money. Over the years my aid has decresed and a high peak in tuition can be seen every semester. It has become a great financial burden and is not at all worth the thousands of dollars we dish out daily for this mediocre education. Although class sizes are small and accommodating, I would have much rather go to a college with moral values than this dump. Never again."
College Junior,1,"Barry University is so money hungry and focuses solely on your money. They have no regard as to whether your a semester away from graduating and 100 dollars over the limit, they provide no exceptions and are never willing to work with you when it comes to the financial aspect. They expect your $14,000+ tuition to be paid upfront every semester and if not paid within the first couple weeks, they don't hesitate to apply additional late fees to your overall balance."
College Freshman,1,How strict they are with vistiors no matter who it may be even barry students you cannot come into the gate without a valid i.d. I have smaller family members like cousins in high school who pass by to see me but cant because they do not have a valid i.d and there school i.d isn't enough for them.
College Student,1,Public transportation is HORRIBLE! You're better off just asking a friend for a ride. School has free shuttle which is nice.
College Student,1,"You have to be 21 to do most things after dark so if you're a freshman, you're screwed."
College Student,1,I hate it! I'm always disappointed in the meals here on campus.
College Student,1,"A lot of people do drugs, and drink but that's a part of life."
College Student,1,A lot of National Championships but the sports aren't anything special. No major sports or school spirit.
College Student,1,"Alright, a lot like high school."
College Student,1,"Alright, not much going on, food sucks people don't do much."
College Student,1,Most of the people make me hate my major..
College Student,1,Most of the food on campus is disgusting. Not open late or open often on the weekend really annoying
College Student,1,"Doesn't cost anything to park on campus, its in you're tuition. Alright parking by dorms. Depends what time you come back if you find a spot or not."
College Student,1,Too expensive to actually get into.. The cheapest is about $450
College Student,1,"It somewhat close, Kinda dirty. not in a secure area"
College Student,1,slow internet. not many computers in the library. 
College Junior,1,"It was oly until recently that allergy labels were posted on a grand scale across campus in the three years that I've attended. There is no listing on the school web page of cooking oils used and allergy concerns. 

Having an extreme nut allergy, there were no accomodations made for meal plans, and no refunds once money was received. Meal plans are absolutely mandatory if living on campus. This is a waste of money and a blatant neglect of student needs. If you have special food needs, DONT GO HERE."
College Junior,1,"There is an extreme issue with the mold present in the older dorms. The school has a problem with communication on this issue and have failed to inform students of scheduled A/C shutdown for short breaks, causing hundreds of thousands of non refundable dollars to students. Quoted to say ""There is just as much mold inside as there is outside"". If you fall victim to this in Weber Hall, D&D, Kolasa, Benicasa, Holly house or the villas, call health inspector FIRST before reporting to the school. Other wise you will see no accomodations and will probably have to pay a couple hundred dollars to be relocated.

Convenient to be on campus. Free access to washer/dryer units if they're not broken down for most of the semester. Vandalism occurs frequently in common spaces so be prepared to share costs in repair if no one is blamed.

Over priced housing, anywhere from 4,000-6,000 dollars depending if you want a room to yourself or shared and with how many people you share the room and which building. As a freshman it is also recommended that you do not share a room with 3 other people you have never met before."

College Junior,1,"I don't think there is much variety here at Barry, the guy to girl  ratio is about 70:30. More girls than guys. The homosexual population on campus is high, so if you do see a guy that might be cute you have to question whether or not he is gay. There are straight guys of course but most are already in relationships or just looking for causal hookups. Since i have been here i have not dated anyone."
College Junior,1,"Without a car you are pretty much stranded. Although there are buses, they usually run every hour or so, and you have to pay 2.00 each way. My best advice to incoming freshman or students is to either get a car or have friends with cars."
College Junior,1,"Horrible Neighborhood! Miami Shores isn't necessarily the best place in Dade County, it is right near Little Haiti which happens to be a very bad neighborhood with an extremely high crime rate. The apartments are fairly expensive and totally not worth it."
Recent Alumnus,1,"We often got sick a lot from the main cafeteria. Not enough options around, any are too expensive."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is the worst. Security is rather quick to ticket you for any little thing and when you're close to time for school it is difficult to find a parking spot. Tickets, on top of being uncalled for most of the time, are also quite expensive. As far as I'm concerned, Barry University has no knowledgeable plans in respect to increasing parking but complaints have been made. One perk about parking is that the decals for the university are free (as well as vehicle and bike registration) and visitor decals are free as well. I highly suggest to not keep bikes outside on bike racks and to actually bring them in and out of your room; there have been many cases of bike robberies and robberies where someone may take one of the tires so that they end up getting your bike."
College Sophomore,1,"HORRIBLE transportation. If you have no car and no really close friends with cars then do not come here. I currently ride the bus to work when i have to because i do not have a car and it takes forever to come. I am from New York so i am used to convenient transportation. Also, the schools transportation is only useful on weekends and it comes every couple of hours or so, so it isn't really something great to rely on."
College Freshman,1,There are not that many places necessarily around here. If you are really interested in eating off campus you would need to have a car.
College Freshman,1,"They won't open the large parking lot ""there is no need for it"" but commuters can never find parking. You always have to get there almost an hour early to find parking because there is realistically not enough parking for every person on campus."
College Sophomore,1,The parking at Barry is HORRIBLE! The lots were always full and if you don't have a decal Specifically in your front windshield to the left then you get a ticket/citation for $30 or more which i think is unfair.
College Sophomore,1,"As an African American my culture pledges to the soroities and faternities of the ""Divine 9"". My school only has one Divine 9 faternity and that is the brothers of Kappa Alpha Psi. There are no women soritites which would be much appreciated."
College Junior,1,"its a joke, most of the RA's are cool, but try an accomplish anything with reslife and you are SOL. Its impossible t take to anyone who knows what they're doing and you'll get a different answer from every person you talk to. 

Room pairings are random, and reslife gives you the most hassle if you need to move. All the dorms are mould infested and the school hires the same companies to fix the dorms even thought those companies halfass the job and end up costing the school more money in the long run.

Your best option is to be a commuter student, its a lot safer, cheaper, and will give you more peace of mind. You may miss out on dorm life, but you certainly won't miss out on campus life, since there is little to none."
College Freshman,1,"There is a profuse amount of diversity on the campus from all over the world. However, majority of the population is rude and don't really seem to care about anything else other than partying, having sex, doing drugs, and finding a way to get off campus. The girls dress very provocative and mostly showing their butt and nipples through their shirts. The boys do seem to dress decently, their is not saggy pants problems."
College Freshman,1,The campus is small enough to walk on foot so there is only one shuttle bus on campus and the main transportation that you can depend on to get out of campus is a taxi because the city bus is sometimes late and sometimes skips the stop.
College Sophomore,1,"The off campus housing is horrible. The area's unsafe (although they have Miami Shores P.D.and Barry security at night.) The apartments are small, cramped, and older (similar to some of Barry's dorms) If you're going to Barry you might as well save your money and live on campus."
College Student,1,"If I had to choose between Barry and community college again, I would have definitely went to my community college. Although I went to one semester at Barry, I realized that I had made a huge mistake and so I went back home to a community college where I have gotten the grades necessary to go to basically any school I want to attend. I can not look back on my days at Barry with any feelings of nostalgia, bliss, or humor because those days didn't exist. The only thing that got me through Barry were my friends and if it weren't for them, I do not think I would have made it through an entire semester. BARRY is less fun than high school was and if you really want to ask any questions about the overall experience of Barry, just ask me and I'll tell you the honest truth. I wouldn't want anyone to make the same mistake that I did. "
College Student,1,"If you're looking for the typical college experience of going out thursday through sunday and meeting beautiful girls at on-campus or off-campus parties, you will NOT find that at Barry. There are NO bars near campus unless you take a bus or a taxi and chances are, if you're attending Barry, it's because you didn't get the financial aid you needed from another school. SO how do you think you'll be able to pay $40 a night for transportation, at least $30 for drinks, and then all of the other things? THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO NIGHTLIFE AT BARRY. "
College Sophomore,1,Very Unknown – The only way that you would know that someone is involved in Greek life is if they are wearing a shirt. There is not a lot of pride!
College Junior,1,There is absolutely no nightlife in Barry. None at all
College Junior,1,Very Poor – The school doesn't provide a lot of activities for the students. They usually have events one per semesters which doesn't interest the students that much. I think if they were to have more events it would attract more students to actually want to be involved in everything the school does.
College Junior,1,"No Options at All – Barry doesn't offer a lot of variety when it comes to food. I like variety and healthy foods that i can choose from. They usually just have pizza, some ethnic foods that are cooked horribly, and the sub area which pretty much consists of sub sandwiches that don't have much taste really. They need more variety for students to start enjoying the school"

Sophomore,5,I like that all the students are friendly and helpful; and staffing is very easy to work with and do what they can to assist you.
Senior,5,"It is a great campus, with lots of diversity. Athletics are very fun to be apart of and the teachers and classes are very fun and interesting. The school is small, but it allows everyone to stay close and bonded! A lot of new clubs are starting to come up. Athletics is a big things for the school, most teams perform very well and all have a tight nit relationship. It is like having one big family when going to Ottawa University, you make life long friends. With having a new campus, means everything is brand new and up to date technology. As time goes on, and more buildings are put up, I see this school as being a top NAIA university."
Sophomore,5,I love the college because I have spent my last two years here and really have had the opportunity to grow as a person.
Niche User,5,"I liked their campus. It's very small. Im not a huge fan of really of a huge campus. Ottawa provides a medium sized campus. I visited their campus on a rainy day , and i thought ""wow this campus is still pretty even in the rain"". I couldn't imagine what it would look like in the nice vibrant sun Their baseball program is fairly new , and I'm very confident that they will go far into their next season. The speech their head coach recited was just inspiring and left me with excitement to attend that school."
Freshman,5,"Ottawa is a great small liberal arts college, I really enjoy it. Everyone is nice, the town is really great. its only 30 min from Lawrence so you can enjoy the big city. The campus is really nice and all the facility's are walking distance from each other."
Senior,5,I have had the best time while here at Ottawa University. I have been connected with so many people and also been involved in so many different groups. College is the best time you will have especially at Ottawa University.
College Junior,5,Big fan base for sporting events. Large amount of athletics to appeal to everyone
College Freshman,5,Campus security is always available all you have to do is call them and within 5 minutes they arrive.
College Freshman,5,"I have loved all of my professors, and the feeling that they actually care for our success."
College Sophomore,5,"Some of the things that I like the best about my school are how nice everyone is, when you are walking on the side walk past someone even if you don't know them they will say hello. I also like how the professors actually seem like they care and they are easy to talk to and get ahold of. My favorite experience at my school so far is when we won the conference tournament last year for soccer, I have never won something that big and everyone was so excited it was probably the best day of my life so far. My school is unique because it is a Christian school so you never have any sort of major event on Sunday and almost everyone here plays some type of a sport. Looking back if I could do it all over again I would still choose to come to my school because I have met some really great people here and I am getting a very good education here. I wouldn't come back because my school is very expensive and I am very concerned I will be in debt the rest of my life."
College Sophomore,5,"There's usually only one or two security guards on duty, but that's plenty to cover this small campus. Not only are there security guards here, but the students here are more than not kind hearted. If they ever witness anything putting someone in danger/harm or even an uncomfortable situation, I'm very confident that the majority of the students here wouldn't hesitate to step up. The security guards are nice, there are of course one or two that take if to their head and are more annoying then anygh, but are bearable. There's hardly any forms of violence here, robberies, rapes, thefts or anything like that. The majority of these students seemed to be raised right, also this is a small campus so the majority of the people get along and almost everyone knows everybody."
College Sophomore,5,"The dorms here are like a little community, very friendly"
College Sophomore,5,There are a lot of individual restaurants with elegant cuisine along with fast food chain restaurants for variety
College Sophomore,5,"Other student offer rides to other students when needed, coaches and teachers also offer helo"
College Sophomore,5,People always offer rides to others if you don't have a car.
College Sophomore,5,"Great parking, no permit cost and small campus makes it easy to park anywhere on campus and not have to walk forever."
College Sophomore,5,Your advisor will get you an internship that's amazing and gives you great information and experience in that field.
College Student,5,"My major is exercise science and it is very important. An internship is very important also, it gives you experience for the job you want to be in. Yes im going to do an internship."
College Student,5,Very motivated and hard working to win. Work hard in practice and it shows on game day.
College Freshman,5,There are many clichés of interests around campus.
Freshman,4,"I have had a fantastic learning experience here, while also having activities available on campus to enjoy."
Alum,4,I love the support given from professors and the ability to get the one-on-one help needed throughout my experience. I think they should change how they handle their concerns regarding a student performance earlier than later
Freshman,4,Small school with great people. Professors have time to have one on one appointments with their students.
Sophomore,4,I have truly enjoyed my experience at Ottawa University. The small campus and close community is exactly my type of environment and is a very friendly and welcoming place to be.
Sophomore,4,"Ottawa has been a great experience. I am working towards my bachelors degree in business administration. I am a full time working wife, mom and grandma. This is my chance to finally earn a degree late in my life and to help me plan for my retirement years. I hope to one day own a business that allows me to spend time with family and travel. I have worked with the Town of Gilbert for 16 years in the Recreation Department. This has been a rewarding and fulfilling job and I now would like to move on to my own business in travel consulting. Thank you for this opportunity."
Sophomore,4,"I loved a.l the professors I had, especially the online professors. They made sure that I stayed on to of my work and that I had an understanding of the weeks lesson. I think the school itself could be bigger but other than that I enjoyed my first  year."
Alum,4,"I went to Ottawa University on a volleyball scholarship and my time spent there was wonderful. I had great teammates and classmates along with the school having a great campus atmosphere. Since the school wasn't huge, the classrooms were very personal and you got a lot of one on one time with teachers."
Freshman,4,"I liked that Ottawa is a small school and everyone knows everyone, and everyone is very friendly. I think the town needs to offer more to the college students to keep them busy."
Freshman,4,"Its a perfect atmosphere for athletes and no athletes. If you are looking for decent size classes and want to actually know your professor, Ottawa is most likely what you're looking for.  Also not far away from bigger cities like Lawrence or Kansas City"
Junior,4,I really enjoy the community atmosphere of Ottawa. However some of the paperwork and red tape within the university can become frustrating at times.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are great, they all know my name, they are always in a good mood and make class fun to learn in."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel safe walking around campus late at night, I live about 7 blocks away and I am comfortable walking home at night from campus to my home"
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone at this school is an athlete so we all support each other, the athletic facilities are very nice, I love getting a good weight lifting workout in between classes or when I don't have practice. They have a good

Amount of machines to get a good workout,"
College Sophomore,4,"Ottawa University gave me the opportunity to continue playing the sport I love while also continuing my education, I live about 23 hours away from Kansas, and ever since I arrived here every student and teammate has treated me amazing, so welcoming and friendly, everyone here is so nice from holding the door open for each other to saying a simple hello or how are you doing."
College Junior,4,Brown hall is a basic college dorm. Bennett Hall and Martin Hall are suite style.
College Junior,4,Very Welcoming environment with campus events happening multiple times a week
College Senior,4,I love Ottawa and the people there. It is a really great small community that cares and loves its students.
College Senior,4,I feel very safe on campus and around the students and faculty. They take safety very seriously.
College Freshman,4,"Because this is such a small campus there is not a whole lot of need for a whole security load, but there are many security officers who are very kind and helpful. The only reason this didn't get a higher rating is because if you live in an off campus apartment there are no lights on the sidewalk from the campus to the apartments which is kind of dangerous."
College Freshman,4,"There are many people who work as head of majors at this school who really want to help you advance in your career, teachers will help you find jobs, grad school and other things to do after college if you develop a relationship with them."
College Freshman,4,"For the semester that I lived on campus, there was always something going on in the dorms. The RA's normally have a game night or such planned on the weekends and sometimes on every few week nights. The only thing that I really have an issue with, but understand why it is a rule, that there is no opposite sex over in your room past 12 on the week nights and 3 on the weekends. This is a private christian college, so I do understand, but it is very annoying."
College Freshman,4,"Our school is predominately athletes. Some of the programs are awesome, while others don't have quite the talent as others. The support shown around the school is tremendous, since almost everyone is an athlete they understand what it feels like to have school support, so they also come out and support others as well."
College Freshman,4,Alumni's are your go to people when you need help with something. A list of them are available with a way to contact them if needed.
College Freshman,4,"You can choose from 3 different dorms, 2 different apartment complexes, or rent a house off campus."
College Freshman,4,We have constant security on campus that is easy to get a hold of.
College Freshman,4,The Engineering degree is a new course at this school but it is on its way up.
College Freshman,4,The few different dorms available have three different types so people can have what they want.
College Freshman,4,The sport programs not only like being successful but want to make every player a better person.
College Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my first year here, and I extremely happy with my choice."
College Student,4,The security is good they help out people when they need it.
College Junior,4,"I attend the Ottawa University Brookfield, Wisconsin campus and attend classes as well as take classes on-line.  My experience there has been very pleasant and I am enjoying my classes.  They are very challenging but the students and professors are positive, which adds to the morale of the school."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Cons: on campus there is only Subway or vending machines.

 Pros:  off campus we are close to a City Center that has a variety of restaurants"
Recent Alumnus,4,"Off campus, we are just 5-8 minutes a way from a City Center with all types of restaurants"
College Junior,4,I'm really happy that I chose this school. I've made a lot of life long friends here.
College Junior,4,The Human Services major is awesome. The faculty adviser is very helpful and she's very easy to talk to.
College Junior,4,Two of the three dorms are excellent. The other one really needs to be torn down and replaced. The cleaning staff is very friendly and nice.
College Junior,4,The financial office will let you know if you're missing any documents so you don't have to worry about that. Ottawa offered the me the most from any other place I applied to.
College Junior,4,The students and staff are awesome for the most part. Occasionally there are a few students who just complain about the college which get annoying really easily. No one's forcing you to go here.
College Junior,4,Internships are required for most majors so the job prospects after graduation are promising.
College Junior,4,"Some programs are better than others. Social Science, Science, Philosophy, and English departments are awesome and teachers are always willing to help. The Music department is slowly getting better, but I wouldn't advise having this major at this point in time. I'm not a Communications major, but I haven't heard many good things about it."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a biology major is pretty awesome, the professors know what they're doing and they're characters. Really, they're the coolest people and they care."
College Freshman,4,There is a lot of diversity.
College Student,4,"Plenty of computer labs, but it's helpful to have your own laptop"
College Freshman,4,I am not very aware of the drug safely rules but the students here seem to be very good students. Drugs are not an is sure here.
College Freshman,4,The professors are very caring about your needs and willing to help with almost anything you need.
College Freshman,4,The workload for a biology major is intense but there is plenty of help offered if you need it. 
College Freshman,4,The campus is so small cars are not really necessary. You can walk anywhere you need to be.
College Freshman,4,I have not heard of any crimes on campus so I would say security is very good.
College Freshman,4,I love everything about it so far. I am a transfer student and everyone is so much nicer here. I love the small community feel. 
College Freshman,4,The people here are very nice and friendly. Most students on campus dress very nice and are easily approachable.
College Sophomore,4,"It's great living on campus. It is very easy to get to classes, and everything is very easy to get to. Everything is close to the dorms and it makes getting around in a hurry very easy. "
College Sophomore,4,"They are very strict on drugs, other than that they are lenient most of the time. Most of the resident assistants expect kids to have fun so they aren't to strict. "
College Sophomore,4,"It is very easy to use the computers on campus. There are always computers to use, but the only problem is the wifi speed. "
College Sophomore,4,The campus facilities are very nice. Almost all the class rooms have state of the art technology. The computer labs are very nice with Apple lab and a Microsoft lab. 
College Sophomore,4,I have no worries about safety on campus. The school is located in a good town with good people. 
College Sophomore,4,"Since Ottawa isn't a very big school parking is not the big of a issue. Most people always have a parking place, but if you do park somewhere you are not supposed to you will get a ticket. "
College Sophomore,4,"The majority of the financial aadvisors here are great, they actually work with you instead of for the school (if that makes sense). Their are a couple who find it difficult to relate with you and cause more of a problem than anything.  The real struggle with financial aid is outside of the school, bUT I would experience that despite which school I was attending. "
College Sophomore,4,"The good thing about Ottawa is the cost to live in a house is not far off, cost wise, of living in an apartment.  There are several houses around campus that are specifically rented out to mainly college students. All these houses are just within a few blocks of campus, them of course being lived in by students, aren't always the greatest condition. They've been partied in and look like a typical college student house. There are, however, usually houses for rent all over Ottawa, varying in quality from very poor to excellent.  Of course the prices change with the quality of the house, the nicer house that are for rent tend to be further from campus. There are also several apartment complexes and duplexes all around Ottawa, some of which fairly close to campus,  them to also vary in quality and cost. "
College Sophomore,4,"Student life here is going to be what you make it, it's really up to you whether or not you make the most of it. The student Senate does a great job of providing annual and regular activities for students to do. Some students even take it upon themselves to get games like ultimate Frisbee,  basketball and so forth going when there are no activities planned on campus. The facilities are in great shape, all of which are up to date except for two buildings which are historical monuments to the campus. The dorms are in great shape and everything is made out of rock, one of the dorms aren't quite up to date but aren't in horrible shape, it is, however,  the cheapest dorm on campus, which is why I believe it's still their. If there were to replace it/build a new one, they would have to raise the cost making all the dorms about the same price. This school is made mostly of athletes,  so our weight room is pretty awesome for what we have to work with. The student center and library are currently way out of date, However they broke ground at the end of last semester on a new student center and library,  which will replace the old ones. It's supposed to be state of the art and cost over $10 million to build. Students usually hang out in their dorms, the student center, the library or even the snack bar. Our computer lab seems to stay pretty up to date on technology,  providing many macs and pc's to choose from, all of which generally have the latest software.  The new student center/library will also be expanding upon the available computers tremendously.  Every dorm has at 3 three study rooms, a long with there being a couple study rooms in our current library. The new one is supposed to consists of a study area, full of study rooms and group study rooms. Almost all of are classrooms are equipped with smartboard technol, making it easier for teachers and students.  And for ""green"", They are several recycling container's and a majority of the campus takes part in recycling. "
College Sophomore,4,"Ottawa University is located in East Central Kansas, So of course the weather is very unpredictable.  However, in the last couple years it's been great. Spring and fall are gorgeous,  perfect weather in my opinion. Summer can get rather hot, but usually june-august, so when school isn't in session,  however this last summer was gorgeous and didn't get above 100°, The winter's fluctuate,  sometimes being extremely cold and sometimes being nice, there are those days however, in the middle of November/beginning of December It'll be 50°+. There's usually snow fall in winter,  you'll be lucky if enough to actually close school.  If school closes, it's usually not for longer than a day. Although last year, it snowed so much we were shut down for 3 days (which was kind of nice)."
College Senior,2,There is no greek life.
College Sophomore,2,"HAHAHAHAHAHAHA what nightlife?

Sometimes there are parties at off campus houses. Good luck finding one that isn't ridiculously cliquey and doesn't suck."
College Junior,2,"The food is truly terrible and it's not good that you're required to have a meal plan even if you're not going to step foot in the caf once. The only saving grace is the Snack Bar. Hopefully with the new union, the food quality will go up. I'm not getting my hopes up though."
College Junior,2,"Only one bar in town. You have to go to Lawrence or Kansas City for any ""nightlife."""
College Sophomore,2,"Good god I didn't come to college to have another mother. Okay cool, Baptist affiliated, great, didn't realize that meant that the residence assistance get to put a curfew on my boyfriend's visiting hours."
College Sophomore,2,You need to have a car
College Sophomore,2,People feel the need for mind altering to have fun
College Freshman,2,There is hardly anything to do at night in this town.
College Student,2,"So it's pretty much non existent. There is nothing on campus, it's a dry campus and people for the most part respect that. Everyone goes to the off campus houses, or to KU in Lawrence to party. If there's ever anything going on, which it does happen occasionally if there's a sports win or a holiday, it'll happen on the weekend at the off campus house of a senior on that team. "
College Student,2,"Nothing is ever happening. Ever. If we want to do something, we have to drive to Lawrence or Kansas City or some other place."
Recent Alumnus,2,"As I said before all facilities need renovation, but this will be happening soon so no need to worry"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Right now it is need of renovations. However, it will soon be getting a renovation and the plans look pretty school. The administration is also planning on bringing more students in, so hopefully this makes the campus livelier."
College Senior,2,we have a nice mixture of guys and girls at my school.
College Senior,2,"Many of the students here are also athletes so the typical students wears t-shirts and shorts/jeans. Many do not take the time to care about their appearance because most of their time is either  spent working out, practicing, or at a game. So when it comes to class many of the guys and girls don't hassle with it. Many of the teams play together and hang together. And usually they date within the same sports for example softball date baseball. Football date cheerleaders, and etc."
College Senior,2,Good but Not Great – The reason it is a C- is because it is very small and there are few activities fr students to enjoy. The classroom experience is decent and so is the food. Dorm life and sports events are the highlight of this campus. Since the campus is small there is a lot of drama that occurs but if you find the right group of friends that suits you then its worth it.
College Freshman,2,"Just Hanging – Our dorms are the old 1960 building, the internet is over loaded for the number of students trying to use it.  My cell phone only words standing in two places in my room. Its old, has no warmth and dank, since I am now on campus, hopefully I will get my request in early enough to get one of the newer dorms next year.  Its your average small college, freshman dorm."
College Freshman,2,"Ottawa is a great college for business majors. Nightlife on the other hand, may not be much unless your shopping about in Brookfield Square Shopping Mall, or meeting at a bar & grill near by after class. Ottawa does not have a campus with live in options. It is an independant college with night shift, weekend, and also online classes."
Junior,1,One of the worst experiences I have ever had. Financial Aid was terrible. I feel like the professors were there to collect a paycheck and leave. My experience couldn't have been worse.
College Junior,1,Greek life is basically nonexistent so there's nothing I can say about it.
College Sophomore,1,Sodexo is going to kill us all
College Sophomore,1,They don't give money...just take
College Sophomore,1,Brookfield is very expensive so students cannot live near campus
College Sophomore,1,There is no campus policy
College Sophomore,1,It's not available. we are all commuters
College Sophomore,1,Wisconsin is really cold. I plan to move back south in a few years.
College Sophomore,1,Pretty much focused on biz degrees
College Sophomore,1,This campus is fine by day but at night it is creepy
College Sophomore,1,"Very poor. The ""profs"" are not real profs. They don't have PhDs. We are all here to get a degree. Let's face it."
College Sophomore,1,This is a terrible place to be a woman of color
College Sophomore,1,"There isn't a lot of parking on or off campus, There are definitely more students then there is parking. If there's not a spot in the parking lot, the only other spot to park is on the streets. Even then it's hard to find a spot and the community gets angry with so many vehicle's on the street.  You must have a permit to park on campus,  they are free which is nice. If you don't have a permit and they find your car, it's a $25 fine. They have few visitors parking, which students aren't allowed to park in and it's only a 2 her limit.  Also a $25 fine, it's a $100 fine if you park in handicap or fire lanes. There's a total of 8 parking lots on campus, decent size. The problem is the students only have access to 5 of them and only three being a reasonable distance of dorms and/or class. This providing way more parking spots for faculty than there are faculty.  Not only is this a problem for students,  but also for friends and family of students who come to visit for longer than just two hours, which is common because most students are from out of state. For they not only enforce the rules on student, but also non-students who most likely don't know the rules."
College Student,1,"Okay, so the campus is small enough you can walk anywhere you need to go so you don't need to drive to class. The parking lots for Brown and Bennett halls are farrrrr too small. There is no such thing as finding a parking spot during the week and if you do, don't you dare move your car or you'll lose your spot in less than 10 minutes if that. So you basically have to park on the other side of campus because we recently got in trouble for parking on the local streets because a lot of people were disrespectful and parked in front of driveways. Parking is free, but getting a good spot takes luck. If you park in a visitors parking or in staff parking during work hours, you are guaranteed a ticket. I don't even have a car and I understand that parking is a major problem here. "
College Freshman,1,"Feed Me – The food is horrible.  I find myself skipping meals because I just do not want to eat what they have to offer.  I am living off peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, water and chips.  Why do my parents pay $1900.00 a semester for pig slop."
College Freshman,1,"Silly Rules – Ottawa does have some stupid rules which I think they just put into place not too long ago. They make you live in the dorms until you are 21 which is just dumb. I absolutely hate this rule, the dorms are still too expensive and the food isn't very good but you have to pay for it as long as you live in the dorms."

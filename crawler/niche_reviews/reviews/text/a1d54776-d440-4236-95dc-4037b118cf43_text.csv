Freshman,5,"This a great school to come to! The faculty are so welcoming and helpful as well as the other students. I have had several people offer to help me with classes, clubs and meeting new people! I can't wait to further my education here in the next few years!"
Senior,5,Instructor used the online platform to allow for good student discussion and communication. Set up was easily understood
Senior,5,The nursing instructors at Newman are exceptional. They have high expectations on the students and provide us with a great knowledge base to be successful in our future careers.
Niche User,5,My experience at Newman was and is incredible with everyone being super friendly.I love Newman and that is my number one Choice for college its environment is clean and safe .Since my senior year I've been able to know my Admission Counselor. She is smart and has helped me along the way. I love Newman and feel that it is an incredible school since the moment I stepped on that campus. I've been to Newman an estimate of about six times throughout my senior year. It is an excellent school with great opportunities.
Niche User,5,"I really like the welcoming atmosphere. Everybody there really makes you feel like family. The music program is a lot of work, but the fun and bonding time really makes up for it."
Sophomore,5,No serious complaints as of now but the food could be better. Always have events on campus that are fun and get you involved in the community.
Sophomore,5,"Newman is a wonderful place to obtain a college degree. So far in my education, it has been nothing but great. The professors truly care about students' education; they hold review sessions before test and put in a lot of extra hours outside of class. Newman has a very strong science program, so if you're looking at going to graduate school to become a physician, dentist, physical therapist, etc. I would strongly recommend Newman. In addition to its science program, Newman also has a very strong Nursing program, school of education, and Criminal Justice program. If you're looking for a big college environment Newman probably isn't the school for you; it's pretty small."
Sophomore,5,I am just ready to enter Newman University in the fall.  They have been very helpful and accommodating to help me get enrolled and ready. I am transferring from a community college.  The staff have been very kind and helpful.  The campus is welcoming and beautiful. I am eager to get started and earn my bachelor's degree at Newman University.  I want to be a part of their community and be a valuable asset to their program.
Niche User,5,Great college to take college credit through. I have at least 10 credit hours already completed and I am only a Senior in High School.
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the education I am recieving at Newman University it is very high quality. This school is a very helpful school when it comes to my career goals. The science program is really intense and well rounded. I would like to see more people involved in the school and more activity within the student body. We are a small D2 but there are areas we can improve.
Freshman,5,"Newman has a small campus with 13:1 ratio . This allows more one on one with your professors and those same professors knowing you as a student.  The science programs for nursing and pre-med are second to none.  I wish there was football, but the social aspect of college life is still here."
Junior,5,"The professors really care about each student. There's always something on campus to get you connected with other people or programs. Newman is a family, not just a college."
Senior,5,"The staff is great and incredibly helpful. I have yet to have a bad experience with a professor there. They're always friendly, and more than willing to help students with plenty of one-on-one time. The student body is also great with plenty of different clubs and activities, as well as good accommodations to help students succeed. It's a small campus, but it's great!"
College Freshman,5,mandatory videos on prevention and also I haven't heard any cases of sexual assault on campus
College Junior,5,Great atmosphere love the campus. They are really there for the students.
College Junior,5,All of my professors have truly cared about my education. The class sizes are a great ratio. There is a vast variety of courses you can take.
College Junior,5,This school really feels like a small family.  Your teachers care about your success
College Senior,5,their is a variety of places to get food while off campus
College Senior,5,every teacher at Newman cares about everyone's well being
College Freshman,5,There are many fast food options right up the street that are cheaper and taste pretty good.
Freshman,4,"Online courses can be difficult, but Newman finds a way to make the instructions clear and easy to follow. I would be scared to be taking my anatomy class online if it was not through Newman."
Senior,4,Taking online classes was doable but sometimes stressful. They aren’t as organized and sometimes difficult to follow. I still learned what I needed to and was successful in my classes but they could’ve been more organized.
Senior,4,I love how Newman university is a small close knit school. I like the small classes and the professors are so personable. However the facilities could be updated and there could be a more active student live on campus. Overall a great academic school and I’ve had nothing but good experiences.
Sophomore,4,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I had no choice but to complete all my classes online. Fortunately, all my professors were able to adjust and teach their courses in an online format quickly."
Sophomore,4,Newman University is a Catholic University with the best science and nursing program in Kansas. It is filled with benevolent professors eager to assist in any way they can.  Newman is also filled with small classes making allowing students to fully experience their great quality education.
Freshman,4,I love Newman University. At this university you feel like you are right at home. Everyone person tied with this college deeply cares about you. The one and only thing I would like to see a change in is tuition cost.
Senior,4,"I love Newman, and I would recommend it to just about anyone! The instructors are caring, helpful, and extremely knowledgeable. The campus is clean and well-maintained. The other students in my concentration are all focused and helpful, as well. The only problem that I have run into was that the Office of Disability Services is not as knowledgeable as perhaps would be preferred or expected for a university."
Sophomore,4,"Newman is a great place to study especially if you are a science major, but one of the most important things to me have been the connections I've made with faculty and the long-lasting friendships I've made. I've felt encouraged to try new things, like the fall musical and swing dance club, and in that branching out, I found a home."
Niche User,4,"Overall, Newman University is an excellent school. Since the university is so small, Professors are able help each student outside of class. People are friendly for the most part, there are plenty of events on campus to stay engaged, and the faculty and staff (for the most part) seem to care about each individual student. No university is perfect. There will be issues wherever one chooses to attend. For example, it is, in my opinion, extremely expensive to attend Newman University. There are numerous other issues, but it is a great school and I would recommend others to go here."
Alum,4,"Price on here is actually only per 1 semester. It’s actuslly $28,000 and raising each year at newman. They have good teachers and they care about their students though"
Niche User,4,"I am a high school student, however I believe that I am able to comment on Newman University, as I have been taking college courses from Newman. In my high school career, I have thoroughly enjoyed taking my college grade classes from Newman University. The professors have been helpful in every class, and their educating styles are easy to follow. I have not seen the campus, so I have no authority to judge on any on-campus facilities or activities. However, as I stated previously, the education has been helpful within my career path, and it has set me up for the types of courses that I will be taking in college."
Niche User,4,Newman University is located in a very pretty and convenient part of Wichita. The campus is very pretty and has a sort of rustic appeal in some areas.
Junior,4,"I really enjoy the teachers I have, they’re very knowledgeable and do a great job of teaching their subject. The only thing I would change is making the program a semester longer because they have way too much packed into one semester. But otherwise it’s great!"
Sophomore,4,"The campus is small and compact, so getting from one side to the other only takes a couple of minutes. The small atmosphere makes it so you know your professors well, and they know their students by name and not number. Commuting is the only downside because a lot of students do it, so parking can be a bit of a hassle sometimes."
Freshman,4,Newman University is a great college for those who like a tight-knit community. Everyone feels like family and your professors all know you by name. We all watch out for each other and I have not encountered a mean person there
Senior,4,"Very good school, with knowledegable teaching staff and interesting courses. Great class dynamic and size, which allows you to have great discussions. High cost of tuition is a drawback. No school scholarships if using VA benefits."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman coming from a high school that prepared me for college. Newman's academics were slightly challenging. However because this is a catholic campus there are some limitations on what the administration and faculty can allow which hinders the amount of fun students can safely have. Funding is also a problem, and lastly there isn't a lot to do on campus."
Sophomore,4,Love the atmosphere at the university. Small campus and class size but tuition fees are crazy high and they increase the prices willy nilly without any financial disclosure
Sophomore,4,The education here is top notch. The professors are some of the best in the area and are focused on ensuring that the students not only succeed in their courses but outside of the lecture hall as well. This combined with a beautiful campus and tight-knit community make attending Newman one of the best decisions I've made.
Senior,4,The college has a very homey feel. Even though it is a University the atmosphere feels like a local community college. Instructors work with their students really well.
Freshman,4,"I like the small class sizes and how easy it is to get to know your professors, especially within your major. You do feel the Catholic presence on campus, which is good if that is what you are looking for, but can be intimidating if you are not Catholic."
Junior,4," My adviser knows my name, and what I want out of life. This is what has made my experience at Newman a good one. Having a relationship with my professors instilled in me a sense of personal accountability. My instructors never fail to encourage me to keep getting better. The faculty wants success for their students and they do their part to ensure that success.  Life outside of the classroom is not as impressive. However, Newman does not make it impossible to have a great college experience, but that has to be an active choice by each student. Getting a great education without much entertainment outside of the classroom seems like an okay compromise to me. After all, It is not the responsibility of my university to entertain me. I went to college wanting a intense four years of personal growth, Newman made that possible. "
College Junior,4,Most of the classes I have taken so far have been useful and have helped given me the tools I need to succeed. class sizes are typically small and professors are always there if you need their help.
College Junior,4,"During the fall/spring semester, there are emails sent out from the career center/services that provide a list of possible job/internships."
College Junior,4,"There is very little number of campus crimes. As for personal safety, I feel fine to walk around on campus except near the green area by Sacred Heart due to it being poorly lit. However, security is always patrolling the campus and if I feel that I am in a sketchy place I call them and they will escort me to where I need to go."
College Junior,4,"So far my experience at Newman has been just like the typical college experience in the sense of being in new town, meeting new people, and fun memories. What makes Newman unique is that even though it is a catholic university, they welcome everyone with open arms. If I had to do it all over I would still pick going to Newman."
College Freshman,4,My friends explain that they like it. I'm a commuter student
College Freshman,4,My school is awesome! I made the right decision to attended there.
College Sophomore,4,Security are always around and willing to help. They are just a call away and always come to your location if given on campus if you feel unsafe.
College Sophomore,4,They are always willing to help. They are concerned when you do not turn up and they get to know you too.
College Sophomore,4,They have career fairs and they do help you with the future.
College Sophomore,4,It is a small school however you really get to know your professors and they do really want to help you. You get to know a variety of people and learn about different cultures too.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very helpful and nice. They are also very understanding of athletes schedules.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone shows great school spirit on campus.
College Freshman,4,Newman has had no issues with health and safety
College Freshman,4,Courses have the right amount of difficulty to the point where you're actively learning and engaging in the material. Professors care for your education and are willing to talk to you one-on-one. You can find almost any kind of course or major considering it is a small university. The Science classes are moderately large while other classes are average for a catholic university.
College Freshman,4,The science program is highly prestigious increasing chances in applying to post-graduate schools or jobs. The science professors have many connections to those in the career fields (i.e. medical field).
College Freshman,4,The athletic program is all-around great and heavily represents the university. They even added a triathlon program this year!
College Freshman,4,This school puts an has an excellent science program all around. Advisors care for any of decision-making. The classes are challenging yet a great learning experience.
College Junior,4,Sport are great here. The equipment and facilities are up to date. I don't play sports and I still enjoy going to the games.
College Junior,4,I have met great people and have made friends. The professors genuinely care for our education. God has blessed me!
College Junior,4,Helpful and getting the expierence that I need.
College Junior,4,Wish we had more stable professors.
College Sophomore,4,This is a very safe campus. No problems that I know of.
College Sophomore,4,A strong science department means that a student can prepare for jobs in the high-demand medical field at Newman.
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are knowledgable and helpful, for the most part."
College Sophomore,4,"A great small, Christian (Catholic) school with a very strong emphasis on the sciences."
College Freshman,4,"My favorite experience would be heading down to the coffee lounge and singing karaoke with a stranger and becoming best-friends with her after. What makes my school unique is the fact that it is a catholic school, but they are not strict and want people to be who they are and believe in what they want, mainly what Newman wants is for students to become a better people by helping the community and in helping the community we make ourselves feel better. If I could go back in time when I was a Senior in high school I would choose Newman every-time. Newman University is very challenging and I like a challenge. There are always activities to do and everybody just wants to make you feel welcomed. All the teachers want you to be is the best you can be and help you reach your goals and level of potential they can see, but you can't."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the small size and Christian atmosphere, however, living on campus has been complicated"
College Senior,4,at this school they have many different sports that everyone can enjoy
College Junior,4,"Since living in a small town, the food variety is great here! So many options!"
College Freshman,4,It was a really easy process to get financial aid and scholarships. My admissions counselor helped me find scholarships that she thought that I would be able to receive and after further conversation she found several more.
College Freshman,4,"I like living on campus because it's easier to get to class in less time. I don't have to worry about the commute to and from school and I don't have to worry about my car breaking down or not having money for gas. Living on campus allows me to have the assurance that I can get to class.

The dorm I am currently living in is the freshman dorm. I am on the all girls floor and my wing spends a lot of time together. We go out for dinner and shopping, we see movies, we have door decorating contests, hang out together, and spend time working on homework and studying together. Many of the dorms are like this with close knit groups. We spend a lot of time having fun but also working on schoolwork. 

I believe that the cost can be on the more expensive side, but the dorms are nice quality and I enjoy the living space."
College Student,4,Lots of student involvement and support.
College Student,4,Nice neighborhoods near campus in a variety of price ranges.  Many shopping options nearby.  No off campus housing within walking distance.
College Freshman,4,For the most part academics are great at my school
College Senior,4,there are many different types of ethnicities that mingle  easily
College Sophomore,4,"The small class and small community is nice if you like intimate relationships with fellow students and professors. You get to know your peers very well and there are an okay amount of on-campus activities to participate in, and there are lots of things to do in Wichita."
College Senior,4,"Pretty diverse, everyone from different backgrounds."
College Senior,4,There has not been one time when I didn't feel unsafe walking on campus at Newman. It's small enough to see from one side to the other and there is also security driving around.
Freshman,2,The classes are overpriced for the quality. I have a professor who canceled class by not showing your times throughout the semester and did not show up to the final at all. There is no waiting list for classes despite the limited choices and small class sizes. The dining hall provides bad-mediocre food. I am very disappointed that I chose this school and am transferring after one semester.
College Junior,2,"Bowling is bad. Favorites are chosen and they are the ones who bowl no matter where you place in tryouts. 

Now the other sports and coaches are great"
College Junior,2,There really isn't very many options when it comes to the party scene.
College Junior,2,I am not getting enough financial aid at this school. There needs to be more options for transfer students.
College Junior,2,I am not a fan of the cafeteria food because they serve the same things over and over again. There is hardly any variety.
College Freshman,2,"We have a good amount of computers for students to use -- library, library hanger, and a hanger in the administration building.  The library hanger is usually full of nursing students in the morning printing off thousands of slides from powerpoint so avoid that in the morning. After that usually there is always a computer open somewhere. I would bring a laptop anyway. Now to the bad part.. The internet here is not the greatest...at all.  It is sooooo slow. But usuall you can fight through it. Maybe more like a B the more I think about it."
College Junior,2,"If you have a large meal plan, eat on campus. You'll save money. All fast food."
College Junior,2,"SUPER unpredictable, but after a few semesters, you get used to it."
College Senior,2,"Apartments Are Scarce – There are not very many apartments within a reasonable distance to the campus, but other housing is available off campus."
College Freshman,1,there is no greek life
College Freshman,1,We have no Greek life at my school
College Senior,1,There is a very limited variety and the prices are absorbent.
College Junior,1,"First off, if you do not live on campus...good luck! If you're not at the school before 8 am to find a spot you're probably not going to find one close to where you need to go. Parking is pretty limited for those who do live on campus too, especially for Fugate"
College Senior,1,"Hard to Find a Spot – you have to get to campus pretty early to get a spot if you have a early morning class, if not you will be parking in the very back of the school"

Junior,5,The teachers are taking a lot of steps to make the transition to online learning very easy and accommodating. I personally requested to have a class online due to formatting.
Niche User,5,"I like how Ursinus is an above-average private college located in Collegeville, Pennsylvania in the Philadelphia Area (which is my favorite state). It is a small institution with an enrollment of 1,489 undergraduate students (I like small institution). Popular majors include Biology, Economics, and Psychology (which are some things that I'm intersected in)."
Freshman,5,Ursinus is a great environment for learning and personal growth. The professors are very connected to their subjects and really care about the students. I have found that I have become more open minded and I have learned a lot in my major.
Sophomore,5,I love the community and the facilities.  The people make the journey through college worth it and the friendships that are made are incredible.  The school is teaching me how to be my own person because I'm not just a number in a lecture hall due to the size of the school. I think Ursinus will pave a bright path for me in the future
Junior,5,"A cozy, comfortable, inviting environment full of people ready to help. Offers an amazing experience to all kinds of students from rigorous athletes and serious academics to artistic creators and determined entrepreneurs, thereâ€™s a place for everyone at Ursinus College to call home."
Freshman,5,Great four year small college.  Focused on small classrooms.  Good social environment.   Athletics is important for more than half the study body.   Love the campus.
Alum,5,The staff is super helpful in your process to achieve your goals. The entire campus is like a giant communal family! There's a lot of things to be involved with and many employment/internship opportunities.
Freshman,5,"I find that Ursinus College has provided academia in which helped guide me into further opening my mind.  My college has been the best experience of my life, and I believe it is a needed experience."
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved Ursinus and would highly recommend the school to anyone who is looking to apply to colleges. I learned a lot, especially from the freshman seminar, The Common Intellectual Experience. I joined a Sorority, made friends at a local nutrition club and took rigorous classes."
Freshman,5,Great place to learn. Class sizes are small and the professors are always available. People who go there are down to earth and everyone cares about each other.
Freshman,5,"Ursinus was a school that I applied at last minute to and wasn't entirely sure about my decision. However,  I have been pleasantly surprised over and over again here. The professors are extremely qualified in their fields and the small class size makes it super easy to get a more personal and engaging learning experience. The student body is diverse not only in their ethnic background but also socioeconomically, politically and their interest. I am a member of the swimming and track team along with balancing a double major and a radio show. The passion among the students here, especially the studnet-atheletes is contagious, and it wasn't long before I found myself passionate not only about my course but also my studies."
Sophomore,5,"Ursinus has a great community. The campus is small, which means you can walk to all your classes within 5 minutes. The campus is also very beautify with many trees. Professors are great and very attentive. Courses are hard be if you apply yourself they aren't that bad and you can make it out with good grades. Party scene is great to me, but other aren't into. You become friends with everyone because you see them everyday."
Alum,5,"Ursinus College is a wonderful institution, full of engaged students and passionate professors.  The academics prepared me very well for graduate school."
Niche User,5,"As soon as I walked on the campus I knew this school was for me.  The campus is great & everyone I met was very inviting.  I'm interested in the engineering program, and absolutely love the athletic facilities on campus. I'm planning on joining the cross-country team so I look forward to working there too."
College Sophomore,5,No one will ever be turned down from a party. Reimert residence hall is just one huge party with other parties going on within the individual suites occupied by varsity sports or frats/sororities. If you're underage there is no worry that you'll get caught unless you're drinking in the freshman dorms (where alcohol is strictly prohibited). Ursinus is a wet campus which allows for easy access to alcohol at parties.
College Sophomore,5,Main street houses and Reimert are the party places where anyone can drink without worry as long as you're inside reimert courtyard and inside a main street house. There are parties every friday and saturday. When its nice out there are usually day drinks on sundays in reimert. No overcharge for parties and it is easy for both males and females to enter parties without question.
College Sophomore,5,Every course challenges you in a good way. The workload is tough but you also have a lot of time to get it done especially if you manage your time well. Professors are very knowledgeable and with class sizes smaller than the average college it is very convenient and easy to get to know your professors well.
College Sophomore,5,I love my school and I am so happy I chose it. The classes are extremely difficult but the teachers are willing to work and help.
College Sophomore,5,"Academics at Ursinus are the best part of the school in my opinion. Most professors are great or at least adequate, and you can easily find out the ones who aren't by talking to people before choosing classes. Other than first and second year science courses, class sizes a pretty small, ranging from 15-25 on average. We don't have really concentrated or specified majors; we just have the basic, general majors. Despite being a liberal arts school we actually  have very strong and rigorous science departments. The work is a lot and you have to study hard, do your work, and see professors if you want good grades, but that is college and it's manageable once you learn how to handle and juggle everything."
College Freshman,5,Campus safety is very helpful and make me feel safe.
College Freshman,5,I run with UCEMS. Campus Safety is super friendly and helpful!
College Freshman,5,Professors are extremely helpful and actually want you to succeed!
College Sophomore,5,Professors are thorough in what they teach students.
College Sophomore,5,Most offer help beyond the classroom.
College Sophomore,5,There's nothing to complain about.
College Sophomore,5,We are a top contender in Divison three sports in almost every sport.
College Sophomore,5,I love it.  It's the most supportive school I've ever attended.  They really do care about every student.
College Junior,5,All the teachers I've had so far have been enthusiastic and love to teach their field. They enjoy working with students and give extra attention when needed and always were accommodating if a student needed help
College Junior,5,"The academic experience is top-notch. If you want to be challenged and be given access to great opportunities,  you can't go wrong here"
College Freshman,5,"My school  is very community-based.  I know so many people, probably more than I knew in high school, and they are all really nice, easy to talk to, and smart. These classes that I'm taking are very hard my first year, because I am taking biology, chem, German, and a common intellectual course along with  a one credit philosophy course. There's a lot of work involved; however, I feel that it is all going to be worth it in the end. This college has professors that are willing to help, and want to see you succeed. Classes are small to really get to know your professor. It makes it a more enjoyable time learning. I love my school so much,  and I would not want to go anywhere else!"
College Junior,5,I love Ursinus. It's my home and my happiness.
College Sophomore,5,"We'll tell you we are a wet campus. What we mean by this is pack your floaty wings kiddies, you're going swimming. The only alcohol rules are: none in the freshman dorms and no open containers in the hallways of others. Other than that, go buck wild, but try to keep it together. The admin does not want you causing problems for the police, it gives the school a bad name. So they will try to handle it themselves, in the form of keeping an eye out for belligerent drunks. If they catch you throwing up, peeing outside, doing anything along the lines of stupid and/or disrespectful to the campus or others, prepare yourself for a citation. If you're high as a kite or drunk as a skunk but keeping yourself pulled together, they'll smile and wave and let you be on your merry way to more bad decision making. Drugs are easy to come by, though the quality is questionable. 

If you bully or assault another student, plagiarize or steal, you will 100% wish all you were was drunk and coked out of your brain. They will bring the hammer down on you pretty severely for things that reflect poor character. But as far as partying goes, you'll be sent to an alcohol class and asked to keep yourself in check before they release you to the wild. There are also two bars within walking distance, though many people opt to stay on campus for the parties."
College Freshman,5,"Most sophomores live in main street houses and they tend to be very popular.  They're ""off campus"" but much of the property in Collegeville is owned by the school."
College Freshman,5,"The freshman dorms and RA's are pretty great and focus on building the community of the freshman.  As a rising sophomore, I've noticed that there are a lot of opportunities to see the housing options beyond freshman year.  I've been to a few of the Main St. houses, which also has special interest housing such as the arts/writing house, the international house, and queer house.  There are two upperclassmen dorms that are located on campus and are pretty popular."
College Sophomore,5,"Solid in my department, it varies depending on the major."
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely love Ursinus. There's a new event each year called Mayday - it's a free outdoor concert for all students. It was a huge success in it's first year and it will continue to happen annually. There are events on campus every week in addition to parties.
College Sophomore,5,The college will obviously do something if you're blatanly uding drugs. But they don't go out of their way to catch you. Alcohol rules are very leniant on campus. As long as you're not carrying around a glass handle of alcohol at a party - they won't care.
College Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy the party scene! There are parties every weekend and it's nice that they mostly happen in the same areas - that way you can move from party to party easily. There's also a great rule that was new last year where any person within one building and it's courtyard can have an open container of alcohol. I'm 18 and I can walk around, obviously intoxicated, with a Red solo cup full of vodka and campus safety will talk to me - but only about my night! The worse they've done was tell me off since I wasn't wearing a coat on a cold night."
College Junior,5,Great professors! They actually know you by name. Each department is basically a community within the whole Ursinus community. There is a lot to participate in within your field and opportunities to receive help when it is needed!
College Junior,5,i received a scholarship from the school because of personal achievement.
College Junior,5,It's hard to get into a lot of trouble.
College Junior,5,"Housing lottery is done poorly. However, I love all the dorms on campus."
College Junior,5,"You can rage whenever you want! Reimert is where most partying happens, and on Main Street. Parties are registered through the school so they are regulated but they are a great time!"
College Junior,5,"I'm not gonna lie, alcohol usage is a big part of the social scene at Ursinus. Heavy drinkers are praised. However, everyone at Ursinus just wants to have a good time and if you hanging out with everyone and not drinking is your idea of fun people will not judge you as long as you're down to have fun otherwise. No one pressures anyone. Most drinking takes place in Reimert and on certain Main Street houses. 

Campus Safety patrols and keeps things under control and punishment is dealt when people are doing something stupid or breaking rules."
College Junior,5,I think Ursinus has fairly attractive students! I think people actually care about what they look like and try to look their best. I think its a very fashionable school; people dress well. Although it is very common for sweats and workout gear as well. The school is very nonjudgmental. I say the girls at the school are better looking (in general) than the guys.
College Junior,5,I got the financial aid I needed. It's not hard to get financial aid at this school. I don/t know of anyone who pays in full.
College Freshman,5,Everyone gets their own computer and everything is well.
College Freshman,5,We are a liberal arts school in the middle of nowhere pa. They cant be to strict and its awesome.
College Freshman,5,Honestly my college is the best i would not want to go anywhere else.
College Freshman,5,"The amount of financial aid I received from Ursinus is insane. It's definitely one of the reasons I am attending the college now. During the application process, they definitely take note of a student's hard work and reward them in any way possible. I think it's safe to assume that more than half the student population is on some sort of financial aid or scholarship from the school."
College Sophomore,5,"The rules surrounding nightlife at Ursinus are very inclusive. But they also have rules in place to keep the students safe. The night life takes place mostly on campus, although some students over 21 do venture off campus to visit a bar or two in the area. There aren't really clubs in Collegeville, but students create their own ""clubs."""
College Sophomore,5,The laptops they allow freshman and sophomores are perfect for the first two years. Then if you keep it in nice shape they upgrade you to a newer model for your junior and senior year.
College Junior,5,I never feel unsafe.  The campus is well lit and the safety officers are constantly making rounds.  I've had them come in and check on me when I was pulling an all nighter in a classroom!
College Sophomore,5,There are a lot of different options and variety. All of them are super close too and offer delivery. The costs are reasonable and many places have discounts for the students.
College Sophomore,5,I am extremely happy with my major selection. I would do it over again because it isn't too stressful. There isn't a large workload or difficulty so I love it. My career goals are to be a theater Director and to branch out into the major motion picture films.
College Sophomore,5,I am in the theater program and there is no special application process to get into it. It is as easy as pushing a button.
College Sophomore,5,"The computers at Ursinus are excellent. Tech support quickly handles any problems that we might have, whether it is a virus or a key popped off. We are also given printers, which I don't use because you have to buy paper and toner. I print to main buildings, even when it does cost at the end of the year. At least, it is color. Ursinus Wifi works inside buildings, when you step out, you need to find a hot spot."
College Sophomore,5,"That's a tough question; there are a lot of things to choose from. I think everything is unique about Ursinus. The statues we have are pretty unique; they catch everyone's eye and the ones of people are so realistic that my parents always mistake them for real people. It is hilarious. The Main Street houses are also awesome and the housing tuition is the same for it. This semester, I will be living in Clamer Hall. I like it because it looks like a castle. It's farther from school, but closer to the market, which I go to at least semi-weekly, so it's helpful."
College Sophomore,5,"The school is always very fair with financial aid. They work with every student the best they can off their needs. Even though the tuition raises every year, they still do the best they can offer. It is much appreciated."
College Freshman,5,"I love it. I don't consider it work, I think of it as entertainment that is so intriguing to me."
Freshman,4,I like how even though we are in the middle of a pandemic they still try to give a us a normal expereince.
Freshman,4,I'm in person but when professors want to make classes online for a day. They try to make it feel like we are in a classroom even though we know we are not.
Junior,4,"It's a good liberal arts, but there r some underlying flaws I think would be fixed with more thought and funding. Academic quality really depends on department."
Freshman,4,"I will be attending Ursinus this fall, and since it's a smaller school, you get to be way more involved in the admissions process and getting what you need. That's what I really like about smaller schools."
Sophomore,4,"I'm really enjoying my time at Ursinus. The SIM program is incredible, and if you work and push hard enough, you'll be able to pursue what you really want."
Freshman,4,Beautiful campus. Small and close knit community. Fantastic professors. Yummy food! There is not much to do outside of campus. Not many places within walking distance.
Sophomore,4,"At Ursinus College, I was able to make friends and connections very easily. The professors are personable and always know your name after just a few classes. The classes are small so it is easy to participate and ask questions. The coaches of all sports teams make sure that students are putting their academics first. 
I am able to continue most of my extracurriculars from high school here and still have enough time to get all my homework done. The campus is beautiful and just down the street are restaurants and grocery stores. The Student Activities Office always has fun and cheap activities planned for students to mingle or to get off campus for a day trip on the weekends."
Sophomore,4,"Ursinus College has an excellent Pre-Medicine and Biology department, with extremely helpful advisors.  Class sizes are very small, so there is plenty of one-on-one help from professors.  Furthermore, most professors practically live on campus, so office hours are always available.  If your schedule does not fit their office hours, they are always more than happy to schedule a meeting with you outside of their hours!"
Sophomore,4,"Ursinus College is a small school which lends itself to greater student-professor interactions. The small campus means minimal time is required to get to classes. The dining hall is usually consistent with having good food. There are a lot of organizations for students for interests of any variety. The academics provides a challenge to students, forcing students to really push themselves to develop themselves intellectually. The surrounding suburban area makes for a peaceful campus compared to city life. People are very friendly and welcoming at Ursinus which makes Ursinus feel like a home away from home. Ursinus is a wonderful place to be at."
Junior,4,I like how welcoming the community is and how professors really want you to succeed and will go above and beyond to make sure that success happens.
Sophomore,4,"Ursinus has a fabulous neuroscience program. The faculty are very engaged in their classes, and most welcome students to visit office hours with questions or concerns. The small campus environment makes it easy to get to know your classmates, and many students are down-to-earth and friendly."
Sophomore,4,Ursinus is a wonderful institution. The academics are quite challenging for a small school but the professors are some of the most supportive human beings
Alum,4,"Although Ursinus is a very small campus and there is very little diversity, it is academically chanllenging and prepares it students for the future."
Sophomore,4,"The Ursinus community is very nice, many students on campus freely express their opinions and there are many on campus opportunities. From academic and Greek organizations to club sports there is plenty of student groups on campus. The faculty and staff are very friendly over time some may even begin to be like family. Food needs a little work and like in most places not everyone knows what hygiene and cleanliness are but that's why there are many options for housing after the first year and multiple options for getting a bite to eat."
Sophomore,4,"I had a wonderful first year here. The professors are helpful, the facilities are well kept, and it was easy to make friends."
Freshman,4,"Ursinus College is a small, private college in Collegeville, PA. It may be small but its size makes it unique and actually quite likable. The students become close and the learning is really tailored to the students' style. The classes are challenging but fun, the clubs are welcoming, and the events make everyone feel like a community. The thing I would change would be the limited diversity at the college. I would like to see people of many more backgrounds and experiences."
Junior,4,"This school is perfect for anyone that wants to have a close relationship with their professors and classmates. With the small class sizes, both academic classes and graduating classes, you will be on a first name basis with almost everyone on campus. You become close with your professors and are able to seek help in your course work on an almost daily basis. If you professor is not available, any professor in the department is willing to help you."
Senior,4,"I love the environment, it's a small school so you can walk to classes within 5 minutes and I love the campus feel. It's in a small suburban town with loads of trees and nature on campus. The food isn't great, but most college diners aren't, the food is generally okay but doesn't have much variety and could always be more nutritious. The academics are great, I've loved all my professors, even the ones that taught classes I hated. They are also great because we have small classes, so there is more time for teachers to help students with one-on-one time."
Freshman,4,"Overall a very close nit, excepting community. There are tons of academic and social opportunities for all. "
College Sophomore,4,The are only a handful of people that would be intolerant. Everyone is welcome and everyone gets along rather well.
College Sophomore,4,You never really see drugs being used at parties but if you find the right people they are accessible. No one treats you differently if you don't drink or do drugs everyone is pretty welcoming.
College Sophomore,4,"Classes are very difficult but I know I am getting an excellent education out of it. The work load and stress factor is very high for me as a bio major on the pre-med track. Classes range from about 10-30 people and it is a very safe and productive learning environment. There are many types of classes to take and many requirements in different branches of the school such as art, history, sciences, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus safety makes me feel extremely safe while on campus and while partaking in school events. There was one major crime that involved outside people coming onto campus and breaking into a suite in Reimert but campus safety and the police were brought in quickly and students involved were relocated and helped efficiently and to further protect them the suite was evacuated for the rest of the year. Campus safety is very friendly, helpful, and easy to reach if ever in an emergency."
College Sophomore,4,"As a rising sophomore, I have only lived in one building which was the freshman dorm. Freshman are placed in one of two freshman dorm buildings, BPS or BWC. I lived in BPS and it was definitely more spacious when compared to BWC. I had a positive living experience there as I was friends with most people in my hall and I felt very safe as i kept my door open or unlocked almost all the time. Sometimes the halls and bathrooms would be messy but once the cleaning staff came around everything would be better and clean. The housing process is a lottery system where every student is assigned a number and then students pick in order of junior, sophomore, then freshman. It is a very effective system and worked fairly well."
College Sophomore,4,"As a student athlete, I love our fields and facilities. Our gym is being run very well and fairly large which allows multiple teams and others to workout and there is still space and all time is spent effectively. Our fields are amazing and well maintained. Our nationally ranked field hockey team has their own field which is top of line for their sport. Most other teams share our main stadium but there are other practice fields in the lower parts of campus. Our school is 2/3 student athletes and therefore most students offer high support of each other and are invested in other teams on campus besides their own."
College Sophomore,4,My school offers amazing support in helping me succeed. Professors always offer their help and have office hours almost every day for your every need. The courses are very challenging but I know I am getting the best education and I am active student athlete and I find professors to be extremely helpful and supportive of how I must balance my time.
College Sophomore,4,My professors are great. Some of them are weird and don't do anything but other than that they are there and know what they want to teach and try and help no matter what.
College Junior,4,"The professors are all friendly and remember you by name, so it's overall a nice college experience."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors I have had thus far have been great.  They are very knowledgeable and want their students to succeed.  The quality of the courses have been informational, I've learned a lot.  There is a decent variety of courses offered and most class sizes are small which is really nice because you get to know the people in your class personally and you also get more personal attention from professors."
College Sophomore,4,"A lot of jobs come from the people you know.  Its honestly all about networking and making connections.  You have to get involved and research internships and opportunities for your field in order to succeed.  Getting a degree from this school is amazing and leads to many successful lives. Majority of those who graduate from Ursinus end up furthering their studies and going to grad, law, or Med school.  Others have a great job coming right out of college.  The career center is helpful in obtaining information on internship opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love Ursinus and I could not see myself at any other school.  All of the professors I have had thus far have been very knowledgeable in their field.  The friends that I have made I know will last me a lifetime and I feel that I have had many experiences that I would not have had at another school.  What makes Ursinus unique is the sense of community that we have on campus and the one on one attention we receive from our professors due to small class sizes.  You know when you're walking around campus who attends the school and who is visiting.  The only thing I wish was different about Ursinus is the cost of tuition I think is absurdly high.  If I could do it again, I would choose Ursinus each time."
College Sophomore,4,"Crossing Main street is scary and they are trying to implement changes to make it safer after a student got killed crossing the street. To be fair, it's not really the colleges fault and it's more of PENDOTS fault since it's considered a main highway. There are campus safety officers walking around pretty frequently, especially at parties and other big events and potentially dangerous occurrences. Anything can happen anywhere, but Collegeville is very remote and in a good area, so you generally feel safe on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"The career and professional development office have very helpful, extremely nice and friendly people, but you have to seek them out yourself if you want their great services. They put a lot of work into holding an annual job/internship fair where about 100 organizations come and set up tables with representatives. Like I said, they aren't going to come to you, so if you want an internship you have to go to them and they will certainly give you resources and be of great help and assistance to you, but you also have to do things yourself."
College Freshman,4,"There is always campus safety walking around especially at night. They walk around the parties to make sure everything and everyone is okay. Not to bust people for drinking, they will never do that unless people are publicly throwing up or urinating. The campus safety office is in the center of campus and very accessible. There are also several blue emergency polls on campus. I can walk back to my dorm from a party alone no problem I never feel unsafe."
College Freshman,4,the courses are tough but they are not impossible. The professors are very wiling to help and they want you to succeed in the classroom. The biggest class I have ever had was 50 students which was for bio and the smallest class I had was 14. Most of the larger classes are more lecture and are you just taking notes while the smaller classes get you involved which allows you to become closer to your professors.
College Freshman,4,This school is known to have excellent academics and a degree from here is not overlooked. There is a job/internship fair that is held every spring which allows students to talk to future employers and set up summer internships and jobs post graduation.
College Freshman,4,"The freshman dorms are not the best. BPS is better than BWC in relation to cleanliness and amount of bathrooms but BWC is in the center of campus and it makes walks to buildings a lot shorter. The Best housing is North/Richter and New. Reimert suites are decent but because that is where the party scene is, you might not get a lot of work done on the weekends. But if you ever have the chance to live there you should take it. The Main street houses vary. Some are extremely nice like the president's old house and some are pretty old."
College Freshman,4,"When a team is doing well there are usually a lot of people at the games. The other men's sports team create a student section when they are not in season for the men's teams that are in season and they are rowdy which is a lot of fun. Our teams here are pretty good especially Men's lacrosse. The facilities here are very clean and nice but the weight room could be bigger with more equipment, especially in the winter when everyone is training and using the weights."
College Freshman,4,Because the school is so small we are a pretty close knit community. You do not get that on a big campus and it makes getting to know your professors so much better and you are able to connect with them on personal levels.
College Freshman,4,"I have never felt unsafe on campus other than trying to cross Main Street, a girl got hit by a car and killed in December trying to cross the street.  The campus is located in a very low crime area, so even walking to Wawa at three in the morning I feel safe.  If anything bad were to happen on campus, the campus safety officers are all really old and don't seem like they could to much (I could take them if I had to)."
College Freshman,4,"I love the professors at this school.  Most of them are very nice and welcoming of questions.  They will help you, but you need to put in the effort to find time to meet with them to ask questions."
College Freshman,4,Campus safety does a great job protecting faculty and students.
College Freshman,4,So far it seems like professors really care about the students individually and are willing to work on on one.
College Freshman,4,Ursinus has a great reputation!
College Freshman,4,"Many people, athletes and non athletes, are part of greek life."
College Freshman,4,Its a huge part of the school and the social life on campus.
College Freshman,4,I love the people and the atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"I know that Ursinus has a lot of connections for students, but as a freshman, I haven't seen much of it yet."
College Freshman,4,Professors are extremely helpful when you are confused. My only problem is that heading takes them awhile to complete.
College Freshman,4,You can tell that athletics is important but the facilities could be better. I think there should be more equipment in the fitness center.
College Freshman,4,"It's nice! The freshman dorms are kind of gross sometimes, but other than that it is great!"
College Sophomore,4,"Some professors are super caring and want to see you achieve. One even recommended I transfer because he realized this school wasn't that great. However, there are plenty of professors that have no idea what they are teaching, and I could  instruct the class better than they do."
College Sophomore,4,Sports teams are generally good. Sports facilities are pretty old and sub part though.
College Senior,4,I have always felt safe on campus.
College Senior,4,The courses are challenging but managable. There are a variety of social and educational opportunities.
College Senior,4,A lot of alumni give back to the college and are successful.
College Senior,4,There are various types of buildings for everyone. The facilities are relatively modern.
College Senior,4,"I am a member of Greek life on my campus, and i think it benefits the social environment of our campus."
College Senior,4,My school is challenging academically and contains a lot of various social expÃ©riences.
College Sophomore,4,I've only heard of one incident.  No one knows the complete truth although the incident happened last year.
Senior,2,I would like to see better living standards and better food. I'd also like to have more of a student center and non-alcoholic fun options.
Freshman,2,"Ursinus is a great College if you are in Bio/Chem track. There are many resources for science classes. Campus is relatively small, so you can easily create relationships on campus. One thing that Ursinus has to change is tuition costs. "
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly not worth the money.  I love living on campus because of all of the friends I have made an it is also super convenient.  However, dorms are absurdly small and have not been updated in what looks like forever.  You would think that all of the money the school receives from tuition they would renovate the dorms.  Freshman year I lived in the basement of BPS and it was awful.  I had a total of around 10 people in my hall which was awful for it being my first year.  At the end of freshman year, I got to experience the housing process which is THE WORST.  The school assigns numbers to each person in the school, randomly, and this is the order we go in for choosing.  You would think, logically, that they would just go in numerical order right? Nope.  It goes by class, starting with rising seniors and ending with rising sophomores.  So, needless to say, freshman into sophomore year you get screwed.  Also, they ""didn't have enough rooms"" so my roommate and I were put on the wait list.  Everyone knew their living space in mid April, and me? I didn't find out until July.  I ended up picking a house with one of, I would say, the nicest rooms on campus.  Our room actually consisted of three separate rooms, and even our own bathroom.  However, it was a ""far"" (considering the size of the campus) walk.  I honestly loved the room but did not enjoy that I felt very disconnected from campus and not very safe.  If I could put that room on campus, I would live there every year.  The rooms in the houses are definitely a whole lot nicer and roomier than the dorms. Except you do not get that effect of living in a college dorm because you're living with less people instead of a hall.  Overall, the cost considering the rooms and even the cleanliness of the rooms is definitely not worth it and I think they should definitely consider a change soon because the school needs it."
College Sophomore,2,"Some of the sororities and frats are pretty exclusive while other ones are very down to earth people as a group. Overall I'd say it's an even split between the two of these. When looked at individually people in greek life aren't bad people for the most part but when they are in their organization they can act differently and be exclusive. The pledging process isn't as bad as some state school since most organizations are local, but it is pretty intense; people have to do some pretty weird things for several weeks like wear certain colors every single day and not talk to people in other organizations, and sometimes academics get put on the back burner because it's a big time commitment. I think the greek life is a lot more of the school then they advertise it as; they are the ones that host most parties and events and you will pass around two dozen people wearing greek letters a day. Overall I'm not a fan of the greek life because of their exclusivity and the things they do to make people be a part of their organization."
College Freshman,2,"I love my classes, but the social scene leaves much to be desired.  I love my professors and the staff in the Career and Professional Development office are all really nice.  But there is absolutely nothing to do here on the weekends if you are not friends with/in a sorority or fraternity or on a sports team and I am so bored here on the weekends and most nights.  The school claims to be open minded and ""encourages you to speak your mind"" but I have never met more closed minded people in my life.  I feel like I am in high school 2.0.  If you want any form of a social life in college, I would not recommend this place.  It feels like a prison."
College Freshman,2,I hate the lottery system because the lower classes will always get bad rooms. We should pick where we live based on preference not class. Ursinus is stingy with single rooms.
College Sophomore,2,"I tried to apply for 1 internship I really wanted, and the career development center delayed my application only to add a few comments long enough that I could no longer apply. It blows."
College Sophomore,2,"This school is overall pretty aweful. The food is really bad with almost no nearby alternatives except wawa, the housing is pitiful and super expensive, over 1000 per month if you do the math, you can't move off campus or they cut your funding, something they don't tell you on visits, and the academics are easy. I thought this school was supposed to be rigorous and insightful, but I've already taken the hardest courses for my major as a sophomore and found it quite easy. The only positives about this school are Reimert and the athletics teams. Men's lacrosse and football throw ragers on thr weekends, and a lot of the other teams are cool. The frats and sororities here are a joke. None are nationally reckognized, and the only cool people who join them are the athletes that get cut from the teams. Can't wait to transfer next fall."
College Sophomore,2,"Collegeville is boring af. There is only ONE bus and it only runs every hour. There is a nice shopping center (lots of clothing stores, Wegman's, a movie theatre) HOWEVER unless you have a car--or a friend with a car--it is VERY DIFFICULT to access. This has been incredibly frustrating for me during my time at Ursinus. 

ALSO when applying they make it seem VERY easy to get to Philadelphia. This is NOT true. You have to take a bus to Norristown TC and them a train in to Philadelphia all together it costs about $18. Life will be so much asker here if you have a car."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know much about off campus housing, but since Collegeville is so small I know that it is difficult. MOST students live on campus all 4 years and it would be wise for you to do so also."
College Freshman,2,The only things that are remotely good are Wawa and the diner.
College Sophomore,2,The food system is set up rather poorly. There also aren't late night options on campus. There are currently actions being taken on campus to fix this however.
College Sophomore,2,It's a very white campus. I haven't noticed racism or any form of non-acceptance. I think the school doesn't attract diverse students mostly just because they don't put a lot of effort into trying. The targetted students for admissions are generally upper middle class - and the students who enroll are reflective of that.
College Senior,2,Not many people attend athletic events at Ursinus. The gym is nice but small and both athletes and other students have to share it so it gets really crowded.
College Senior,2,There are a few options but if you don't have a car you can't really get to them. Marzella's is a good pizza place with $1 slices after 9pm but they don't stay open very late. Off campus dining is not so great since collegeville is basically no-where-ville.
College Freshman,2,To do the FAFSA is so hard you need ever single move you have ever made in life to complete it. They also don't give fair amounts in my opinion.
College Sophomore,2,"Fairly average, but it really depends on which dorm you get.  My dorm was fine.  Mostly it would depend on the students.  Some halls had rowdier students some didn't.  There were a lot of problems with cleanliness in the freshman dorms, but I think that had more to do with poor student behavior than with any problems with the janitorial staff.  All in all, the rooms and amenities are quite average."
College Junior,2,"Ursinus is a small liberal arts college in the middle of Pennsylvania and is comprised mostly of the sort of people you would expect.  While the students bring in diverse backgrounds, thoughts, and beliefs, it is majority middle class white students."
College Sophomore,2,"It all depends on where you come. For example, If your hometown is very diverse, you will think Ursinus has little diversity. If your hometown is not diverse, than you will think Ursinus is pretty diverse."
College Sophomore,2,"I know of a few people of campus, but for the most part everyone stays here all 4 years. If you live off campus, you cannot have a meal plan."
Senior,1,"If you are black, do not go.  If you are black and have approved accommodations do not go.  Ursinus college recruits minority students and says they want to see them succeed.  However, they make the black students play by a different set of rules than the white students.  For your first two years, Ursinus will treat you well, then when you enter your third and final year, they somehow find ways to eliminate you before your senior year so you will not graduate.  The few minorities that stay are so mentally damaged when they do graduate.  They also have a history of taking away disability accommodations for the minority students without notifying the student and this results in them not passing classes. Being the only female, and a minority, in the sciences, I watched my white male peers exercise their privilege and cheat, while the professors knew. My professor was also promoted my isolation and intimidation of my white male peers.  The school is also in a racist town."
Junior,1,"DO NOT ATTEND URSINUS COLLEGE!!!

First, there are 2 options for freshmen living, and they're old with paper thin walls. For upper classmen, there are very limited options: Main Street houses, which are old, small, and narrow, or New/North, which are nearly impossible to get into, and Reimert, a nasty dorm complex where people host ""parties"". These parties are the same every weekend and get boring fast. You will be very bored here. 

The most important part of this review is how awful resident life is. I am suffering from depression and anxiety, with a terrible roommate, and I need an emergency single. I asked my RA for help, he contacted the AD, and I have yet to hear from the AD. So I am stuck in a bad room, no hope for escape, and my mental state getting worse. The food here, again, has limited options and is extremely unhealthy. The school is incredibly overrated, OVERPRICED, and not worth a single penny that you pay. Please learn from my mistakes: do NOT go here."
College Junior,1,"This school is not worth their advertising. They do not portray an accurate student experience to prospective students--making sure to gloss over all of their issues right until you move in on campus. The dining hall is disgusting; it was slapped with fourteen health violations last semester after an outbreak of Norovirus. The classes are mostly dull due to lack of student interest or participation. Expect crickets in the classroom and disruptive, drunken freshmen all over campus on the weekend. Their budget seems to emphasize more on athletics and ""new, innovative programs"" than the liberal arts or theater. Ursinus boasts an inflated percentage of medical school acceptances, something like >90% of pre-med students--while failing to mention that the majority of pre-med students drop out of the track after the first year, due to the rigor and lack of support in large classes that were designed to eliminate students.  The college advertises a close-knit, intellectual community--but the administration (especially its residence life) do not care about about your college experience. The lack of diversity, rampant sexual assault/binging culture, and drained funding remain largely unaddressed issues on campus and are not expected to change by the time you might graduate."
College Sophomore,1,"I hate the housing here. It is super expensive, dirty, and small spacing. Oh, and the worst part is you can't move off campus or they cut financial aid."
College Sophomore,1,Our greek life here if such a joke. 90% of the athletes consider them terrible.
College Freshman,1,I know that we just failed like 7 health violations last week. There were rats and bugs in the kitchens. It's quite disgusting.
College Junior,1,"The campus is ugly, it doesn't make sense. Bio 101 is crazy, and not in the ""I feel good about this"" kind of way...NOOOO!!! Take that class at a community college! The neuro program seems fine so far. Dr Bish is great! There is literally nothing to do unless you party!!! Best advice: choose another school! Trust me...you can do better! The tuition is not worth it!"
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing to do, no where to go, nothing to see"
College Sophomore,1,"Food on campus is absolutely awful in quality, i mean some of the cheapest food one could find is what we are fed. New rules limit choices and it's practically impossible to find something to eat past 8pm if you dont want to eat pizza or waste $7 on wawa. The dinning experience alone makes me want to transfer. "
College Sophomore,1,Wawa or Pizza are really your only choices and both are pretty expensive.
College Sophomore,1,All student spots are ridiculously far from housing and campus safety will write you a ticket within a couple hours of illegally parking which is usually $50. Gravel parking lot ruined the paint on my car last year.
College Sophomore,1,"Everyone's white and conservative pretty much. They're all from the same area, look the same, act the same, and have the same interests. There's a small portion on non-white students who are really good kids but they tend to all feel like outsiders at the school. The school is really biased and bust the colored kids for almost anything but let the white kids go on warning. There isn't a very diverse population of lgbtqia members. It's mostly bisexual girls. And it seems like everyone is rich too. It's hard to not be economically successful in the Ursinus community."
College Sophomore,1,"Mostly Suburban, Middle Class White Kids â€“ There's very little diversity here, although the school tries to claim there's a lot more. The student body is pretty homogeneous when it comes to ethnicity, although there is some diversity in terms of opinions and interests."
College Freshman,1,"Disgusting food. The food is a travesty.  Comparable, near-by schools (Muhlenberg, Franklin and Marshall) far exceed - so much so that when I visit my friends there and go to their dining halls with them, I get uber pissed at Admin for thinking they can cut costs (mind you, with our tuition, we should get better food) by giving us that Sodexo garbage that you had to eat in elementary school."
College Junior,1,"NOT Diverse â€“ This school is NOT racially or ethnically diverse, by any means. Don't let the photographs in the view books fool you."
College Junior,1,Art Department Is Disappointing â€“ The sculpture professor is disrespectful and shows little interest in the well-being of her students. Be wary of taking a class in this department.

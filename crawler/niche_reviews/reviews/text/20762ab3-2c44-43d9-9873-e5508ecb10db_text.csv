Freshman,5,Where do I start? This is my first semester I am studying Digital Photography   and I totally love Ai. I appreciate that all instructors are willing to bend backwards for their students. The facility is always kept clean and the administration is very professional and understanding. I would definitely recommend  The Art Institute to someone who's willing to work and love to learn.
Junior,5,i love coming to school at the Art Institute of Las Vegas it was very tragic recently about the schools possibility of closing but overall the students love their campus as do I and I enjoy all my academic classes and my professors.
Freshman,5,They are such a great school. Such an amazing environment! The staff is always so open to help you with whatever you need.
Freshman,5,"The Art Institute of Las Vegas has kids who were stuck on what to do in life, so they ended up furthering their careers. It is a helpful and safe environment full of hope and the thrill of baking."
Freshman,5,"I have dropped out of college twice because I do not like school at all. But since coming to The Art Institute of Las Vegas, I haven't wanted to stop! Granted, I'm only in my first quarter but I have enjoyed it immensely! The professors are entertaining and involved with the class, the classes are interesting. I am in the Culinary program and learning the techniques and trying the food has given me a real sense of accomplishment. "
College Sophomore,5,The Art Institute of Las Vegas is great because you get to really focus and learn exactly what you want. There are general classes to take but there aren't nearly as many as if you went to a state school. The administration staff are friendly and help you with anything you need. They answer questions fully and will find specific answers if they themselves don't already know.
College Junior,5,The scheduling fits very well with my home and work life.
College Junior,5,Everyone that works here tries their best to help the students succeed and get jobs.
College Junior,5,Being a photography student has given me opportunities to experience real life photography situations.
College Junior,5,I absolutely love my school. All of the staff is so helpful and caring.
College Sophomore,5,Everything is pretty reasonably distanced around campus. I love the library
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school to death. With the dedication i've put into this school, they should love me too."
College Sophomore,5,They help with everything and if they can't they will go get someone who can.
College Sophomore,5,So far I love the school and the classes are superb!
College Sophomore,5,I love the schools atmosphere and I feel that this school in particular is one I would recommend to friends and family alike.
College Sophomore,5,"One of the main reasons why I chose this school rather then the other schools that accepted me was because of the student body. The atmosphere is utterly stupendous and the people are extremely friendly. It has seemed like every other day I make another friend. As well as an outgoing student body, the students here are hard working. Since this school is a three year curriculum, the students get much more homework then the average student would. It helps us grow and mature as individuals because of this. One person in particular who has shown tremendous progress would be my friend J, Not only has she put effort into everything she does but her drawings have become so wonderful. I can only imagine how great of an animator she will be in her future. She's also helped me learn about the diversity this school has. I have never met so many different kinds of people in one location. I have met people from all over the world just by coming to class everyday and I must say it is truly an enlightening experience. The people here are very open minded and it shows through their attitudes towards one another. It is because of these reasons that I feel this school is utterly superior when it comes to meeting the emotional needs of the students."
College Sophomore,5,"I love game design because not only am I able to learn about the animation aspects of the designing process but, I am also able to learn about the most up to date programs available to me. In the short time that I have been attending class, I have already become an intermediate Photoshop user. Not only this, but I am a straight A student in the five classes that I'm currently taking. I also enjoy the animations I have been able to create through the program. I love how I am able to bring my craft to life by giving them specific movements and body shapes. It creates a sense of childlike wonder that I feel only the current program that I'm taking could provide. In short, my major provides me with the best opportunities available for me and I wouldn't change my career choice for the world."
College Student,5,"I think that we have some amazing instructors, all of who still work or in their respective fields. The instructors try to offer real world experience along with textbook knowledge and there is a lot of know-how associated with the major once courses are finished."
College Student,5,"They have been one of my greatest assets while attending this school. They have helped me perfect and build my resume and personal brand, and always look to provide me with new and better opportunities."
College Student,5,"Students and staff come from all ethnic backgrounds, participate in school events, and have a decent sense of camaraderie. It becomes more like a family environment as the days go on."
Freshman,4,This is a pretty diverse school in terms of where people are coming from and what they're majoring in. I just wish this school offered athletic programs and more scholarships.
Junior,4,The Art Institute has taught and challenged my skills. The teachers are amazing and the students are very inspiring. Being in a diverse environment motivates me and challenges me to be a better artist. I was skeptical about going back to school but I am so glad I did.
College Sophomore,4,I can take evening classes most often so I can stay home with my baby during the day while my husband is at work.
College Sophomore,4,So far so good. I plan on starting my own business and I have the tools and networking I need to do it.
College Junior,4,The online classes are very convenient for those who cannot get to the campus.
College Junior,4,Our career services center is so helpful. They help create resumes and everything with getting a job in your field.
College Junior,4,I love being able to get critiqued on my photos to know what I need to improve.
College Sophomore,4,"Well I haven't started yet but I am trying to get scholarships. All I can say is the Admissions Rep was really nice and kind. Very described on details of the school, courses living area, career jobs,, and activities"
College Junior,4,Classes are small so the professors know you and can personally help you with whatever it is you need.
College Freshman,4,"This school is amazing. I have met so many talented people. The teachers are fantastic. The price, not so much.. But there are small classrooms so you get one on one with the teacher and the teachers actually care how we do in school and want to see us succeed. I'm not sure if I would choose this school again.. while I do love it, I have given up a lot to be here. Moving almost 2000 miles away just to come to this school, it's hard. But I love it."
College Sophomore,4,"Being a collage freshman, i've heard that post-grad services are pretty good and help out any way they can."
College Sophomore,4,I love my major and the classes that are required.
College Freshman,4,The more you learn the more likely you are to get you dream job. They also offer a chance to experience first hand in your field of choice.
College Sophomore,4,I feel that because of this school I will be able to succeed in my career and my future.
College Sophomore,4,I love how I am able to have numerous scholarships at a time because it helps me to focus on my work rather then stress about the finances that come with college.
College Sophomore,4,This school in particular has been known for helping students jump into the career that they so desire. They have numerous events held to let students show and present their work to business owners.
College Sophomore,4,"Since I started class at the Art Institute, I noticed that they had a multitude of events going on through out the week. They have a few courses which I frequently attend, for example, they have a weekly event called ""Media Mingler"", which teaches students about finances, getting applications for jobs as well as the rules of using a credit card. I have learned so much and I only makes me even more excited for the events that have yet to come. They also have courses which help me balances my class schedules and organize my school work. As well as an organized class schedule, this school also helps students keep in contact with their teachers and consolers. They provide services such as school emails, help hotlines as well as the teachers personal contact information. This has been immensely beneficial for me since I normally ask a lot of questions on projects. In conclusion, the Art Institute of Las Vegas is the obvious choice when wanting to pick a school that puts its students first."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is so alive and themselves here
College Freshman,4,It focuses on your career
College Freshman,4,Very efficient if you have a lot going on with work
College Freshman,4,I havent worked with them yet but it seemed as though they were able to provide these services
College Freshman,4,Everything is pertaining to my field. There is always gonna be a big workload to do but it'll pay off once you gain experience in your field which the school helps provide.
College Freshman,4,Everything is basically straight forward
College Freshman,4,Its very convenient if you are a working student.
College Freshman,4,"Everything seemed pretty open, there is a library and a check out section where you can rent stuff out. There are many activities going on throughout the school."
College Freshman,4,So much technology everywhere!! Open lab if you need to use a room to do the rest of your homework if you dont have the resources you need at home.
College Sophomore,4,"fantastic possibilites, registation could be easier, as there are gaps when classes are offered creating a delay for final graduation"
College Sophomore,4,"the photography instructors are fantastic, and have real world experience that they pass on to the students"
College Sophomore,4,"new imacs all around, even a pc lab.. printing is available no cost except for photo printing  fantastic network speed!"
College Sophomore,4,"very expensive, but hopefully worth the investment!"
College Student,4,There are a range of classes that are offered in different categories. Even general education class coursework is made interesting depending on the teachers offering the course.
College Student,4,I have learned a lot and have been offered more opportunities than would have been available to me had I attended another school in the area. I have no regrets and am actually a returning student.
College Student,4,There are always open computer labs with all the latest technological programs. There is also a well-stocked library with literary gems to help with any assignment or research topic.
College Student,4,"There are open computer labs, classrooms with drawing tables or still life references, and printing services available (new to campus is a  3D printer)."
College Student,4,Offering of courses and workshops that are beneficial to all major types.
College Student,4,"I don't like doing online classes because I am a visual and auditory learner, so it made the course work slightly more difficult as I wasn't able to be in a hands on in a physical classroom. It wasn't painful though, coursework was due every few days and the class finished in half the time of the traditional classes."
College Student,4,"Again, the financial aid process was tedious before we understood how many credits would transfer over, but once the credits were received the process picked up."
College Student,4,"They are kind and obliging when it comes to student enrollment. I don't think grants and scholarships are stressed enough, and there is definitely an emphasis on student loans. They are always willing to help correct a student's financial plan, but the process is often long and tedious."
College Sophomore,4,The student body is nice from what I have seen so far
College Sophomore,4,Overall the academic experience is great. The staff is wonderful. Well knowing and understanding. 
College Sophomore,4,"Flexibility is great. Teachers are not as much, but they are still just as good"
College Sophomore,4,Too much loan money but school is wonderful.
College Junior,4,All the computers on campus are set up to a network that runs through all of them. There is a printed always ready to be used and in range.
College Freshman,4,"I work two different jobs , both with weird schedules , and i still got all my needed classes in ! They definitely work with you , and help you to be successful !"
College Senior,4,"The Art Institute is very personal. You can actually build a personal relationship with the faculty. The classes are very small, there were times that it was only five student in class. Which is really good because you can get the attention that you need and not worry about the teacher not taking the time to listen to you or rush you."
College Junior,4,"There are a few faculty members I don't agree with, but I have always been helped in every way as far as every other department goes.  My questions are answered thoroughly.  I get free tutoring and counseling."
College Sophomore,4,My teachers right now are great they are knowledgeable in the course that they are teaching.
College Sophomore,4,"Pretty Good – As far as I can tell, CS does a pretty good job. They help students find part-time jobs when they need them, help prepare their resume, and set you up with internships in different facets of your major."
College Sophomore,4,Facilities Are Good but We Could Always Use More! All of the equipment is great. You have access to Macs and PCs and they're both chock full of great software. You can check out equipment like cameras and drawing tablets and everything is in pretty good shape. And there's always tons of resources available to you.
College Sophomore,4,"Use Every Resource Available – I feel like I'm getting a great education for my tuition cost. All of my instructors are experienced in my future career and can give me the ins and outs of the industry beyond that of a classroom education. Make sure you use your money wisely. Pick your instructors' brains, because whenever I've asked for help or advice, they were able to give it to me. Also become friends with your financial aid counselor. Don't be afraid of them, helping you is their job."
College Junior,4,"Computer Labs Are Great – With my degree being in Game Art and Design, their classroom that is full of the 21 inch Cintiqs are a must have. All of their systems work and are in good condition. Next to the front door is are sanitizing wipes, and I have always had no problems using their computers. Their student drive formats every other day, but that's fine since I save all of my work on my flash drive."
College Junior,4,Awesome Times to Go to School – I am really amazed at how the school works with my time frames.
College Freshman,4,"Graphic Design – I am a Graphic Design major, my classes are what I expected. The classes are what we need, they start with simple things that we need and slowly progresses into what we must learn. These classes are not over the top they are just right. They are simple but not so simple, these classes keep us awake throughout the day and I always want to go back."
College Freshman,4,Career Center – The career center at the Art Institute is definitely available to anyone who needs help or assistance in finding a job.
College Freshman,4,The Art Insitute is very diverse in its students and everyone is treated as equals.
College Freshman,4,Faculty and Staff – Through the enrollment process the Staff has been more than helpful and are determined to make sure all your questions are answered.
College Junior,4,"Not That Bad. The curriculum is shuffled around a lot at the expense of the students. The teachers are amazing, and I've made amazing friends, but the constant adding and dropping of classes is costing me my sanity and money."
College Senior,4,Student Lab – I love the student lab because of the different porgrams and applications available.
College Senior,4,The School – I just don't get it! The grade you see is my grade that I am earning.
College Senior,4,The assignments we are getting are lame. The grade you see is my grade.
College Sophomore,2,"not really accurate matriculation of previous credits as i was lead to believe.  Also told that they would wave a few classes, but when I went to push this, I was told they did not remember the conversation..."
College Junior,2,"Pretty Good. There's only one open lab, and for the most part we can't use any of the computer rooms because of classes. The scanners are awful and the tablet pens are almost always blunt."
College Junior,2,"Not Applied – I have no experience with online classes, nor have any knowledge of what it is like."
College Senior,2,"Not that great, I would want to say more sub-par. Unfortunately this school needs to redo a lot of the scheduling, staffing, just about everything."
College Sophomore,2,It's not the worst choice but not the best choice I've made.
College Senior,2,The education that I am getting is great to what I am paying. The Financial Aid office could use a little more knowledge about different loans out there. I have done research on my own versus get help and I got better help than I do at the Financial Aid Office.
College Junior,2,"Eh Its Ok – I do not like the school because it focuses on subjects like happiness and if you have a cold class room, or are hungry, all that the school can offer the students, as far as food goes, is candy or food that is a level below junkfood.  Even when you try to do something meaningful for a club, they do not seem to help you out as promised, (I think that one particular organization is not liked by AILV.) They make you take classes which teach nothing towards students' core programs like audio/drawing/cooking/management, and  I feel like people can get away with buddying up to a teacher to get an A. The classes for our core curriculum are awesome to plain boring, in my opinion, but I know I am mostly educating myself for my choosen profession."
College Sophomore,2,"Opinionated Teachers – While some teachers base their grades on the level of work done, there are certain instructors that favor a certain style.  For example, a certain teacher loves certain work that is ""girly"".  Anyone that turns in certain projects that involve ""girly"" font styles and colors seems to always get the recognition from the teacher."
College Junior,1,"I do not think the amount of money I am paying is comparable to the education I am receiving.  I do, however, think that the educational experience a student receives is completely dependent on the amount of knowledge the student wants to learn."
College Sophomore,1,"Lies Lies Lies – They won't help you unless you are in your 3rd year, which is the exact opposite of what the enrollment adviser will tell you. Bunch of liars out for just money,"
College Sophomore,1,"Lies Lies Lies – The advisers completely misrepresented the school. The culinary classrooms are overcrowded and there is not enough equipment to be effective or even try to cook. On average there are 25 students in each class when there are only 30 burners, yet everyone is expected to produce 2-3 dishes. There are no demos to show proper technique. You would be better of buying ingredients and cooking in your own kitchen. When these complaints were addressed to the head of the culinary department, he agreed with every complaint, yet nothing will be done. They just want your money and do not care if you learn."
College Junior,1,"The career services at my school laughed at my goals and plans as an animation major, stating that my big goal should be working at a casino. And they legitimately laughed at me and my friends."
College Junior,1,"Over Bearing Prices – While the school does teach based on projects which costs a good deal, the amount we are paying and how [certain things will stay], [the way things are run is] starting to degrade, as well as the lack of notification to help reinforce a particular student's ability to stay in school; [it] is disheartening. The worst part about it is the fact that our school personally has no control over the pricing, only the main branch does. This leaves students to wait on changes from half way across the US which can happen over night. Even right before a quarter, this can boot them from full time to part time student; if not worse."
College Junior,1,"The Stand Alone Complex – In a class of web designers, we as students for the most part band together to make things happen for each other, helping in the homework, in new ways of doing things ,in finding things that are needed to complete the projects that we are doing, and in some cases the software that we need we do not have so there needs to be a way around that as well."
College Junior,1,"Academic Review – In the course of being at the Art Institute of Las Vegas for not one but rather two degrees, graphic design as well as web design, I found that the program was ""made [up] as they went."" There seems to be a need to rebuild the program to a point of current industry standard because a vast amount of the students that come out of AILV are not ready for the field.  That is why I give it a D+."
College Junior,1,"I do not like to hang out because I go home where I can eat, do homework, and do what I want to do."
College Junior,1,"Oh No They Did Not – It's horrible, when you try to get finished with signing papperwork, and it is nearly impossible to work with [them because things] will flip flop, considering payment schedules, and the school will kick you out if you even try to control the situation."
College Junior,1,Portfiolio Prep in Reality – The graduation portfolio requirements call for a student to do more than half of the portfolio in a program and/or with techniques that are not taught in the classes leading into graduation.

Graduate Student,5,"Small class sizes, very personal, taught by professionals who are currently in the field you are studying to be in which is awesome for networking."
Graduate Student,5,Very communicative to help keep you on track and supportive when you need it most from the professors and the IT department.
Senior,5,I took all of my elective courses online and had a lot of fun with them.  The instructors are very knowledgeable and encouraging.
Senior,5,Fresno Pacific's Degree Completion program has aided me in obtaining my Bachelor's degree in less time than if I were to have transferred to another 4 year university!
Alum,5,"Fresno Pacific really cares about each students overall success. I was happy to find a school that didn't see me as just another student on the conveyor belt of students. I was always given the support, resources, and care that I deserve as a student."
Alum,5,"I loved all of my classes! The professors were usually working in the field, so we were getting hands-on experience and information!"
Graduate Student,5,Since I was in a degree completion program part of our instruction came from online assignments. We attended a physical classroom once a week and the rest of the week we were to complete assignments online. If we needed assistance or had questions on our assignments our instructors were easy to contact and we were able to easily communicate with our peers as well.
Graduate Student,5,I loved Fresno Pacific University. The small classroom size was perfect for me. The degree completion program I entered helped to finish my degree by requiring me to attend only once a week which allowed me to maintain the two jobs I worked. Resources and professors were easy to access when one most needed them.
Senior,5,I love going to this school. This school's degree completion program has taught me so much in just one semester. I love what I am learning and can't wait to use my new knowledge in my career job.
Senior,5,I took many classes online. I like how the professors take their time and help you with any questions you have towards any material. I also like how much feedback I get. The feedback helps me improve my writing skills.
Freshman,5,"Online experience has been great so far. Zoom makes it super simple to communicate with counselors, advisors, and professors."
Junior,5,Fresno Pacific University is a great place to study. People are really caring and they will do anything to help you excel in everything you want. Athletics are amazing and the support they give you is incredible.

Senior,5,I loved the environment at FPU. I felt safe to share my ideas and beliefs. I hope that the school will begin to offer a wider variety of graphic design classes.
Junior,5,"There There are many things I like about Fresno Pacific University. The first being, that it is based on God and faith. You can guarantee that your faith will flourish as you attend this university. The students come from all different types of life, but you all have faith in common.

Junior,5,"I absolutely love attending Fresno Pacific. All staff and faculty are absolutely amazing and will do anything to make sure that you are doing well and succeeding. It is easy to get involved on campus with leadership positions or even on-campus jobs. I think one thing that Fresno Pacific could maybe improve on is including students who might not have the best background/track record to show them that although we are a Mennonite Brethren university, we still care about people of different views."
Sophomore,5,I really enjoyed my first year of school at Fresno Pacific. The professors are very well equipped and knowledgeable about the subjects they taught. The beautiful facilities made working on school grounds fun and relaxing. I am very excited to start my second year of school in August.

I feel that at Fresno Pacific I have the opportunity to gather all the tools I need to be successful in life."

I like this university because of their great staff and faculty and excellent instructors. They have all been very helpful throughout the time I have been there and I know they will continue to be like this. The environment here is great and the university is very diverse. I love how they emphasize diversity and encourage students to learn about different cultural backgrounds. Another thing is that the campus is beautiful. It feels great because you are surrounded by nature and there are some squirrels, which are really cute. You can hang out or do homework outside in the nice weather or indoors at the lounge, library, etc. Overall, Fresno Pacific University ranks a 5 out of 5 because they are a welcoming community based institution where you feel you belong."
Niche User,5,"I haven't joined the university as yet, however so far its amazing. The staff is super helpful, flexible and organized. I love it."

Junior,5,I absolutely love this campus and everything about it!! I am a psych major and all of the professors are wonderful here and everyone who works here wants the absolute best for their students. I also love the Christian aspect of the school and the constant positive environment and small homey feel of the campus.
Junior,5,"I've really enjoyed the small class sizes and the ability to easily develop relationships with the professors. Everyone is extremely friendly, and it is easy to get help with anything you need. The only changes I would make would be to update more parts of the campus and their class equipment. I also dislike the high tuition cost, but it is a private university so that can only be expected."
Junior,5,"Fresno Pacific is an amazing college. Even though it is a small college it is flourishing and growing over the years. The staff truly care for students overall; And seek to develop relationships with all of their students. Professors and staff members not only want to see their students thrive academically but also mentally, emotionally, occupationally, and spiritually.  They also provide a good amount of donor scholarships; And they also provide affordable study abroad programs!"
Senior,5,"For years I told myself I would NEVER go to Fresno Pacific because it was a local university. After visiting the campus one more time (after visitng schools like UCSB, UC Merced, CBU, APU, and etc) I fell in love with it! I have run into some issues though with communication between different departments on campus, but all in all I have really enjoyed my experience at this school. The professors and faculty feel like a family!"
Sophomore,5,"When seeking to pursue a higher education I was fearful of impacted class sizes, and a rough transition being a first-generation student. The community and atmosphere provided me with confidence and security."

Staff's main focus and priority is to assist the students with any questions or help they need. I would recommend this school for anyone.
Niche User,5,"Love Fresno Pacific University.  Very glad with my decision to choose this university.  Living in the valley of California, we do not get a lot of nice universities, but Fresno Pacific University changes that.  The learning environment is great, teachers are great, staff is great.  I can not say enough nice things about this university."
Junior,5,"I actually just started at Fresno Pacific, I would have to say I am really looking forward to learning about the bible especially since I grew up Mormon."
Graduate Student,5,"The faculty at Fresno Pacific University does an excellent job of ensuring their students get the most our of their educational experience. The number of students in the classes I have had has not been excessively large, such as my former university. This makes it much easier for the professor to be able to interact with each one of their students. Never did I think I would be at a university where every professor I have knows my first name. In addition to this, all the professors I have had have been great. They are flexible and are willing to work with you if ever you encounter any difficulties. I highly recommend this university."
Junior,5,"Fresno pacific has a beautiful campus, and they are really family oriented around the campus, which is exactly what I love; it makes this school amazing. I'd like to see them have a bigger sports crowd outing, and support for home sporting events."
Senior,5,"I have attended Fresno Pacific for a year and within that years I have not only grown personally but academically as well. It has been such a great experience. The professors have been great, they really provide so much knowledge that they bring from the own work experience."

I am basically starting over!  The staff at Fresno Pacific have been very accommodating, kind, and super knowledgeable.  They have made this life changing decision jump off to a pleasant start.  I feel very well informed and prepared to start this next journey in my life.  I truly believe with the support I have at Fresno Pacific I have an awesome chance at achieving my goals!"
Junior,5,"I really like how they are Christ Centered! You develop relationships and strong bonds with other students and teachers. You can feel the love and attention from people, wanting to live Christ like while making a difference. I wouldn't change anything honestly, It is a bit pricey but the reviews and graduation rate is awesome. Companies are hiring people who come out of Fresno Pacific!"
Senior,5,My experience at Fresno Pacific University has been great. The staff and administration are very friendly which a gives way for a wonderful learning environment.  Being a Christian University I am able to Discuss my views from a religious view point. I feel Fresno Pacific has strengthened me as an individual which will allow me to be more proficient in my career.
Alum,5,"I loved being a part of this school and the community that surrounded it. I came into college only knowing one person and left with a handful of lifelong friends who have stayed by my side. I was able to grow not only intellectually, but also spiritually."
Recent Alumnus,5,Career services are great about immersing students into job like situations and getting students ready for the work force
Recent Alumnus,5,"Great coaching staffs for all sports, with quality facilities. It's all lead by great faculty from the AD down."
College Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the courses and professors at our school. We have expert in their field and people that really care.
College Sophomore,5,The level of school spirit at Fresno Pacific is astounding. Everyone is passionate about sports and proud to be a sunbird.
College Sophomore,5,"I was honestly dreading coming to Fresno Pacific for its background and its belief system, but I would have to say that it is one of the best things that I ever did. It has shaped me in incredible ways and I couldn't be more thankful."
College Senior,5,"This degree completion option at fresno pacific allows working students with careers, like myself, the opportunity to obtain a degree during evenings to further their current careers. It is a desirable fast track to further your career."
College Sophomore,5,The one-on-one relationships that I have with all of my professors and staff members helps so much. The school is so small that everyone knows each other and we are truly a close knit community. I love that aspect of my school and the Christian atmosphere is awesome as well.
College Senior,5,I have never felt unsafe while at school either on the main campus or at the North center.
College Senior,5,It is wonderful to be able to pick up the phone and talk to my adviser about any questions I have. Having an adviser walk me through the steps I need to take is very refreshing. When I was at community college I basically had to figure everything out on my own or talk to someone who didn't know me personally. I love the close family feel of Fresno Pacific University.
College Sophomore,5,"I have really enjoyed both my courses and professors. Even when I am not fond of the subject, I have somehow managed to enjoy every course that I've taken."
College Sophomore,5,"This particular school has been essential in both my academic and character growth. The classes are engaging and professors are open and helpful. There is an open door policy that makes professors and other faculty member very accessible. 

The campus is beautiful and comforting, and the community is very tight-knit. I have made some of my best friends at Fresno Pacific, and the university's environment really encourages and nurtures deep and lasting relationships.

I would not choose any other college even if I could do it all over again. This was definitely the right university for me, and I hope to see many more people choosing it in the future."
College Junior,5,The school is amazing because the professors truly care about the students and want a one on one interaction.
College Sophomore,5,FPU is a great school! The environment is so inviting and grounded by a strong Christian background.
College Junior,5,I have loved every moment of my college experience. I live on campus and have learned to challenge and better myself through trials while at school.
College Sophomore,5,"The school help me out tremendously. The individual is responsible to look into the free money. It is out there, you just have to be willing to ask about it."
College Junior,5,I dont know much about it but I have only heard amazing things about off campus housing.
College Junior,5,I think that the school is close enough to all the best places to dine.
Sophomore,4,"After the closing of schools due to the pandemic, my professors maintained frequent and transparent contact with our classes. The smaller class sizes of FPU benefited students being able to communicate with professors about personal struggles, and were accommodated by the majority of professors. This made the sudden shift to online much less stressful for many of my classmates, something I could not say about many  my friends who attend other universities."
Sophomore,4,"FPU provides truly impactful instruction through caring and competent faculty. The community at FPU is very special, and something many college environments lack. While not a traditional college atmosphere, FPU makes students feel valued. There is still work to be done to change certain outdated policy language, however FPU instills in its students a drive to better the world around them, and prepares them to do so."
Sophomore,4,Fresno Pacific is a great University. I had a great experience while attending there. All of my professors were willing to help and responded to my emails in a timely manner. I would definitely recommend FPU to friends and family.
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love Fresno Pacific University. I would recommend this college. The professors are great! My advisor Jenny was the best!
Freshman,4,"I have just been accepted into FPU. I am very excited to start, but so far the academic advisors have been very great with leading me in the correct direction. They are staying in touch with me, so I count on with the most up to date information."
Junior,4,They had some problems adapting to online learning and a lot of my classes were kinda done because professors didn’t take the time to move to online classes
Graduate Student,4,"Christian school but you don't have to be of that faith to attend. Small classes, nice instructors. They offer instruction on several campuses throughout area. There are financial aid options and scholarships available."
Junior,4,"Smaller classes, counselors and teachers make the effort to talk to you when you have questions, great energy, really good people."
Junior,4,Fresno Pacific is a great university. Staff and instructors provide a lot of support. Every questions or concern is addressed right away. Courses are convenient for working students.
Graduate Student,4,"I completed my Bachelor's Degree through Fresno Pacific University's Degree Completion Program. Students had to have completed their first two years of college before enrolling. The class met once a week for 13 months and was done in a cohort model. As a working mother, the format worked really well for me. I did not have to worry about which classes to register for or whether there would be room. I am now enrolled in a graduate program through them. My instructors are professionals in the industry and I am making lots of good connections."
Junior,4,"At FPU, I feel like I'm a part of a community. The professors, staff, and other students are very friendly. Even though there can be quite a few financial aid or registration mix-ups, the staff work with you to get everything settled. You can become very closely connected with the students and professors of your major and find where you fit easily."
Junior,4,My experience here is just beginning since I am a new incoming student to the campus. I love the campus and it is perfect if you do not like bigger surroundings. My only complaint would be the cost of tuitions …..looks like scholarships are my number one friend this year.
Senior,4,Fresno Pacific is an amazing University with a wealth of professors who are experts in their field. They truly take student learning to a new level and care about their students.
Graduate Student,4,"Love this school. I love that it is faith based. The staff are kind. However, I would wish for more financial aid for students of different backgrounds. Peers are nice as well."
Freshman,4,It’s a beautiful school and the professors here are amazing and always willing to help you succeed.  There’s so many great programs that finding a career right after college should be a breeze.
Senior,4,I really liked the efficiency of the online/hybrid course options. I am not sure how I would have graduated without this program.
Freshman,4,"FPU is an amazing school with an amazing community. It is very small, and it makes everyone feel welcome. If you are looking for a small school with a focus on community, this is the school for you."
Senior,4,The staff and professors are very helpful and caring! Whenever there is a problem they do their best to help you through whatever you need. The faculty and many of the students are welcoming and helpful with tips on how to make your experience on this campus worth while.
Junior,4,"Fresno Pacific is a great school. It is fast paced and is the best option for people who have full time jobs and need to go to school in the evening, but don't want it to take 4 years to get their degree."
Junior,4,"I love the community and atmosphere on the main campus. You get to meet really amazing professors and classmates. The classes offered here are enriching and the professors really care about you succeeding. The school is founded on Christ and is affiliated with the Mennonite sect of Protestantism. You do not have to be a Christian to attend this university as there is no statement of faith paper which needs to be documented. They are welcoming of all backgrounds and beliefs. Our athletics are also amazing. I especially like the swimming & diving and volleyball team. They are both so fun to cheer on! We are located close to downtown Fresno so my friends often go coffee shop hopping on the weekends. The school may be small, but we make up for it with big smiles and big hearts."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy Fresno Pacific, I an incoming freshman so it was very intimidating going and looking at the big college campuses. I mainly chose Fresno Pacific because of how small and personal the campus is. They truly make time to get to know you and make you feel at home. To them you are just not another face, teachers and staff actually know who you are and will truly get to know you. Also there campus felt so homey and just enough to feel like you are no longer in high school."
Alum,4,"Fresno Pacific University is a private university. As a private university, the tuition fee is very expensive. The FPU offers scholarships for students from low income family and students with high GPA. The ratio between professor and students is low. The professors put student' success in the highest priority. So, the numbers of graduation students is very high compared other universities. The FPU has dorms/housing, campus food, other facilities."
Junior,4,"This school has a lot to offer, academically, spiritually, and socially. The people here are friendly, and it is generally a God centered school. I believe the education I am receiving here will serve me well in my future career choice."
Freshman,4,"I love the community that this University has created. There are so many people that are here for you and want you to succeed and I think that is very important for students when they first start out in college. This school makes everyone feel wanted and it is so easy to get involved here. However sometimes it can get boring on the weekends because it can feel like no one goes here, that can change though if we can get more people to stay and hang out."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Safety is great around campus, campus security is always around and there is a great sense of safety within campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,"A friendly welcome from commuters. The people on campus is involving in activities and encourage community. 

I love that I get to see the same people on the daily."
College Senior,4,The security precautions at fresno pacific are great and make me feel really safe. we are informed when there is anything we should be concerned about
College Senior,4,"I truly love the flexibility of Fresno Pacific's adult cohort programs. It allows me to continue with my career, and further my education."
College Senior,4,The campus itself is great when it comes to security. The surrounding community is not the safest and sometimes cars get broken into. The university should invest in installing cameras where parking is also free to help get justice for those victims of crime around the campus. There are not many strangers on campus and that usually adds to the feeling of safety.
College Senior,4,Housing seems to be really good. Dorms are huge compared to UC's and FSCSU.
College Senior,4,"All of our sports teams excel in their specialty sport; however, the campus and community is not heavily involved which makes it harder to get that college experience when it comes to sports. School spirit is poor, I feel."
College Senior,4,"Very small campus which is both good and bad. I have heard that students that live on campus know each others business. I would rather not be apart of that on campus culture for that reason, but it is really hard being a commuter when you want to get involved in on campus events."
College Freshman,4,They seem almost typical to movie frats.
College Freshman,4,"Since it is a small private school, everyone works."
College Sophomore,4,I think the dorms and living areas on campus are nice. They're all clean and not to far from campus. Its a great way to keep connected to your friends
College Sophomore,4,"In all of the sporting events we have many supporters and fans. I am a swimmer here at FPU and even though swimming may be a boring sport to watch, many of my peers understand it and keep up with how we are doing. As a school we love sports. It would be nice to have a nicer pool, but we can manage."
College Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore this year, and this year has been really great. We are a small school, so we are all close and friendly. Its nice knowing everyone and seeing familiar faces daily."
College Sophomore,4,its good but not the best
College Sophomore,4,"The neighborhood is a little dangerous, but campus safety works hard to keep us secure. The gate system works well and there are officers available to walk students back from night classes if they don't feel safe."
College Sophomore,4,"The career center is constantly updating the student body on new job, internship, and career opportunities. My work experience has been great, and the school has been a big part oh that."
College Sophomore,4,"I have heard of mishaps and issue with housing because it is very old, but I personally have had a really great experience living on campus and really enjoy the community as well as the convenience."
College Sophomore,4,"I am not personally an athlete and rarely attended sports events before coming to college, but the Student Life office encourages a lot of school spirit and support, so I have actually attended( and surprisingly have also enjoyed) more games in the past two years than ever before in my life. The school spirit is well balance through most of the sports, but our school is especially proud of our water sports, specifically our swim team which has possibly the highest popularity and support from the student body. I'm not an expert, but I would say that athletics are a fairly big deal."
College Freshman,4,"I believe attending Fresno Pacific University has been a great experience for the first semester of my first year of college. It has taught me to value the schoolwork that is given from the teacher. Also, I should be aware of the amount of sleep I get every night so I be ready for class the next morning. I should even consider joining in a club or extra curriculum to meet new people. People at Fresno Pacific University tends to be more friendly than others when joining a club so I became involved. Moreover, it has been an excellent way of helping me in college with a new lifestyle as a beginner in college."
College Freshman,4,"I love this place honestly. The friendships you create are real and authentic and it is so hard not to like anyone or not have at least one friend. The guys are not stuck up. Some are conceited but not stuck up. In fact, the most attractive ones are quick to talk to you and just try and be your friend. There are also a lot of foreign guys if you're into that (I am so I noticed). They also make attempts to talk to you and their accents are swoon-worthy.

The professors are amazing and quite lenient and very amazing. The classes do require effort, some more or less, all depending on the teacher. Overall a great fit for me and anyone looking for kind people."
College Senior,4,This school has offered me so much and has allowed me reach my goal of becoming a teacher.
College Junior,4,"One's experience at Fresno Pacific is often defined how it is approached. If you go in with a great attitude, you're experience will be great and vice versa. There are lots of opportunities to have a great time amidst nights of studying. be careful about who you tell your business to because it's a small campus, and more people than you'll want will get into it. Sometimes things will be frustrating, just like any other place, but it's easy to find great people to build lasting relationships with."
College Freshman,4,"Administration is pretty good. There are certain aspects of the administration that are hard to deal with which are primarily the academic side, however the residence side is great. Resident Directors are great and really get to know you. They want to help you and be available to you."
College Freshman,4,"Freshman housing for girls is fantastic. Girls have their own bathroom that they only share with their roommates which makes the process of transitioning much easier. The RA's that live on the floor are fantastic with incorporating the girls into the campus life. The campus is small which means living areas are close to everything from the library, pool and gym to the classes, cafeteria and multiple lounge/study areas. Cost is a little high, but there are plenty of scholarships available and there are many amenities. The housing process is a little confusing after the Freshman year. It is a little jumbled and slightly unorganized. Social atmosphere is okay. There are some cliques, but no more than expected on a small campus."
College Sophomore,4,Great healthy food options plus there is a Starbucks on site.
College Sophomore,4,I am from the area so getting around is easy. It is probably at 10-15 minute drive to get to the nicer part of Fresno.
College Junior,4,they a lot of different kinds of dining that is available near by.
College Junior,4,What I like about it most is that it is so close to school that I do not have to worry about going far from classes.
College Freshman,4,The professors actually care about you
College Freshman,4,The school is very active in supporting one another.
College Student,4,There is plenty of space and lots of people to get along with.
College Student,4,There is plenty of apartments and other housing close to Fresno Pacific.
College Freshman,4,"There's a lot to do in the area, and most of the places that we want to go are near by. I personally like to stay on campus, but my Mod Mates go on Dutch and Chipotle runs all the time."
College Freshman,4,"They are understandably strict about many factors that would affect our academic performance as well as our futures. They keep us safe and have open communication. We are allowed to protest and petition, but they are pretty adamant about the school's Christian foundations."
College Freshman,4,"They really let you know all the expenses ahead of time and only ask for the money month by month. They have a lot of scholarships, and try their best so that none of the costs catch you by surprise. The school is expensive, but if you are willing to work, they are willing to help you as much as possible. Plus, there are a lot of on-campus jobs that are especially for students."
College Freshman,4,I feel very safe on campus. the security is good and there is a generalk concern and interest in the well-being of individuals.
Senior,2,Exclusive. Divided. Confused. Should be the actual motto of campus. The campus as a whole seems to lack a base knowledge of where it wants to go. Professors are caring but sometimes less either less knowledgeable about the subject than students or just lack the skill to teach at a higher eduction level.
College Freshman,2,"It depends how you see it. It is very strict but sometimes thats good. However, visitation hours are so strict and its hard because sometimes you just want to watch a movie with you boyfriend if you don't have class the next day. Feels like your at home with parents, not college sometimes."
College Freshman,2,"A lot of the housing is old and run down. A lot of housing assignments were moved around and priority did not go to athletes. So late practices are held, the cafeteria is not open and underclassmen athletes are left with no kitchen to cook a healthy dinner. East Hall is by far the best, but is primarily freshman girls and now faculty housing. So the studetns once again get the old housing such as Stras and Krause."
College Junior,2,I am still dealing with financial aid. I can not figure out how to get anyone to reply back to me. They drag out this proess and its awful.
College Freshman,2,Not the best place to live.
College Freshman,2,"It's strict but a little too much. We are adults, we aren't in high school anymore. Visitation hours are too strict. We just like to hang out, we don't want a curfew. I feel like I am treated like I am a kid all over again."
College Senior,2,Off campus housing is expensive and in not in the safest part of town. Your better off renting an apartment with a few friends. The cost is way cheaper!
College Senior,2,"Nobody parties on the campus. If people want to go out, they attend parties, clubs, or other social gatherings outside of the campus."
College Junior,2,"Public transportation is not convenient in Bakersfield.  It took me two hours, two buses and some dusty walking to get to work when it only took 25 minutes by car."
College Student,2,super hot summers and cold but no snow in the winter
College Senior,2,It get's really hot in Fresno in the Summer 
College Sophomore,2,"I know a few students who live off campus, but I don't think I ever would. You're required to live on campus if you're under the age of 21, unless you're living with your parents. So most students do live on campus, but off campus housing is questionable in Fresno. I wouldn't feel safe living off campus, because a lot of the buildings are located in bad areas that are run down and dangerous to live in. I'm not sure what the prices are, but I don't think they'd be worth the risk."
College Sophomore,2,"If it weren't for the campus itself being so nice, I wouldn't have ever wanted to live in this area. The university is located in one of the worst parts of Fresno, and there is definitely a lot of crime and drug use in that part of Fresno. It's not an attractive area either, but once you are actually on campus you feel completely safe."
College Junior,2,"This is a great school and I have learned a lot but this is not the school for me. I really wish I would have looked into a lot more before making my choice. I understood that I was signing up to attend a private christian school, but I don't believe I was at all prepared for the type of environment that is practiced at this college. 
The staff and students are very friendly but if you're not a christian that is practice the type of religion the school does the environment can be uncomfortable. You are required to take Bible classes, which was nice since I have never really read the Bible before. But the classes are not set up for much of any type of discussion or openness to any other type of review but their own. 
The classes that are not based on religion still carry religion in them. This is one of the reasons I believe this was not the school for me. I do not see how learning about the religion factor and whatever major it maybe is at all helpful. 
I am all for the freedom of everyone to be able to practice their own religion but I do not like that it is pushed upon the students who do not practice their ways. 
I am not a fan of this schools views on gays. Yes, there are gay students at this school, just as there are gay people in the world. Also the schools pacifist beliefs are a little unnerving. They do not respect or observe Veterans Day which in my personal view is in total disrespect. 
Ultimately this is a good school but be aware of what you are getting yourself into first. If I could do it all over again I would rather attend Fresno State and feel more comfortable with my school and surroundings. "
College Senior,2,"Unfortunately from what I have seen and heard, dining on campus is not great. There isn't the same quality and taste as home cooking but it's satisfying at least. The dining hall is spacious and plenty of areas to sit and enjoy your meal; there is not much of a variety inside the cafeteria but there is also a coffee shop that provides meals too. The meal plans can be pricey but eating three times a day can add up in the end. There are restaurants outside the school that are options outside of the school."
College Freshman,2,"When I have visited, the parking is tight, and often you cannot find anyplace to park at all."
College Junior,2,"We are known for being on the ""bad side"" of town and there is not much to do that does not cost money. Shopping, movies, bowling and that kind of stuff is usual but it is such a bummer to pay for entertainment."
College Senior,2,"Not That Great. On campus parking lots aren't for on-campus residents, only for staff and commuters. There's a separate parking lot off campus for resident students. It's a little inconvenient and the neighborhood is pretty bad. But we have decent security keeping an eye on things."
College Junior,2,Only One Computer Lab – There is only one computer lab that is available for all students. The others are only available to students who have been put on a lab list. This is unfortunate as the other labs are bigger and have more computers available and the main computer lab fills up way too quickly.
College Senior,2,"Its hard to get a lot of financial aid, the school is extremely expensive and only Jesus Christ can really provide the finances for one to attend the university."
Graduate Student,1,"Some of the professors were awesome! However, the dorms/housing is no good. Other students living there act so immature like children screaming at the top of their lungs all day when other people (like me) actually have homework to do but can't focus because of them. The RA did nothing about it neither did the head of the housing. Horrible experience. Also, the registration people don't care about holding you back an extra semester even if you have completed all of your credits. They do not respond on time & they're always sending you from person to person without answering your questions. They never helped me. It was very frustrating. If I had a chance to redo that I would not go back to that again. Very disappointing."
College Senior,1,We don't have greek life.
College Freshman,1,"HORRIBLE. There is nothing. May as well just go to a house party, you will be caught on campus. Once again, doesn't feel like you're at college at all. Mistakes are supposed to be made, we arent all supposed to be saints."
College Freshman,1,"I have had so many problems with this food. I am highly allergic to tree nuts. I was pouring fruit loops one time and found numerous almonds and walnuts in the cereal. Its there because the staff didn't clean out the cereal dispenser before pouring the new one in. Thus, leaving stuff from previous cereal in there. I could have had an allergic reaction and had to go to the hospital. I shouldn't have to check if my fruit loops has almonds in it! It is so unsanitary. The silverware and plates have crud still on them sometimes even after being washed. Its disgusting."
College Junior,1,We have a vending machines.
College Senior,1,Its very strict because we are a private school.
College Student,1,idk haven't found it yet
College Freshman,1,"House parties are great but rarely happens, and nightlife is mostly for those 21 and older students."
College Junior,1,"Not the Best – Since we are a small school, all the have is the cafeteria. The food is sometimes good, but the only thing I consistently enjoyed is that there is a chef's corner where they make burritos every day at lunch. We really don't have many options and I have acid reflux, so the food was always making me feel sick."
College Junior,1,"Not the Best Area – The off campus selection for living is not the best. The area that our school is located is defintaely not the finest in Fresno as well. The safety and comfort is not there, so i have chosen to take a big step and stay at home while i attend college. I know a lot of friends that have had stuff broken into, whether it is their car or appartment. YES, it can happen anywhere but the frequency of this occuring is higher."
College Sophomore,1,Public transportation is available in Fresno however the system is not well designed.  You can catch a bus near campus but may have to change buses several times and it may take a significant amount of time to travel a short distance.

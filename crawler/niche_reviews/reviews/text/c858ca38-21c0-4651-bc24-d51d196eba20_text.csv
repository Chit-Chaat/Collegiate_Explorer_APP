Alum,5,"Professors and counselors were very supportive. 
If you are interested in research opportunities many of the professors will let you know if they are accepting students, if not, some will help you find someone who is.

The SEE program was very helpful with informing members of available scholarships, events, etc. that made my college experience much more enjoyable.

The only 24 hour study building is the AIRC, which can sometimes be overcrowded. It would be nice if it was larger or if there was another building"
Senior,5,Love Sacramento State! It is so diverse and fun that you will really grow in this university. You will end up meeting a ton of people who are just as nice :)
Senior,5,"The online experience is great! We all have to adjust due to COVID, but we are working it through. It isn't the worse thing and professors are super understanding on everything."
Junior,5,"It has great services for everyone, and you get quick responses back. People are friendly and there are great places to hang out."
Alum,5,"I had a wonderful experience at Sac State & miss it dearly. The professors in the Psychology department are helpful, supportive, & truly enjoy investing in the success of their students. The campus is beautiful, despite being described as ""ugly"" on several top 10 lists. It is covered in beautiful greenery & the buildings are contemporary, both in design & in internal construction. There are plenty of student resources that are dedicated to supporting students in their success. The Writing Center, PARC, the Well, etc. are all incredible resources that should be regularly used by everyone who attends. The tuition is affordable compared to the UC system & the support is far better than the UC system (I attended Berkeley, which was a nightmare & a half that I would not wish on my worst enemy)."
Alum,5,"I did not enroll in any online courses, but I did take online courses this last semester due to COVID-19. The university did a great job of transitioning online & everything flowed smoothly."
Junior,5,"So far I only registered for online courses, however, the  help with the online courses and student center is great."
Junior,5,"The help from the Sacramento State, quick response on emails, and phone calls. During the pandemic staff and counselors are helping student to choose the right classes and creating the Zoom workshops."
Alum,5,sac state offers many classes online. i took multiple summer and winter courses online and it allowed me to graduate faster. Each class I had online through sac state was well run by the professors and highly organized.
Alum,5,"I had the best experience at Sacramento State. I graduated with a B.S degree in liberal studies and a minor in history. Each and every professor i had was outstanding and so kind. They really go the extra mile to be sure students have a healthy mental health, feel important and that everything is fair and just in terms of classes and campus life. I'm a young adult girl who takes pride in feeling safe everywhere i go, and never once did i feel unsafe at sac state."
Sophomore,5,I have only had three classes online so far and they have been easier than what I expected. You really have to read the syllabus many times to understand everything. This is because some teachers have a specific way they would like you to submit assignments. I really liked how my teachers would respond to email really fast it never took more than a day to get a response. One thing that was a bit hard since I couldn't ask my teacher all the questions I had. It would be best to work with other people in your class or get tutoring because that helped me a lot when I got stuck on things I didn't really get.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently in me second half of being a Sophomore at Sacramento State. I went into this school not sure about what I wanted to study but in orientation I made friends and they told me their major which was Construction Management. I was curious about learning more so I decided to declare that as my major and it was the best decision I did because I love the program and have made more friends in my classes. I adapted really fast to the college environment with the help of many people which I am thank full for. Everyone is nice and people are willing to help others with anything. The campus is really nice the only thing that Sacramento gets really hot and I am from the bay so I'm still not use to the drastic weather change. To summarize, I would recommend any one who is going to graduate high school  to check out Sac State."
Junior,5,Sacramento State has become my home for the past two years. I have developed life long friendships and have learned a lot from my peers and Professors.
Junior,5,I will be attending Sacramento State online this next semester. I am still looking forward to attending the classes regardless of if they are online or not.
Niche User,5,It is an extremely professional environment that prepares students for real workplace environments but also allows for growth.
Niche User,5,"They provided the materials needed in an efficient and affordable way. They also gave extra support when needed, caring about each individuals students need.s."
Sophomore,5,The professor are kind and I can finish my work on time on my own schedule. I am grateful! I can get my degree faster!
Sophomore,5,I attended a community college before transferring to Sac State. They helped me with the transition into the university.
Alum,5,"Excellent School. The professors are brilliant and kind. The professors are really good at teaching and doing it in a way that makes it more inviting to come to class all the time. Also, other students are generally nice and school has a very friendly atmosphere."
Junior,5,"the one thing i like about my school is that, the campus is very diverse and also how connected you feel to school when living on campus"
Senior,5,I love CSUS!! I like how it's basically a forest and each and every tree has a number on it. I love all the student events CSUS offers.
Junior,5,"Sac state is a beautiful campus and very welcoming. It is also a very diverse campus, unlike other CSU campus’s."
Alum,5,"CSUS is an overall great school. They provide tons of resources for students to use and the campus is very welcoming. I would say a lot of classes are impacted due to too many students, but I was able to get my degree in a comfortable amount of time."
Alum,5,Courses online were very easy and straight forward. I didn't have any difficulty registering or completing online courses.
Alum,5,"I rate California State University, Sacramento 5/5 stars. I one day want to become an Occupational Therapist, and I was overjoyed that this school had a Pre-Occupational Therapy Club."
Alum,5,"I took a few online classes at this school, and I never had any problems with the online system. All of the online tools were easy to understand and utilize."
Alum,5,"Great school that has a lot of options available for students. The Well is a remarkable aspect to the college for students that are wanting to focus on their health. The Well is equipped with exercise equipment, mental health services, and over-all health options. The academics are put together well and force you to learn and grow."
Senior,5,"I overall love my experience at California State University, Sacramento! I appreciate the diversity of the campus. It makes me feel like I belong on campus. During club days, I can physically see how diverse the campus is. There are many clubs students are able to join. I specifically found my place in the organization, Kappa Psi Epsilon Sorority Incorporated. I do not regret joining the org. I especially appreciate President Nelsen during this hard time. He does his best to address issues such as crimes on campus, racial discrimination, etc and gives the student body reassurance during this pandemic. I can feel how genuine he is and how much he cares."
Junior,5,"Despite people giving Sacramento State a bad rep, they are just whiny little babies. Don't listen to them. Sacramento State is amazing and has a lot to offer. Also, when reading reviews on Ratemyprofessor take it with a grain of salt. Most of the people leaving bad reviews are, wait for it, whiny little babies that expect the professors to spoon feed them the information. It's college y'all. Sports can use some extra funding and the buildings can be updated but I am told that that is in the works."
Senior,5,"Sacramento State was a wonderful experience. There are tons of trees and great departments over there. Their library is tranquil, peaceful, and a perfect place to get homework done. They got Panda Express, Round Table Pizza, and many more places to eat. They offer tutoring and other services as well. Squirrels are very common over there but there are also turkeys, jackrabbits, and coyotes as well. The Well is a great gym for students to work out."
Niche User,5,It was very nice and welcoming. I love the campus and can't wait to attend it later on this year. It is a very gorgeous camp and wish many other would attend this amazing school.
Junior,5,"I love it here. It is so beautiful around campus and everyone is so nice and welcoming. I haven't started school here yet, I start in the Fall 2020, but I absolutely fell in love with the campus during my first campus tour. I have done 2 campus tours already and I visited the campus outside of tours on my own. I love it here."
Senior,5,"Sac State has a great academic setting. There’s so much diversity not only in the student body, but also with the opportunities provided on campus. The food variety gives a little of each. There are so many organizations or clubs that help network like-minded individuals to help grow and pursue career aspirations and goals. My experience has been nothing but great. I am able to achieve my educational goals and pursue career opportunities through UEI that will help me experience post-graduation careers. Sac State has provided me the opportunity to accomplish a higher standard of learning, network with others who share a similar dream or career, and professional skills when working with others."
Graduate Student,5,I haven't started yet but I am sure that when I do it will be amazing! I will answer these questions to the best of my knowledge so far of the school and campus. I have been there for interviews and info sessions so I have a pretty good idea. My sister also goes there for grad school and loves it so I have a lot to go off of with her help.
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus, it is very beautiful and there are so many clubs and extracurricular activities to be a part of. There are also lots of very easily accessible resources available if you ever need assistance."
Senior,5,"Academics and Professors, When I first started Sacramento state was very nervous and shy. I did know what classes to take and basically had no direction. My advisors helped me figure out what I want to major in. I decided to major in health science. In this major, I became really close with all my professors. It is true when they say, you know you picked the right major when you fell like you fit in. To my professors and academics, I felt like I fit in. Sacramento State has taught me a lot and it is a great CSU to attend."
Junior,5,"I'm a transfer student and am in my first two semesters so far. Sacramento State has been a good overall experience, The campus features a great gym, multiple food courts and great nature environment. There is an amazing planetarium that is newly built, It gives a real world experience of planets and more. It almost is as if you were at that specific location yourself.  Sac state provides a nice environment for prospective students."
Freshman,5,Good experience on all so far. The think I’m concern is the parking lots for the student we need more parking.
Freshman,5,"Very beautiful campus- diverse, big, great community. Would recommend for all students to attend this university."
Junior,5,"I love the diversity and the professors are very understanding. The thing I love the most is that they care about your grade if you do and will do the best they can at helping you achieve your goals and they can be very motivating and encouraging. There are lots of opportunities here like gym, sports, Rock climbing, sororities and so many more programs. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a 4 year college."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the fact that Sacramento State University  is inherently diverse, but students still have the opportunity to find a group of people on campus who illustrates and stand for the somethings as themselves. I like that there are multiple resources and events; enough to balance out ones life if needed and most professors I have ran into are always ready to help if one puts in the work. All these characteristics demonstrate an amazing campus."
Freshman,5,"The school has been open to me, being that it's my first year. There's truly nothing I'd change about it."
Freshman,5,Sacramento State is really helpful with incoming freshmen. They offer first year class and a space for only first years and offers so much help.
Niche User,5,"It was so beautiful! It was so beautiful!
It was so beautiful!

Freshman,5,"Overall Sac State is a great CSU, there is so much it has to offer academic and student life wise. I joined greek life and made so many new friends and I am super comfortable on campus."
Junior,5,"Sac State is a very beautiful school. The atmosphere is like no other! I enjoy all it has to offer. The professors are very helpful, and my peers are also willing to offer a helping hand. One thing I would change is to update some of the older buildings to give it a fresher appearance."
Sophomore,5,"It’s a really good school it has a very nice environment. Most of the teachers that I have had so far a really good. 
They really care about the students and they want everyone to succeed."
Junior,5,"It's a wonderful school. The professors are great and many of the programs are fully funded. The graphic design program is brutal but very good. Excellent choice for transfer students from the Los Rios Community college system. Many, if not most, of the classes available there transfer to Sac State."
Freshman,5,"Sacramento state has been amazing so far the staff and professors have been so friendly to me. The resources they offer are so helpful in every aspect if you are struggling finically, needing extra help in a certain subject, having trouble fitting in or to destress from college. I've only been here for a semester but already I am enjoying myself the school had made it easier for me to transition from high school on to college. The campus looks so beautiful as a whole and the scenery of the bike trail is wonderful as well. The clubs they offer have great opportunities for the club I was in had amazing speakers that were related to the careers we wanted to go into. so far the school has been an amazing experience."
Freshman,5,"Is my first year but I like it, I hope I can get the help I need when time arrives, because is kind of hard to be far from home is something new but I will try to work"
Junior,5,"I love it here at Sac State. Everyone is friendly and nice. The campus is beautiful. They offer everything you can think of. This is a great place to learn, play, and meet interesting people."
Sophomore,5,"Coming from a small town in the Valley, I love how diverse Sac State is! There are so many things to do and so many experiences within this university. It has helped me expand my horizons in a socially and academically status."
Freshman,5,"CSU Sacramento State is a really diverse school. It is interesting to see the diversity of the school and the experience in college is very different when compared to high school. People in college are friendly and helpful when you need a helping hand. The prices for food is average but there are varieties of type of food on campus. The school also hosts numerous events on campus and most of them are advocates or an event filled with employers employing college students or interning them. Overall, the campus is really great and they have multiple emergency stations throughout campus."
Niche User,5,I love it here at SAC State i honestly believe that it is the best college in the country and if you can you should come here.
Niche User,5,"I am a High School Student that went to see California State University - Sacramento and seen the diversity and the academic opportunities it had for me. I was also able to take a tour of the whole campus and it was a good looking school. California State University - Sacramento had many classes I was intrigued by, in order to pursue my career as a Clinical Laboratory Scientist, which required many biology courses and many science courses."
Freshman,5,"First and foremost, Sacramento State is home to the capital of California and is super close to downtown and Old Sacramento. The campus at Sacramento State is amazing, especially in the fall, because all the leaves on the trees change to beautiful, warm colors. Also regarding campus life,  it is extremely diverse and welcoming, as there are many ethnicities, religions, and cultures. Sacramento State welcomes everybody no matter what status or what you label yourself as, which is why I love it."
Sophomore,5,Great school. Not much to it that I don’t like. Campus is nice and so are the people. Professors are all very helpful. Tons of resources as well if any help is needed
Sophomore,5,I really like the campus and the big trees. The professors that I got so far are really nice and make the sessions of the topic comprehend able.
Sophomore,5,"It’s given me a challenge, but I love challenges. So, that’s what makes it fun and interesting. The professors are awesome and will always try to help."
Freshman,5,"Everything on campus is new but also has character. The campus is clean and very green. All the trees on campus provides an abundant amount of shade. Covering tables, benches, and even paths as you walk, making a hot day not so hot. The only thing they could improve on building more parking structures or lots for the amount of students who commute here."
Alum,4,Their online classes were easy to use and they were able to provide good education experiences through online classes.
Freshman,4,"The transition to online combined with budget cuts as a result of COVID-19 have undeniably had a significant impact on nearly every facet of life for every person related to campus. However, it feels as if many of the teachers are unprepared for this new all-online environment and it reflects in the inconsistency regarding certain test-taking policies. All in all though, this is to be expected and it could've been much worse."
Junior,4,"I like that the professors actually care about the success of their students and that college peers are always happy to help. I do not like that unfortunately, due to covid, we have classes online instead of in person."
Junior,4,"I am taking all of my classes online at the moment. I always check my ""dashboard"" on canvas to see the assignments I need to complete. My professors are welcoming of any questions or concerns I have of the class. My peers have been helpful as well."
Alum,4,"Most of the professors I took classes with had their students well-being in mind. 
Many wanted their students to learn the material and would try to make their office hours as flexible as they could."
Niche User,4,"I stayed on campus for my freshman year. I loved staying on campus because it was very convenient. The only thing that I would change is the amount of dorm rooms. If you don’t apply as soon as possible, you’ll be put on a long waitlist."
Niche User,4,The online classes are really simple and convenient for the pandemic. It may not be for everyone because some people are visual or hands-on learners.
Freshman,4,"All but one of my classes are online and it has been hard to get used to mainly because of the setting. I prefer having a different setting from home to do schoolwork. But when it comes to the classes themselves, professors have been comprehensive and understanding and they know it is not easy especially with threats of evacuation from wildfires."
Freshman,4,academics wise CSUS is a very good choice if you are in the area. It is affordable and it's not hard to get financial aid. the professors are good and you can always ask for help. there's also plenty of peer-led resources to help you with your class or if you are having trouble with your homework.
Freshman,4,This is my first year at Sac State and I just started my semester but so far I love the professors and everyone seems very welcoming!
Freshman,4,I was nervous going online for my first semester of college but it's actually going pretty well so far.
Junior,4,I took all my classes online and the professors were super helpful and ready to help individuals. They were quick to respond back and make it more easier to learn.
Graduate Student,4,"The university’s Canvas program for online courses served as a comprehensive, organized platform for students to succeed."
Graduate Student,4,Updated campus with many resources.  Would like to see more street lights around campus for safety measures.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful and has a lot to offer with clubs, sports, campus food, etc. The student life off campus is something you should tour even if you do not decide to move there the downtown scenery is like none other. The dorms are VERY bad, but the student apartments are fun and you'll meet plenty of new people!"
Freshman,4,"This will be my first semester. What I like best about California State University, Sacramento so far, is the campus."
Junior,4,"Sac State is a beautiful campus to attend. It has amazing resources for student to use such as big library, tutoring, IT team and much more."
Junior,4,Overall Sacramento State is not a bad school. It gives you the education you need to be prepared for your graduate school or future career. The classes are challenging but definitely doable. It is more of a commuter school rather than a traditional 4 year university. The professors care a lot about your success and want to help you whenever they can. They are not interested in failing you and want to do what is best for you.
Junior,4,The professors did their best to adjust quickly to online learning. Before the full transition to online there were not that many options for online classes.
Junior,4,"I willingly took one class online which was a great class, but because of Covid-19, everyone had to switch to online learning for all of their courses. The switch was very sudden, which lead to professors not being that organized, but they made it work and I'm sure the next semester online will run more smoothly."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at this university has been fairly good so far. The school is very diverse, it has lots of clubs to join and it is easy to make friends because most of the people are very friendly. I think that they could add more resources for some majors, but other than that, I've had a good experience."
Junior,4,"I really appreciate the staff. If you have a problem or need to raise an issue, they won't hesitate to help you out. The teachers really want you to succeed in the future and encourage you to seek help if you need it. The campus itself is beautiful and full of trees. All on campus events are worth going to and are wonderful."
Alum,4,"I never took an online class. However, on some general education that had some online parts for homework and extra files needed for the class the online platform was always up to date and never really had any technical issues. Also, in general the online access to the library was very easy and any difficulties were usually easy fixed either by the frequently asked questions page or through the information technology department. Additionally, any technical issues the same information technology department were always helpful and were able to fix the problems in reasonable time. Thank you very much for the excellent education."
Junior,4,Taking online classes was a bit of game changer because I'm a student who likes learning in a classroom environment and I️ always have tried to avoid online school. It may be different but professors are willing to help you when e-mailed and take a lot more time to explain lessons. Its still a big change for me but I'm glad the economics department at Sacramento State has reached out to their students and assured us that they are willing and flexible enough to aid us.
Junior,4,I️ transfered to California State University- Sacramento in January before all of the turmoil and chaos of COVID-19. It was a big change for myself because I️ was going to be the first and only child of immigrant parents to go to a university in the U.S. I️ was nervous and anxious about what might come about because the campus was bigger than I️ imagined it to be. The education was different than community college it was more rigorous and more challenging. But that did not phase me because I️ wanted a new challenge and along the way I️ meant peers that were in my major and were like me. I've met people who are currently in my shoes and we shared the same goals. I️ found a group of like-minded individuals and professors ready and willing to help their students succeed. One in particular I️ will never forget is Mark Siegler who is one of my role models and will forever be one of the best teachers at Sacramento State.
Senior,4,Even I haven't taken many online classes in the past I think the school has done a good job at transitioning over to online formats for classes during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Senior,4,Sacramento State has been very good to me in terms of supporting me along my journey to earn my bachelors degree. They have a wide variety of programs for students to choose from and is very diverse when it comes to its student populations. The one thing that disappoints me about the school is that school is that a lot of the art departments are underfunded which results in less offerings for students who would like to pursue that major. Even more so to the point where majors like Graphic Design have been impacted for over two decades. I think the school could do a better job at securing resources for non-STEM related fields so that students have more choice.
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love Sacramento State. I am a thor generation college student because my mom and grandfather both attended Sacramento State. I knew where I was gonna go even as a kid. It has a beautiful campus that lives up to Sacramento being the city trees. There are beautiful trees everywhere and newly updated dorms called Riverview where I stayed. Teachers are all approachable, nice, and y flexible. But you have to actually talk to your professors in order to get them to be flexible. One thing I would change about Sacramento State is the eateries. We as students deserve more food options and a better dining hall. Also, the theater department for me has been nothing but helpful. Couldn’t be any more excited for my sophomore year."
Sophomore,4,"Yes, I did take classes online this semester due to COVID-19. Most students like me moved out of the dorms while enrolled in online classes it was definitely a strain on me. To loosen that strain Sacramento State did take an additional week off to help us transition in these troubling times. My teachers were all extremely understanding during this time. Teachers had to adjust just as much like us students. We all had to be patient but most teachers were lenient and tried to teach us as much as possible. All the teachers I had reached out and sent lots of emails to remind us of our classes. I think my school did an incredible job. For me personally, it was a lot but I got through it maintaining straight A’s."
Sophomore,4,Going to Sac state is one of the best decisions I have ever made. They have made it home for me but they do lack in letting their students aware of resources on campus.
Junior,4,"They can be quite hard to reach when you call them, but they are very student friendly when it comes to on campus access. Sure you will have to pay a heavy fee for parking, but what college doesn’t have a parking permit? There’s a shuttle you take throughout the Sacramento area, as well as a huge gym! Tuition is cheaper than most colleges in California, which is great for students paying out of pocket. Overall, CSUS is a flower among weeds. The college isn’t perfect, but it’s cheap and the education has quality. I hope to see you this Fall. Go hornets!"
Sophomore,4,after seeing the campus I really enjoyed their campus as well as I like the school spirit and they are really nice people and it is just a great campus
Sophomore,4,It is a great campus and also very large as well as the people there are great and very supportive.as well as they have a great service.
Senior,4,"In the middle of my 2020 Spring semester, all my classes have gone into virtual teaching. I truly appreciate the amount of effort and time all the professors have invested into making virtual teaching happen. They had a lot to do during that one week they had to catch up and adjust. I personally believe that my professors did an amazing job at adjusting to the current circumstances. Online classes is not my ideal way of learning, however, my professors made it work. I was able to finish the semester strong and earn good grades. I am forever grateful for the hard work my professors put it. It is not easy being an educator and going through this pandemic. They were flexible and very understanding when students were in trouble."
Junior,4,"I enjoy the environment, I enjoy the staff and how helpful everyone is. It’s a good university over all"
Junior,4,"It all depends on the class. Some may be easy, others may be hard. But you can always read rate my professor to see how classes are"
Alum,4,I had a great experience with CSU Sacramento. The atmosphere of campus was great and most of the time staff in my major (criminal justice) were willing to help with grades if they started to fall. I had some really great professors and joined multiple organizations on campus. Though I would say the only downfall is parking and the campus is a bit outdated in terms of building infrastructure. If you have a class sometime near the afternoon parking is non-existent leaving students to park on a dirt road across the street. It seems like it wasn't exactly built to house the number of students it has now and I would like to see it updated some way other besides their new engineering building (which I think looks awesome)!
Junior,4,It's a nice school with some excellent teachers. The union building is where you can buy a ton of foods from the food court while also having study rooms and even nap rooms upstairs. the classes are expensive and a lot of work compared to community college.
Senior,4,"Sacramento State is overall a good campus. The faculty are usually very understanding and helpful when it comes to their students. Class sizes are not too big, so getting to know your professors is very much possible. There are a lot of clubs and sports offered here as well. The only complaint I would have would be about parking, depending on the time you arrive to campus. Aside from that, it could be difficult graduating within the expected four years due to availability of classes. I would recommend this university for anyone who lives in the Sacramento area."
Junior,4,Sacramento State has given me a chance to really challenge and expand my critical thinking skills. I was able to thrive on my own creativity and let it become an essential to my personal writings on the side and in class.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Sac State has been good, I met so many people and made new friends in class and outside of class. Everyone is helpful there, so I know that if I am ever stuck on something there will be people to help me. Since it is my first year, I feel like everything is good and nothing should be changed. The campus itself makes me feel comfortable and it is like my second home."
Alum,4,Sacramento State was a great college for me. Very reasonable in price. I enjoyed all my professors and made great networking opportunities
Junior,4,Sac state is the first university I've attended after I transferred from a community college. I love the diversity of sac state.  I just hate how I have to commute at least a couple times per week since I live an hour away. It's nice to know most students are commuters.
Senior,4,I love Sacramento State. It's a beautiful campus and there's never really a shortage of things to do on campus. It isn't perfect but what campus is?
Graduate Student,4,"As a current Graduate Student and Alum, I have only amazing things to say about Sac State. The teachers, administrators, and students make you feel welcome and apart of the community. It's a great campus, with lots of things to do, and the school offers lots of interesting classes and activities."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time at CSUS. For the most part everyone here on campus really is focused on the success of the students. I feel like the school is affordable and realistic as a commuter school. The con would be parking and feeling over crowded at times. Other than that I really enjoyed my time here!
Alum,4,I had a great time throughout my time at Sac State. Everyone was always kind and despite what your interested in you can always find a group of people that have a similar interest. I only wish there was more career preparedness/ support for students approaching graduation. There also wasn't much of a system I'm place to help students applying to graduate school in preparation for their undergraduate graduation. All of the teachers are well informed but the difficulty of classes varied a lot. Overall I would recommend that anyone interested should definitely apply.
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed the campus and I love the city. Sacramento was always one of my top colleges and I hope to attend it this upcoming fall. The dorms are nicer than most colleges I have toured and the professors I met are really friendly. Their criminal justice program is just amazing and I cannot wait to be able to be a student at this school. Sacramento overall is just a very modern city and I really enjoy it.
Freshman,4,"CSUS Sacramento has a beautiful campus that draws eye to many, not only is the campus beautiful the campus itself has so many resources for students ! This encourages students to be involved and create long lasting relationships with others."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the university is really diverse and open. Many people here can agree and this campus is always expanding."
Freshman,4,Sacramento needs to change priority class registration to those who play sports. Also classes are ridiculously hard to get into as an under grad. Another major part is campus police do not seem to help those.
Niche User,4,"I went to Sacramento State University for a school trip. I’m part of a high school program, AVID which helps first generation students go to college. During our trip we also visited other school; for exaplmple, San Francisco university and San Jose. All of the schools we vistiendo were amazing but the one that really caught the eye for everyone in the AVID program was Sacramento State University. The campus was beautiful and everything was green they also had a great choice for food. Everyone on the campus was so friendly. My favorite place i got to visit during the tour was the gym. The gym was amazing it had so many things you could do. Overall it was an amazing experience."
Senior,4,My overall experience at CSU Sacramento was one that I did not expect. The academics here are as as challenging and exceeds the expectations I had. The professors are encouraging and always interested to help their students. I never felt that there was a moment when I was left to figure something out on my own - someone was always willing to help.
Niche User,4,I have not yet attended the university but I have visited the campus with my Highschool Avid group. The campus was very beautiful and the students were very friendly.
Junior,4,Great school and very under appreciated. The professors are helpful and down to Earth and the campus is gorgeous. I loved my time at Sac State and would recommend the school to anyone. The only downfall is how impacted many of the majors are.
Junior,4,"The school is overall excellent, the only fault is how easy it is to get lost at such a  vast campus"
Sophomore,4,"California State University of Sacramento is one of the most diverse Colleges in the country. It is filled with very nice, outgoing and smart intellectuals which makes it very easy to make friends. Based on my times at Sacramento State, the professors are very smart and want nothing but the best for their students. The campus is filled with lots and lots of trees with tags that number each tree which I think is really cool."
Junior,4,I love the diversity of sacramento state it is one of the best place you can find to learn about so many different cultures. The environment is so beautiful specially the trees in the fall. I always found support easily for any doubt or question that I had. Only thing I would change is more parking.
Freshman,4,"Lots of people there so it can be easy to get drowned out but if you find the right people and resources, it'll make your life a whole lot easier. There's lots of opportunities and things to do. I've only gone for one semester so I don't know everything but I'm enjoying my experience so far."
Freshman,4,The climate and attitude on campus is very superior. Everyone there seems to know what they are doing and are confident in their choices. It is also a welcoming atmosphere that allows all students to express themselves however they feel comfortable. The campus is very open and beautiful.
Sophomore,2,I do not personally enjoy online classes regardless of what class it is or which professor I get. So in my biased opinion I think online makes it more difficult to communicate with teachers. I also find it very hard to focus out of the classroom. Despite all the efforts by Sacramento state it still is very hard to speak with counselors and other faculty members.
Junior,2,"online learning experience was honestly not good, i just couldn't lern that much, and i lost focus a lot of the time i will be on zoom"
Sophomore,2,Learning online has been stressful since we were put on lockdown. Its hard for professors to clearly communicate with their students.
Senior,2,Sacramento State can definitely do better with online classes. It really does depend on who your professor is because some know how to work online classes while some don't. This semester I had most of my classes move online and it was horrible. Professors would say that they care for their students wellbeing but then assign a million things on top of the exams. I think if Sacramento State can learn to be a better college online and offer more courses then I would give them more stars but for now I rate them 2 stars out of 5.
Freshman,2,"My time at Sacramento State was unpleasant. The administration has no concern for the students. The classes are small and poorly organized. They don't have enough infrastructure to support the growing population of students. 
The teachers are not bad but they don't seem too excited to work there."
Niche User,2,"Campus itself is absolutely beautiful but don’t let that distract you from professors who don’t care about a students education. I’ve had so many bad experiences with professors who were rude, insensitive, and in worse cases racist. Of course not all the professors are like this, it’s just hard to find the good ones. I recommend using ratemyprofessor.com for more insight."
Senior,2,"Sacramento State has good campus and an active student body life. The university is very decent, safe, friendly, average size and welcoming. To be honest it seemed like a great choice at first glance. The professors are a blind pick for certain classes and for others there are several awesome professors. Financially the school is not that helpful the longer to continue to study there. They really helped out the first two semesters I was there but now that I need to Graduate they have denied all financial aid to me.  They have also been audited this year and have also increased the tuition from 2018-2019. They extend construction for longer periods of time needed. There are several classes that are in high demand and they have not managed to open new sections to accommodate the influx of students every semester. The dorm life is cool and convenient but very expensive."
Alum,2,"Too many students, not enough classes or faculty members. They are more about the money than they are helping the student learn and graduate. I spent 3 1/2 years there and only had 2 professors who actually cared about the students and were extremely helpful, all other professors where more interested in their research or other pursuits. Academic Counselors were of no use, too many students to respond to email, even showing up in person they couldnt help."
Junior,2,"Getting into classes are stressful, there are not enough sections open, therefore causing an addition 2-3 years MORE to graduate than the promised 4 years. Majority of the teachers don't teach and read directly off the slides. Parking is a nightmare and there are more parking for faculty than for students."
Freshman,2,"DO NOT ATTEND THIS SCHOOL!!! I am from out of state, I was expecting to get the legit college experience instead I got Sac State this place has absolutely no student life and the professors all teach at community college you would get the same education at a community college DO NOT SETTLE FOR THIS SCHOOL read all the reviews this place is awful."
Freshman,2,"Almost everyone graduates after 5.5 years. Classes are hard to get into, unless you're in the Honors Program, which is why people have to wait so long to graduate. In addition, you won't even touch intro courses for your major until you're a junior or first year senior. They concentrate too much on gen eds, rather than helping you prep for your career and pursue what you really want to do. Tuition is cheap, and the gym is nice. Sometimes you'll see homeless people walking around campus until Campus Police kicks them out. I transferred out after my first semester."
College Senior,2,Some greeks think they're better than other but everyone that isn't one knows they only join because they got no friends
College Sophomore,2,"From what I heard from my roommate's friend, being part of the Greek life is similar to what most watch in movies. There are lots of parties, pay to earn fake friends, and it is a waste of time."
College Senior,2,Not much to offer in this commuter school.
College Student,2,They smoke pot and other drugs.
College Junior,2,This is not the place i would suggest a student lives in to experience college. Students would be better off living off campus than enduring the repetitive food menu and poor attitudes of the students.
College Freshman,2,"People aren't graduating on time, not enough spaces or classes available. Internships and jobs are hard to come by. Majors are constantly impacted."
College Freshman,2,We always have sexual assaults on campus.
College Freshman,2,"I don't feel safe walking alone at night, I prefer walking in a group there have been reports already in my first semester of girls getting sexually assaulted that has lead me to fear walking at night in my campus"
College Freshman,2,This school is very disorganize as to student support and needs to focus on support more than just trying to advertise their school.
College Freshman,2,Alot of the food is not well seasoned. There is not enough vegeterain or vegan options.
College Freshman,2,"I feel as if most of the food is over priced, and places such as gordito burrito are gross and need to be replaced."
College Junior,2,The system notifications on what needs to be turned in could be clearer.
College Freshman,2,It's kind of like a mess here. Homeless people are out and about. My friends keep on getting harrassed by some people who are poor and require medical attention. Lots of drug addicts. Many shooting threats towards campus.
College Freshman,2,"The school's financial aid office is frequently overwhelmed with students. It's very busy, especially around the beginning of the semester. The disbursement process is very slow."
College Freshman,2,i didn't get as much financial aid as i needed
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid office is super disorganized, make sure to physically bring in all documents and keep your own for safe keeping"
College Junior,2,I do not get any financial aid. I will be on my own financially and am in desperate need of help.
College Senior,2,The off-campus housing often has a lot of crime and theft.
College Senior,2,I did not get a clear answer of why my financial aid was going through.  I had to resubmit the same document three times.  I have applied for school scholarships every semester that I have been here and I have never received any.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Still not employed. I've been looking for any job, even low-wage and entry-level positions. I don't blame this on the school. I attribute this to the poor economy. But seriously, either get a STEM degree or plan on expensive grad school, because job prospects are very poor."
College Sophomore,2,Living off campus is much nicer and cheaper than living on campus. Dorms don't have their own bathrooms and are extremely cramped with someone you don't know.
College Senior,2,Registration and class enrollment is the most stressful part of each semester. Many departments are impacted and it is almost impossible to graduate on time.
College Junior,2,It's really bad compared to other major schools.
College Junior,2,"i currently live off campus, but walking distance to school.

i lived off campus in the dorms 1 semester and it was a horrible experience. very small and uncomfortable, being a foster youth, i did not have parents to visit, the dorms were closed in the holiday breaks and i had to move out. i didn't have a place so decided to live off campus since."
College Sophomore,2,"Students do not follow simple rules in the library. They would eat lunch in the library even though the sign says food aren't allowed in the library, and they also talk loudly in the fourth floor where students are not allowed to talk."
College Senior,2,"As mentioned previously, I was a Resident Advisor on campus. I would not recommend anyone live here, as it is a bad environment to start the college experience. The housing management is too uptight, and have a very duplicitous nature. I understand that the job is difficult to watch over many incoming freshman, however there is lots of room for improvement."
College Senior,2,"I am sad to say that the Greek Life is very much overrated at my school. The frat guys are tools and disrespecting towards society in general. They are pig headed and self-absorbed. Because they are so selfish, many people choose not to associate themselves with this part of the college life."
College Junior,2,The teams seem to lose all the time perhaps if the won games I would have more interest
College Junior,2,"Biology majors are facing impaction and will be kicked out of the major if certain classes aren't passed by Fall 2015. Other popular majors (business, nursing, etc) are facing the same problem. If you want to be a Bio major, you may want to choose another school."
College Senior,2,"ride sharing should be more advertised, maybe even create a site for people to look for others in their area looking to commute together"
College Junior,2,"There is little information about aid and whatever you do find out is usually through the online student center, not through a convenient method."
College Junior,2,If the campus and the city could make the regional transit system accessible all over the city it would be a lot more convenient.
College Junior,2,"Parking is horrendous and expensive. There are only two entrances to campus so expect to take a while to park. The parking lots are full of hit and run incidents and parking enforcement is always writing tickets, even for simple things like parking on the white lines."
College Freshman,2,"Everything is too far, even more so when you do not own a car."
College Student,2,This is Sacramento sure we're the capital of California but we're in the middle of scenic nowhere. L.A. and San Francisco easily outshine us and many of our people find themselves taking weekend trips to said cities.
College Freshman,2,"The Biological Sciences program is very impacted. It is very difficult to get into the major classes that you need because of the many other students trying to get into them and the upperclassmen get priority enrollment in classes. It is challenging to get into a class and many classes cannot afford to have a waitlist because they cannot provide enough spots for students, thus delaying the earning your degree on an acceptable time. I recommend to anybody to not really apply for the program because of how difficult it is to get into classes, but if they do, they really need to hope for the best and keep going to the specific classes the first two weeks of class to see if they can be enrolled; it is better to have a back-up plan."
College Freshman,2,Not enough computer labs on campus. It is often very hard to find an open computer on campus. Printing costs are low and there are several printers around campus. The wireless network often times out and disconnects on mobile devices but on laptops usually remains connected. Recommend having your own laptop.
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive my financial aid package until 4 months into the fall semester. There was a mix-up with paper work and although I spoke to the financial aid counselors multiple times, the issue wasn't resolved until much later. My advice is to make an appointment for a private session with a counselor. Have them explain everything to you and tell you what you need to do, especially if you are a first generation college student like myself."
College Freshman,2,"In my opinion, greek life is taken a bit too seriously at Sac State. I've had friends that have dedicated hours upon hours of their time just trying to get into a fraternity/sorority. And sometimes they invest all of that time only to be denied in the end."
College Sophomore,2,i know a lot of people that drink and use drugs especially when they go to raves.
Recent Alumnus,2,I wish there were more school spirit
College Freshman,2,"Its pretty dead, everything closes early and theres not many people out"
College Senior,2,It was bad at first because i did not know what i was doing. But now it is okay.
College Freshman,2,Very worth it your first year
College Senior,2,"They are slowly taking steps towards making better food available to students, and their food HAS improved since I started there 3 and half years ago."
College Sophomore,2,i consider smoking a drug and people smoke way too much on campus. it's disgusting and inconsiderate for others
College Junior,2,"Registration at this University is horrible. It takes hours of searching for classes that have already been filled up. Some students are forced to take English and math classes at a later period because they cannot find the classes they need. Also, searching for science classes is horrible as well. "
College Sophomore,2,"The cost of parking increases each semester. The cost of a parking for the summer semester is completely unreasonable. Many tickets and fines are sent out every day, so always double check your parking. Come to school early to get a good parking spot. If you come near lunch time, don't be surprised to circle the parking lot for about one hour."
College Sophomore,2,"When it is cold and rainy, walking from class to class may be frustrating. Especially during the winter season, wear enough jackets to keep you warm."
Alum,1,Low quality education program. Low quality career support. Unable to find employment after graduating with a BS in Computer Science. Go to a better school that cares about its students.
Alum,1,The online classes are worse than the in person classes. The quality of the material is very low. The professors do not care about student success nor does the university.
Niche User,1,"I am an Asian-American and a teacher said ""f*cking ch*nk"" when a female Asian custodian worker walked into the class for trash. Also had a few run-ins with hostile sorority girls and a frat guy saying ""if you have hate in your heart let it out"". There is also little to do in the area."
Freshman,1,"I hated it here. The food was disgusting, there's no parking and I hate the dorms. I don't feel walking around my own campus either. Plus, it's a commuter school so if you're not commuting, it's really hard making knew friends if you're not fro around here."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Only if you live far, far away. Get off-campus as soon as you can. Super expensive and the meal plan is garbage."
College Senior,1,"Sac. State offers one apartment complex for students, with a waitlist of two years for a one-bedroom apartment; however, I am a transfer student, so I will graduate before then."
College Freshman,1,This is a terrible neighborhood and I'm terrified to be on campus at night.
College Freshman,1,No cares about the sports here. All of our teams suck.
College Freshman,1,The process about how you get a roommate is confusing and doesn't work well. The administration also works in a weird way that doesn't make any sense.
College Sophomore,1,I cannot find any sort of scholarship that I qualify for.
College Freshman,1,of course the most popular majors are always compacted and competitive.
College Freshman,1,i have not been told about anything about it so far
College Freshman,1,i hated it. all girl floor was disgusting all the girls are filthy
College Senior,1,Parking is difficult to find and they are quick to charge.
College Senior,1,On average you will park 5 to 10 blocks away from campus
College Student,1,"There aren't many Greek students that i know of at my school. I've yet to at least meet someone from my school who is Greek. I haven't heard anything about Greek frats, sororities or even clubs."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking in camps is really bad, therefore, you need to get 1 hour before your class or be ready to park far and have a long walk to your class. Always make sure that you have your parking permit and do not lose it because if you do they would not replace it and even now that they have tracking numbers."
College Junior,1,"i am 22 years old my mother, who does not work because of medical issues, just got remarried a year ago and because of this i had to use her husbands tax information for my financial aid information, using his information i did not qualify for any financial aid even though i hardly know him, have never lived with him nor do i get any help from him financially. i am struggling to find out a way to be able to pay for my classes and cost of living."
Recent Alumnus,1,I really do not park inside the school's lots because of their expensive permits and tickets. I recommend finding parking outside the school or at least nearby.
College Sophomore,1,On campus recruiting is down the drain. Major quality is below average for most departments. Wide array of majors.
College Junior,1,"Parking is horrible. The fees are through the roof. It's even bad for visitors. I use public transit since your Sac State card is good for six months of free Regional Transit bus and light rail. There's always biking too, but good luck finding an unbreakable lock. The college police make you register your bike because bike thefts are a huge problem in Sacramento."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is nerve-wracking. Make sure you get to school 45-60 minutes before your class starts, if you start at 9 o'clock in the morning. Any other time after that, get to school 30 mins before, because you need to account for even walking to class."
College Freshman,1,horrible to find parking in few crowded university garages and lots
College Freshman,1,"It is completely ridiculous especially the first few weeks of school during both semesters. The police are pretty strict on how you park, if you park on the lines at all you get a ticket and they will catch you with out a permit. Permits are six bucks a day and about 250 for a semester."
College Sophomore,1,Parking can be insane especially around 9:00. The parking permits are very expensive and if you can carpool with someone I would do that since it is cheaper. There is a lot of parking but it seems to fill up quick.
College Junior,1,"The mornings can get pretty crazy and congested due to an overhaul of students and deficiency of viable parking spaces. Basically if you have an early class or even one around noon, it would be ideal to come and hour to an hour and a half early just to be sure you're not late to class. Also the pricing on the parking permits for school and/or dorms seem a bit costly."
College Junior,1,"My experience with financial aid has been a very difficult one. I have little help from the financial aid office. I've never applied for financial aid before so this process is all completely new to me and every time i run in to an issue and try to speak with someone at the office they simply tell be to refer to the services on line and all my questions will be answered but that is not the case and i end up more confused than ever. the whole process is quite upsetting, which is why i give it a D"
College Freshman,1,The off campus living areas are not bad but they can be pretty expensive. considering we are college students having to pay high tuition prices.
College Freshman,1,There is was more parking for faculty then there is for students. You may be circling for an hour before you find parking.
College Freshman,1,Parking costs is so bad. its overpriced and parking is crazy. i always have to park far away because i can never find one close to the school
College Freshman,1,Parking can be a horrible experience.  The parking lots are overcrowded especially during peak times.  I recall circling multiple parking lots for 30-45 minutes looking for a spot.  The compact spots are so narrow it seems like they were lined specially for smartcars.  Parking permit cost is ridiculous (currently set at $159.00).  Daily parking permit is $6.00 at CSUS compared to the $1.00 daily parking permit at LRCCD colleges.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus can be a hassle most of the time. If you have afternoon classes good luck! The best time for parking is anytime before 9:30. After that its the matter of luck. I often hear people saying ""I had to fight for my parking spot"" or ""I literally had to follow someone walking to their car and wait until they left."" The busiest days of all are tuesdays through thursdays. Mondays can still be bad but are not as bad as tuesday through thursday. Fridays are the best days for parking. If you are ever running late getting to school, friday would be the day to run late. Personally for me, I do not even bother trying to park in any of the parking garages or parking lots in the front of the campus. I also just go straight back to the back lot where I am guaranteed to get a parking spot in the morning."
College Sophomore,1,"Here's how financial aid works:
if you're in the lower class, the government will give you money no matter what.  Even if you end up wasting your time at school.
if you're in the upper class, parents will pay it off and not be affected much by the tuition hikes
if you're middle class, you have to do the most work to get a scholarship since your FAFSA says your family makes enough to pay....even though the money earned by your family went to paying for bills on necessities and then your education."
College Sophomore,1,"Low Energy and Its Unsafe – Sacramento is a small city, so there's a little a bit to do there. Almost every one would rather stay in their homes. My guess for people staying in early in there homes is because its not a safe environment. My recommendation is to not even think about coming here."
College Freshman,1,"I receive no financial aid from the school. Except for student loans which is just money you have to pay back. 
The school says I do not qualify because my parents make too much. According to them my parents should be able to pay for my schooling. Perhaps they should, but the extent of their help goes towards letting me live with them rent free, for which I am very grateful for. 
So while I go into debt 8,000 dollars every year I attend, I work and hope that I make enough at my minimum wage job to make a small $100 dollar payment on my student loan, which barely dents. 

Student loans and the increasing debt is a constant anxiety inducing thought that is always in the back at my head."
Recent Alumnus,1,Not So Sure – Heard that there are lots of cases of rape. Use the buddy system!
College Freshman,1,"Night Life – Night Life in Sacramento is, and can be some what of a drought. Not much goes on maybe if there were minor concerts or poetry recitals or just small events we could attend near camopus the night life would be better."
College Freshman,1,"Hard to Find, Expensive, Not Worth the Price. The Prices here are way over board and not only do they not provide furniture but were college students we can't afford that. I've only seen one place thats worth the price but is in a dangerous area to live, things constantly get stolen and the managers try to take advantage over customers."
College Freshman,1,"Transferring to Another School – I dislike the school and the city as well. The school try's to get students to be involved but because the events held aren't fascinating no one attends to none of them. The city seems unsafe to me and if it were there's not much to explore or hang out at. I'm bored and I hate it here, so my plan is to transfer by the end of my second year."
College Freshman,1,"There's Not Much Going – There's few clubs that allow under the age of 21 in but there really aren't that many. Also there's not a lot of partying going on, students who are in sororities and fraternities are the ones that throw parties but the school isn't known to be a party school since there's not much going on in the school and in the city in general. If your interested in going out and partying most of the time my suggestion is to look for some other school that has that kind of rep."

Senior,5,I personally enjoyed Walsh University. I have only attended this University for a short time however in this time I have really enjoyed the experience. The staff members are very welcoming and supportive. All professors are very knowledgable and know how to teach their content.
Senior,5,I have taken a few classes online and the professors were still extremely helpful. They responded to emails and made sure that I truly understood the material and what I needed to do.
Junior,5,Walsh has became a second home. Surrounded by my best friends receiving an exceptional education. Everyone was always helpful and welcoming and the staff was always there to help!
Freshman,5,"Walsh feels like home. Everybody here is extremely friendly and will go out of their ways to help you. I can barely walk through campus without greeting somebody that I know, and the family feeling is one of my favorite parts about Walsh."
Sophomore,5,"Walsh is a great community and environment. The professors work personally with you to make sure you're understanding the material and actually learning, in turn making you more successful in the real world. The dorms have all been updated and are in pretty great condition. The freshman dorms don't have AC units yet, but it was never too bad. It's only really hot hot during August, then it cools into fall weather, and the campus is beautiful this time of year. The food could be better, but is manageable for college food. There are multiple gyms around campus which is really impressive for such a small school. I'm about halfway through my college experience at Walsh and I've been thoroughly pleased with the experience I've had here. If you like small class sizes, genuine professors who will know you by name and not just an ID number, this is the place for you."

I attended multiple other college tours, but none of them had the ""wow factor"" that Walsh had.  The people there are professional and welcoming as soon as you step foot on campus.

The school pioneers personalized curriculums and promotes international experiences that it's competitors cannot even hope to offer."

Freshman,5,"At first I saw an email inviting me to explore college options on Walsh university. I gathered my stuff and applied to Walsh. Very soon i was admitted and earned a partial scholarship, Since then i seriously started to explore that college and It's really an awesome place to go for a highly qualified education, not to mention a better location that fits the interactive studying environment. I can't wait to attend by fall, as soon as I get a fund for my education."
Sophomore,5,Very friendly environment and caters to both the academic and scholarly environment .  I would expand cafeteria hours especially on weekends.
Sophomore,5,"Walsh University is by far one of the best Universities in Ohio. The staff and students are super amazing, nice, smart, and understanding. The programs are so good and the success rates are very high. Also, campus itself is also absolutely gorgeous all year round and i honestly could not have chosen a better college to go to."
Sophomore,5,"The professors here are excellent, caring, and take time out of their day to talk to you and invest in your life. Most of the activity on campus are religious or service oriented, but there are other groups and ways to get involved if you are non-religious. They have great study abroad and global learning programs. I love it here."
Freshman,5,"So far I love this university. I feel challenged yet also supported. The professors truly care about their students and provide thorough lectures. The single downfall here is the food which lacks in variety and is inconsistent in quality. Overall, I would recommend Walsh as a second home and place of education for anyone who loves a small, caring, Catholic atmosphere."
College Senior,5,"I love Walsh. It is a very good school, clean and dedicated to their students. I am very happy with my choice to attend here. All of the professors have a knowledge base that never seizes to amaze me."

College Freshman,5,Class sizes are between 20-30 people and teachers are available for helping you.
College Freshman,5,The school is extremely safe and campus police are actual police officers. This school has had no issues with sexual assault.
College Freshman,5,"Even though I'm not involved in varsity sports, intramurals are a good way to get exercise and have fun. My friend and I are even starting a gaga ball team because it's a fun game and it's a good way to make friends. Attending the varsity sports games is a lot of fun and it's a good place to get away when stressed from school work."
College Freshman,5,"My school is amazing in many aspects especially academically. I know that I'm getting the best education possible especially for my major. Even though academics are rigorous the school offers many extracurriculars that can help me make new connections with people. The learning doesn't stop in the classroom, I will be working in a hospital with real patients and I will be more than ready to work in this environment."
College Junior,5,I absolutely love the professors and my peers. Everyone is supportive and wants to see you succeed. I'm happy that I picked this school to continue my education.

College Sophomore,5,"The Campus Police do a nice job of patrolling campus and making students feel safe while walking around campus, even during night hours. Campus Police, at Walsh University, are readily awaiting to serve the Walsh community in any way possible. The Campus Police officers all take their job seriously, but are also kind, and easily approachable."
College Sophomore,5,"Walsh University offers students one-on-one interactions with their professors and helps in any way possible to help make sure every student feels welcomed into the Walsh community. Walsh University wants its students to succeed, and is willing to help students as much as it can to help ensure its students' success within Walsh, as well as post-graduation."
College Sophomore,5,Walsh University alumni's are always willing to help students who are looking for their help. The Career Center at Walsh University also helps students find internships in every field of study that is offered at Walsh.
College Sophomore,5,"Walsh University's resident halls are unique because they offer individual bathrooms to all students, even in the freshman dorm. No student in the resident halls will ever have to share a restroom with more than 4 people (5 persons to a restroom in total). This is an incredible luxury because of the convenience of always having a bathroom in your own room."
College Sophomore,5,"Walsh University supports its student-athletes while they are on the court, and also while they are in the classroom. The professors are always willing to work with athletes who will be missing class because of athletic conflicts. The faculty/staff is always supporting the athletic programs, as well as the students are always a huge support system. Walsh students are always in the crowd at athletic events, and all sports are welcomed and encouraged with the same amount of respect."
College Sophomore,5,"Walsh University is an incredible college because the faculty/staff care about the successes of all their students. All of the professors are passionate about their field of study, and they care for their students (both within and outside of the classroom). Walsh also promotes the ideas of its students, and is willing to help students with ideas they have to help improve Walsh. Within the last few years, Walsh University has helped their students start an on-campus recycling program, as well as helping a group of students start up ""The Garage"" (an innovation center where students are welcomed to bring their ideas, and then Garage-members will help students pursue those ideas and turn them into inventions). Walsh University believes in all of its students, and the amount of support it gives its' students is amazing. I am proud to be part of a university which has as much faith in its students' success as Walsh does."
College Junior,5,"Being that it is a small school, I feel safe at my school. I have no problem walking to my car at night after a night class. Walsh's security takes their job and mission seriously. Because Walsh is a small school, if anyone feels they are in danger, action is immediately taken and people are notified, whether it is through email or cell phone. Walsh cares deeply about the schools safety and will do anything for their students."
College Junior,5,"Each degree and major matters deeply at Walsh. Whether your majoring in English or in Nursing, Walsh will do everything they can to make sure you are taking the necessary courses needed for your degree and make sure you graduate at a rate you want to achieve. Walsh has a huge alumni network and many people will recruit family members or friends to Walsh. Once your apart of Walsh's community, you start apart of it."
College Junior,5,"Walsh is an excellent school if one is looking for small classes and professors who care about their students. Walsh's professors will go out of their way to make sure students understand their course material. Walsh offers many major related courses with some extra curricular courses as well. I will say that Walsh does not offer many courses in relation to the arts, but Walsh is known for its nursing program, education program, and business program."
College Senior,5,This university prepares you for MCAT and GRE
College Freshman,5,Super friendly environment and great professors
College Freshman,5,"Walsh University is a great, the people on campus are extremely kind. The academics are one of the hardest in the state of Ohio. Very small class sizes which helps you learn more and connect with your teachers."
College Freshman,5,"Currently, going into Walsh as a freshman they have made me feel very welcome and comfortable in my decision. There are always people there to help me when I am confused. They also have many current students I have met who are very outgoing and helpful when making choices about classes and how to organize myself. For Walsh being a very new environment for me, the staff and students have made it feel a lot like home."
College Sophomore,5,Walsh is a smaller school that allows for individual attention from professors that really care about your success!
College Freshman,5,They were willing to give more when I asked and expressed that I really wanted to go there so I felt that was a great aspect of the process.
College Junior,5,"This school is unique to me because the professors care about you, and your success in college. So that you can then turn around and be a successful adult."
College Sophomore,5,Financial aid is an easily accessible office on campus the people there are friendly and try to help you make things work.
College Sophomore,5,You get what you give which is the perfect option for me.
College Sophomore,5,"I love living on campus. It's a smaller school so you get to know people but it's big enough that every year you meet new people. Generally, everyone is nice and considerate and follows housing rules. Neither myself nor anyone I know has experienced problems with people disrespecting their stuff or shared space."
College Junior,5,There is almost every option available.  Most of the restaurants offer vegetarian options.  I don't know enough about vegan to make a comment about that.
College Sophomore,5,"In my opinion, BW has very few negatives to it.  The professors, the clubs, the students, and the environment on campus make it feel like home with a lot of growing opportunities, both professionally and personally."

Sophomore,4,Walsh University overall is a great school academically and athletically but the weak part about Walsh is the dining hall food is not the best and the hours to get food are not great for athletes.
Sophomore,4,Overall the learning experience online did not change from in person. Everyone is still communicating and learning at a good level and the professors are still teaching very well.
Freshman,4,"I like Walsh because it is a small campus. Because of that I have been able to connect with other students faster, and I have a more personal relationship with my professors. I play womens Lacrosse and I enjoy the bond I have made with my teammates. The campus is small but very safe and protected. The dining hall food is about average, and as you progress through the years you get the opportunity to get much nicer housing like the apartments on campus."
Sophomore,4,Walsh is a great school that challenges students to do their very best while also gaining real world experience. The atmosphere is like a family and anyone you meet is very friendly. As a business student the business professors will go above and beyond to help their students at any cost. Especially this past year with unforeseen circumstances with the coronavirus. The professor made sure that they were available at all times to help no matter what time.
Sophomore,4,"I like the amount of international students, its amazing the amount of international students you can meet, and learn about their different cultures!"
Sophomore,4,I love Walsh's classes and faculty and the college experience you get when staying on campus. The only thing I'd like to see change is the food. Sometimes it is good but most of the time it's pretty terrible.
Senior,4,walsh is a small school where professors are very willing to help you with any questions you have or problems with the material. small class sizes give athletes and other members of teams the ability to work with professors to make any specific accommodations needed. great school
Freshman,4,I absolutely love it at Walsh University. So far all experiences I've had are amazing. The staff is absolutely amazing and very helpful in helping me pursue my future career paths.
Junior,4,I really enjoy the opportunities that Walsh has to offer its students. There are many resources available to increase one's skills and experiences towards the career path a student is on. I would like to see better diversity in the food and locations for food.
Junior,4,"The professors and faculty are really involved in your success both in their class and in the future. Professors are very willing to help if you ask. Faculty want to make sure you are happy and healthy on the campus, and are willing to listen to and help you if you have comments or concerns."
Junior,4,"When I first started college, I started off at Kent Stark. It was not the best experience. Once I started going to Walsh it was was completely different. The tuition is more expensive I understand but it is worth the extra money. They help any student that needs it. I was surprised at how involved the students are on campus and how everyone generally gets along. Some of the best teachers I have ever met are at walsh."
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the small size of the campus and population.  One down side is that there is not much to do in the area so weekends can be pretty boring. But as long as you got a group of friends you’ll have a good time.
Freshman,4,"Walsh University is the perfect school for someone who is self motivated in regards to getting involved and looking to connect with staff and professors. I would highly recommend if interested in playing a sport in college. Walsh is a relatively small school, with excellent professors and kind and students from all walks of life. Furthermore, if you are looking to continue your journey to faith, Walsh University is perfect for you."
Sophomore,4,I am going into my second year at Walsh University. I love the campus and the people. The small class sizes make it easier to make the transition from highschool to college and if you put forth a little effort you will be able to use your professors as references later on. Choosing Walsh University was the best decision for both my academic and athletic career.
Sophomore,4,My experience attending Walsh university has been absolutely amazing. I have met extremely nice people who have impacted my life substantially. Not only are the students a great feature but the faculty. The faculty here at Walsh are exceptional professors. They work with each student to make them the best that they can be. One thing that I did not like about Walsh was the hours of the dining services. One thing I love about Walsh is that it is close to just about everything you could need and you don't really need a car on campus. A couple things I notice at Walsh that I don't really see on other college campuses are the large amount of diverse students. It is great to have this diversity because it gives you a chance to learn about others lives while they experience yours.
College Senior,4,Its great! I also see campus security driving around. You can even call security and have them walk you to your car at night.
College Senior,4,The are very good with job placement. I have a friend that I work with that they placed him in an internship that he loves.
College Senior,4,I do not live on campus but I know that campus life is great! Quiet dorms and a calm campus to focus.
College Junior,4,Campus police are very helpful
College Junior,4,Career center is very helpful
College Junior,4,Walsh is a great school with great people.
College Freshman,4,They match you up with someone with your major so it's easier to study for tests because both of you will be staying up all night and can help each other. But the rooms are small and the bathroom is shared with another room having a few friends over will make the room seem pretty crowded.
College Sophomore,4,Our basketball teams are the best teams at Walsh. The other sports are very well liked.
College Sophomore,4,During my freshman Fall semester at Walsh University I made the Deans List with a 3.7. Since then I have maintained my grades well. I will be a sophomore this Fall. I continue my education by taking summer classes that are needed.
College Senior,4,There aren't too many issues with sexual assault at Walsh University.
College Freshman,4,Campus policy are always seen around campus and the health clinic is easily accessible
College Freshman,4,"The career center offers students and graduates a lot of help to find the right job, and to help you get that job"
College Freshman,4,There's a lot to do on campus. The professors keep you on your toes and make sure you know what you've been taught
College Junior,4,"Even though I am a commuter, I have many friends who live on campus. They say that living on campus is fun and many enjoy living in the apartments on campus. While living on campus is costly, many say they overall enjoy living on campus and it adds to the college experience."
College Junior,4,"My overall experience has been wonderful at my school! Walsh is very resident friendly, meaning a lot of activities are towards residents. However, I myself am a commuter and Walsh provides plenty of friendly opportunities for commuters to get involved, The professors are amazing and care so much about their students! The overall Walsh community is fantastic! I love my school!"
College Freshman,4,"The school had the Lacrosse program that I wanted to play for, and I have now been excepted."
College Senior,4,This university has great Diversity acceptance
College Freshman,4,There are no big threats and I usually feel safe
College Freshman,4,Everyone is friendly and makes time for you
College Freshman,4,It's a good school with a good academic reputation
College Freshman,4,It's nice but many colleges have nicer dorms
College Senior,4,"It was small and intimate like I wanted, personal attention was great, all they promised has been met.. I would choose same school only big complaint is food.  Too limited and with many places to go off campus you still need money and transportation to do that."
College Freshman,4,"I am currently enrolled at Walsh University and this school offers many great features that helped me decide I wanted to attend here. Factors such as small classroom sizes, free tutoring, and a great campus environment, I could not imagine choosing any other school. Their nursing program is one of the best in the state and the teachers are very helpful and want to see you succeed."
College Junior,4,Walsh University is a great school for those who seek a small school environment. The professors are all so kind and willing to take their time to help assist their students. This university shows unity and and try their best to make commuters feel welcomed.
Recent Alumnus,4,Many places to choose from right across the street. And even more choices just 10 minutes down the road
Recent Alumnus,4,Everyone I have had contact with have been very helpful.
College Junior,4,"The rules are always enforced, with punishment usually following suit."
College Junior,4,I received the scholarships that were promised to me.
College Junior,4,"While I am a commuter student at Walsh, I've been in friends' dorms enough to know that the quality of them is very good."
College Sophomore,4,I am an athlete and I like everything about it
College Sophomore,4,The campus is very green. All the building are located in acceptable distance from each other.
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of fast food places nearby and BAM is close which is great healthy dining. A little farther away in Belden there are many more dining options though, a lot of sit down options."
College Junior,4,The most difficult class I have encountered is BIO 102 Lab. All I can say is study from day one and don't stop until the last practicle!!!!
College Junior,4,Class sizes are on the smaller size which is great because it allows the professors to give more one on one time.
College Junior,4,The professors and advisors will advise you to the best of their ability. They want to see you succeed. So there is more of a push to succeed. With that comes greater opportunities for internships and future jobs. Because of their high standards.
College Junior,4,"I'm a biology major. Science majors are the majority of majors on campus, we have had a new building just added on with the intentions to improve the quality and space for science majors."
College Junior,4,There are always campus police around who actually survey the entire campus daily.
College Sophomore,4,The athletic facilities are good but a lot of people want an indoor track/ football field.
College Sophomore,4,Parking on campus could get annoying but it is cheaper than living on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Across the street from Walsh University their are a ton of different food options.
College Sophomore,4,"If you are doing something wrong and campus police catches you, you will get in trouble."
College Sophomore,4,Only 2 places to eat lunch and dinner.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy living on campus. Everything is within walking distance. Most buildings are only a 5 minute walk.
College Freshman,4,"They are very set about their rules about underage drinking however they do provide lots of activities for those who live on campus so you're never bored and they also have a game room for you to use where you can play board games, ping pong, pool, and watch TV"
College Sophomore,4,Walsh has recently made changes to their security staff and it has made a positive impact to the atmosphere of the campus. You can always have an escort by calling campus security which the number is on our student ID cards and the paths are well lit.
Niche User,2,"Honestly, I was not impressed with Walsh and transferred to a different college. If you are Catholic or an athlete, you will love this school. I am neither, so scholarships are pretty much impossible to get. I am a 4.0 student and I did volunteer work and other activities, but because I am not an athlete or Catholic, scholarships were not in my favor. Also, I was a commuter student and found it difficult to find much to do on campus. When there were events, they always scheduled them at the same time of day, so if you have a class during 12:30-1:30, you were out of luck. Academically, professors were pretty good (some better than others) but nothing super spectacular that made it worth my money. If I am paying this much for a school, I better be getting good academics and feeling included on campus. I never truly felt happy here, but I know some people love this campus and it's their home.Honestly, this campus may serve you well, but for me I have been much happier since transferring."
College Sophomore,2,Food is too fat and unhealthy
College Senior,2,"It is extremely hard to get approved to live off-campus, most students just say they are going to live with their parents."
College Senior,2,"Although the Scherv has stepped up their game this year, the previous years have been pretty horrible."
College Junior,2,I't been very hard for me to receive any scholarships.
College Sophomore,2,not that many places to park
College Sophomore,2,food is not the best
College Sophomore,2,It is not that bad
College Junior,2,"There isn't much of a nightlife at Walsh, many students go to bars or clubs to drink and have a good time, because Walsh is really strict about underage drinking or partying."
College Junior,2,Classes and other activities are rarely canceled or affected by the weather.
College Freshman,2,There is plenty of computers around campus for your use but the internet is very poor at times.
College Freshman,2,"Since Walsh University is a Catholic Institution,fraternities and sororities are non-existant."
College Freshman,2,"Walsh has a lack of diversity.  Sure, we have some foreign students, but the guys and girls pretty much look, dress, and act the same."
College Freshman,2,"I did not receive very much financial aid or scholarships. I definitely would apply for any scholarships possible even locally. nobody ends up actually paying the whole $32,000 though"
College Senior,2,"I don't use any of the transportation around here, but I know that there are buses and taxis you can get, but nothing Walsh provides."
College Sophomore,2,Nightlife is mainly for 21 and up. There are few on campus activities for kids under 18. The RAs try their best to make progams for them. There are 2 clubs that kids 18 up can get in and they are pretty fun. There is no transpotation to and from campus to these clubs.
College Sophomore,2,No college atmosphere. More like a suburban township.
College Sophomore,2,"At Walsh you can expect that the majority of students are all middle and upperclass whites. Being that it is a private school with limited scholarships and activities, I think it tends to eliminate opportunities for diversity."
College Freshman,2,"Dining Hall – The good at the dining hall is not very good at all. It has its days where it is alright. But, many students feel sick after they eat."
College Sophomore,2,"I received decent amounts of money from financial aid but the student service center has lost some forms which is irresponsible on their part although there are many students.Our school does not do a very well job of helping the students who are in need of money or financial help, they just want their money, that's all."
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life at walsh university
College Junior,1,"Because it is a catholic school, Walsh does not have sororities or fraternities because both have the potential to exclude students from joining, which goes against Walsh's values."
College Freshman,1,Nightlife on campus is always dead. On the weekends no one stays because there is never anything to do and campus police and the RA's are always looking to bust people so nothing goes on on campus. There is always more to do off campus.
College Freshman,1,Walsh requires students to live on campus all four years unless your a student who commutes.
College Freshman,1,Well the drug scene is not very lively just because campus police are always on top of there things and most of the time people are always caught with drugs or get an underage all the time.
College Freshman,1,"Campus Police at school are so strict that it makes you feel like you are always being babysat. I feel like I can't expand my wings and be the young adult I want to be because I am always being told you can't do this you can't do that, that is not safe, and so on and so on. It is very annoying because we get treated like we are five here."
College Freshman,1,When it is snowing the walk ways are never plowed or salted. The weather here is terrible along with the maintenance.
College Freshman,1,We do not have any types of shuttle transportation on campus because of how small our campus is.
College Freshman,1,We do not have sororities or fraternities and therefore Greek life does not come into play
College Sophomore,1,There are no preppy guys. They all dress like shit.
College Sophomore,1,Its too small for me. There is no nightlife and it is located in a little town. There is not much to do. 
College Junior,1,The rooms are small and 3 to a room is terrible.  Most of the freshman have 3 to a room
College Freshman,1,It was absolute hell getting the funds I needed to attend Walsh. The financial aid department didn't seem to care that they messed up my paperwork.
College Sophomore,1,Dining Halls – Anyone that is bringing a lunch to school or doesn't use flex dollars in the cafeteria is not allowed to go into the cafeteria. I'm a commuter and so if I want to sit with my friends that live on campus for lunch we have to go somewhere else to eat rather than eating in the dining hall.

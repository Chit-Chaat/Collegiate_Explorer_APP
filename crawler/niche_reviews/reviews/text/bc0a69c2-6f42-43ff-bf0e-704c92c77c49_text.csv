Junior,5,"The classes are challenging, but there is help if you need it.  The curriculum and teachings have been completely in line with the Magisterium of the Catholic Church!  All the professors are clearly experts in their fields and leaders for students!"
Sophomore,4,I found the content of the courses to be excellent and rigorous. As an online student I would like a more efficient way to communicate regularly with professors.
Sophomore,4,"I am set to graduate with my Associates of Arts from Holy Apostles, one year after graduating high school. Through partnership with Angelicum Academy, I was able to take college classes my senior year of high school. Since I am an online student, I don't know what campus is like. However, the online classes have challenged me and I feel prepared to continue next year as an on-campus student, wherever I decide to go. I highly recommend this program to high-school students, a Liberal Arts degree will prepare you well for continued education as well as any job."
College Senior,4,"Given its relatively small size and small town neighborhood location, Holy Apostles generally does not have security issues.  Everybody knows everybody, so it is next to impossible for an outsider to get on campus unnoticed.  Though there is no campus police force, there are individuals charged with security (and some of the seminarians themselves are former police officers)."
College Senior,4,"Given that Holy Apostles is first and foremost a place of formation for candidates for the Roman Catholic priesthood, the school has many policies governing the behavior of the student body.  As a Christian institution it takes moral formation just as seriously as intellectual formation."
College Senior,4,"Living on campus is great. . .the only issue is that only seminarians and sisters have housing.  The school has expressed interest in the possibility of providing lay student housing in the future, but at the present this is not possible.  Lay students either commute from home or rent apartments in the area."
College Senior,4,"Holy Apostles offers a unique environment where laity, seminarians, and religious study, eat, pray, and play together.  This special setup fosters a sense of community among the various states of life in the Church, laying the foundation for further cooperation in the future.  I would not have traded this experience for another school.  Holy Apostles' small size also gives the campus much more of family-like atmosphere."
College Senior,4,"Holy Apostles strength is in its theology and philosophy offerings, some of which are taught by nationally renowned experts in their field.  The math and science offerings are very weak, sometimes feeling more like a high school course."
College Senior,4,"The great thing about Holy Apostles is that it is one of the lowest cost private colleges in New England.  It is possible to graduate with little to no debt.  I did receive financial aid during my first semester, and the process was quick and easy."
College Senior,4,"Parking at Holy Apostles is free and easy.  There are two lots for commuter students, both within easy walking distance of campus.  One tends to fill up by mid-day, but the other generally always has several open spaces."
College Junior,4,"Holy Apostles is a small school with a small campus, therefore, campus transportation is not necessary.  There is a bus line that makes stops close to campus and transports people to Cromwell and nearby Middletown.  Carpooling among students is common, and can be easily arranged.  The school also assists students in finding rides to Bradley International Airport."
College Junior,4,"Holy Apostles College & Seminary is nestled in a quiet neighborhood in the small town of Cromwell, CT.  The immediate atmosphere of the neighborhood creates a peaceful surrounding that distinguishes Holy Apostles from other colleges located in busy cities.  

The town itself, given its small size, has few attractions, although there is a state park within walking distance of the campus.  Plenty of opportunities are afforded by Cromwell's proximity to the cities of Hartford and New Haven.  The ocean is only thirty minutes away, whereas New York City can be reached in two hours.  The historic Mystic Seaport and Aquarium, the Hartford Symphony, and several beaches are among the attractions within reasonable driving distance from Holy Apostles."
College Senior,2,"Being primarily a seminary, Holy Apostles has no official sports teams.  All sporting activities are student initiated and more or less informal.  These include soccer, ultimate frisbee, bocce, and volleyball.  Athletics play a very small role here."

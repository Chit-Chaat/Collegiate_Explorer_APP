Junior,5,As an international student I can say that I felt very welcomed here and will always be grateful for the chance I got.
Sophomore,5,"In my overall experience at North Carolina State University, I can see how staff are determined to help me succeed and with that I am encouraged to move forward because school can get exhausting. I also enjoy the campus and the atmosphere of having a school that has a modern feeling to it. Another thing I enjoy is that NC State really encourages me to build my network and gain skills that I know will help me out of college."
Junior,5,"I am a first year at NC State University and I have already received so much support from the school, especially during the pandemic. The community in incredible and welcoming and the academics and professors are outstanding."
Junior,5,"With everything transferring to online courses because of the pandemic, my professors and fellow students have been unexpectedly adjusting to online classes. The faculty and staff have gone above and beyond to keep learning fun and engaging in an online setting and to give us all a sense of connection during these unprecedented times."
Sophomore,5,I just started a few weeks ago and felt very comfortable. I have never lived on campus before and especially not during a pandemic. Not to mention that I am also a transfer student. So far NC State has made my transition very easy and seamless. I am doing all online classes this semester due to COVID-19 but I have found ways to get involved and have a real college experience.
Sophomore,5,"I have taken online classes before but never using the platform Moodle. I have only ever used blackboard. However, all my professors have made the transition very easy as they have had some trouble themselves. No one has been made to feel less than or under pressure due to technical issues. I also find that the online lectures are much more interesting and students feel much more comfortable communicating and asking questions using the zoom chat functions as opposed to in person answering. There is less pressure and anxiety."
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful and the community is incredibly inviting and kind. The classes not too bad, professors are good and the classes are well structured."
Junior,5,Curriculum and syllabus are explained and executed flawlessly. Professors are very receptive to meeting with students if they need the extra help.
Sophomore,5,My teachers have accommodated lessons well either through Zoom classes ( so you can learn from a voice ) and/or readable lectures and pre-recorded video lectures. Professors are often very supportive and understanding and do their utmost best to reformat assignments for the benefit of students.
Alum,5,"My classes within the last semester as an undergraduate student were all online due to COVI-19. Most of my assignments for each class were already due online anyway, so switching the format to be solely online was no problem at all. I was able to do as well as I would have had I been in class."
Freshman,5,"I am attending NC State in the Fall but so far I've loved it. The communication has been great, the campus is beautiful, and the online class I took was very well done."
Freshman,5,I've only taken the intro to chemistry module so far but it was very helpful and taught me an entire high school course in about two weeks.
Sophomore,5,"After finishing my freshman year at NC State, I'm so glad I chose to go there. Everyone there is so welcoming and even after only the first week there I truly felt like I was a member of the Wolfpack. Even though NC State isn't known for sports everyone still gets really excited on game day and we have a great student section. The campus itself is beautiful and academics are also great there. There's some really interesting classes and so many different majors. All of the professors I've had so far have been genuinely interested in what they're teaching and really helpful. There really is something for everyone there.

Although everyone was sent home due to COVID-19, we were emailed with updates from administration almost daily and all of my teachers did their best to keep my classes on track and in communication.

I'm excited to go back in the fall and I can't wait for the next three years!"
Graduate Student,5,"Studies transfer well to online courses, I have taken more than 5 classes online and felt I understood the material sufficiently."
Graduate Student,5,"Great school for the price and accommodations for students.Facilities are well kept, teacher are generally helpful, and opportunities are plentiful."
Freshman,5,"This was my first year, and I had a very pleasant experience, It helped that the majority of people I came into contact with felt the same way. The school spirit is unmatched, and I love the energy."
Graduate Student,5,Great experience with great instructors on a great campus. Raleigh can be whatever you want it to be!
Graduate Student,5,"I’m not a big fan of online courses, but theirs were as good as could be. I hope to avoid online classes in the future!"
Freshman,5,NC Sate University allows the students on campus to feel as though they are at home. The environment is quite welcoming and each faculty member is eager to assist students in any way possible.
Freshman,5,"Excellent campus environment with lots of options to find your own community.  The surrounding area is lovely with great options for housing, and good local opportunities for involvement."
Alum,5,This school is awesome. Huge campus eith lots of uplifting scenery. There are always events going on. There are a lot of clubs to join. There is something for everybody. Has several libraries and staff are very helpful. Many different tutoring services and lots of support if you look for it. Has busses that drive around campus at different locations so you dont have to worry about transportation. Highly recommend going to this university. Is a top notch school in NC.
Niche User,5,"North Carolina State is a great, very pretty campus, easy to get around, great security, and transportation."
Senior,5,"North Carolina State University is a great school with a highly diversified demographic, devoted staff, and amazing opportunities."
Freshman,5,Very welcoming and fun environment. Students and teachers are very helpful and kind. The campus is beautiful and creates an awesome learning atmosphere.
Freshman,5,"I love almost everything about NC State. When I was a senior, I had no idea how much I would enjoy it. There is a lot of school pride that I never experienced before. The Wolfpack is very welcoming to new members and I found that, not only are the professors and other faculty very nice, but students are as well. I've been able to have random conversations with people on campus and they responded as if they knew me. They were all very friendly people and I met some of the greatest friends I could ever ask for at NC State. The sports teams are decent and whenever I attend games, they're always exciting. Overall, the school is just awesome and I'm happy to be a member of the Wolfpack."
Sophomore,5,"I made such a great decision by picking nc state. I went to high school about 30 minutes away from campus and maybe thought that it would be too close to home or not something new enough but I was very wrong. I met so many great friends at nc state that come from all over the country and world! And although I am semi close to home, actually living in the city of Raleigh has been the perfect mix of a new scene along with being close enough to home that it is there if I need it. The sports, social scene, and academics here are all amazing and you won’t find a school with more school spirit than the pack! It’s a huge school with a beautiful campus, in one of the fastest growing and best cities in the country. You can’t go wrong with going to NC State because you will find your niche if that is with Greek life, sports, or the thousands of clubs here, so get involved! Amazing city, beautiful campus, and great academics! I’m so happy I chose to run with the pack!"
Sophomore,5,Deciding to attend NC State was the best decision I’ve ever made! There’s a place for everyone on this campus.
Freshman,5,NC State is a beautiful university that has a lot to offer.  This university is known for its great engineering college.  From here many people get fruitful jobs and are successful.
Freshman,5,I am so excited to start at NC State. It was my top-pick university and I'm excited to start. I love the campus and all of different majors.
Freshman,5,I love NC State and would recommend anyone to take a tour. The education and support I have received from my professors is great and has been very beneficial to me.
Niche User,5,"I love being at NC State, it has a wonderful atmosphere and great campus life. I feel connected with everyone when I’m there."
Freshman,5,what I like about NC State is that the people who attend are open to others and they strive to improve society to make an impact.
Sophomore,5,I am in the CALS program and my professors are always extremely engaging and supportive! I have been able to get to know my teachers even in large lecture halls. It is challenging but I feel I am able to work under stress and are better prepared for after college.
Freshman,5,Very nice campus and engineering program !!! I love the city and the opportunity it provides. The buildings are also very clean and look like new. The campus has a nice brick theme too.
Niche User,5,"I love the atmosphere at NCSU. Everyone is so welcoming and down to earth. Also, being located in a city, there are tons of things to do. Additionally, NC State's campus is beautiful and large enough to accommodate everyone."
Freshman,5,NC State is amazing! The amount of resources available to students is awesome and you never have to go far to get help in any way!
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful and the students are extremely nice. the food is amazing at the fountain dinner. a lot of diversity the professors are so nice.
Senior,5,"Best school ever. I transferred here after two years at a private university, and I don’t regret it. The people here are great and Raleigh is a great place to be. Also, great if you are a big sports fan as well."
Junior,5,"NC State's large campus spread across multiple sections is full of buildings where research and teaching are done on a myriad of topics. Most of my professors have been fantastic. The food on campus is great, especially at Talley and Centennial. There's always so much happening on campus."
Sophomore,5,"Everything is perfect at this university. It is diverse, exciting, intelligent, athletic, and has a ton of other amazing features. Every student wants to be here, and 
I love that so much. The only thing I would change is the amount of construction that is currently happening. It ruins the vibe of the campus with all of the noise."
Graduate Student,5,"There seems to be so much opportunity at NCSU for any student. Whether that's due to state funding or competition within the triangle, I feel like the staff and course are extremely helpful towards advancing my career. The facilities are state of the art, I am constantly blown away by the not only the labs but also the libraries as well with how much technology is available. There are so many workshops and clubs to get involved in that it would be hard not to leave NCSU without learning something outside your degree. Overall, I would highly recommend it."
Freshman,5,"I love it! I feel so at home. Ever since coming here, I have made so many new friends and I feel like I truly fit in."
Niche User,5,"In my time at NC State , I have seen how great a college it is. The campus is a great environment that promotes learning and self discovery."
Sophomore,5,"I love attending State! There are tons of great people and a ton of resources like, free tutoring, career guidance, and help with food insecurity. They have some nice options for housing however, a couple options are not too great. If you choose to live in University Towers you have to get the meal plan there which is at least $900 and you cant get it covered on financial aid unless you get a refund check. The food elsewhere is pretty good most days. The best dining hall is Case but, It's only open for athletes at dinner and they get way better food."
Sophomore,5,NC State University is filled with a variety of opportunities and ways to get involved. Students are guaranteed to find a place that suits them. NC State is also very excellent at making connections with the real world to ensure students graduate with jobs lined up. The atmosphere is extremely welcoming an I am proud to call NC State my home.
Junior,5,The professors at NC State are all excellent and I've learned so much since I started attending the school. The staff is all super friendly and the advisors are super helpful to help make sure you take the right classes to graduate on time.
Niche User,5,"I love that NC State has the academic programs I am looking for close to home. The campus is beautiful and the dorm rooms are a decent size. There are many options for dining on campus and the howling cow is amazing. The student center is a great place to meet people and even study on the upper levels. The tunnel of expression is an inspiration to all. With all the wonderful opportunities that Raleigh has to offer, the educational experience at NC State cannot be beat!"
Niche User,5,"Very nice college has worked well with me and my non-degree seeking (NDS) math studies in High school. The campus has good, but strained transport infrastructure, but it is reliable. The campus is sprawled a bit though, with there being two major sections of the campus, this isn't a problem though, due to the aforementioned bus transportation."
Sophomore,5,"Since I have started attending NC State, I have had such a great time and experience. I transferred from a little community college to this huge university and it is so different, but a good difference. I've made many friends who have the same assets and goals as I do. I also have been challenged by the rigorous course work but I've been working really hard to maintain my grades and GPA. Overall, I am happy and excited to continuing pursing my education here."
Sophomore,5,I love it here at NC State! I have really enjoyed my time here! There are so many great professors and instructors. I also really love the community and environmental of the campus! Raleigh is such a great city to be in!
Freshman,5,"Everyone is so welcoming and ready to help. It felt like home even from orientation day. The people are nice, the atmosphere is fun, there's a good mix of people and events, as well as clubs and sports."
Sophomore,5,NCSU is a great place to learn and grow.  There are plenty of opportunities and student involvement.  There is plenty of diversity.  The campus is very beautiful and although it is quite large you feel like its a nice small community.  NCSU also provides a very safe environment for their students.
Freshman,5,great school and engineering program. campus is close to Raleigh which makes it more attractive. diverse student population and a wide assortment of majors and minors to choose from. great school and engineering program. campus is close to Raleigh which makes it more attractive. diverse student population and a wide assortment of majors and minors to choose from. great school and engineering program. campus is close to Raleigh which makes it more attractive. diverse student population and a wide assortment of majors and minors to choose from. great school and engineering program. campus is close to Raleigh which makes it more attractive. diverse student population and a wide assortment of majors and minors to choose from.
Niche User,5,"The atmosphere is amazing, it is easy to find yourself a community and feel like you belong. The staff is truly invested in making sure your college experience is a great experience. At first, it can be hard to balance school work and social life, but as the year progresses it gets easier."

Senior,5,"The staff at the Food, Bioprocessing, and Nutrition building have been tremendous help in guiding students. The campus offers a wide range of courses that challenge and exposes you to niche opportunities. From beer brewing classes to lactation science. The classes have helped create a better idea of all the potential opportunities available in the industry. The advisors for the nutrition department have been active in providing job opportunity information for all the undergraduate students. Throughout my tenure at NCSU, I have taken upon two jobs through the advisor that have allowed me to develop professionally."
Sophomore,5,"NC State is a school that includes a great college experience because of its wide range of activities an student engagement. Raleigh offers to be a nice city with community activities that all students can get involved in. Sports is a big deal at NC State with football games being popular events on weekends. Students take pride in being a part of the wolfpack and cheering on their team. NC State is a school that accepts people from all different backgrounds and mixes them into the community. Academics are also an important factor in the school which is shown through the quality of professors and the amount of help you can receive for classes. The wide range of classes to choose from, students can find topics that they enjoy."
Sophomore,5,"I really like the department I am part of, it is close-knit and everyone knows everyone. Even the professors put in effort to learn the names of all the students and I really appreciated that. Universities can be so intimidating to go to because they feel so big but the fact the professors and upperclassmen put in the effort and energy to get to know me made it feel way smaller and more close-knit. I don't think I would want to see much change about the university I have fallen in love with this past year."
Freshman,5,I love the campus and the scenery is beautiful. The professors are great and I hope the rest of my four years there are great.
Alum,5,NC State was a wonderful experience and I would suggest enrollment to anyone who is okay with a larger school & class sizes. Once you move up through your major the class sizes shrink so that is helpful. Most majors have internship and practicum opportunities which are great experience.
Freshman,4,"This semester was not the worst but, since we were moved online, it was not as easy to learn. I went home after all our classes were moved online(after 3 weeks)  so I did not get to enjoy the on-campus experience."
Junior,4,"I have had classes online for the past two semesters, half of spring 2020 and all of fall 2020. Classes are not that hard to get by as most are asynchronous so I can complete them on my own time. This allows me to work around work and life."
Junior,4,"I like the size of NC State. I do not like how small the dorms are. I also do not like that we do not usually have a long winter break, when comparing to other schools."
Junior,4,Due to COVID-19 I took all of my classes online during the Fall of 2020. I am not a big fan of online classes but the teachers do the best they can and make it as enjoyable as possible
Sophomore,4,"I think everyone can say that it has been challenging to move online and everyone has had to make a sacrifice both students and staff. Still, I think NC State did a great job in how they have handled zoom and opened up forums for students to stay in contact with one another. I also see that NC State has encouraged joining fitness programs and diversity programs online. So, they have done their best in trying to create an online community. Still, I did not give this an excellent star due to professors only being lenient at the beginning of the transition, I still think students as myself are still getting used to being online."
Junior,4,"All of my classes are online. It hasn't been an issue so far but my teachers definitely understand we are all new to this concept and have been very accommodating to my needs as a student. It was an issue last semester trying to  be apart of classes that didn't need to meet twice a week that insisted on it. Only now there are teachers who had time to adjust, get training and are a lot more understanding of the situation we're in since they have also had to live through it."
Junior,4,"N.C. State has been an excellent experience so far and has been everything I could've asked for in an university.  Even though I'm not satisfied with full tuition when moving to a completely online space, I still find that my teachers and staff are incredibly flexible and care about my success as a student. Even in the liberal arts, in a school based around its engineering, business and agriculture, you can find very passionate teachers and programs that are a great fit for students who want to attend a prestigious university."
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and most of the people I have met there are very nice. I have really enjoyed my time here so far and I recommend it to anyone who wants to go to college in North Carolina.
Sophomore,4,"I generally do not like online classes, but the professors I've taken online classes with at NC State have all made a really good effort to provide a quality educational experience."
Senior,4,"Overall, I have very much enjoyed my time at NCSU. I think a lot of it has to do with the location of the school, but I have also had great experiences with classes and professors as well."
Senior,4,"The online learning adjustment has not been too hard for me, as I have been taking one online class per semester for the past year or so. There are obviously some things that need to be improved, but I think fall will go more smoothly than spring did as professors had a period of trial/error as well as much more time to prepare themselves and their plans for the almost all/all online courses."
Freshman,4,Most teachers accommodate well. The transition to online classes is not too rough but dislike the mic of in-person classes alongside online classes.
Junior,4,"Awesome school at a wonderful location, full of resources and dedicated professors. I never felt, at any point, that I was limited in things I wanted to accomplish here- including, but not limited to, research, extracurriculars, and entrepreneurial ventures. The school and the chancellor genuinely care about the students and community, and are always striving to ""Think and Do"" by providing innovative, progressive ways to combat any issues that may arise. The campus is also extremely safe, with its own dedicated, independent police force. The athletics department is amazing as well. Lastly, the students are extremely diverse but also extremely understanding and friendly to one another."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I love the university.  They give you all the tools you need to succeed, and I never felt overwhelmed by anything, which is hard to come by."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the campus, there are multiple libraries and walking around is always scenic. The food isn’t great, you have to know where to go and what to get so there is definitely a learning curve. Most of my professors have been great, and the school of engineering has been a great fit for me."
Sophomore,4,"We had to go online because of COVID, but learning online is not the best fit for me. Despite this I felt the professors did a good job of adjusting and the school offered a pass/fail system for all classes."
Sophomore,4,"NCSU has a wonderful campus atmosphere and has some amazing, world known professors ( such as Dr. Nacoste who teaches Social Psychology ). We have so much at our fingertips at our university to set goals, be creative, and advocate for a better future, not only for our students but for our country. Though the diversity is not as strong as suggested, minorities are not undermined and our student government dedicates themselves to establishing equality for all."
Senior,4,I enjoyed the campus and the quality of the professors at NC State. It is a very large and somewhat diverse school.
Sophomore,4,"After all classes were moved online due to COVID-19, all of my professors made sure to keep us in communication and tried to continue on a similar schedule. Most of my professors used video lectures or power points to teach their courses in a way that would help students understand the material. Although the courses moved online, they were all still very easy to communicate to with questions."
Freshman,4,"Although I didn't like the online format, the teachers I had worked hard to give us the same quality of education online as we did in the classroom. It wasn't perfect, but it wasn't terrible either."
Sophomore,4,"Have taken classes online because of the pandemic and I would say my professors handled the transitions very well. They tried to keep the classes similar to how they were during in person. However, I did hear some people have negative experiences with the transition."
Sophomore,4,"I really love campus since everything is pretty close to each other. It is also easy to get around campus whether by walking, biking, or riding on the campus buses. Housing and dining is ok but the meal plans are pretty expensive considering what you get from them."
Junior,4,I love the fact that they have an entire Dept. for Entomology which is my dream area of study. The teachers I have had so far are very experienced and can be personable if you take your time to learn them. Similar to the name of this website you can find your niche of individuals pretty easily if you look for organizations to join.
Freshman,4,"NC State was a great school, which I ultimately chose to transfer from due to their my major not being very good at the school. Although, I think that their engineering program is very strong and can lead to very good jobs. Campus life was fun as long as you went out and found friends."
Freshman,4,"Overall, my experience with NC State has been quite nice. The professors are very knowledgeable and my classes provide me with enough resources to succeed and improve grades. The campus has improved a lot since the addition of Talley Student Union and there are many fun activities and interesting clubs/organizations to get involved in. However, my one issue with my experience is that I feel N.C State does not provide enough resources and opportunities for students to set ambitious goals. For example, there isn't any drive towards applying to big tech internships outside the RTP area. I feel the culture needs to change by pushing students to test their comfort zone and setting bigger goals so students have the potential to be successful in the future."
Graduate Student,4,"The courses are great. A lot of choice is given to the students. I love the infrastructure, especially the new Talley building. There are a lot of activities covered for the students in their tuition fees. Tuition tends to be on the higher side. There are not many departmental student employment positions available. But there are a lot of part time jobs on campus, which at least let you earn your living expenses."
Freshman,4,"I am from out of state and I absolutely love NC State. Its campus is beautiful and I love the strong sense of community that there is on campus. I love going to football and basketball games. I feel that the professors that I have had are good and want to see their students succeed. However, I lucked out with my professors because a lot of other people had many different experiences with their classes with me. I would like to also point out that the physics department at NC State is absolutely horrible. I am an engineering major and PY 205 is really difficult. And I have heard that it is supposed to be worse for PY 208. Be wary of the physics department."
Junior,4,I really enjoy NCSU. It has been my dream school for a long time and it lives up to almost all of my expectations. It is a beautiful campus with staff who are always willing to help!
Freshman,4,"I love going to NC State. Even though the school is big, they always find ways to make every student feel like they have a place to belong. There are lots of student organizations on campus that fill every need and if you do not see something you like, you can start your own organization! One thing I have learned through this quarantine season is that the professors really have the students' best interests at heart and will do whatever it takes to make sure you have everything you need to succeed. The sports are great and even if we don't win, they still make it a fun time to be there. All of the traditions really help students connect with the campus and create a special bond with the school by becoming a part of the Wolfpack. Since we are the Wolfpack there are a lot of community building events and things that bring everyone together."
Freshman,4,"Of the time I've spent at NC State, it's been the best and I wouldn't trade it for the world. It's such a loving and inclusive environment that truly feels like home."
Senior,4,"Everything is extremely streamlined and it's very easy to navigate resources online (except MyPack Portal, which is trash. It's very hard to enroll in classes). Teachers are well-qualified. I was surprised to see the amount of grad students they have teaching psychology classes though."
Freshman,4,"The campus is big, but that's because there are a lot of available educational opportunities. I came into NC State in engineering, but now I am switching to double major in physics and applied math. While these are all STEM disciplines, NC State's wide variety of majors means that any student can find what is right for them."
Freshman,4,"I loved seeing a lot of my friends from high school here, and how easy it was to find new friends on campus. Ski club has become a second family to me and I love our weekend trips to the slopes. The only thing is NC State lacks diversity. Hopefully over the next few years it will change but the large majority is white middle class students."
Alum,4,"NC State is a great school. However, there really could be more assistance from the professors. There isn't much interaction between faculty and students outside of the classroom. This really made pursuing fieldwork and mentorships really difficult. Its a top school for engineering and liberal arts, but for life sciences, you should look elsewhere."
Sophomore,4,"NC State provides so many resources for students who want to succeed. With abundant tutorial centers for difficult courses such as accounting, chemistry, and calculus, it has really helped me do well in my courses and allowed me to gain confidence for my future goals."
Junior,4,"NC State welcomes everyone with warm arms for being a school of over 35,000 students. It is easy to find your own niche here and get involved in clubs, Greek life, sports, etc. This school is very diverse and strives to make that the biggest part of what they have to offer. The biggest complaint I have is the lack of organization when it comes to finding information and dealing with “administrative issues.” There are so many separate accounts you must use for different purposes such as selecting a meal plan, requesting tickets, registering for classes, buying books, applying for scholarships, paying for school, doing school work, and so on. There is no central database for all this info, so it can be very stressful at times. If NCSU’s website was simplified and had easy access to information instead of dealing with an Easter egg hunt every time you need to do something online it would be much easier."
Graduate Student,4,I currently am attending North Carolina State University. I am getting my masters in social work and have only been on campus for a semester. I throughly love this school and the amount of school spirit it has. There are countless activities offered around campus. There are also a lot of resources to help you throughout your education on campus.
Niche User,4,"They have a very big campus filled with activities for every student, whether you are athletic or a bookworm. Not only that, but they also have a very good student support program that can help with any problem you may have."
Freshman,4,"I like how welcoming the community is, all the professors I have had so far are approachable and easy to talk to.  The first week or two, the school does a really good job to try and get freshman to participate and feel like a part of the NCSU environment."
Sophomore,4,I really love North Carolina state university. I’m from New York so the change in atmosphere was a little intense at first because I feel like it’s more “southern” than I expected. There is a group for everything and I feel like there is a strong sense of community here that makes me feel connected and happy.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy my time here. Everyone tends to be very friendly and accepting of others. There are hundreds of clubs of any kind to join, there is a place for everyone. Academics are somewhat hard, but not impossible. Professors tend to be helpful, but there are the inconsiderate few who are not. There has been an increase in crime surrounding NC State, so that's kind of scary."
Freshman,4,"I like the atmosphere of NC State. There are a lot of people and a lot of diversity on campus. There are constantly campus wide events happening so you can always meet new people and have a lot of fun in between classes! I wish they would do a bit better with housing though and trying to put people with similar majors in dorms together. I live in Syme and I am an engineering major and I am the only one in the whole building, so I wish I was put in a dorm with more engineering majors."
Sophomore,4,NCSU is such an amazing school and I would not choose any other school to attend. It's a large campus with plenty of activities and organizations for students to involve themselves in. You'll never be bored and there is plenty of opportunities for career development nearing graduation.
Freshman,4,"The professors are great, the campus is beautiful and I have so many resources to help me with technology and research!"
Freshman,4,I really like NC State it has that strong community feeling similar to my high school. This school has so much to offer and amazing programs.
Freshman,4,"NSCU is your above average state school and the experience seems to very much be what you make it. The opportunities are out there but you have to utilize the many resources provided to find them. Professors are hit or miss, check ratemyprof when making your schedule. Definitely a school that's focusing on STEM though"
Niche User,4,North Carolina State University is an amazing campus with a breathtaking atmosphere. The University offers several majors for most types of students looking for a great education. I wouldn't change much around the University.
Junior,4,"When I visited NC State, i notice how nice the classrooms and campus are. There was a very positive aura about the school and it was very appealing. I am very interested in this school."
Junior,4,"My visit at NC was very nice, the buildings are really nice and the classrooms as well. Everyone seemed so positive and happy and gave off good vibes."
Senior,4,"NC State is a good school to go to if you are interested in Animal Science, Engineering or Design. They have a lot of work to do with diversity. Although they pride themselves on being diverse, the people that go to school do not all value that so if thats what you're looking for this place is not for that. Other than that the school has a lot of opportunities for working with animals and the only reason why I can speak on that. Housing for the most part is nice, but some of these places have pest problems so keep that in mind.  Just do your research and look at multiple reviews (:"
Niche User,4,I've toured North Carolina State University. It was a beautiful campus during the fall time and the students were very welcoming and kind. Studnet life must be great.
Senior,4,"I transferred here from a private school, and I have to say that NC State is far better! Here I feel like I am not just another student, all of my professors want me to succeed and will help me in any way possible to see that happen!"
Freshman,4,"From my experience from being on campus at North Carolina State University I observed a lot on the campus that I wasn't used to especially coming from a small community college. It's a good college experience if your planning on going to college or a big school such as a university there many places you can explore around the campus to grab food, library, exercise, & etc... All in all North Carolina state University is a good diverse school where you can meet a lot of new people and have a good experience."
Junior,4,North Carolina State is a fantastic school. It is a large school which can be a bit overwhelming but also means that you are likely to find people you fit in with. The teachers are extremely knowledgeable and helpful.
Junior,4,I'm in the Architecture Program at State and its somewhat overwhelming and I can't necessarily say if its good or bad. It feels like the program is like a how to draw tutorial that once you get to the line work they have already added the facial details but did not explain how to do it. There's a lot of things they focus on but we're not going to completely use in the real world and its frustrating most of the times because its a 5 year program.
Niche User,4,I would love to see a change in the acceptance rate and to offer more scholarship money than they do.
Sophomore,4,You really get you wolfpack pride before the first day of classes. There are so many events going on to get you involved in the community and make you more aware of what is going on. NC State is always innovating and constantly updating its infrastructure so it is refreshing to see it and be a part of it. Soccer games are so much fun. Highly recommend! God speed on classes though. Don't let those side events take to much of your time.
Niche User,4,"The Campus is really big and pretty. I enjoyed my college visit there, and I really hope I’ll be able to attend North Carolina State University. The staff was really nice and helpful. The tour guides were also nice and helpful. The campus in general was simply amazing."
Senior,4,"I love NC State. I am an Animal Science major and there have been so many opportunities for me to learn about this field. During labs I got to go to the Equine unit, the swine unit, the dairy/beef units, etc. I was able to learn hands-on with the animals. NC State also has good food, my favorite is the smoothie place in the atrium. The students are very friendly and there are a ton of opportunities for pre-vet students like myself."
Senior,4,"State so far has opened my eyes to the diversity life has to offer. You meet the best people and really become engulfed in the culture State has to offer. The strength of the pack is the wolf, and the strength of the wolf is the pack!"
Freshman,2,"There is very little to do if you do not join a sorority/fraternity. If you don't want to join greek life, good luck. You might have a hard time finding your group of people. The food gets very old very fast, it's not very good and there are not many options. Many of the professors are not accessible and are not willing to work with you if you need help/have an emergency, etc. Some are not all well suited to the courses they are teaching in my opinion. As a freshman, there is VERY little to do off-campus and frat parties are the only thing that anyone ever does, which also gets old pretty fast."
Graduate Student,2,The campus needs to do more to foster diversity and inclusion.  The white women act like they are scared of the black guys--as if the black guys were the ones to enslave their ancestors.  Interracial dating between black men and white women is almost unheard of on the campus.  It definitely needs to move into the 21st century.
Freshman,2,"Raleigh is not a very welcoming environment, and neither are the students on campus. The school is pretty good at helping students with financial aid, but other than that I haven't had any good experiences while staying on campus and going to classes. I suppose Raleigh just isn't for me."
Niche User,2,"i really like the people and the scenery. Especially, the students of NC state are so nice and helpful and they helped me get to my first class."
College Senior,2,Housing staff does not do much to make sure students are comfortable in their living situations. Only puts enough effort in to avoid lawsuits....Wolf Village staff in particular.
College Sophomore,2,"The dorms are super old and need to be renovated soon.  In my last dorm there was a huge ant problem, like it was an infestation.  Then following the ants were spiders (the ants are food) and that was awful."
College Junior,2,has a bad reputation here but many seem to join.
College Sophomore,2,"My bad experiences may have been mostly due to my sound sensitivity, but I had an absolutely horribly time.  The doors slammed loudly at the ends of the hallways, and in the middle of the hallways people would stomp around and shout a lot so that I had literally no quiet time.  It was extremely bad for me.  The RAs did little to stop it and often partook in making things louder."
College Freshman,2,There are always people getting drunk
College Freshman,2,There really are not many places to go
College Freshman,2,Not very much greek life
College Freshman,2,I don't really like Greek Life
College Junior,2,"Trying to find a place off campus is absolutely ridiculous! The price to live in a one-bedroom apartment is constantly going up in price, and is really unaffordable for a college student. Even living with roommates is difficult! Pricing and availabilty is so crazy, I feel as if more financial aid should be considered for students living off campus!"
College Freshman,2,"If you are over a certain point you will not receive any aid. If you think you won't get aid, you're probably right. If you are under a certain point you are forced to send in a large amount of paperwork to verify this. The process is absolutely horrible. However, If you really need aid you will recieve it."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus crime, rubbery, sexual assault frequently occur... School should put more efforts in preventing them."
College Sophomore,2,Sexual harassment frequently occurs in fraternity groups...
College Sophomore,2,I do my FAFSA as early as possible but I still have to wait for my package. last year i waited LONG after my peers. it was almost summer
Recent Alumnus,2,I was not helped or assisted with financial aid or scholarships.
College Junior,2,Only Greeks throw parties and it is scary.
College Junior,2,The people are not great
College Freshman,2,There are not many scholarships from the school itself you have to rely on outside aid or federal aid.
College Freshman,2,I did not get any aid.
College Junior,2,I have had some issues in the pass with financial aid including them needing lot of excess paperwork to prove my financial need for assistance. I had to send in numerous doctor bills and household bills just to show them.
College Freshman,2,"Parking is very strict during the school day. Spots are very limited, sometimes far away, and permits are pricey."
College Junior,2,not very visible for African American students.
College Sophomore,2,The cashiers office is no help at all.
College Sophomore,2,I am personally having a lot of issues with this.
College Junior,2,I'm currently looking for offcampus housing and it's a chore!
College Junior,2,"I applied and didn't get ANY. Apparently my family makes too much to get financial aid, but that's not true."
College Freshman,2,THE SKY IS ALWAYS GRAY AND MISERABLE HERE. IT IS WEIRD WHEN THE SUN SHINES
College Freshman,2,Lots of support for mediocre teams. Pretty mediocre school overall
College Freshman,2,"The professors are just here to research, and the students are just here to get degrees"
College Junior,2,The rain makes it impossible to walk around campus without slipping.
College Junior,2,"Campus housing can either be great or terrible depending on the other students in you're dorm. There isn't that much to do in the dorms, but they're close to the gym so there's usually a lot to do."
College Junior,2,"The greek life is okay. There are a lot of people that get bad reps, but greeks aren't bad."
College Freshman,2,You have to park very far from the dorms and academic buildings.
College Freshman,2,"Campus housing is not that great. Most people live off campus. If you are going to live on or near campus, you should go for tri towers, tucker/ owen, or UT (off campus)."
College Sophomore,2,"they give work study to athletes that have full scholarships borrowing no money, but Im taking out loans for school and apparently I didnt qualify. I simply dont get it"
College Sophomore,2,"i didnt get into the program i wanted to because the school raised transfer requirements right when I was transferring, so I wasnt allowed into my first choice major because my GPA was .2 points too low. Dont know why they did that"
College Sophomore,2,The team sucked this year.
College Senior,2,"The mechanical engineering advising/registration process is a pain in the ass and you don't actually get advised if you need it until well after class sign up has begun. Many majors require the same ISE course for graduation, yet only one section of it is offered per semester. "
College Senior,2,"They lost a form I submitted to them. Otherwise, pretty alright."
College Freshman,2,"People are pretty religious and awkward, not very outgoing, and usually unmotivated."
College Freshman,2,"I love the physical school, but despise the boring, Southern, narrow-minded, religious, run-of-the-mill, non-committed, non-educated student body."
College Freshman,2,"It is difficult to find parking in general, especially when an event is occurring. There are not many spots available for those without parking permits."
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus cost a lot and off campus is hard to find
"
College Freshman,2,There isn't and abundance of help from the university unless you are an athlete.
College Freshman,2,"Parking passes are difficult to come by, but all on-campus parking is free on weekends. "
College Junior,2,"Our school is very old so parking and car traffic was not as big of a factor back in the day.  Today, however, it is a problem and it's hard to navigate around unless you're walking through campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Alot of people think that NC state is diverse, but it's NOT in my opinion. Majority of students here are white, christian and conservative. I wouldn't recommend NC state to anyone who is different or looking for a school with alot of diversity."
College Freshman,2,It gives me an headache.
College Senior,2,"The campus tech support is not helpful, the wireless availability in the classrooms is awful, and the computers in labs/in the library are ALWAYS full. "
College Freshman,2,"Partying for under age people will only happen if you are in a frat, a girl, or a risk taker."
College Freshman,2,Good things are sinks in the rooms. The dorms are very noisy and far away from classes. In my building there was sewer flies in the showers of every mens bathroom and no one ever did anything about it. THE BATHROOMS ARE HORRIBLE
College Freshman,2,I wouldnt choose this school unless I was a engineering or science student. The school is run completely around those students and everyone else is just a paycheck
College Freshman,2,"Most people are white engineering/science students who are very conservative, judgmental, and close minded."
College Freshman,2,The food here is bad and there is very limited options. There is only three dining halls that all serve the exact same food and only two food courts for equivalency. The equivalency program is also a scam because you can only purchase one item at a place due to inflated prices.
College Freshman,2,Campus is pretty strict about alcohol and drugs. They make a point during the first three weeks to make examples out of possible users.
College Freshman,2,There isn't much access to drugs or alcohol if you aren't in a frat or a girl. Drunk people speed down the street at night waking you up. At the same time most people are actually up tight about drinking and drugs.
College Junior,2,"The bus system (Wolfline) is great, especially going from Main to Centennial Campus. However, the employees who handle parking permits always seem to make it difficult for everyone involved."
Niche User,1,Took only a few days to review my graduate app and reject it with no explanation as to why.  Letter sent seemed to be a canned form letter after they quickly and greedily took my $75.00 app fee.  I have reached out to the dean who sent said letter and without any further explanation referred me to the head of the department.  I am waiting for their response which I hope is more informative than the latter.  Save your money and apply somewhere where they will actually give you a fair review and at least a detailed response for your trouble.
Graduate Student,1,"Research faculty at NCSU are overpaid and many are unfunded, unmotivated, hate their jobs, and take in students to use as place holders while they wait to retire. There is no support or interest in furthering student education or careers . For a school that promotes itself as inclusive and diverse, the faculty are remarkably exclusive, ageist, and sexist."
Senior,1,"If you are an adult learner deciding to pursue an education, NCSU is not for you. They are extremely inflexible in class availability as every aspect from advising to the curriculum is designed for 18 year olds. I have had good instructors but the experience was ruined by all the difficulties and hoops I've had to jump through just to get the classes I need. Prepare to beg your boss for time off and use vacation days regularly to take tests, meet advisors, go to required orientations, etc. Online classes are few and far between and require in person testing at a center not open late enough past 5pm for a normal worker to not have to leave early. You are required to take 2 fitness classes feat. on site testing... a complete waste of money and time. With so many adults going back to school, I was shocked that NCSU is so behind the times and not adult friendly. I can't even explain how much I regret taking this path. If you are like most adults with a career and set schedule, reconsider."
Graduate Student,1,"PARKING IS HORRIBLE! It is extremely expensive and you can’t ever find a good spot. You can’t drive between campuses even if you have a permit. The jerks in the transportation office write tickets as a revenue-raising past time activity.  NOT TO MENTION the nice $100  late registration fee NC State loves to slap onto your bill without warning. Here, you are a way for them to make money."
Alum,1,"This school is crap. My professors in (nutrition) dept were horrendous. One professor in particular zeros in on students and doesn't care if you are struggling with a disability even w/ a NOTE from the health dept.  She let students grade each other, and refuses to let your feedback cut into her favorites.  I wanted to start crying each time I tried to tell her that the group students would cut out my work without discussing why they did it, and refused to believe I did anything even when I showed her my work and research. Really? They gave you all these false promises of jobs and stuff when you graduate. This school is NOT accredited for nutrition and they insisted on posting job listings for WIC jobs.  I was told by a HR manager that the school was NOT accredited and I had a good resume and couldn't get the job because of this school. The science classes were harder than necessary and professors were not even interested in helping.  I learned more at a community college."
Alum,1,I went to the Poole School of Business. I don't feel like I was taught the things people want in an employee. I feel like they taught me a bunch of useless crap that no longer applies to the business world. I read job applications and am nowhere near qualified for the things they need. I'm going on 14 months after graduating without a job. After spending several years studying there I've become useless to the workforce. I'm worse off for wasting y time there.
College Sophomore,1,Didn't look past points of a point
College Freshman,1,The Panhellenic Council is extremely cliquey and surprisingly unwelcoming for the number of frats on campus.
College Freshman,1,"If you are a white, Christian, or preppy student then you are at the right school. As a mixed race, less religious, nerdy student I often feel very out of place and find it hard to fit in. This also makes it very hard to make any friends"
College Freshman,1,"Campus food is absolutely disgusting. You will like it for about 3 days and immediately get tired of every restaurant on campus. The dining all food can barely be called food and the ""restaurants"" at talley are very tiresome and boring."
College Junior,1,I don't go to parties because I haven't found one that is of interest to me.
College Junior,1,The science majors and engineers have it the worst. The classes are definitely challenging
College Senior,1,"Pretty bad. Its overpriced and s****y quality. Parking is horrible everywhere and you are guaranteed to get towed if you don't have a parking permit or are in one of the 10 visitor spots per complex, which fill up every single night and weekend. Most are far from campus (not walking distance) and getting to campus without a car is a chore."
College Freshman,1,"I HAD MORE FUN IN MIDDLE SCHOOL. Few people leave their little dorm rooms on a Saturday night and those who do, probably still won't drink or do anything actually fun. Frat parties are the biggest waste of time and usually get broken up before they could even try to become fun, and being a northerner, the clubs are more than pathetic with only like 50 people in them awkwardly dancing for a few hours and then leaving by 2 (when the clubs CLOSE....)."
College Senior,1,"They do not inform you of when you are running out of financial aid and let you figure it out on your own. My financial adviser is dumber than a box of rocks and was completely unhelpful. Just know that you only get $31,000 worth of federal loans and after that, you have to get private loans. Not like they ever told me that though!"
College Junior,1,The parking cost is outrageous especially because they give more parking permits than can fit in the parking lots they provide. It is not worth the money. 
College Freshman,1,PARKING SUCKS. The enforcement officers are all jerks and legit walk around and ticket people who are parked in different spots then their permit allows but there is never any spots with the pass they have. Also I normally have to park out in the middle of nowhere when I get back from practice late at night and it's sketchy as hell. 
College Freshman,1,I find it really annoying how much attention the varsity sports get. They have their own dining hall and it's not fair to the rest of us that they get to eat there and we don't. Also they get fancy matching backpacks which is annoying. The school should get a varsity lacrosse team and then I'd be happy.
College Senior,1,"The housing at State is a disaster overall. The methodology that they use to pair people is sub par to say the least. Just because people go to bed at the same time does not mean they are compatible. Furthermore, University Housing favors students that are more like the ""typical"" college student, i.e. drinkers and partiers who are inconsiderate. They also lie concerning different halls, maintaining that all halls are essentially alike in terms of quiet. This is very untrue. There are definitely ""party halls"" and ""study halls,"" and you need to know where to go if you are going to be happy. There will be some people who will tell you that you should go to a certain hall and that it will be quiet because ""ROTC members and student athletes live there."" Right, the two groups that have the worst reputation for raising hell when there is no one there to look. There is a lot of pandering, and you need to live where YOU will be appreciated for why you are in college."
College Junior,1,"Despite being a very qualified student and going after many merit based as well as financial need based scholarships, it's impossible to receive the help I need and I get very little from financial aid. Looking forward to a decade of paying off student loan debt."
College Junior,1,"Dear God, campus dining is awful. The dining halls is some of the worst food I have ever had. I'm pretty sure prison food is better quality. Not only is the food disgusting (have you heard of the 'fountain effect'?) but there are hardly any options for vegan, vegetarian, or gluten-free.

The same goes for the Atrium and Talley. Other than outside chains, the food sucks (Zen Blossom is the worst Chinese food I've ever had. I'm pretty sure the cardboard box it comes in tastes better).

Campus Dining charges SO MUCH money for such bad quality. It's a rip-off."
College Junior,1,The variety is not that great and they often lie about what is going to be on the menu. Sometimes the food is stale or not even cooked all the way. Can be very disappointing.
College Junior,1,There is no free parking for students and the closer the as you get closer to main buildings the parking passes get more expensive
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is expensive, and often times the spots are not that close. I did not have a car freshman year and just waited until I lived off campus. You really do not need a car. Public transportation is great down here!"
College Freshman,1,Permits are high and you can't really park on campus. Also the lots are so far from main campus you'll have to take the bus or just walk 30 mintues or more.
College Freshman,1,"Sometimes the food is good but I don't always know exactly what the dish is. It may be because NC State dinning needs to please each race sometimes but as a African American I'm not used to every type of food. But the food gets old at times, breakfast is always the same."
College Freshman,1,Mostly Asian or Italian food that is not good or desirable.
College Freshman,1,"I Don't Drive – But from other friends' experiences, I can say that parking is pretty poor. Its hard to find parking near your dorm. Whats worse is that even after paying for the right to park on campus, you're still not guaranteed a parking spot."
College Sophomore,1,"Drunken Madness – My only experience with Greek Life on campus was a dazed drunken girl repeatedly falling on the sidewalk. A friend and I walked her home when it become clear she couldn't stand on her own. She lived in a sorority house, and when we were in her area dropping her off, we got jeered at."
College Sophomore,1,"My Dog Eats Better Than Me – They have three dining halls on NC State campus and one of these is an athletes dining hall. The regular dining halls are not satisfying at all and are extremely repetitive. Usually i end up eating salad whenever i go because there is nothing else appetizing. I have eaten once at the athletes dining hall and i was surprised on how great there food was, none of the other dining halls were even close, it was shocking. they have a taco bell and chickfila but they get old real fast."
College Sophomore,1,"Impossible Craziness – Impossible with no permit, crowded, far from classes"
College Sophomore,1,My experience with the financial options is not good.  I am working on a graduate certificate in e-learning.  NCSU does not offer any financial aid to students unless you are in a degree program.  There is no consideration for the continuing adult student.
College Freshman,1,Corporate Fast Food 95% around campus – The food offered just off campus is 95% corporate junk food.  It is really really sad.....
College Freshman,1,"Being a school with 90% in state students and 10% out of state, there is no diversity.  The school is very religious, and I'm not.  Coming from the north it is difficult to meet people who are like you.  Just like Northerners have stereotypes about the South, Southerners have stereotypes about the North. If you come here, just be prepared for a quiet nightlife and meet a lot of in state students."
College Freshman,1,"Not so great – I'm an out of state freshman, and nightlife is terrible.  Theres usually nothing going on besides small frat parties. It may be better if you know a lot of people from high school going here, but if you don't know anyone nightlife is definitely lacking.  If you are looking for a school with good night life, I'll save you the trouble of going here and being disappointed."
College Freshman,1,"If you are coming out of state, be prepared for a lot of in state kids.  There is no diversity and ""Northerners"" are viewed as outcasts. If you're looking for good nightlife, this is NOT the school you want to go to.  If you don't know that many people here, odds are you won't like it here.  I'm transferring mid-year; and other Northerners don't like it here as well."
Recent Alumnus,1,The greek houses look like office buildings. They started to remodel greek court by slowly building an actual house for each sorority/frat but it is a very slow process.
College Sophomore,1,"At the beginning of my freshman year I was raped off campus and the administration tried to play it off because the guy was a park scholar. They only questions they asked me were if I had been drinking and if I was only upset because I lost my virginity. Only after the police took pictures of my bruises did they give him a slap on the wrist by making him move out of the dorms. And I also got charged for underage drinking and received a first offense by the school, even though it was off campus and the police said they weren't going to charge me because of the nature of the crime."
College Senior,1,"Avoid on-Campus Grad Student Housing – NCSU offers some on-campus housing for grad students (some of which is mixed with seniors) but I would recommend avoiding this.  It may be convenient, esp. for internationals or students with no cars.  However for about the same price you can easily find an apt. off campus with more ammenities and less restrictions."
College Senior,1,"Greeks are Missing – The Greek life on campus is so low profile one would think it was gone.  I personally only know one person who was in a sorority but she transferred schools after a year.  The Greeks keep to themselves and hangout with themselves.  You have to know a Greek to even get into one of their fundraising events.  Greek Court and Greek Village are essentially closed areas for non-Greeks, not that anyone would notice at all.  "

Senior,5,"For me, this school has done exactly what it says on the tin. Almost all of the critical reviews are complaining about aspects of the school that are very well reported. The gender ratio is skewed, tuition is high, some dorms don't have AC, and the classes are rigorous to the point where many will fail at some point. Some over-privileged rich kids come here expecting mom and dad to pay for straight A's and they all get a rude awakening when classes start. I love that. Most people who have a problem with this school are simply not into STEM or not self motivated. If you work hard and are serious about STEM, then you will flourish here. Thanks to this school I already feel like I have a serious competitive edge against other graduating engineers. I landed two dream internships while at Rose, and I'm sure I'll have no problem finding a well paying job this year even though there is a pandemic happening right now. Amazing school, amazing profs, amazing support at this school. 5/5."
Junior,5,"Love Rose-Hulman! If you're looking for a party school, this certainly isn't it. If you want somewhere you can get a great education from professors that care, then look no further. One of my math professors took the time to build our graphs in Minecraft so that we'd have a visual representation of what we were studying. He was so passionate about teaching that he went home at night and worked on that. All of the professors at Rose are very dedicated to helping students learn in and out of the classroom. Even with everything that's going on due to COVID, Rose is taking individual needs into consideration and is creating a much better environment that most the schools my friends go to. It's a great place to learn and a fun place to be in general. If you're going to attend Rose, definitely recommend living on campus. The on-campus atmosphere is like no other and you'll make more lifetime friends than you even thought possible."
Sophomore,5,"Rose Hulman is a great school. The workload is challenging, but also rewarding. Professors are caring and helpful, good at their jobs. Food selection isn't great, freshman dorms need air conditioning in the summer."
Sophomore,5,They are very accommodating.  There is lots of help to transition into a college lifestyle.  Opportunities for assistance with academics.
Freshman,5,"A great school for engineering, and mathematics. This school provides a great place for talented students to work. With many challenges and many people/resources to help, Rose-Hulman is a dedicated to helping all of their students succeed. Overall, the campus setting is perfect for developing students, and the curriculum is updated every year in order keep up to date with the outside world. Lastly, Rose-Hulman prioritizes incorporating job experience into the student life in order to make their students top picks for businesses."
Niche User,5,"During my visits, they were well organized and informative. Though I have not attended yet, the display was more then etiquette and has draw much of my attention."
Junior,5,Rose-Hulman consistently ranks as the number one Engineering School in the country (without a doctoral program).  It is a small campus so I get personal attention.  I love that the professors actually teach the class instead of having another student teach.
Sophomore,5,"Honestly I love everything about Rose-Hulman. From the Professors to the food to the campus everything is amazing, and nothing needs changed!"
Senior,5,"The best thing about Rose-Hulman is the small class room size. I've never had a class with more then 30 people. Since classes are so small, it's easier to engage with the professor and it's also easy to meet with them after hours if you need extra help. The academic halls are very nice and filled with places to sit and work. The cost is pretty steep though."
Sophomore,5,"Rose is a small school, designed for learning first.  I love the quarter system.  There are three academic periods in a year, and I get to learn so much more because of it.  The campus is incredibly safe (I will just leave my laptop sitting out in common areas for hours at a time) and the people are incredibly friendly.  While it is not entirely there yet, they are getting better with LGBTQ+ acceptance"
Niche User,5,I love that the campus is so home like and that everyone is so open and inviting. i like that the campus is small and easily navigable because i get lost easily. i love that the classes are rigorous because i love being challenged in classes.
Freshman,5,"This is the perfect place to learn, grow and be with other students that understand you. There are great profs and the support system is really great too."
Freshman,5,"I love attending Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. It is a difficult school, but they are interested in helping you succeed."
Alum,5,A wonderful STEM school. Very rigorous academics but it prepared me for my career. I was able to get a job right away and felt I was able to quickly grasp what was needed to make a difference. I highly recomend.
Senior,5,"It's a good but difficult school. The general atmosphere is nice, as all the students and professors are understanding of what the students are going through. The professors are generally pretty good and there are a few that are outstanding. My biggest negative critique is the cost of living on campus and the food services. The food is passable but not worth what one must pay for it. I recommend moving off campus after the first year as housing and food will be cheaper."
Niche User,5,I am at Rose-Hulman for operation catapult. The professors are very energetic and helpful. The food here is wonderful! The dorms are very small though but they have lots of bathrooms. I have very much enjoyed my time at Rose-Hulman.
Niche User,5,I've spent quite a bit of time on the Rose campus and I love it. The teachers are personable and helpful. Their facilities are extremely nice and everyone feels welcome. The student life is very diverse and fun to be a part of.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman, I have been very pleased with the attentiveness of my professors this year.  The curriculum is challenging, but my professors have been fabulous and accessible.  I even had a professor willing to help one of my groups from 8:00 p.m. until midnight on a Sunday night.  Iâ€™ve heard stories that other professors do the same thing routinely."
Sophomore,5,Rose is not for the faint of heart. The curriculum and culture put you through the ringer. The structure of the class schedule as a mechanical engineer is well thought out and practical. I enjoy participating in the top-notch intramural program her as well.
Alum,5,"This is THE best Engineering school. Professors are great and help students understand the material any time of day. The classes are the perfect size and their career services department went out of their way to help me land the perfect job. Though with the almost thousand companies coming to the campus during three job fairs it isn't really needed! I was welcomed by everyone and felt safe on campus. The food is now awesome thanks to locally sourced veggies and fruit, Some grown on campus. I love Rose-Hulman!"
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the small campus environment; easy , short walk from Student Union to classes, dorms, indoor athletic center or administration building. I enjoy small class sizes and hands on approach to learning, as well as, a very academic environment, camaraderie, long standing school traditions and a strong alumni association. Rose concentrates on internship experiences and job placement. Some of the challenges are: The campus is located in Indiana(I live in NY), so going home on breaks is expensive and requires a bit of planning, although the food is good, I wish it were a little better(but  all students say that?), also, not having a car on campus is limiting. All in all, I am enjoying my experience at Rose-Hulman."
Sophomore,5,"Rose-Hulman is a very intense, high paced school and it isn't the college of choice for a lot of students. It takes a very tough, brave and driven student to succeed at Rose-Hulman. So many students go to Rose-Hulman believing they will breeze through the curriculum sort of like they did in high school or the student will try to balance all of their responsibilities on their own, which both are false hopes that lead to failing out or transferring schools. Rose-Hulman offers tremendous resources to allow students to succeed but it is a decision the student has to make-- to struggle alone or to struggle with the help of others."
Graduate Student,5,"Amazing experience, professional and connected professors, TONS of extra-curriculars, amazing family, small school feel, rigorous academics and all the fun you can have in Terre Haute"
Junior,5,"The Rose-Hulman community is one of the best things offered at the school. Everyone has the same mindset to succeed. The professors are there to help. There is no pressure or dog-eat-dog environment. The curriculum is hard, but it makes for the most successful engineers and scientists."
Niche User,5,"I liked all of the Coaches and Admission counselors, all were very nice.  They help constantly with anything you need and don't stop until they know you will be set."
Freshman,5,"The academics are outstanding. I learn more each week than I ever learned in my high school career. The hands-on aspects of labs makes each class fun! Every day is an adventure! And I have already made lifelong friends, and everyone I meet is open to meeting people."
Freshman,5,"I am a Freshman here and completely loving it. All but one of my teachers are totally amazing, so willing to help and fantastic. The school atmosphere is so safe, walking around campus at night is no problem, and the trust that people have with others is incredible."
Recent Alumnus,5,Academics are challenging but awesome.
Recent Alumnus,5,My Rose-Hulman education was unparalleled.
Recent Alumnus,5,Rose-Hulman was a 2nd home to me and I loved it.
College Freshman,5,"During the day, there is no problem. At night, the school provides services for emergency communication and even have a Public Safety car roaming around campus at night. In fact, many people freely wander around campus with no uncertainties. I personally have always felt safe on campus, even when walking from another dorm back to my own in the dead of night."
College Freshman,5,"Most teachers are very understandable and accepting and will work with individual students on any sort of struggle (as long as the student shows an effort). They know their topic and what they are looking for in their tests, homeworks, and projects. They give quite a few hands on and engaging assignments and activities to enhance learning."
College Freshman,5,"Being a small community, it is very easy to ask both classmates and teachers for help in studying or homework. There are also multiple opportunities for being tutored and they are mostly very helpful. Most teachers end up on a first name basis by the end of the trimester. Classes are taken in trimesters which gives a good balance of classes while not dwelling in one class for too long but learning very much. There is also quite a bit of hands on work which makes it exciting and fun."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is respectable and campus security is always available, even though the campus is an extremely safe place."
College Freshman,5,The career placement is unmatched with three career fairs a year and over 90% placement of the senior class by graduation.
College Freshman,5,Te professors are always willing to help.This is great considering the difficulty of every course.
College Freshman,5,"Anyone that is a part of engineering knows how much a degree from Rose-Hulman is worth. Due to that, we get opportunities for jobs that no other college gets, and we have career fairs 3 times a year during each of the 3 quarters from many well-known companies that are looking for people from Rose-Hulman to offer jobs or internships. Everyone at the career services actively try to help you get yourself in the right place to secure a job well before you're out of Rose. There are rarely only a few people that don't get a job out of Rose before their senior year is over with, but you'd have to not be trying to not get a job out of here."
Recent Alumnus,5,no rapes or anything bad happen here.
Recent Alumnus,5,Football and baseball rule and soccer is a closer third.
College Sophomore,5,"We have three yearly career fairs and a great career services team, all to help students get jobs and internships. One of the things that attract students is the job outlook after graduating. The Rose-Hulman name is attractive to employers."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the school and think it is a great fit for me. I like the small campus and the small class sizes. I like how professors I had for one quarter last year still know my name and say hi to me. I like how easy it is to get help, either from tutors or people in your classes. Almost everyone there is in engineering and we all understand how hard and busy everyone is. And that's the thing, it is hard. The classes and workload are hard but it can be done."
College Freshman,5,"3 job fairs a year help place at least 50% of freshmen into internships if you're an upperclassmen the odds are in your favor. 98% job placement by graduation and average salary of $68,000 says enough by itself."
College Freshman,5,I love the family feeling.  Everyone is friendly and open.
College Sophomore,5,The people at Rose are what make it a special place. Students are friendly and there is a definitive collaborative spirit that runs free on campus. The teachers genuinely want to help students. Close relationships can be formed because of the small style environment. The education is top notch and requires a lot of hard work. But I wouldn't have it any other way!
College Sophomore,5,"The student body is welcoming and inviting, and making friends is easy, which is useful given I was the only person going to Rose from my high school. The courses are tough, but the professors are friendly and willing to provide one-on-one help constantly. There are many extracurriculars available, and the floors within the dorm rooms become close-knit communities, providing much-needed support. The college is nationally recognized as excellent, making internships easily available, and reduces stress about finding a job after graduation. The material covered in class is engaging and challenging, and achieving academic excellence has an extra level of satisfaction and reward. Overall, the college is fantastic."
College Senior,5,"Rose has a very close family community.  The courses are extremely difficult, but every wants to work together, professors included, to see each other succeed."
College Freshman,5,"Strictness falls in line where I think it needs to.  Drinking is pretty much fine as long as you aren't stupid or public about it, and drinking policies are really only enacted pro-actively by your residence hall assistant if you have previously gotten really sick/ noisy/ have a drinking problem.

Noise violations come down to your local environment.  Unless its finals week, you can be as noisy as you want during the day, and only have to be quiet at night so your floor mates don't get bad (its not really taken care of at an administrative level unless you are unfair about it for nights in a row). 

Honor is a big deal hear - we want to produce students who can DO THEIR OWN WORK, its why our hiring process is awesome.  People respect us for it.

Parking is really enforced during events, otherwise just don't block handicap spots or stay any where that is not parking for more than a few hours.  There are not any meters or such on campus, so you do not have to worry about those being enforced because they are nonexistent.

Visitation is a roommate by roommate basis.  Again, if you hear your neighbors making weird sounds in the middle of the night, it is your choice to do something about it, not administration's."
College Freshman,5,"1st years have to live in the dorms- - and its awesome. 1st year you share core math classes and such with a lot of your floormates.... I have just walked down the hallway groaning ""Calc II... pleeease""  - and blam, instant study buddies just materialize.

Since campus is very small, there are not a lot of bad places to be. Demming is old and does not have air conditioning, but it is the closest to everything, in between the mess hall and academic buildings.  It's rooms also have more character and it's all male.

The triplets( Blumberg, Sharpenberg, and Mees) are the closest to the SRC (the awesome work out facility) out of all the 1st year halls, so definitely something to consider if you like to work out or swim in the winter.

Every hall (and in the larger, upper classmen residence halls, every floor) has a lounge area.  The first year halls have public kitchens -- in the other halls it varies, dependent on whether or not you have your own suite kitchen.

Men and women are housed near each other, only really separated in Deming (which probably is just tradition and semi-necessary due to the gender ratio), which encourages students to bridge the gender gap that might exist at an engineering college."
College Freshman,5,"This campus is very safe, and everyone respects the guidelines that are set up. Our honor code is what makes this place feel like home."
College Freshman,5,"Rose shocked me when I started taking classes here, all the professors truly love what they do, and they are happy to help out when you are struggling. That being said: Just like any top-tier school, nothing here will be spoon-fed, and you still will have to work hard to do well.

As a Computer science major, the small class sizes really help out because any issue on a topic/code can be addressed immediately during  class time, as opposed to waiting for office hours. While Rose's #1 ranking technically doesn't include CS (US news doesn't rank undergrad CS w/o a doctorate) I have no doubt that the quality and focus of the program is very hard to match anywhere else."
College Freshman,5,Never heard of an issue so far.
College Junior,5,Housekeepers. They're the best and keep the dorms running smoothly with notes every week they clean and finals week snacks and surprises.
College Junior,5,It's the worst and the best. I love it but I hate it. It's a love-hate relationship because of the material being very difficult but the professors get us through it.
College Junior,5,"When I applied it was free application, and I think it still is. It's very similar to most colleges except for the requirements and scores required to get in."
College Junior,5,Public Safety keeps an eye on everyone and everything while being very helpful and supportive. I've never even really thought about it on campus because it doesn't really happen ever.
College Junior,5,"Intramural sports are a big part of everyone's week, a way to get away from school for a couple hours and have some fun."
College Junior,5,"Being at a smaller school, authorities are a lot more lenient than at a bigger university."
College Junior,5,"Anything you want or need, they probably have it or can make it available to you."
College Sophomore,5,There is always a student crowd at every game.
College Sophomore,5,Being Greek or not is not a huge deal. I have friends in many different fraternities and sororities.
Senior,4,Covid happened and most Profs tried as hard as they could. Of course it isn't as good as in-person but that's why administration is pushing for a safe version of in-person classes in the fall quarter.
Junior,4,"I'm not the best online learning which is unfortunate since that's what a lot of classes are being switched to. Rose is making it a smooth and easy transition, however. Professors still have office hours and more help sessions than before. It's an uncertain time for a lot of people but Rose has helped add a little certainty back in."
Sophomore,4,"Excellent school! Feels just like home! The work is tough, but the professors are more than willing to work with you."
Senior,4,Its a great experience to have overall. I have really grown as a person here and Rose has prepared me well for the real world.
Senior,4,Itâ€™s a different environment all together but the professors made it still very conducive to learning.
Sophomore,4,"Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I've been taking classes online. Although it would be easier to learn the material in-person, for having to switch suddenly to virtual classrooms, online learning has been very good."
Freshman,4,"My favorite thing about Rose is the people. This is also what initially attracted me to the school, and choose it. The people here are extremely supportive of you, if you ever have a problem  there are so many people you can reach out to to help you. Also, everyone is striving for a good education and to do well which encourages you to do your best. The only thing that is challenging is the workload of schoolwork, but still manageable."
Niche User,4,"I loved the environment at Rose. The people are super passionate, smart, and innovative when it comes to changing the world. The professors are really nice and helpful making the small class sizes enjoyable. 
One thing I would like to see improved is the food. While I was there I just missed home cooked food. You could just tell that it wasn't prepared from ""scratch."""
Junior,4,"I really enjoy the small school atmosphere at Rose, but the best thing about it is the competitive edge that you gain after graduating compared to other engineering schools. The intraschool atmosphere is very supportive, the professors and students want everyone at Rose to succeed and do something amazing."
Junior,4,"Rose-Hulman has done a lot of work to renovate and update the campus overall, but there is still a lot of work that needs to be done updating the residence halls and campus accessibility."
Junior,4,I am a current junior studying biomedical engineering. This is a challenging school and no one will understand the experience until they go through it themselves. I have enjoyed my time and would not have wanted to go anywhere else.
Sophomore,4,I am currently a sophomore at Rose-Hulman. I've been through living in the freshmen dorms and I am currently in a fraternity house off campus. The on campus living was helpful  freshman year as I knew I could always go to my RA or SA to ask for help. I also received some of my closest friends from my floor last year. The professors vary in difficulty from each department and the food is decent. Not the greatest but it gets the job done. The sports teams on campus are always winning awards.
Sophomore,4,Rose-Hulman is an awesome place. That is if you like having to work hard and spend a lot of time on assignments. This place will challenge you and make you work for what you want. The professors in most cases are very good.
Sophomore,4,"Very challenging school with high reward upon graduation, I love every minute of being there. Can get stressful at times but are many ways to relieve stress with fun activities that surround the campus throughout the year."
Recent Alumnus,4,Parties are usually a 50/50 success or failure.
Recent Alumnus,4,Diversity is good at Rose in all aspects.
Recent Alumnus,4,I have more positive things to say than negative.
Recent Alumnus,4,Never was afraid walking alone at night.
College Freshman,4,"They work with students to give pointers and directions for resume making, interviews, follow-ups, and job fair preparations. They are very resourceful and show their goal for guiding students to success."
College Freshman,4,"Most social environments are divided by dorm, floor, then section on the floor, but there is a lot of intermingling among them. Through socialization, floor activities, and floor dinner, one really gets to know and bond with fellow classmates. Even with these 'divisions', everyone is open to anyone joining their community."
College Freshman,4,"Its a lot of work and fast paced, but the level of education level is above all."
College Freshman,4,"I have never heard of anyone committing a crime on campus, nor have I ever felt like I was in danger at anytime while walking about on campus at anytime of the day."
College Freshman,4,"The professors here at Rose show that they aren't worried about research, just teaching students and making sure they understand the material. Each professor does have their own style of teaching, so going from quarter to quarter will be different every time. For the most part, there are quite a few different courses offered in the humanities, but the intended category of engineering you go for means you usually take the classes that are needed that aren't humanities. Since the seniors do get first pick of classes, the freshmen get the worst pick of humanities classes. Class sizes do have a wide range, some being as low as 5-10 people all the way to 30."
College Freshman,4,"I don't live on campus, so I wouldn't know anything except for what I've seen when visiting friends that live in dorms. As far as what I've seen, the dorms aren't that bad, although there are some that are considered better than others."
College Freshman,4,"Everything I heard about Rose definitely lived up to it's expectations; there is a hugely steep curve to how Rose works and how traditional high school works. As much as the fast pace kills me sometimes, the kind of education I'm getting from here is something I wouldn't trade."
Recent Alumnus,4,I've enjoyed it and it's been a great experience.
College Sophomore,4,"There is very little crime on campus. People feel comfortable leaving their belongings in the union lobby or at study tables and walking away. There was a theft problem earlier this year but it was handled and the student was expelled. We try to have an open door policy. As a girl, I feel safy walking across campus alone in the dark."
College Sophomore,4,There are small class sizes and most are conducted in a lecture fashion. For a small specialised school I think we have a good variety of courses.
College Sophomore,4,"I like the housing. You get close to those near you. As a freshman, you get sophomore advisors in addition to your RA. These students help plan more fun activities for you to do as a Res Hall. The rooms are a bit small, but it's college, what to you expect? A housekeeper comes through once a week and changes your sheets. Getting assigned housing is easy, you just fill out the survey where you specify your first and second choice Res Halls and there is a second where you can request a lake view or what floor. As a freshman there was no long questionnaire, just a second to put whatever information you want to help them assign the roommates, which I thought was weird at the time but it worked out well."
College Sophomore,4,"The greek life on campus is great. Most people in them are nice and the parties are what you'd expect. As someone who just recently became greek, before I was pretty indifferent to those who had chosen to go greek. I just personally thought it wasn't for me. But then one of the sororities nicely asked me to go through recruitment and now I'm Greek. The sororities each have an apartment in Skinner and one of them has another on campus apartment. Three of the frats have on campus houses with the others not being too far away."
College Freshman,4,Pub Safe is always on the look out as well as RA's and SA's and the entire campus nothing gets through unnoticed.
College Freshman,4,"Class size on average is maybe 30, I came form a small school and it feels the same. I have had some visiting professors who expect us to already know the topics. My advice is try to get the tenured professors and talk to your SA's and RA for advice on profs. The classes are challenging but are helpful for future courses. You're also almost guaranteed a job coming out 98% job placement. Be ready to work hard and study harder and you'll be fine."
College Freshman,4,All fraternities are equal just have to find the one you fit into there are plenty of options.
College Freshman,4,Our Intramural fields are better than all the football fields I've played on. We also have an indoor and outdoor track and the recreation center is massive and updated.
College Freshman,4,"Make sure to get the right professors, try to avoid visiting profs as they don't have the best experiences teaching and can't convey the material as well as the tenured professors. Rose- Hulman is great environment and atmosphere for social life and has several greek options. There are also several events put on by the organizations of Rose, but not much free time from studying."
College Sophomore,4,"The people here are the reason I was able to survive my first year. They are so nice. Most of the professors are also wonderful. I definitely love that it's a small school because you get to interact with your professors more, and they know your name."
College Sophomore,4,"While the classes are hard, it has been fun."
College Freshman,4,I think the campus strictness is just right. They stress no drugs and stealing and other things like that but they don't really get in the way of the whole college experience.
College Freshman,4,"The people in the financial aid department are absolute angels! They really work with you, and if you need more money, tell them. They will do anything in their power to help you out and award you more aid if you really need it. The staff is just wonderful and the reason why I even chose Rose. They try to make it as affordable as possible."
College Freshman,4,"Engineers party hearty, and the pub-safe is really good about keeping us out of crazy shenanigans without ""writing us up"" persay"
College Freshman,4,"It is so much easier to go to Aramark (the A-R-A) in the Union than to cook for you self.  It is not just the food preparation that takes too much time, but driving into town and trying to cram perishables into your fridge is a real struggle.

The ARA might not be as good as some private schools, but it is well worth it versus the cost of driving into town regulary or living off gas station food (as long as you eat more than 1 meal a day) , and it offers a great variety at the salad bar with reasonable rotating main courses, a daily pizza menu, a grill line for burgers and friends, daily noodles, daily rice, a sandwich bar complete with PANINI PRESS.

It's super awesome, unless you are from some really crazy private high school."
College Freshman,4,"Varsity sports may not be the core part of RHIT, but people here still love to participate in intramurals.

The Rec. Center is very modern and accommodates for many activities.

 (The Indiana Colts used to train here during the summer)"
College Freshman,4,"I love the housing here! There are only two dorms that have no A/C, and those are the freshman dorms. If you're a girl, you're guaranteed an A/C dorm. Rooms are spacious and room service is given to everyone. 

RHIT is one of the few places where there are two Sophomore Advisers that work with the RA's to help out the freshman, and the open door policy really helps build a community."
College Freshman,4,"For a town this size, there are are plenty of food choices to pick from. At the start of the year you are given a discount card with all of the restaurants that give discounts/deals to RHIT students. Many places stay open late."
College Freshman,4,"People may complain that Terre Haute is a sleepy town, but there are plenty of things to do around town, you just have to know where to look."
College Junior,4,"Do well in high school and the financial aid will follow, also apply for scholarships online like I am right now."
College Junior,4,Off campus housing for me will be 2 miles from campus with a trail that leads right into campus that I can ride my bike on.
College Junior,4,I think they said we represent almost every country in the world through the students and faculty at Rose.
College Junior,4,Terre Haute is a bigger city with small town feel.
College Sophomore,4,There are a few apartments of campus that are close enough to walk.
College Sophomore,4,Apply early and pay attention to due dates.
College Junior,4,"I enjoy it. The people in my program are nice too, which is good because I can approach them about questions. So professors are okay."
College Junior,4,Its fairly easy to get in because the school is so unheard of.
College Junior,4,I think the campus is safe.
College Freshman,4,Students are driven to do well and study a lot.
College Freshman,4,I live in a secure campus where everyone is there for a good education and take it seriously.  It seems to be close knit and trustworthy as to where we don't even lock our doors.
College Freshman,4,I am a member of  Phi Delta Gamma and truly enjoy the fellowship.
College Freshman,4,I am in an rigorous engineering program but have good professors.
College Sophomore,4,The majority of the school is a minority.  There are also a large variation of religious and sexual orientations.
College Sophomore,4,"Intramurals are a huge part of the sports on campus, and our sports do very well for a small school."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Work hard, play hard applies here...but too hard."
College Freshman,2,It's a division three college and the performance and turnout of the sports teams reflect that.
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, the food isn't up to par with any standards, especially considering how much it costs to go to the school. There aren't a lot of options and choices on campus. I'd rather go out and eat, but that costs so much more."
College Freshman,2,I only received information after applying and filling out the FAFSA.  I received some automatic academic scholarship but didn't get any prior information on applying for additional scholarships.
College Freshman,2,Terre Haute is a boring place
College Freshman,2,"You better have a friend with a car, or you can't go anywhere"
College Freshman,2,"Most folks are too busy with school to care about sports, however the sports facilities are surprisingly excellent"
College Freshman,2,"The winter is is cruel, but the grounds keeping staff make in manageable."
College Freshman,2,"For living in a dorm with no AC, I feel like I'm being ripped off, but the Roomate choosing system is excellent, as is the location"
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is crazy. It's incredibly fickle. It can be hot and sunny one day, and cloudy and cold the next. It's hard for me to predict, even after checking weather reports. Luckily, my roommate has lived in Indiana his whole life, and provides a much more accurate forecast, so even if I can't trust a news site, I can always rely on my roommate's prediction."
College Senior,2,Limited scholarships cover about 1/2 of your tuition.
College Junior,2,"You get sick of the food here pretty quickly.  The ARA has a lot of choices, but they aren't always the best.  Some days are really good, but most are just average.  There is a Subway and a Noble Roman's on campus.  There are also a few coffee shops where you can also get premade sandwiches and stuff like that."
College Sophomore,2,Not Much to Do Off Campus â€“ There are not really very many community events in terre haute but The campus activities are great and there are so many things to do that you never have to leave!
College Sophomore,2,"Good Odds, Odd Goods â€“ At Rose-Hulman there is a saying for the girls: The goods are odd, but the odds are good. This saying is an understatement. Men at Rose-Hulman are in general less attractive then the avergae, and their personalities are on average far outside the norm. After a bit of time here, a girl's idea of what's normal and what's attractive are skewed to find the less attractive more so. A summer spent away reopens the eyes only for the process to be repeated."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is primarily white, but other races are entirely accepted. The campus is fairly accepting as a whole."
Sophomore,1,"We're a STEM school with an emphasis on hands-on learning. COVID-19 did not make that easy. Professors tried their best, but it was too much with too little time."
Freshman,1,"Rose is ridiculously expensive, ridiculously hard, and ridiculously boring. Classes are so frustrating I have about 2 mental breakdowns a week, and I almost broke my hand punching a wall after a calc test. Profs make the classes overcomplicated for no reason. Kids here are all very antisocial and weird, very hard to make friends. Party life here is nonexistent. Stay far away."
Niche User,1,"I really cannot express how miserable I was at this Rose-Hulman.  Located in  the middle-of-nowhere the novelty of not having to lock your door wears off pretty quickly.  Classwork is akin to hazing, some profs decline to offer office hours.  I did fine, academically, the year I stayed there but that was because there was flat out nothing to do unless you are part of a sports team or go greek. It's nerdy for sure one kid galloping around campus all year (?) and the nerf assassin club is serious.  Get hit with one of the darts and they've rigged it so you feel it and I was just a bystander.  I transferred to a university in a large metropolis with public transit offerings and am soooooo much happier.  Grads at my new school also boast a higher starting salary than at Rose."
College Junior,1,Nothing to do and a lot of red necks.
College Junior,1,"The fine system is pretty dumb.  Public safety jumps at any chance to ticket you, even if the car isnt registered to a Rose student.

Pakring could be extended because its very crowded."
College Freshman,1,"Rather Secluded â€“ For the most part, one is going to need at least a bike or motorcycle to get anywhere into town for something. There's virtually no public transportation or ZipCars (TM) here. Many people end up having to carpool whenever possible."
College Freshman,1,there's really not much to expect with the already horribly skewed gender ratio. Most people come here with long-distance relationships in hand.
College Freshman,1,"Still Needs Work â€“ Given its location in Indiana, this area does not attract as many students as much as the East/West coasts do. They're still working on it, but I don't think it's really much of a priority. Academics before diversity, I guess?"

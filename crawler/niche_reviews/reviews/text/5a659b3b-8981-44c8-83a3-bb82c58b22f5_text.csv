Sophomore,5,"This is an awesome school!! the only reason I'm not there is because I wanted to finish my degree earlier than possible at this University. Because this is a Christian school there are  mandatory faith based courses.
I plan to work on my next degree at this university"
Senior,5,"This is my third year and the staff and administration has handled any question, concern, or issue I had in s timely manner and with diligence. The professors are helpful and are dedicated to education. Whenever I have had tough conversations with my professors we find a resolution we both can agree upon."
College Junior,5,Professors work with us to find and internship that suits us and then to help us find a job that we will thrive in. We have a vast alumni network that greatly supports the university in prayer and monetarily. We have many opportunities where we can meat with representatives from ministries and employers and discuss with them what they have to present to us and what we as students can do to fulfill their needs.
College Junior,5,The quality of courses and professors at LCU is phenomenal. Our professors are highly trained in their topics and many of them have graduated from well know universities. We have a vast variety of courses offered to equip us to become life long learners and global difference makers. Our student to teacher ratio is really good because we are a smaller University. This makes our professors easily accessible and makes class run very smoothly.
College Junior,5,"LCU is a very small campus so it is very easy to know what is going on on the grounds. You cannot enter any dorm without a student ID that you have to scan and the doors to classrooms, buildings and offices are locked at night and unlocked in the morning. Crime is very little to non-existent on campus as we are a Christian University."
College Junior,5,"The girls dorm at LCU is pretty new therefore it is really nice. We have a kitchen, laundry room, living room and work out room on each floor and each wing has its own community room. They provide us with all of our furniture which is really convenient as well as durable. The community room and living rooms provide a great place to have social gatherings, play games or watch movies. The cost is definitely worth it to be part of such an awesome community within the dorm. The housing process isn't a hassle at all as most of it is taken care of by our dorm mom. With LCU there is no ""worst option"" as they always strive to provide us with the best."
College Junior,5,"While we may not be the top ranked school in sports, our athletes have stellar attitudes on and off the court. As a christian school, we strive in everything we do, including sports, to show Christ in our actions, reactions and words. The school community loves to watch games and cheer on the LCU Red Lions. Our sports teams ALWAYS pray, win or lose with the opposing team regardless if that team is from a Christian or secular college. We have a wonderful gym, field house, soccer field, baseball diamond and work out facility that provides an atmosphere to have fun in no matter the purpose of it's use. School spirit is something students enjoy to take part in, it is always fun to gather as a student community all decked out in our LCU apparel to cheer our classmates on."
College Junior,5,"There is not a single thing that I don't like about Lincoln Christian University. Our professors take the time to immerse themselves in what they are teaching and make sure that we understand it. As students, we can talk to our professors not only about classes, but anything else in our lives. They keep an open door to us in their homes and offices always ready to lend a helping hand. Professors at LCU are definitely dedicated to creating life long learners and global difference makers which I believe is something that makes LCU unique. We have students all over the world that chose to commit their lives to serving Jesus Christ while at LCU. LCU prepares us to go out on the mission field no matter what occupation we choose. Whether we go to school for teaching, psychology, nursing, business, missions, etc. we are greatly equipped to serve and make an impact for Christ. Professors take time to listen to your dreams and what the Lord is calling you to do and then they help you put those things into action and make them a reality!"
College Sophomore,5,There is little to no alcohol or drug use on campus.
College Junior,5,"I just transferred here, so I have yet to attend a class, but I already love the staff and how helpful and eager they are to have me attend."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is great! Amazing professors.
College Sophomore,5,Great material with a focus on God as well.
College Sophomore,5,Just trying to keep everyone on the right path
College Sophomore,5,Parking is not an issue at all.  The parking is close to dorms and buildings but there is no need to drive from building to building.  All of the buildings are close enough to walk from the dorms.
College Sophomore,5,"The workload at LCU is hefty, but rewarding at the same time.  The professors are passionate in their teaching and their willingness to be available for students is admirable.  "
College Sophomore,5,Completely safe.  I have no fears or concerns about my safety.
College Sophomore,5,"The community aspect of LCU is one of the best highlights about the school.  There is a gym which has a cardio room and weight room which are both always available to students.  Along with the gym there is a field house which is available to students.  The warehouse would best be described as the student hangout.  It has a coffee shop and is simply a great place to hangout and play games or do homework.  Personally, most of my time is spent in the warehouse."
College Junior,5,"I feel I am getting an exceptional education here.  I am an intercultural studies major, and many of my professors have been outside of the country, and teach both from experience from the ministry field, as well as from academic knowledge.  They are genuine about their teaching, and I learn so much from them.  I have had several opportunities to get connected with other ministries, as well as gain experience by going on trips, and serving local ministries."
College Junior,5,The curriculum is top notch.  The professors are very knowledgeable and will help you to understand the course topics.  They give great feed back to help you to better your work and papers.
College Student,5,"No Need for on-Campus Transport â€“ The campus is relatively small.  You would never need on campus transportation.  If you want to get to campus, you can take the Amtrak from St. Louis or Chicago to the Lincoln area.  Very nice"
Graduate Student,4,"Well, I am impressed by the high level of teaching at LCU.  I am disappointed that one of the 3 professors left last year because I really enjoyed her teaching style.  Each professor is very different, and I have to change my learning strategy with each professor.  The program consists of all required courses as 8 week night or online classes.  2 elective classes must be chosen as a concentration, and those are 1 week intensive courses.  The setup allows all full-time individuals to take these courses."
Junior,4,I love the community aspect of this University. Everyone is friendly and cares about you. I think that the Cafe could really improve but the Warehouse Coffee Shop is amazing!
College Sophomore,4,There are many international students here that become very involved in the community.
College Sophomore,4,This is a very safe environment and there is very little to worry about. Campus crime basically does not even exist and there are many safety services. It is a safe place to be.
College Sophomore,4,"I reviewed the girls dorm, which was fairly new and in great condition. The boys dorm however was in poor condition. Mold and mildew could be found on almost every floor in the rooms and bathrooms as well. The rooms are also quite a bit smaller in the boys dorm and there is one lobby, instead of three in the girls dorm."
College Freshman,4,Some of the best experiences have been the community events. Our school is unique because it is a Christian campus and environment. If I could do it all over I would still choose Lincoln because the both the professors and the rest of the staff are always encouraging.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There is an amazing community of students and professors at LCU, if you make the effort to get plugged in. The classes will shape you professionally, spiritually, and personally."
College Sophomore,4,Everything is pretty good to me
College Sophomore,4,"I only need to visit the campus if I want to attend a function. However, I have not had any incidences where crime was an issue."
College Sophomore,4,"Taking an online program can be challenging but it motivates me to be more responsible. As the  program's mission is to grow student leaders, the online studies is a great way to kick off that goal by instilling practices that are indicative of responsible, mature leaders."
College Sophomore,4,LCU is fairly diverse.  LCU has a Chinese Institute which creates a more diverse environment.  I would say that most people feel accepted.
College Sophomore,4,There is no drug scene at LCU.  Students sign a covenant agreeing that they will not participate in illicit drug use.
College Sophomore,4,"Lincoln Christian University is a campus full of students trying to live a life for God.  For the most part everyone is social and welcoming.  I would say that everyone's looks are unique and their interests are as well.  When it comes to social lives, students have the choice to be very social but they can also choose to be a recluse.  Essentially, each student decides for themself what kind of social life they are going to have.  Relationships are rampant at LCU as I am sure most Christian schools are.  For anyone coming to LCU I would caution them to not rush into a relationship (it is a SMALL campus), but if the right person is there follow God's lead."
College Senior,4,"They are good in the computer labs, sometimes the internet at lincoln sucks"
College Junior,4,"We have three sports for each gender. We are a small campus, and our teams other than guys basketball, and women's volleyball are not the greatest, but students are pretty supportive.  I personally have been involved in soccer, and I just love the Christ-centered community of the team.  I think we have a great athletic program in the sense of sportsmanship, and showing positive, and Christ-like attitudes no matter what the outcome."
College Junior,4,"Our campus is pretty strict, but I think it's a good policy because we are a ministry based school.  We have a student covenant that has policies such as no alcohol, sex, drugs, etc. And I agree with most of the restrictions the school places on the students, mainly because if we were involved in those things, not only would it hinder our academic ability, but it would moreover hinder our relationship with Christ, and serving others."
College Junior,4,"Lincoln is a fairly small town, but coming from a small town myself, it is perfect.  I mean, having a wal mart and a grocery store in the same town is kind of a big deal, and is also convenient.  Overall, the local people I have ran into are rather polite, and I think it's a great community to be in.  Even though the community is small, I love the bond our campus has, and with the amount of outreach events we do, we get opportunities to venture out to the cities around us.  We are close to Springfield, Peoria, and Bloomington, which are all no longer than 45 minutes away. I love it here."
College Junior,4,I am in the online Intercultural Studies Master's program.  The program is phenomenal.  The content of the classes is direct and very pertinent.  The reading load is heavy since it's an online program but it isn't busy work.
College Junior,4,The financial aid process is clearly stated and the office staff is extremely helpful and quick to respond to emails and inquiries.
College Sophomore,4,People on the Team Are Encouraging â€“ I am on the Girls' Soccer team and they are so encouraging. We are not the best nor are we a major focus of the school but we use our sport as a way to grow with God and to pray with people from other schools.
Alum,2,"Lincoln Christian University is a good college if you are looking for a small campus where everyone knows one another, strict rules, and unsuccessful athletic programs. It was good for my spiritual life, but that is all."
College Sophomore,2,"The work load is unattainable and the professors expect way too much from students that could be achieved. Pushing students to their goals is acceptable and often expected, but this school goes too far and many students attain much lower GPAs because the academia is too much to handle."
College Sophomore,2,"The Gen-Ed requirements are quite extensive and offer a lot of specific Bible knowledge, but do not really help with studying the Bible and being a better Christian. As a psych major, the TA and program manager for Psychology is not the greatest and are often unfair in the grading process, as well as disorganized and unhelpful. There is also a lot of busy work for the core requirements, but I felt that I did not learn much. I had little to no time for extracurriculars because of the amount of homework required. The current science professor is also unqualified as far as I am concerned to be teaching. I honestly did not learn anything from being in her classes and labs."
College Sophomore,2,"While there are some local restaurants in Lincoln which are great, there are mainly fast food restaurants.  The only late night options (after 12) consists of McDonald's (drive thru only) and Steak and Shake.  Cost is consistent with fast food prices."
College Sophomore,2,Most People Have to Live on Campus â€“ The school requires students to live on campus until they are a certain age. The good thing about being on campus though is that the price for eating the caf. food is built into room and board so there are no meal plans unless you live off campus. People who can live off campus are married couples and people who are 24 (i think) and older. They do offer student appartments so there are some available options and there are appartments in town.
College Sophomore,2,There is nothing except Steak 'n Shake.
Alum,1,"Meh. This is my alma mater.  Both my husband and I regret attending here.  We are true cynics after attending this school.  We are currently trying to heal from that.  Basically, it's the biggest regret of our adult lives.  But alas, those who are favored are greatly praised and go on to be successful and true Christian's of this world."
Junior,1,"The foods is terrible. There is nothing to do on campus. It is a safe campus. There is not a lot to do in town unless you go to Bloomington.
The dorms are old and dirty before you even move in."
College Sophomore,1,"There is little to no night life, except for the occasional drinking party, but there are restrictions on curfew and all students are under a code of conduct."
College Sophomore,1,"There are no parties really, but the open dorms nights can become a little chaotic and rowdy."

Freshman,5,"What I like about Central Methodist University is that the students and teachers on campus are super nice with everyone and guide students to the right direction in life, not just in the classroom."
Sophomore,5,"I am a current student at Central and I absolutely love it. The faculty and staff are so understanding and want you to succeed and only want what is best for you. One thing that I would like to see changed though is the price of tuition. It is extremely expensive, and while it is most definitely worth it, it would be nice to see a tuition lock and not have the tuition go up astronomically each school year."
Freshman,5,"I personally have never took online classes, but I know so many students that love it ! When it comes to having help and access to notes and one on one time the professors and the college is right on it ! I’ve never personally heard anyone complain or talk down on Central Methodist’s online classes."
Freshman,5,"The first time I went Central Methodist University  was for a soccer ID camp, to meet the coaches and tour the college. Let me just say that everything about this college is amazing the coaches, the administrators, professors, and amazing facilities to help you throughout your education. CMU has dedicated professionals and workers that only do for their students ! I could never find anything I would change about this college because it’s perfect the way it is. I am very blessed to go to a college I know that is well suited and dedicated to make sure I am comfortable in my new home ! I can not express how much I love my school and it’s positive atmosphere, I never have to worry about not getting help in class or on the field because CMU students have access to free tutors and amazing trainers; I am so excited for year !!!"
Sophomore,5,I love the size of the school and how the teachers interact with the students. They make sure each student is set up for success.
Sophomore,5,The teachers were really prompt about the assignments and always sending out reminders to make sure you didn’t forget to do the assignment.
Sophomore,5,I love the professors in my major.  I enjoy the freedom of living away from home in a safe environment.
Freshman,5,"They accommodate very well for people of all ages, sexes, religion, etc. 

I personally love Central Methodist because they have the program that I got one of my main scholarships for which is esports and they are designing my curriculum around the fact that when I graduate I want to immediately go into coaching a sport at a pro scene and that's something a lot of people aren't able to say. 

After classes, I get to coach their collegiate Overwatch team to become one of the best in our division to get more scholarships and become the very best out of all the schools. 

I firmly believe that I can make a difference inside this school and this school is making a difference for me."
Freshman,5,I loved how well-developed the connections between students and professors are. You truly never feel unable to talk or ask questions about anything in any of the classes.
Freshman,5,I will be going to this college in the fall of 2019 to play baseball and study Exercise Science.  I have been to a baseball showcase and love the field and took a visit to talk about my scholarship for playing baseball.
Sophomore,5,"As someone who has just finished my first year at CMU I can firmly say that I love this school. A significant amount of my involvement is in the music department despite the fact that I'm not a music major, and that availability is part of the reason I wanted to go to CMU in the first place. The second biggest thing that's incredible about CMU is the faculty. A small liberal arts college like CMU is the ideal place to get real connections with faculty. How often in college do you have BBQs at your professor's house? The last thing that's incredible about CMU is the sense of community. Because it's easy to be involved in a lot of things it's easy to know a lot of people, and you'll never walk to class without seeing someone you know, which makes the transition to college a lot easier. I won't say you'll never be homesick, but I found that I got over it a lot faster than my friends at other schools."
Freshman,5,"I loved the atmosphere, everyone was very helpful and the food was great! Being apart of the football team is very exciting. The people are all very friendly and I enjoying the feeling of being welcome as soon as you arrive on campus."
Niche User,5,"I love the atmosphere of CMU and how homey it is. I have visited there many times and each and every time, everyone is very welcoming and kind no matter what the situation! Both students and professors are willing to give a helping hand"
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at CMU and this first year will be coming to a close quite soon. I love this university and all of the people I have met, both faculty and students. I plan to attend all four years of my college career here and earn a Bachelor's Degree in Marine Biology, which this is the best Marine Biology school in the Midwest. The campus here is incredible and the professors are extremely helpful and never want you to fail. Most of my professors offer to stay later after their office and class hours just to do review sessions with their classes before taking an exam, midterm, or final. If you want a small school where all of your professors know your name and your largest class is about 50 students then I highly recommend checking out CMU."
Sophomore,5,"Central Methodist University is located in a small town called Fayette Missouri. The campus is beautiful especially during spring and summer. Each professor is dedicated to the ultimate success of the students, and do whatever possible to make sure that these students understand what they need to do to reach for that success. Although the school is located in a small town, the school holds fun activities such as taking people who sign up to the movies, baseball game, etc. or even ice cream socials and more that keep the people attending CMU involved and always meeting new people. The dorms are nice and provide everything you need to add on to the college experience. The majority of the school are athletes, and the stands are always packed and active when we are supporting each other in hopes of a win for the Eagles!  I've enjoyed the students, professor, coaches, and the environment and I'm sure that you will too!"
Freshman,5,"I have had a wonderful experience at Central Methodist University so far. Everyone on campus is friendly and welcoming, the professors are willing to work with students whenever possible, and my classmates carry a wonderful reputation and are a joy to talk to. I always have a group to sit by in the cafeteria, and I have a couple of close friends whom I hang out with and talk to frequently. My first roommate is the only roommate I will need; we have so much in common, and I look forward to sharing a room with her for the next few years. I have moved over two hours away from home to spend my first semester in a dorm on campus, and I have felt welcome there, even though I am in a completely different environment."
Sophomore,5,"The professors care about you! The classes are not the easiest, but if you show effort in class then the professors will help you succeed. Everyone on campus is super friendly!"
Alum,5,Fayette is a small town with great people. It is a place you can walk home and not look over your shoulder. CMU was a great community that has so much to offer and always an event to attend. 
College Freshman,5,I am a freshman but I have fallen in love with this place already!
College Sophomore,5,I love the school and believe it has been an amazing fit for me! There is always something to do and everyone is so nice. No matter where you are you always see a friendly face just waiting to say hi.
College Sophomore,5,Central Methodist is very small and I love that! I know everyone on campus and all my professors know me by name.
College Senior,5,I really enjoy the small class size and the freedom of religion. The professors are amazing!!  I am an  online student if I have a question regarding studies it usually needs a response in a timely manner. They are quick to get back to me and even hand out their home phone numbers incase I need to comunicate on weekends. If I am stumped they have been very good and patient when it comes to explaing the assignment.
College Sophomore,5,I love being at CMU. It is small and all of the students here are pretty friendly. It's awesome being able to walk across campus and being able to say that I know over half of the students I walk past.
College Sophomore,5,"We commonly have job fairs to help students find jobs, we also have a lot of internships opportunities around."
College Sophomore,5,I wish that non-Greeks would not choose to be indifferent to Greek life. No one in Greek life thinks they're better than others. We honestly just want everyone to get along. It is frustrating for them to talk smack on us and then expect us to throw parties for them to attend.
College Freshman,5,I can't wait to be old enough to move off campus. I like living on campus but I've lived alone for so long I'd really like to have my own place again.
College Freshman,5,I like most of them.
College Freshman,5,There is always something going on off campus. WE have a dry campus though so we don't have fraternity houses on campus or anything.
College Freshman,5,I'm not a picky eater so a daily buffet never upsets me!
College Freshman,5,I personally love living on campus. My roommate is the best and our room is plenty spacious for the both of us.
College Freshman,5,All students are held to a high standard and are responsible.
College Freshman,5,"Fayette is a beautiful and rich town, even in the architect of the college, you see it's truly historic background."
College Freshman,5,"Nothing but kind and wholesome people, I've yet to meet anyone that wasn't kind or respectful enough to help you out."
College Junior,5,Love the majority of my professors.
College Sophomore,5,There are many different places to hang out and enjoy yourself.
College Sophomore,5,There is always a huge crowd for each game.
College Junior,5,I had an athletic scholarship that was very helpful.  There are scholarships that the school gives that can be helpful.
College Junior,5,Off campus dining has a vast variety of options available to anyone and everyone from fast food to oriental restaurants.
College Junior,5,It is a very small campus which allows a lot of interacting between students and teachers. The college has a great atmosphere. Everyone seems very friendly.
College Freshman,5,I don't live off campus but they have nice homes for good prices and very close to school.
Freshman,4,I Only have one online classroom and it is great! The professor is very understanding and knows the difficulty on being on zoom calls are morning. We all as a class work together to get things done smooth and efficient.
Sophomore,4,"The online experience, while not as rewarding as in seat classes, is still a great one. I digital university aspect of the college is nice and really helped when it came to the corona virus pandemic"
Junior,4,All the staff is extremely friendly and are always willing to help you in anyway. The class sizes are small so the professor actually knows who you are. The professors are amazing and help you no matter what. The living isn't the best but its ok with how old the school is.
Junior,4,Its depends on how well the professor knows how to work Mycmu which is our program we use for our grades and assignments. We all get an iPad Pro which is really nice.
Sophomore,4,"Due to the recent covid pandemic CMU had to change all classes online. Being an international student in a different time zone this was daunting at first, but thanks to the digitalU program and all students having access to an iPad, I found it relatively seamless and minimal stress. My professors were amazing, extremely understanding and did their best to make it work for their students"
Sophomore,4,"The best part of CMU is how the professors take the time to get to know you as a person, as well as a learner, they strive to find the best way for you to learn and perform at your best. The school is small meaning you know everyone and everyone is super friendly and supportive. Caf food isn’t the greatest but it’s manageable."
Junior,4,I would really like them to use Moodle i stead of their intranet. With Moodle everything is centralized in one easy location no tabs necessary.
Freshman,4,"CMU is a great school. I live in Holt hall, and it's really nice! The campus is so pretty, and it's small. A small campus is nice because A) it isn't a far walk across campus, and it takes me like 5 minutes at the most to get to my classes, and B) it's easy to get to know people, and professors will know your name. The food is cafeteria food, of course it's not the greatest, but it's definitely better than highschool food!"
Niche User,4,I loved how Central Methodist offers many options to students who are still in high school and allows them to dual enroll and to get ahead in your college career
Niche User,4,"I am an online student with Central Methodist University. I have enjoyed the program. The online program has an entry course for online students to become familiar with the online program, which was very helpful and informative. The professors that I have worked with are easily available for questions and concerns."
Junior,4,Many things to get involved with. The professors are incredible and help as much as they can. Many are very active in the university.
Sophomore,4,"I like that the campus is small and you can walk to all classes.  The staff is friendly and professional and always willing to help or find the appropriate office/staff to assist.  The food can be really good but not always.  There are so many activities to be involved in even if your not an athlete!  Overall the town of Fayette is small with few eating, off campus activities but it is centrally located so it is just a short drive to the mall, etc.  Tuition is about 30K per year a little high but they work with students to find scholarships, grants, etc to help lower the cost.  The dorms are old and some outdated but there is construction on campus to update facilities."
Freshman,4,"Good small university. If you are looking for a busy town with loads of things to do, do not apply to CMU, because Fayette is very small and relaxing."
Freshman,4,The campus makes it easier for you to have automatic friends and that makes the experience easier and a lot of fun. Parties are lit too and the campus gives you opportunities but it’s up to you to take advantage of those
Freshman,4,I like how attentive they are. Someone is always willing to help or get you to the right person to answer your questions.
Sophomore,4,I like how cozy the college the campus feels and how driven the staff is to help you succeed. I do wish there was more freedom on campus but there's a reason its considered one of the safest colleges in the US
Junior,4,"One thing I liked about central Methodist university is there professors, they focus on every students needs individual and would do anything to help us succeed. What I liked least is the food , the food could be way better and tuition cost is also way to much for what's provided on campus."
Freshman,4,"I love this school. I play soccer here and I it is a very good program. Majoring in both math and physics is not easy but all of the professors are very helpful and will support you. Small school, small town, but that just means you stick out more. "
Sophomore,4,"Great college, older dorms.  The student athlete experience is great and the professors work with your sport schedule."
College Freshman,4,I did not rush my freshman year but I know a lot of people who did and really enjoy it.
College Freshman,4,Most sports at this school are doing very well. I am here for baseball and they just came off their best season ever.
College Senior,4,"This is my first semester here and it's online this summer so I don't have a lot of experience meeting people in person, however, they seem very friendly and hard working based on our discussion forums. The teacher are also extremely knowledgeable."
College Freshman,4,I always feel safe walking through the campus at night. A lot of people intake alcohol so that is kind of scary.
College Freshman,4,The student center has a place where it works with students to fill out applications and have mock interviews for the future.
College Freshman,4,the class sizes are small so it is easier to meet people and ask the professor questions in class.
College Freshman,4,"I really like having a half bathroom with my room. Also, the rooms are decently sized and have good closet space."
College Freshman,4,"Many students are athletes so everyone cheers for one another. The coaches are very biased and choose favorites, that is a downfall."
College Freshman,4,"I like my school because all of the people who work here are friendly and helpful. Also, most of the students are athletes so we are all a lot alike."
College Freshman,4,Athletics is a very important and popular aspect of campus life at Central Methodist University.
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy attending Central Methodist University and my first semester on campus went better than I expected it to go.
College Sophomore,4,Academics here are great. You really must learn to buckle down in order to pass some classes.
College Sophomore,4,"The professor for my field of study are pretty great. They work with you to make sure you succeed. I have had an excellent time with professors at CMU, they truly care to see their students succeed."
College Sophomore,4,"Most would say that they think the party scene at our school is lame. Though, I have a friend who goes to University of Missouri, and she says she prefers coming to CMU to party. The people are way more personable and fun she says."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel safe at CMU, and our campus security is very strict on rules of our handbooks. Which I'm glad about, because I know they do this in order to keep us safe and in order."
College Sophomore,4,"I love going to college at CMU. Though, some usually complain about living in the dorms, the only complaint I have are the rules and prices of Room and Board. At CMU you are not allowed to live off campus until you are 21, so most only are able to live off campus at most for 2 years. Myself, I will only have the opportunity to live off campus my senior year. This is difficult because tuition at CMU is high, and Room and Board is quite pricey as well. I already feel like I could be drowning in student loan debt already, and knowing that I could be cutting some of that cost by almost $4,000 by living off campus can be quite unsettling. Besides this factor though, I really do enjoy going to school at Central Methodist University."
College Freshman,4,"The only issue is that if you qualify for a new scholarship, but you are enrolled, you cannot receive the scholarship."
College Freshman,4,The parties go for a long time and are actually safe because the owners of the houses are reliable.
College Freshman,4,"No system is perfect, but the one on campus seems to work very well. There have been no infractions in the past two years of sexual assault."
College Freshman,4,"I've been in worse places, but the dorms leave a bit to imagine. All white walls, which is not ideal for me."
College Freshman,4,"Each restaurant is great and very worthwhile, more healthy options opposed to fast food."
College Freshman,4,"Every person I've dealt with has been kind, caring and helpful."
College Freshman,4,"I personally am not an athlete, but I'd say each Eagle athlete and athletic advisor have a great agenda. They recognize the importance of academics equally as much as athletics."
College Junior,4,"Great instructors, great environment. Terrible price."
College Junior,4,Very Helpful empoyees in the department.
College Junior,4,The houses here are old but tend to be well kept. The prices are cheap as well.
College Junior,4,I love the Greek life here. There is a diverse selection to choose from.
College Junior,4,I wish we would have cameras in stairwells but other than that the security is great.
College Junior,4,There are different ethnic heritage and international students and we are fairly equal with boys and girls.
College Sophomore,4,The opportunities are great with the nursing program. I will be able to do clinical very easily with help from the teachers. Although there is a huge work load it can be done.
College Sophomore,4,The academic programs are difficult but can be achieved by giving a lot of effort.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is so friendly and is always willing to help in any way they can.
College Junior,4,The maintenance crew on campus is absolutely wonderful and do a great job with keeping up with the weather.
College Junior,4,"I think the standards are very high for the nursing program and will make its students better nurses.  If I could do it all over again, I would.  I would like to be a labor and delivery nurse and I do have concerns about finding a job."
College Junior,4,There are many computers on campus that are available to students and there continues to be more popping up everywhere.
College Junior,4,"I think most of the professors are wonderful at what they do and truly have a passion for developing young minds and educating us.  Depending on one's major, the expectations are incredibly different.  For example, the nursing program holds much higher standards than the criminal justice program does.  There are available tutors for most subjects on campus and the professors usually love to answer questions and assist in any way they can."
College Freshman,4,There usually isn't an issue with safety on campus. People feel pretty secure walking around by themselves and there is rarely any kind of crime on campus.
College Freshman,4,"There are more than enough computers on campus, so owning one is not really necessary. There is high speed wireless internet. Each student is also given a certain amount of free printing, which is usually more than enough."
College Freshman,4,"There is a small percentage of students that participate in drugs on campus, and the ones that do aren't very noticeable."
College Freshman,4,I like how close the dorms are to other buildings on campus. The dorms are always secure and safe. The staff does a great job at keeping everything clean and the rooms are clean and nice to live in.
College Freshman,4,There are a large number of students from foreign countries so therefore there are many different races on our campus. For the most part all the students and teachers accept the diversity of our campus. There are lots of different sexual orientations and political beliefs which also have been accepted.
College Sophomore,2,"I often am very disappointed in eating at the campus cafeteria. For the amount the students pay it is definitely not up to par. Most meat their can be quite questioning on whether we can eat it. And most times we only have ""good"" food when our Board of Trustees are visiting or when we have recruitment days for sports students. This is unsettling in the fact that it shows that the school really only cares to impress the Board of Trustees, who wouldn't even be there if it weren't for us students. This college is running due to the high tuition that we pay, so I believe we should have actual food that nourishes our bodies if we are paying to eat it."
College Freshman,2,You can only eat in the dinning hall certain times of the day. There not many variety of foods.
College Junior,2,Very slow internet throughout campus.
College Junior,2,You know who the pot smokers are and you can always find a party and someone to provide alcohol.
College Junior,2,You know when sports are going on but there is not a big to do about it.
College Junior,2,"Unless you have your own car, or a friend with one, you can't go anywhere outside of the city limits."
College Junior,2,"There isn't much to do in our town due to the fact that it is so small.  However, there is a lake that we attend frequently and we very much enjoy that."
College Freshman,2,There aren't enough parking spaces for the number of parking tags that they give out. The parking lots are also very far away from campus. People get tickets for ridiculous reasons and there isn't a lot they can do about it.
College Freshman,2,Weather changes drastically from day to day. It makes people sick and often make the sidewalks and roads unusable.
College Freshman,2,Greek life is usually the source of problems on campus. There is no special Greek housing available.
College Freshman,2,"There is very little to do in the town of Fayette. Everyone goes to Columbia for fun, so there is little to no nightlife at Central Methodist."
College Sophomore,2,the dorms are old. Most dont have air conditioning. The heaters sound like someone is beating the pipes with a hammer. You cant control the heaters so it gets very hot and i have to keep my window open in the winter. If the building does have an elevator it doesnt work very well.
College Sophomore,2,There are never any parking spots during the week. People get tickets beacuse they have to park in somewhere there not suppose to becuase there were no open spots. You deffinintely need a car on campus because you are so far away from everything and need to get out of this town.
College Sophomore,2,I feel like my degree program is extramly hard. For the most part the professors are good and helpful but others are not able to teach.
College Freshman,2,The meals in the dining hall are decent sometimes but most of the time they are average and there aren't very many options.
College Freshman,2,Greek life here is not a very big part of the campus experience. Most of the students are so busy with classes and athletics that they don't have time to join a fraternity or sorority.
College Freshman,2,"Out here there isn't really a lot of places where you can get a job at just because of how small the town is. All the jobs have mostly been taken. So my plan on getting a job, is to wait tell I get home over summer, and try and find a job in the morning and evening to make a good amount of money."
College Freshman,2,I would have took a visit to the school before I made a final decision.
College Freshman,2,"There are some shuttle buses we use for sports or other school activities. Nothing fancy, but I'm glad we at least have them."
College Junior,2,"A Little Boring – When moving to Fayette, you do not know a lot of people. The good thing about this being a little school is that you make new friends fast and most of them are very trusting and fun. The town however isn't the funnest for college life. During the beginning of the school year and the middle of the year you can find a lot of small group parties to go to but its either a hit or miss. In the town though, there are only 2 bars one in which is more for bikers. The closest big town is Columbia, in which you can take 30 minutes to get to and can always find something going on here. As for Fayette though, there is almost no night scene here except for that in a apartment or rental house. It can be fun if you are used to a small town feeling but if you are from a larger city Fayette doesn't have much to offer."
Senior,1,This school is about the money not the student. I should graduate in may 2018 but I am being denied that opportunity because they have found a way to make me fork out more money. They told me to pay for some credits that they would except from my job. Once I paid for them they told me they can no longer except them and that I need to take more classes. They truly are scam artist and if you decide to go with this school I wish you the best of luck.
College Freshman,1,"I was promised a full ride after my outside scholarships came in, but they canceled out any scholarships from the school when my outside scholarships came in. I'm still dealing with the financial aid office. They also made me claim my parents income when I've lived alone for 2 years with no support from my parents. The United States declared me independent, but my school decided they could over rule that so I didn't get any financial aid but my parents certainly didn't pay a dime toward my college."
College Junior,1,"There is no transportation provided to the students yet there might not be a need.  However, parking is absolutely awful.  There are never parking spots, thus, paying for a parking pass is a waste."
College Freshman,1,There are less than ten places to eat off campus in Fayette and none of them are open past ten in the evening. The cost is pretty average and so is the quality.
College Sophomore,1,There are only two fast food places that close at 10PM and a few small town restraunts that close early. The only place to get food late at night is the gas station.
College Student,1,zero public transportation besides if you're going to a school sanctioned event.
College Senior,1,There are a few houses that a student can rent but to my knowledge the school does not own any property for living off of campus.
College Freshman,1,The parking on Central Methodist campus is horrible. There are not enough parking spaces available for the number of students here. Everyone fights over parking.

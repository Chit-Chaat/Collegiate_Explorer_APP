Senior,5,"Like every other school in the country, Barton moved to online learning due to Covid-19. My professors were extremely patient, understanding, and caring during this sudden change in our lives. My professors made themselves available anytime we needed them. They would FaceTime, Zoom, E-mail, etc.. My professors made it easy to find our resources online, and were very organized with our learning and objectives."
Freshman,5,Barton College is a safe place to live. It is a wonderful place to make friends and learn and study.
Freshman,5,"I just started my Freshman year in August 2019. So far, I've really enjoyed it although, some of the teachers aren't that cooperative when you really need it. The campus is great - it's small, but not too small, and very visually pleasing. The location also isn't too far from Raleigh or Greenville, as it's right in the middle almost so you can go to the cities on the weekends!"
Freshman,5,"I will be an incoming freshman this fall at Barton College and based off of the few couple visits I've had, I am loving it already. The campus is very well taken care of and the thing that caught my eye the most was the overall attitude of the employees and administrators on campus. They were willing to help me as soon as I stepped on campus and being that this is a smaller private college, that is something I intended to happen."
Freshman,5,My experience thus far has been very enjoyable. I'm a transfer student and the faculty and students have made feel very comfortable in my choice to transfer to Barton College. The professors are very helpful and they want to help me in succeeding and earning my degree. I'm too far away from home. My family and friends will be able to come and see my participate on the sports team that I play on so that's going to be exciting.
Freshman,5,"What is your overall opinion of this school? 
It is a great campus and the faculty is amazing and very friendly. The people on campus, staff and peers, are always there to help and want to be there. Learning is a priority and the sports program is amazing. They make sure that you will get along with your roommate and that you get into one of the dorms that you wanted to be in."
Niche User,5,"When i went to Barton College, I was on a visit for incoming freshman. I loved every bit of the tour, the guides answered all of the questions I had before touring, not making me part my lips once. It was very informative. The campus is small, but it doesn't feel small because all of the students know each other and the professors seem to care."
Senior,5,Barton has a close community of faculty and students that makes the environment a great one. This is one of the reasons that I enjoy attending Barton.
Niche User,5,Community aspect was amazing. Everyone is involved in everything campus wide. Very very friendly also felt like home
Senior,5,They really care about the students. The professors go above and beyond to ensure the students understand what we are learning. The school has many resources to help with the students that live on campus and those that live off campus.
Freshman,5,"I come from out of state, at Barton they really make it feel like home here. It's amazing! Everyone here is so sweet and welcoming. The professors do actually want to help you. 10/10 recommend."
Sophomore,5,"The Barton Community can be summed up into one word, family. The professors and the staff are the most caring and genuine people I have ever met. They helped me adapt to the North Carolina way of life after transferring from my prior university in West Virginia.  The campus is very diverse having students come from Canada, Spain, Serbia, and even Australia. All the diversity found on campus makes learning in the classroom a one of a kind experience. The education I am receiving at Barton has really put me in a great spot to succeed. I have learned communication and people skills I couldn't have found any where else but Barton College. Barton will forever have a lasting impact on my life and I cannot wait to see what's in store for me these next few years."
Senior,5,My experience at Barton was very family orientated. I came as a transfer student and enrolled in the Social Work program. My advisor and instructors were very hands on in making sure i had everything i needed to be successful with my academics. I currently hold a 4.0 GPA & look forward to returning in the Fall of 2018. Barton College has been a great experience in preparing me for my career as a Social Worker & giving back to the community.
Junior,5,"I love Barton for both its' focus on academics and student support. When I first went on a tour of the campus, I was blown away with how informative and helpful both our guides and orientation leaders were. I knew I wanted to attend this college from the moment I stepped foot on campus. The staff is extremely helpful and want each and every student to succeed. The Financial Aid office was very cooperative in helping with my needs and very thorough in explaining how loans and grants work, and how they will help me in the long run. Overall, I look forward to attending Barton in both the fall and spring semester(s) and can't wait to graduate in two years."
Niche User,5,"Barton College was a very little and quiet college just how I wanted a college to be. Majority of the people at Barton were very friendly and seemed like very people to hang around. Academic wise I liked how the class would be very small so you can have a one on one experience with your teacher. For that was a plus because I need that one on one with my teacher and or professor to achieve my goal to get my degree. The campus is very diverse in my opinion which was weird since it wasn a private college. But I mainly went to visit Barton for a track and field visit. During that visit I felt like Barton would be the place for me in the future and the people around me would also help me achieve my goals in life. Also I wouldn't have as much free time to play around or not get work done because I would either be at practice, studying, or in class."
Sophomore,5,"Still a sophomore at the school. It's a small school, but the amount of 1 on 1 attention you receive from your professors makes it worth while. There is always something to do, you just have to be creative sometimes."
Junior,5,"This college has a wonderful program for adults who are looking to go back to school. It has night, weekend, and online classes that are eight weeks long that fits perfectly into a working adults schedule."
Freshman,5,Barton College is a small community in which you get to know many people from all around the world. It Is an exceptional school with many amazing faculty and students.
Sophomore,5,good atmosphere and very good style of easy living. Life in baritones very slow but at the same time barton allows you to succeed to the best of your ability and also teaches you hot to start your life in the right path.
Freshman,5,Barton College is a place where you feel at home. The people are always excited to help you in any way you need. The students on campus help each other out and never let one another fail. Its not overwhelming and scary.
Freshman,5,"I love the staff and the campus. My instructors always lend a helping hand when possible. I love that Barton College has an open door policy. My peers are wonderful as well. Any question I cannot get to an instructor or administration right away, most of my upper-classed peers help me out. The home feeling I get while staying on campus is phenomenal and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else! Thank you Barton College!"
College Freshman,5,We are on an Army instillation. I'm safe.
Recent Alumnus,5,i have had a private dorm since I was a freshman
College Sophomore,5,Our academic program is the best!! We are encouraged to go above and beyond to pursue our interests.
College Sophomore,5,We are very accepting towards everyone. We even have people from other countries and it makes us feel very diverse because we want to know about their culture.
College Sophomore,5,"Barton wasn't a top choice of mine, but I came to love this school."
College Sophomore,5,This school wants the best for their students. Barton sends out alerts from the career center on any job position.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is very safe and we have alerts on our phone and via email about anything happening on campus.
College Sophomore,5,The Greek life is very helpful in the community! They are very safe and are friendly to everyone they meet.
College Sophomore,5,"I was very scared at first when I came to Barton. But the professors are very understanding and very welcoming. I have made very good friends, even though I am what people would call a wall flower."
College Sophomore,5,"e have onsite police department, and any suspicious behavior is generally reported."
College Sophomore,5,This school wants every student to be successful.  It is also a peaceful environment.  This is a great school to attend for one on one tutoring and support.
College Junior,5,They are big on jobs.
College Junior,5,I love mrs Pittman she was with me every step of the way! she even introduced herself to me at open house
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is friendly and cool to hang out with
College Sophomore,5,The student section at the games are hype
College Sophomore,5,I think the academics provided at Barton are great
College Freshman,5,We always have police on campus.
College Freshman,5,I am apart of the Greek Life at Barton. It's fun and rewarding!
College Junior,5,Barton College is an amazing school to attend . Everyone is so kind and always willing to help. It is just a nice environment to be in . Barton makes me feel as if I am home and I feel absolutely safe son campus.
College Sophomore,5,i love the school i am attending now because it is a small scool where the professors actually know your name and with the open door policy you can easily reach your professors and ask them questions
College Freshman,5,My school from the beginning: I was welcomed by everyone that I came in contact with.  My school answered any questions that I had or still have.  My school is unique because it is a school with only 1100 students.  This makes my class sizes small and my ability to be taught on my level and have questions answered and get one on one with my professor important to me!  I enjoy the atmosphere at my school.  Everyone is friendly and helpful.  It is a great place to be and I would recommend it for anyone!
College Sophomore,5,"I love being a political science major at Barton college. The people in the program are great and so is my advisor. I can not say to much about it because I won't be a sophomore until August, however, what I have learned so far is amazing. Also the workload is very doable so it doesn't stress me out to much and I know this will give me many opportunities."
College Sophomore,5,"I am not associated with a Greek organization at my school, however a lot of my friends are. I find Greek life very important at Barton. They do a lot for the community and for the school. I am really happy with Greek life at my school, and personally, I think we have the best Greeks around."
College Junior,5,"All the faculty in the education department are phenomenal. While the curriculum is challenging and up to date on new teaching styles, I love being in my program and learning everything presented in class."
College Junior,5,Living on campus has just been a wonderful experience for me. Each dorm has its own uniqueness to it and has a variety of students living in each building.
College Junior,5,i absolutely love being in my specific program at my school. The facilities are amazing and are available for helping any student. The curriculum is very flexible and the workload is not heavy but there is a lot of thinking and evaluating involved.
College Junior,5,"The diversity on campus is one of the best around. The campus is filled with everyone of different political/spiritual views, sexual orientation, ethnic diversity, and everyone on campus is very accepting if each and every person around."
College Junior,5,"Our Campus Activities Board organizes a lot of free, fun activities for the students to attend each week. Sports are also a big part of campus entertainment. The whole school usually supports all of the athletics programs when they have home games and away games that aren't too far away."
College Junior,5,Our school is relatively small so people are very amicable and friendly and everyone pretty much knows everyone else.
College Junior,5,"We have very knowledgeable and experienced Business and Mathematics departments at Barton. Our professors are highly educated and have worked in a variety of job fields that some still have connections to to help us with job opportunities. The workload in Accounting, Business, and Mathematics classes can get a little heavy but I feel the intensive, direct learning methods our professors impose on us allow us to gain a more complete knowledge of the subject matter."
College Junior,5,I love the academic environment at my school. We have small class sizes so the professors are very attentive to our individual learning needs and actually get to know us personally. As a result they are more understanding of strenuous circumstances that may affect performance in the classroom and are willing to work with students so that they get the most out of the classes.
College Freshman,5,"When it comes to drugs and alcohol, noone on campus that i hang out with use drugs or alcohol to have a good time. "
College Freshman,5,I think in college most people are mature enough to get along with everyone so I believe most of the time diversity is not an issue on campus.
College Freshman,5,"When they have events near the school, they do have a bus to transfer you if you do not have a car."
College Sophomore,5,"Barton College has a very good atmosphere, is very safe, and has many activities that can be participated in on campus."
College Junior,5,"Wilson has a lot of different restaurants to choose from. We have your everyday McDonald's, Wendy's, Chili's, Olive Garden, Ruby Tuesday, etc. The prices are reasonable and range from around $1-$50 (depending on where you eat). Buffalo Wild Wings is a great place to check out."
College Junior,5,"I am a Criminal Justice and Criminology major and I enjoy my program very much. My professor is an amazing man and he is very helpful. He helped me to be more open-minded when looking at professions in this field. He also asks if anyone needs extra help in class. Overall, he is a great professor to have."
College Junior,5,"Barton College is small, but large in heart. Students here enjoy one another's company and are huge supporters when it comes to athletics. Greek life on campus is amazing ! Parties are thrown a lot in the beginning of the semester and it simmers down so students won't lose sight of their studies. One thing that I really love about Barton is Day of Service. Students take a day out to  give back to the community. Students volunteer at different schools, retirement homes, churches,etc. It is always a joy to put smiles on many faces.The library here at Barton is also great. We have separate rooms with computers in them, so we can focus on our work away from the open. Students can also check out laptops, if they do not have one of their own. We also have ""welcome back to Barton day"" and ""Bulldog day"" these activities consist of students and faculty winning prizes and just having an awesome time. There are several different games that are played in the center field on campus. We always enjoy ourselves at the end of the day. Overall, Barton College is a great place to achieve your degree."
College Sophomore,5,I feel safe around the campus and the police are always visible.
Senior,4,"Throughout my experience at Barton College, I have learned to grow in so many ways. I transferred to Barton from a community college, and I was very nervous going into Barton. But, as soon as I got to Barton, there were many people there, a range of students, teachers, and staff, that opened their arms and treated me with such kindness. I have learned to be myself, and to be more understanding. I have grown into a very open-minded person. If I have a problem, academic or personal, I know I have so many people willing to talk to me. If I have a problem with any classroom material, the professors doors are always open. If I am having a hard day, the professors are understanding. The professors are very hands-on with learning, they do not just read material, they explain it, manipulate it, and make you understand it. The only thing I would like to see change on campus is the residence halls need to be updated, other than that, the campus is a solid 10/10."
Alum,4,"Attended this school as a transfer student, so I only stayed for two years. Although, they were a great two years. Being a small school you are able to make a personal connections with the staff as well as your classmates. Blessing and a curse, as everybody likely knows everyone's business."
Niche User,4,I went on a visit to Barton since I'm going to play football there. The campus itself was beautiful but real quiet. It's also a small private D2 college and it's their first year with football.
Sophomore,4,Probably what I experienced at Barton is that as a student you are not just a number. Since its smaller there are people who recognize you and want to see you succeed. Your a member of the university rather the just some one handing them a check.
Freshman,4,"Barton College has provided me with many ample opportunities to not only express myself through academics but also leadership and even Greek Life. Through academics it has provided a challenging, rewarding experience that truly prepares you for career path that you wish to take. Through my Presidential Leadership Fellows Program it has given me the leadership skills to know that I not only have a place on campus but also a voice in my community. Greek Life has also given me another avenue of expression of myself on campus only adding to the delightful place that I call my second home."
Junior,4,"Barton is a small college, and it makes a world of difference. I came from a small town school where all my teachers knew my name, so I wanted that in higher education as well. I didn't want to be just another number, name, or face in a crowd. Here at Barton, I am a person. Our former Dean of Students knew every single student by name, and he made each of us feel like we were his family. Something we say at Barton is "" You always have a place at our table."" This reigns true because the Barton Community really is a family. All of my professors make it a point to know my name. They care if I miss class, and they are willing to go the extra mile to help me succeed in life. The student resources are also incredible. From peer tutors to career services, our office of Student Success is one of the best!"
Senior,4,"Has good programs and campus. The buildings and dorms are a little old but everything works perfectly. Campus recently got upgraded electronic locks, and class rooms are equipped adequate technology. Parking is always easy to find, along with being free. Surrounding community has great restaurants and shops."
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful, academics as long as you care are good. Professors will care if you show interest and respect, and will be more than happy to help you if you have any problem. Regarding athletics, basketball and volleyball are the only good teams. Maybe Tennis, but it depends. ECS and Hackney are nice dorms.  The campus is safe.

Stay away from the business office, financial aid. They will only help you when you arrive, and they literally won't care and try to cause you problems. The food is disgusting and unhealthy, so stay away from it."
Junior,4,The school is great. The teachers are understanding and easy to work with. Administrative offices are very unproffesional when it comes to helping students with information.
College Freshman,4,Flexible and productive classes. Advisors need more training. They don't seem to care when they make mistakes.
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy that many students are adult students focused on continuing education and the professors understand that. It's different to go to college while working, raising a family, and having adult responsibilities."
Recent Alumnus,4,I became  cheerleader my second year and that gave me a better look at the sports from the inside.
Recent Alumnus,4,"i started off wanting to transfer because it wasn't the typical college experience, but after a year I gave it a chance and now I can't imagine getting my degree anywhere else."
College Sophomore,4,The student fan club at Barton is amazing. The students are always at the games cheering on their school mates.
College Sophomore,4,The students and staff at Barton College are extremely nice and friendly. They always create a warm and welcoming environment.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not all to familiar with drugs on campus, but I know that it is nearly impossible to have them, even alcohol. They are pretty protective to prevent underage drinking."
College Sophomore,4,"I do not live on campus, but I visit the dorms frequently and I like them. It's clean and everyone is pretty nice."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not a big sports person, but everyone is very supportive of the athletics department at our school."
College Freshman,4,I gave it 4 stars simply because no school you go to is going to be perfect. There are of course downfalls of this school but the pros definitely outweigh the cons. The faculty here are very encouraging and are willing to help you every step of the way. It is also a very friendly and inviting environment. With the classes being so small it allows you to really get to know professors and ask questions as well.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors here are great, but you have ot work and study hard for grades obtained.  I enjoy the small class sizes and great acquaintances with fellow students."
College Sophomore,4,"The career center is available, I have not had time to stop by there yet, but I will."
College Sophomore,4,"From what I hear, living on campus is good and safe.  Students like living on campus and going straight to class."
College Sophomore,4,The athletes at our school traveling alot but are well around students
College Sophomore,4,I receive emails constantly about recruiting on campus and outside jobs that are available for students.
College Sophomore,4,I have had a great experience and love that the class sizes are small.
College Sophomore,4,I do not live on campus but have classmates who do. They state it is very nice and convenient.
College Sophomore,4,"I like this school. I have had many questions from financial aid/loans to what building my classes were in. to which parking lot is the closest to my class and I have asked various counselors, teachers and even current students and all have been very helpful."
College Sophomore,4,"By the emails I receive almost daily, it seems that sports on campus is very popular. I have seen the gym and it is very nice and equipped properly."
College Junior,4,I do not like one of the teaching styles of an old instructor
College Freshman,4,I absolutely love being at Barton. I know that I chose the right place to be. I haven't had a class that I disliked and almost all of the professors are very nice! I would recommend Barton to anyone who has not chosen a college.
College Freshman,4,"The parties are pretty fun! I don't like that the sororities don't have their own houses, but rather just have a floor in one of the dorms."
College Freshman,4,Its a very welcoming school. I'm really glad I chose to go to a private school and in particular this one. The staff is very nice and I feel very at home.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone you meet is friendly are are accepting for who you are as a person
College Sophomore,4,The party experience is great when you're with friends
College Sophomore,4,The bathrooms and showers are cleaned daily
College Freshman,4,The classes are somewhat challenging but worth it!
College Freshman,4,Classes are small and challenging.
College Junior,4,Many programs at Barton have awesome teachers who have great connections. I'm not to sure about the artsy programs but nursing/gerontology and business majors have no problems getting jobs.
College Junior,4,"I enjoy the small school atmosphere. Classes aren't huge so it is easy to ask questions during class if you're not grasping a subject. Most teachers have good office hours. This is a liberal arts college who focuses on writing, so be prepared to write many papers! Staff are generally nice. I am in the nursing program and with the high number of female professors and female students, there is a bit of drama. This program is also going through many changes."
College Junior,4,I have only heard of one sexual assault since I've been there. Since then the school has added much needed extra lighting outside.
College Junior,4,I am not personally in a sorority but I have many friends who are. They are not snobby and do not look down on non-Greeks. Greek life is huge at Barton. If I had to guess. I would say about 70% of students are in ethier a fraternity or sorority.
College Junior,4,"Since Barton is a small college, each person is looked at as an individual. Everyone knows everyone which is very helpful in establishing a good relationship with professors."
College Senior,4,I remained at Barton College because it is family oriented. I enjoyed being able to have that encouragement in my studies and athletics as I am pursing my undergrad degree. I have friends who became family and even teachers and coaches who push me to be my best.
College Freshman,4,Barton offers a very comprehensive list of subjects. The only thing I wish it offered more of is science.
College Freshman,4,"I did not know what to expect going into my first semester, but all of my professors have been extremely professional and passionate about the subjects they teach."
College Freshman,4,The Wilson police Barton division plays a great role on campus. They are friendly and easily accessible.
College Freshman,4,"I love being part of such a small school. Teachers on campus really got out of their way to know you as an individual, and you are really able to pe a big part of your program."
College Sophomore,4,Barton is the place if you want one-on-one attention with your professor. Barton also helps students find internships within the community
College Sophomore,4,"I attended Chesapeake Community college in Wye Mills, Maryland for my freshman and sophomore year of college. I am now attending Barton College in Wilson, North Carolina. I am a student- athlete, I play softball and enjoy every minute of it. What I loved most about visiting Barton College was the kind and friendly people that were there. I also enjoyed the extra help that the students, professors and other staff are willing to give you, they seem to really care about their students and their success!"
College Junior,4,The financial aid I received from school covered all of my costs for the year. I even got a return check after buying my books.
College Junior,4,On campus housing is great. Friendly people and a great atmosphere.
College Sophomore,4,"The only challenges most people deal with when it comes to getting into a program at my school, is the nursing program. My school has a great nursing program and it can be hard to get into. However, I do not have that problem. I am a political science major and my program is very easy to get into. I think the best overall tip I can give someone when it comes to admission is, High school is important. Do not blow it off or it could prevent you from getting into your dream school."
College Sophomore,4,"I think when it comes to being strict at my school, they are very well at enforcing what they should be strict about, and what they shouldn't. It doesn't really affect student life that much because they all know what to expect, and no one really complains about the restrictions the school has."
College Sophomore,4,"This can be considered a very complex review. We have a different variety of guys and girls at my school. Even the Greeks all share different interests. Not any two students share the same everything. My school is very diverse and I really enjoy it. Even though everyone is very diverse, they all seem to get along very well which is a good thing to have when at a school."
College Sophomore,4,"I love eating off-campus at school. We have a lot of different choices even though most of them are chain restaurants. However, the food is not to expensive and a lot of places offer student discounts. I am very happy with off-campus dining."
College Sophomore,4,"This past semester, there was an incident on campus. One of the first of a very long time from what I was told. After that once incident, safety and security have became a very strong topic at my school. There are a lot of safety measures such as police and student escort classes, Calling boxes, and cameras. We also have great lighting. I am very happy with the safety measures at my school and I feel really safe on campus because of them."
College Sophomore,4,"I really love living on campus at Barton College. I am in the only all girl dorm there, and starting August it will be my second year. Though I believe the prices are a little high I really enjoy it there, the idea of suitemates lets you easily connect with other students and it is a very convenient walk to my classes."
College Senior,4,Security is great because of the Barton police dept.
College Senior,4,Barton is a great school and I enjoy being a student.
College Senior,4,All of professors have been great in my classes.
College Freshman,2,I'm unfamiliar with Greek life here.
College Freshman,2,I don't even think we have teams...
College Freshman,2,The school is very expensive and cost way more than it is worth. financial aid took too long to send my fafsa back so i did not receive as much as i should have. they will help you later on if needed but it won't be much.
College Freshman,2,Wilson is a very bad are to live in. I actually know of a guy that got away with 2 sexual assault charges on campus.
College Freshman,2,The student housing at Barton is terrible. The buildings are out of date and worth way less than what you pay for.
College Sophomore,2,"Financial Aid is the only problem I have came across at Barton College. Let me start that saying Barton College is quite expensive compared to a lot of other schools. Last year I got barely little money and I had my FASFA in by February. This year I have had it done since March and I still have yet to get a financial aid packet, and when it comes to communication with the offices, the main person you have to talk to is not very formative. I hope this is the only year that I will have problems with financial aid. I can not afford to take out a thirty-five thousand dollar loan every year. When it comes to getting advice for financial aid at my school, I recommend having all of your information in by the third week of January at the latest. Also, try to stay really updated on the financial aid process. College can be stressful, and money issues just add more stress to it."
College Junior,2,Being an out of state student it was so hard to go home on breaks I generally went with my roommate home or traveled to nearby cities for transportation.
College Senior,2,"Because of reconstruction with the entryway an entire parting lot was removed. Parking was bad enough but since this happened, it's even worse. We have raffles where people can win a designated parking spot. No one cares about the fact that you can pick how close you want it and where, but more for the fact we actual have a guaranteed parking spot. So far I haven't seen any accommodations for this problem."
College Sophomore,2,Only on campus options are the cafeteria or one fast food place. There is not  much variety food wise in either location. No other on campus options
College Sophomore,2,Not much variety to choose from. Alot of fast food places. Very few late night options to choose from.
College Sophomore,2,Small school not much to do outside of sporting events. Education wise it is a great place to get an education.
College Sophomore,2,School only has 3 male fraternitys on campus. Not alot of variety to choose from.
College Sophomore,2,parking spots fill quickly during the day and stay full untill the afternoon classes get done. If going off campus for lunch usually have to park far from intended destination
College Freshman,2,"The local atmosphere here at Barton College can be somewhat dangerous. We are not located in the greatest neighborhood. However, the school does take a great deal of time to teach us how to stay safe. There are some great events that happen in Wilson and surrounding cities such as concerts and fairs. Our school holds cultural events. There are plenty of places to eat as well as shop in Wilson. The local attitude towards students is usually friendly, but you mush always be cautious!"
College Junior,2,Not really sure about public transportation as a new student.
College Freshman,2,"Wilson is a small town and, as everyone knows with small towns, there is hardly anything to do off campus. There are a couple of shopping places (Walmart, Target, Rue 21, etc.), but after a short while these places become boring. On the weekends it gets very empty, everyone rushing to go back home. However, Wilson is fairly close to Raleigh and Greenville, which are two major cities in North Carolina."
College Freshman,2,"When it comes to underage drinking, campus police is very strict on that. If someone underaged is caught drinking it will lead to a write-up, however, this is only for first time offenders. When it comes to second and third time offenders, they risk living on campus and continuing their studies at Barton. However, when it comes to the RAs I'd have to say thyme are not very strict about much. In fact, it is possible to get away with pretty much everything."
College Freshman,2,"There are plenty of open spots in the designated commuter parking lots, but some students that commute decide to park in the lots in front of the residence halls and then the students that live there can't park. It isn't the school's fault, but commuter students."
College Junior,2,"The College is not located in the best part of town. It is very open. You have random people walking, riding their bikes, etc on campus during the day, at night which is pretty scary. The library is public access which is also scary. We get emails all the time about keeping your car doors locked and valuables out of sight because of the break ins. Wilson in itself is a small town not really much to do there are fast food places to eat and some places to shop."
College Sophomore,2,Having a Friend – Public transportation is very hard to find. The buses run on an off schedule and you rarely see taxis. So your best option is to either have your own car or find a good friend who has a ride.
Sophomore,1,"Not that great, not having a good time. For 42,000$ this place sucks. I have to type 100 characters about how I feel but its honestly not worth it."
Niche User,1,"Don't send your soon to be college student to Barton!!!  Here's the many reasons why.  Not worth the value.  Overpriced below par education. Not a safe or clean enviroment, that includes the surrounding area. Your student will be hungry because the food sucks. Meal plan is $2900 a semester. If you what your son to learn how to be a womanizer, this is the place for you.  Great place to leave as an alcoholic or drug addict.  Your daughter will be used, abused and broken mentally by the self entitled, disrespectful, no boundaries males at this so called college. Barton needs to take Christian out of their label of what kind of college it is.  It's more like  Barton-Camp Crystal Lake without Jason Voorhees!!  This place isn't a safe environment for females or anyone.  Please don't send your daughter or son to Barton.  It's all about covering up what really goes on there, so they can get their donations and fool parents to pay for the lie."
Alum,1,"Barton College is a great school to attend if you are looking for a 13th grade that will result in good grades and a degree. Unfortunately, Barton does not compare to schools such as NC State or Wake Forest. The teachers try their best, but the curriculum is very far behind in the presently faced paced and technologically advanced work force. You will have extremely easy teachers, some who struggle to teach you much of anything, and others who do just fine. If you live in Wilson and are looking to work for BB&T or Firestone, then this is the place to be. You will not find any connections to Barton College outside of Wilson, NC. The staff is friendly and they try their best, but if you are looking to go to school and put yourself into thousands of dollars into debt, reach higher and attend a place then will challenge you everyday and force you to learn."
College Sophomore,1,Don't go here if you like to be surrounded by people who care. Students don't care about anything but the next Alpha party and who will buy them alcohol.
College Sophomore,1,The school doesn't even have its own track
Recent Alumnus,1,its supposed to be inclusive but it just makes you feel excluded before you can even say hi
College Junior,1,The college do not have any African American Greek life
College Freshman,1,terrible area to be in. the only thing close is ECU which is 45 minutes. the closest mall is in rocky mount which is an even worse area.
College Sophomore,1,Many of the buildings on campus need renovations like the student center and gymnasium
College Freshman,1,"If you really need to have a variety of choices for your meals, this college isn't for you. The same exact food is offered every single day and half the time it doesn't taste right. Because of this, many students often opt for meals outside the cafeteria."
College Sophomore,1,"At Barton there is really only one way to get around, and that's either by having a car on campus or having a friend with a car."
College Senior,1,There is little public transport for people who do not have a car.
College Senior,1,Parking on campus is not that great. I don't drive so I don't have to worry about it but you must get there maybe 20 minutes before your class start just so you can get a good parking spot.

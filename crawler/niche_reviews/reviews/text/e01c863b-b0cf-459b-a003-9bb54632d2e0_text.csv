Sometimes you have to restart the computers in the library because they are always on, but that is to be expected of any highly used computer system. There are several printers available for free use throughout the campus, and they are high quality. Unfortunately there is no wireless access at the campus. After inquiring about this issue with technical support, it is to ensure safety and reliability of the campus' network. Technical support is available from 7AM-9:30PM Monday through Friday and on call on the weekends. The e-Learning program is absolutely wonderful and easy to navigate which makes online learning a snap. In fact, I have taken a lot of my classes through the e-Learning program. There are so many computers available on campus with extended hours of availability Monday-Saturday that a computer is not 100% necessary to own if you are able to make it to campus."

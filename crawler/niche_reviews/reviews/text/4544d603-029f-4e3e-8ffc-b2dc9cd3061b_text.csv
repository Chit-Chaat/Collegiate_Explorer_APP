Freshman,5,"Missouri S&T is among the highest rated engineering universities in America for a reason. The teachers are incredible, and the facilities are top-notch. The classes available are myriad, you will always wish that you were able to take more classes, because they all seem very enjoyable. 
The atmosphere at MST is a focused one, the students here are here to learn. During the week, the campus is quiet, but during the weekend there is always something to do."
Freshman,5,"I didn't take any online courses yet, but their website is very accessible.  You can easily find many resources about academics, extra activities, and campus life."
Senior,5,"MS&T is the best bang for your buck engineering school in the state of Missouri, and definitely will give any other engineering school in the country a run for their money if they tried to claim the same. At MS&T, you will get out of college what you put into it- hard work pays off here, and the return on your tuition investment is absolutely massive."
Senior,5,"This is a great academic school with a huge number of opportunities after graduating. Career fair in school always has more than 300 companies. All people that graduate from here are very smart. Campus is not too big, and not too small, just enough to walk in between the classes. Food is good. There are 2 cafeterias."
Senior,5,School is using the Zoom platform for online lectures and professors are very much available to answer on all questions and emails. No complaints about it.
Freshman,5,This is a great college!! As I enter the Engineering field I’m very excited to learn more about my future career. The application process was super easy and the staff was very committed to ensuring I was informed. Once I actually got to the school I was incredibly happy with my choice. While it’s a smaller school I like that I get more specific training to what I will actually use when I start working. Many larger colleges require so many extra classes that have nothing to do with your chosen path.  I’m not a huge party person but I can always find something to do on campus thats entertaining. I can even work on campus to make some extra cash. The campus is spacious but not too big to walk across in a decent amount of time which helps with that freshman fifteen!
Niche User,5,I went to a visit at Missouri S&T. The school itself was exceptional. I talked to professors and they were very nice and very talkative to students. The campus was small but it makes it easier to get from class to class. The food was great. They have chain restaurants in the eating commons such as Chic-fil-a.
Sophomore,5,"Missouri S&T is a great school if you're looking for a high quality, affordable engineering degree. The course work is applicable and at times rigorous, but will prepare you for the career path of your choosing. The professors in many cases have been in the private sector for several years which influences the way the classes are taught and in turn imparting more ""real world"" knowledge. Where the school really shines is the plethora of activities, clubs, research projects, and design teams. These outside-the-classroom activities are where the rubber meets the pavement,  while learning useful ""real world"" industry knowledge, connections are also forged with those already well into their careers, thus providing opportunities for employment after graduation. 

All-in-all Missouri S&T is a great school, highly recommended."
Niche User,5,I will be attending s&t in the fall of 2020 and could not be more excited to start my journey in rolla!
Niche User,5,I went to visit Missouri S&T and I had an amazing time. There were lots of opportunities for me to meet the staff and lots of information for me to learn inn one day but my tour guide summed it up for me. I got to see how everyone lived and how nice everyone was.
Niche User,5,The campus was very pretty and the housing was very nice and well kept. The school also offers tons of opportunities to get involved with clubs and sports and it has many career opportunities to get you into the working world.
Niche User,5,Visiting the campus was an amazing experience.  I feel that the institution fits me best as a prospective engineering student.
Freshman,5,"I'm a first year at Missouri S&T and I absolutely love it. I've met so many cool people here and this school isn't completely full of socially awkward like so many people stereotype it to be. All of the faculty here really want you to succeed and there seem to be endless opportunities to help you academically and with a search for career opportunities. There are so many resources to help you succeed and get you on the right path. In addition to this, there are a lot of clubs and activities to get involved with, whether you want a career oriented club like a design team or a club just to have fun, like swing dancing or rock climbing."
Freshman,5,The university has done a fantastic job preparing the incoming freshmen. Professors have been available for questions and eager to help. Orientation was thorough. When starting school students are confident and prepared.

Missouri S&T is an excellent school. It gets a lot of flack for being a tough school, but it's not only hard, but it's also a really good school with great programs. The professors, TA's and other administrators will help you succeed and help you pass. The coursework is hard, but every student is given all the tools necessary to succeed here. The campus is really nice too! Small and easy to navigate, the campus is both cool and charming."
Freshman,5,"I am currently an incoming freshman, but for the times that I have been down there, I have been talking to many of the students, professors, and locals about the town and the school itself. I have stayed in a fraternity house for a weekend and enjoyed every part of the town, school, and living space."
Freshman,5,Very intense college that requires a lot of work and effort into your academics. Beautiful campus and so many different clubs to join.
Senior,5,"I love this school. The years I have been here have been some of the best of my life. Despite there being hard spots and downhills and setbacks, I have made great friends, had good times, enjoyed new experiences, learned so much and become closer to my family. This campus has done a great job preparing me for adult society and joining the work force. Before I came, I had no idea what to do with my life. Now, I think I know what I want in my future."
Freshman,5,"Very nice facilities, friendly staff, good location, good quality of education. Good for students who would like good education at a great relative cost."
Sophomore,5,"The school has state of the art facilities that show students what they will be working with in real life. They also provide students with ways to network with companies and get internships, co-ops, and jobs."
Niche User,5,"As of now, I have been impressed with the friendliness and helpfulness of everyone I have spoken with. I look forward to continuing my career here."
Niche User,5,Really loved the atmosphere of the campus and it really seemed like a top-notch school! All the professors I was able to meet were all very friendly and welcoming to the school. The small campus really makes it easy to get to one side to another and gives a really home vibe.
Freshman,5,Missouri University of Science and Technology (MST) is a really good school for those who are looking to go into engineering. MST ranks better than Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and I'm really glad to be apart of this school. I would highly recommend this college to anyone who is looking to go into engineering or becoming a math major.
Alum,5,"It was a great college to attend. The college population was just the right size for for the small college town atmosphere.  The courses were challenging, nut the resources to get assistance were great. Professors were very knowledgeable and most enjoyed teaching and getting the students involved."
Sophomore,5,"I love this school because almost everyone is an engineer! Everyone has the same interests, like math, sciences, video games, and some outdoor activities. I wish sports were a little more prominent but it makes sense why they aren't. It's a nerd school!"
Sophomore,5,"S&T is a great investment for a college education. Classes are very difficult but pays off in the end. Res halls are lively and student life is very social despite the ""nerd"" stereotype given to the college."
Freshman,5,"I just got through my first year at this university and I really enjoyed it. The classes were really tough which tells me I'm getting a really good education, especially for the low cost (compared to other engineering universities). The campus is really pretty, but nothing too special. The only real downside to it is that it's a town surrounded by nothing but fields and woods, so there's not much to do outside of campus."
Sophomore,5,"Choosing Missouri S&T was the best choice of my career. The quality of education that I am receiving is the best possible quality and the experiences that I have had here have been amazing. I feel prepared to go out into the workforce with all that I have learned here already, and I am only a sophomore."
Freshman,5,"There are many issues with parking. Often times students will not receive access to parking passes until their senior year. This causes many problems as much housing is located off campus, and city police will give you a ticket for parking alongside streets for more than two days."
Freshman,5,"It's a nice school. The campus isn't very large so you shouldn't have any trouble trying to find your classes, and even if you have trouble you can just ask someone as just about everyone is willing to help you. The professors are good, but the classes are going to be hard, no matter how smart you think you are."
Junior,5,The campus is very focused on socialization and group work with the professors encouraging students to engage in real life scenarios and encouraging them to find clients on their own. The campus itself needs to promote more types of safety when it comes to having caution signs and warnings up for people who bike around campus.
Niche User,5,"Hidden treasure!  Feel truly blessed my son is attending M S&T. My other son said I don't know why people state in Rolla there nothing to do... the college has great design teams and the alumni are incredible in support.  You go to school to learn, get experience- design teams, internships, build relationships with professors and people with like minds, learning to work together to change the world.   from Northern California... the home of the tech world."
Niche User,5,"Missouri University of Science and Technology is a great school for many different types of majors or minors. The students are willing to work together to solve problems and get jobs done. They have hard work ethics and they are driven towards their cause. The campus has many options for food, as well as various places around town."
Sophomore,5,"This school is one of the best to earn an engineering scholarship from. The school does a great job on preparing you for life after college. There are two amazing career fairs that the school hosts where a big majority of our students receive jobs, internships, or co-ops. I only wish there were a bit more to do around Rolla."
Niche User,5,I am an incoming freshman and I am very excited to begin my experience here. I have heard that it is much easier to come out of the this school with a steady and stable job you will love.
Sophomore,5,"I love the people here and the supportive atmosphere. Yes, the classes are challenging. However, I know that an education from this school will take me far in life."
Sophomore,5,"I appreciate the focus and aid that the teachers provide in advancing my education. I cannot, as of yet, find anything that I would change about the university."
Alum,5,Great school that will set you up for a successful career.  Our career office is incredible and has numerous events that will put you in front if employers. Plenty of stuff to-do as well even for a small town.
Alum,5,It is a great and challenging school which will either help you learn or realize you may not be made of the right stuff for the area you've chosen. Most professors are willing to help to see you succeed.
Niche User,5,I went to visit the campus earlier this summer and was impressed by the amount of push their was on taking it easy as compared to what I'm used to which is study or fail. I am looking forward to going there should I get accepted.
Niche User,5,I visited S&T and I thought it was an amazing school. The people were really nice and the atmosphere felt really comforting. The campus overall was really nice but it is a little small. The food is good and pretty average for what you will find on a college campus. The housing options are okay. The student has the option of either living community style in an older building or living in apartment style living with three other students.
Sophomore,5,"Missouri S&T is the best university in the Midwest for all STEM majors and many non STEM majors as well. Hailed as the MIT of the Midwest, S&T provides the best education, that employers are looking for, for the best value."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Missouri University of Science and Technology is summed up by you get what you put into it.  The classes can be extremely difficult, but the teachers are always there to help if you ask.  The campus is clean, and most students here are polite."
Sophomore,5,"Great school for engineering and science majors. The camous is small and we'll kept, and the dorms are really nice."
Sophomore,5,"Missouri S&T is a very highly esteemed technology college, with an extremely high return on investment at public university prices"
Freshman,5,"MST is great for students that truly want to pursue a higher education, but not pay as much as private institutions. The university is fairly cheap compared to other colleges, but the amount of opportunities that the school provides students with getting a real world job is incredibly high. The only things that could be different is an improved physics building and a nicer math department."
Freshman,5,Missouri University of Science and Technology is an amazing school with great opportunities to help you after you graduate.
Freshman,5,"Great campus! Easy to navigate, friendly students, always something to do and an even balance of focus on studies and making sure we get out and take breaks to clear our head from all that studying!  This is a great school for future great leaders in their field!"
Freshman,5,The professors are all very helpful and open to questions. The campus is very beautiful and easy to get around.
Sophomore,5,"Overall I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Missouri S&T thus far.  There are many resources on campus that are available to assist in course work.  I have taken advantage of the student success center, lead sessions, and PLC (physics learning center).  These programs have had a tremendous impact on my academics.  Missouri S&T also has great staff that is willing to help students in all ways possible.  My teachers have always been available for one on one help with course work.  There are also many organizations on campus, I believe that there is something for everyone at Missouri S&T."
Freshman,5,"Can't be beat as an engineering school if you live in Missouri. You'll be making the equivalent of 3 years tuition with engineers starting pay. It's in a red state, and the southern part of it as well, so unfortunately the campus is largely white males, but there is a spattering of other cultures, it has a decent Indian presence and many of the professors are middle eastern. It's a large party school if you're into that, especially around St. Pats. If you're more of a museum and indoor entertainment sort of person, the local area doesn't have much to offer. However if you enjoy nature, there are many awesome places to explore. The food is like, fine. Could be better but I'm grateful for what I'm given here. Dorms are expensive move off campus or into a greek house/CCF ASAP unless you want to try to be an RA."
Freshman,5,I love everything about this school. The teachers are great and the students are amazing. The class sizes aren't terrible and the teachers are willing to work with you if you need help. 
College Senior,5,The students and professors are extremely accepting of people of different backgrounds.
College Student,5,School has the biggest career fair with the best companies. Employers know how good of a college this is and how prepared the students are for the job.
College Student,5,Lots of resources to use
College Student,5,Some of the kindest people on campus
College Student,5,Lots of people who are all genuinely nice. Professors are good and care about student success.
College Freshman,5,"Companies from all over the world are interested in our school, which is why we are ranked so high. Most students who put themselves out there will find a job or internship with a company. The school also makes sure that the students have plenty of resources and job fairs on campus so that finding a job in between classes is easy to do."
College Sophomore,5,"The teachers were very helpful. Also, the staff was cooperative."
College Sophomore,5,"S&T is known as one of the top three engineering universities in the United States(called the MIT of the Midwest.) We have close ties with big companies, such as Boeing and General Aviation and Koehler. Every Spring and Fall semester S&T holds a large career fair where students are required to dress in business formal attire and take their resumes to different companies in hopes getting either an internship, co-op, or job offer. Also, the companies that come are good at remembering people, so getting at co-op at one might get you a job after graduation if you do well enough."
Freshman,4,"My overall experience was great at MST. The people there are very nice, and helpful when it comes around to doing things."
Freshman,4,"I am about to start my freshman year at Missouri S&T, but speaking about my orientation day all I have is positive words for this college. They were very resourceful and friendly with any questions or concerns I had."
Freshman,4,"I am about to begin my freshman year at Missouri university of Science and Technology. I can only speak about my orientation day, but all I can say is positive things about the university. The staff helping me out were so resourceful and answered any questions I had at the time. Even now when I have concerns/questions they always respond to the best of their abilities."
Alum,4,"Overall, online learning was done well. Professors did a very good job to make sure students understood the material. However, in terms of online learning through labs, I would not recommend it. You do not get the hands-on experience."
Alum,4,MSE department cared about students and their education. There is a lot of opportunities for students to be involved in extraciriculars.
Freshman,4,"All of the interactions that I've had with advisers were positive.  Sometimes they send too many emails for my preference, but they are good at communicating."
Senior,4,"MS&T was already invested in distance education prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, the switch was smooth and practically seamless across the board, with the exception of some of the humanities and fine arts courses."
Freshman,4,Missouri S&T is a great college with amazing administration. There's so many clubs and acitiviteis that you can join to participate with the community. The education is a little rigorous but that's what college is about. S&T is also a fairly renown college so starting your career after you get out is fairly easy as long as you have strong social skills and are intelligent. The main downside I had was dealing with the VA rep. He didn't respond to emails to well and wasn't very helpful in answering my questions about military. All other staff I emailed responded to me very quickly and were very helpful.
Junior,4,"The life on campus is great, especially around St. Patrick's Day time. DJing at the local college radio station KMNR 89.7 FM is the most fun I have had on a college campus."
Niche User,4,I like the engineering programs. I visited the campus once for camp for a summer program. There was a lot of hands on projects and it was challenging. The challenge allowed us to testify to our talents and show our abilities for engineering.
Niche User,4,I went to S&T for a college visit. I thought that everyone was very nice and seemed very accepting. A couple of the students that I saw seemed to be a little stressed about some of their classes. There was a lot of school pride which was very cheerful.
Sophomore,4,"This school has many opportunities to do well in your studies, but somewhat lacks on writings to do outside of your education. Some design teams and clubs can help but for the most part, off campus entertainment is very scarce"
Freshman,4,"Missouri University of Science and Technology is a very good school if you have an interest in the STEM field and have a very good hiring rate directly out of school. One thing I must say about this school is the scene is not like a normal university. Most students here are taking a large courseload so the campus can be boring at times, but I think the payoff of coming here is definitely worth it and I am very proud to say that I attend this school."
Freshman,4,A good university with pretty meh surroundings. Don't come if an urban setting is a must for you; Rolla is a pretty small town.
Graduate Student,4,Missouri University of Science and Technology has one of the top ten engineering programs in the nation.  The instructors are very knowledgable and want to ensure the success of the students once they have graduated from their program of study.
Junior,4,"It is a great school where you can really learn a lot, and meet a lot of awesome people.  The town is not awesome, but give it some time and you will grow to love it."
Sophomore,4,"It is a difficult school but overall a very good school, the community is nice and helpful and I have had no issues so far unless they were my own fault."
Senior,4,"The campus is smaller but the degree programs are amazing and recognized nationally. I have loved my time there, and it's really easy to find a group that you fit in with."
Sophomore,4,I am a student-athlete and the professors are very accommodating for competition as well as the coach being accommodating for exams and internship opportunities.
Freshman,4,MST has very good academics. I would like to see more diversity amongst the student body and food offered at Havener.
Freshman,4,"I think that the classes are really hard. However, Greek Life is really fun, and I am making some wonderful memories with my Fraternity Brothers. The campus facilities are also very helpful."
Senior,4,"Love the diversity, the friendliness, how everything is easy to get to. The professors sometimes seem to care, students are extremely friendly and always talkative. Campus is like its own little community."
Niche User,4,"The college is really what it seem, science and technology, the courses are good, you get to learn what you actually want to learn, and make an attempt to major in it. Although like most colleges I recommend bringing your bike if you are not a walker."
Junior,4,Missouri S&T is a very academic and research based university. It is always hosting events to help better your success.
Freshman,4,A very good school. I chose it because of its reputation and price. Relatively low tuition costs and extremely high job placement rate. The culture on campus is not very unique but the amount of degree programs is.
Niche User,4,The classes are extremely challenging which suits students seeking engineering. The campus was beautiful. They have great programs for freshmen and great opportunities for job seeking graduates. They also have a lot of program that helps you get ready for the real world.
Sophomore,4,"Missouri University of Science and Technology is a surprisingly fun school. Although Rolla itself might not have much to offer for its students, S&T does a good job of making sure that students not only get the education they want and deserve but also that they have enough clubs to keep them entertained while they spend their time in Rolla."
Sophomore,4,"I love the school and the atmosphere. It’s full of weird people who are passionate about so many things. You’d be hard pressed not to find somebody who doesn’t love the same things that you love. It’s a good place for people who feel like they have a hard time fitting in because everyone is so friendly and fun. However, I’d love to see more people of minorities, as well as females. Since it’s a school that’s heavily revolved around traditionally predominantly male fields, young women tend to get gunshy about coming, but it’s really not that bad. Also, a girl will never be out of luck looking for a date."
Freshman,4,Missouri Science and Technology has a very welcoming atmosphere to it. It allows everyone to feel included.
Freshman,4,"The people here are amazing, and I would suggest that all Missouri geeks consider  Missouri S&T.  There are a lot of problems though... I'm on Student Council here, and I can say that the non-student management I get to deal with is not competent.  The company that is contracted for food out can't figure out the math for their own meal plan.  Since the school currently requires freshmen and sophomores to have meal plans,  I would suggest getting an all-points plan.  It is the least of a rip-off and gives the most flexibility.   Try to arrange the option to live off campus.  The living options are overpriced, and the people who run Student Housing are lazy, and will often lie to get out of doing their job.  The classes are wonderful, with teachers who care about their students and often will meet outside of class to help.  This school also helps students to find jobs after and during college, with many companies going directly to Missouri S&T for their engineers and interns."
Freshman,4,"MOST is a really good school. It gets a lot of flack for being a tough school, but it's not only hard, it's a really good school with great programs. The professors, TA's and other administrators will help you succeed and help you pass. The coursework is hard, but every student is given all the tools necessary to succeed here. 
The campus is really nice too! Small and easy to navigate, the campus is both cool and charming."
Niche User,4,"Last year, I went to a summer camp at MS&T, and it was amazing! All the professors I had a chance to talk to were very nice and genuinely seemed to care about the students they taught. During this camp I had the opportunity to check out the campus and really get a feel for the college. I was pleasantly surprised! The food was pretty good, the dorms were great, and the students were friendly and helpful."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is quiet, the town is quiet, which helps because the academics are very challenging.   The Career Fairs are very encouraging and the staff are helpful when it comes to career placement."
Freshman,4,"The school is very tough academically, but there are plenty of resources to help with student success. Employers recognize this fact, and hire students from this university very quickly. The university hosts the best job fair in the UM system and students from Mizzou come here for jobs. The residence halls are nice compared to other universities, I personally haven’t seen others, but my father said that just the TJ res hall was nicer than the regular dorms at UCM. I enjoy my time here, but it is a lot of work."
Junior,4,Overall very good school. Academics are placed first and it's the way a school should be. The school is fairly cheap and has a lot offer.
Freshman,4,Missouri S&T is a wonderful college. The professors are there to help you as much as possible and the L.E.A.D. sessions are extremely useful. There are so many different organizations and activities going on.
Sophomore,4,"Great education, great campus activities, and great return on investment. Greek Life is awesome, but GDI is huge too. Be ready to study, but don't think we don't have fun because of it!"
Junior,4,This schook is very challenging expensive for out of state unless you can get stellar grades all four years but its worth it given the reputation of the school and the job outlook for most of the majors.
Freshman,4,"I liked the education and difficulty level at Missouri S&T. It's very challenging and it pushes you hard. But the school makes sure you succeed. I would like to see the gender gap close a little at this school, however. There aren't a lot of girls at this school, which is sad, but the number is slowly growing with each year."
Junior,4,"Overall, it is a great school. The classes are difficult, but you will learn a lot. There is not a lot to do here, so the only reason you come is for school. The opportunities are great."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is nervous when they're going off to college, especially if you don't have friends going to the same university. However, the people at S&T are amazing. Students and faculty are so inclusive and everyone wants to help you find your place. There are over 200 clubs to be a part of at Missouri S&T that will help you do just that. There are countless resources to make sure students succeed. I wouldn't choose any other university!"
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Missouri University of Science and Technology. The school is very demanding and challenging, but the benefits are far worth it. The school sets up the individual for success. Once an individual graduates, there are many jobs that will be offered to them."
Junior,4,There are many programs and resources for students and the people involved with the school are determined to help their students succeed. There are some departments that are overly strict making it difficult for students to move through.
Niche User,4,It was a small school so you could know where everything is and get around easier which helped out if you were running a little late
Senior,4,"I transferred from a community college with an associate's degree last year, and even though most of my instructors seemed down to earth and understanding of the challenges of learning the new coursework my friends and I have embarked on, there have been a few instructors that I have learned to steer clear of to keep my GPA and sanity from going out the window. If you are thinking about attending this school, keep two things in mind - it will push you to the very limits of what you think you can do, and make friends with those who've been there a few years - they know which instructors care about how you understand their courses, and which ones are notorious for destroying the GPAs of entire class sections."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the other students at the school, they are so helpful when it comes to classes and school work. Campus resources are as helpful as the professor makes  and if classes are hard which 98% of them are, the majority of the time the programs designed to help with the school work outside of the class will be difficult to understand and concepts will Be hard to grasp. Mostly things like that depends on the professor whose teaching the class. 
I recommend taking your pre-reqs at a community college or somewhere similair before going there for a mahor, you will a much easier and less stressful time doing that than going there for 4 -5 years.
Things I do like about the school, the choices of dormitory, they have really nice facilities and you can make really good friends. I like that the town the school is located in, it is small but it basically has everything you'll need and the people in the town are so friendly."
Sophomore,4,"Great school with diverse student life, tons of different clubs or groups or teams to join. Sports are a little lacking and the classes can definitely get stressful especially since some professors aren't the best at teaching but most professors are willing and ready to help you further if you attend their office hours. LEAD sessions are also available for most courses and their are a lot of student resources. A social life is also easily attainable here."
Freshman,4,This university has an incredibly strong sense of community. It's a safe environment with strong academics. It's a fun and rewarding college to attend and I would highly recommend applying! Miners Dig Deeper!!!
Freshman,4,"Everyone on campus makes you feel welcome. There are several student groups you can join. Because of the diversity of students, and the many groups, there are always activities happening on campus. The classes are challenging, but there are several outlets to get help if you are struggling in a class. The campus has a job fair twice a year. This job fair is geared specifically for their graduates and is a wonderful opportunity to find a career."
Freshman,4,I really like the school atmosphere at S&T. The one thing I would change is for there to be more parking available. I feel as though the school grew so fast in population that the parking was not able to keep up.
Freshman,4,"The academics at this school are superior, and there are plenty of tutoring resources, but they are lacking in quality.   If one is looking to get involved on campus, there are academic design teams that are constantly working and having fun experience; If you attend here, i highly recommend joining one"
Junior,4,"It's a demanding school.  I have ADD and have found , through trial and error that I can manage getting involved in up to 2 campus organizations outside of classwork before my grades begin suffering as a result.  It's not uncommon for people to attend 5 to 6 years before graduating with a bachelor's degree, because engineering school isn't easy.  There's not much variety with regards to campus dining and dining is located in remote sections of the campus.  Students receive university email notifications every so often, 1 or 2 a semester, of female students that are sexually molested on and sometimes off campus in the Rolla area.  The professors in higher up degree related classes are great and truly care about students.  The gen ed professors for classes like Chem, Calc, Physics, etc range between awesome and couldn't care less about you.  It just depends on the instructor you get."
College Senior,4,The professors at S&T really care about helping their students learn.
College Senior,4,Missouri S&T is conscious of drug safety and treats it seriously.
College Student,4,Difficult courses that will challenge you. Professors are always there to help.
College Sophomore,4,Living in the dorms led me to meet some of my best friends that weren't even on my floor. The dining downstairs at TJ was great for lunch and dinner.
College Sophomore,4,"The Greeks are a big part of campus life, and they throw almost all of the parties on campus. There are a huge amount of fraternities, but only 3 or 4 sororities. Greeks and non-Greeks don't really view each other differently."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a great school for education, but it's a small town. There is not much to do besides study or go partying."
College Freshman,4,Clean and well kept. Great in-building facilities.
College Freshman,4,"Personally not involved in Greek life, but those who are love it. Plus the parties aren't totally awful."
College Junior,2,"The athletics are mostly unimportant for the average student, as the school is Division II and not particularly great at any sports. Most of the focus on extracurricular activities is on engineering design teams. For example, the school's satellite design team is constructing a satellite that will be put into orbit in conjunction with NASA and the USAF."
College Freshman,2,"We win our games, usually, but only because everyone we play against is just as bad as us. We don't put a lot of value into sports. But we use intermurals to relieve stress and about half the campus participates in those."
College Junior,2,"Academics are really good, and there are a number of design teams. Outside of school, there really isn't anything to do in town though. There are a lot of fast food restaurants (food options aren't good)."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of sexual assaults we get notified of on campus.  I'd like to think that it is not because of the 4 to 1 guy to girl ratio in rolla, but that has yet to be proven otherwise."
College Sophomore,2,"The university doesn't have enough on-campus housing available for all of the sophomores (required to house on-campus until they reach 50 credit hours) and incoming freshman.   Because of this, the University has some students living in hotels indefinitely."
College Sophomore,2,"Varsity sports aren't big here.  This is an engineering school, and to even athletes, school comes first."
College Freshman,2,"This school is full of people with a superiority complex. The classes and departments feel disorganized, and good luck on all the freshman weed out classes. The campus is pretty, but that's about it. The food is bad, people are awful with accepting anyone of any other demographic than white male, and the teachers don't really seem to care about learning."
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms are so expensive to live in. They are cramped, but close to campus. It is cheaper to rent an apartment or house all year long than to live in the dorms during the school year."
College Freshman,2,"Thomas Jefferson has seriously dropped in quality and variety since the beginning of the fall semester. At least three days a week, I have to resort to cereal for my meal because nothing else is any good."
College Sophomore,2,"Ummmm, this is an engneering school first and foremost"
College Sophomore,2,"Make sure you use your meal plan points at Papa Johns. Remember: 2 free cans of Pepsi product with each large pizza ordered, you have to ask though."
College Sophomore,2,"There's mostly fast food. There are a few other restaurants, but nothing is particularly good."
College Freshman,2,On campus and the surrounding areas are fairly nice but most of the town is depressing if you're used to living in a large town or city..
College Freshman,2,"It's Missouri. The weather changes constantly. Yesterday it was hotter than the fiery depths of hell, and today I was bundled up and still shivering. There are some days that are incredibly pleasant, though, and I think they make up for the bad ones."
College Senior,2,"I applied but received no aid.  I know of students who were promised aid based on transfer coursework, whose GPA was recalculated after moving to Rolla only to lose the promised scholarship.  Bait and switch."
College Freshman,2,Small town with not much to do off campus.
College Freshman,2,If you don't have a car and need to go somewhere out of walking distant you have to bring a bike or ask a friend. There are no shuttle services.
College Sophomore,2,There isn't too many restaurants off campus that aren't fast food or part of a chain. I rarely eat out though so it's not a big deal for me.
College Sophomore,2,Rolla is a pretty small town and there isn't too much to do on the weekends.
College Sophomore,2,Too expensive for the quality.
College Sophomore,2,There is almost nothing to do in Rolla outside of Campus. It's pretty boring.
College Student,2,Too many guys and too few girls.
College Student,2,The food is too expensive for the quality you get.
College Freshman,2,"There's not much of a bar scene or nightlife, but there are options."
College Freshman,2,It's a small town and there aren't too many options.
College Student,2,"we are an engineering school, you can't expect a good sports team"
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is always a hassle.  Sometimes you can find a spot, usually you cannot.  I personally waited a year to get a parking permit, and it was expensive.  The metered spaces are expensive too."
College Freshman,2,"Outside of Celebration of Nations, there are no non-college related community events"
College Freshman,2,"Drug use is very minimal, or at least not as public as alcohol."
College Junior,2,The ratio of guys to girls is not good at all. It is about 5 guys to 1 girl here.
College Senior,2,"I personally do not own a car.  I live relatively close to campus and am able to bike or walk there.  There is a shuttle bus that is going to be added shortly.  Most of my friends own cars, and there are plenty of times when owning a car would come in handy, however I am usually able to catch a ride with a friend in those instances."
College Junior,2,There are three dining halls on campus but on the weekends only one of the three is actually open.  The food isn't the greatest.
College Sophomore,2,"It is kind of annoying, I paid for a parking pass, it is across the campus and it is required to move it at least once or twice a week."
College Sophomore,2,"Classes aren't really cancelled that often due to weather unless it's really severe. Like several inches of snow or tornado severe. But that being said, this is the Midwest. The only place where it'll snow at the end of April, be 60 degrees in the middle of January, and have freak storms that last only a couple of minutes. If you don't like the weather, stick around, it'll change."
College Senior,2,"There are only 3 dining halls on campus. Two are all you can eat all the time. The main one is more food court style and you get robbed every time you eat there. Overall the food isn't very good either. It's not bad, but it's not worth eating there for three meals a day either."
College Sophomore,2,The housing is expensive and sometimes shoddy. This is typical of almost every college campus.
College Sophomore,2,"The ratio of guys to girls is 4:1. The girls are all right for the most part, nothing to special, but you can meet some awesome ones. The guys on the other hand are either hardcore larpers(live action role playing)  or  some of the most ""macho men"" frat boys on the planet. I honestly have no idea where are the normal ones are hiding. The girls down here have a saying ""The odds are good but the goods are odd"". It is pretty accurate."
College Sophomore,2,"The permit cost is fairly reasonable, but the school is small and there are limited spaces. The enforcement is reasonable, not totally terrible, but not free-wheeling either. The need for a car on campus is not existent but the need for one to get around town is high. There is hardly any public transportation and stuff is not easy to walk to, so find a friend with a car is you want to go to Wal-mart. Parking spaces can be easy to find if you go at the right times, but when it gets busy, its really hard to find spaces because of the limited parking. However, it isn't totally unreasonable."
College Freshman,2,Rolla is not a place where you can walk everywhere. Mainly a car innovated city. takes 30 mins just to make a Walmart run.
College Sophomore,2,"Rolla has some activities to do, but for the most part there's not much. There are a few stores, but the supply is limited. There is one movie theater, but it is kind of expensive to go to. This doesn't mean that you can't find things to do. Most people can keep busy. There are a lot of gamers and nerds on campus as well."
College Freshman,2,"Currently Missouri S&T is doing geothermo drilling on campus and tearing up parking lots. There is limited space and you must buy a permit. If you are parked in a lot with out that sticker you will get fined. It's not a necessity for a car on campus, but when traveling across town it is nice."
College Freshman,2,hard to get a parking permit to the dorm where you're stayin unless you applied really early
College Junior,2,"There are drugs on campus, and it's obvious if you know people. It's not like people around you are forcing it on you though. You'd have to seek it out for yourself. Drinking is definitely the bigger deal here."
College Sophomore,2,"Rolla in a Nutshell – The town of Rolla, Missouri is a very small rural town. The core of the town is Rolla, on the outsides lay a very rural minded people. Most residents are very friendly towards the university, but as a student you dred coming back to Rolla, especially if you are from a large town."
College Sophomore,2,"Missouri S&T Athletics is a growing area at the University. In recent past the sports teams have been sub par, but with recent funding to the sports the school is beginning to come and support our teams at home games. All of the athletes are friendly and very intelligent (engineering school). 

Home games are certainly a place to go support your school while meeting new friends and having a good time away from homework."
College Junior,2,"Lots of Mediocre Choices – There are the typical fast food places, but the ""nicer"" restaurants are pretty expensive and still aren't very good. Jimmy John's is probably the most popular place to eat since it's across the street from campus, delivers later than anywhere else, and is moderately priced. Koi has probably the best sushi but is the most expensive of the three sushi places in Rolla. There's also a frozen yogurt shop called Spoon Me that is wonderful and close to campus. Almost everything in Rolla is close to campus, which is pretty convenient. There are also tons of bars and most of them are cheap. Tater Patch is a bar that has yummy meals that last three meals for relatively cheap."
College Sophomore,2,"One of My Biggest Issues Living in Rolla – Of the fast food chains in town, most branches end up being sub-par (the Taco Bell and Steak and Shake there make me sick), but there are reliable places to go nevertheless (I rely on JJ, Subway, Papa Johns, sometimes Maid Rite etc.). I love the Kyoto (Japanese) and Alex's Pizza (local joint, a bit on the costly side) that we have, but I'm not sure about the couple other Japanese places that we have. I've been strongly advised against the Mexican and Chinese restaurants."
College Junior,2,"The Greek Life system at S&T is not at all typical when comparing it with Greek powerhouses like most SEC schools. Fraternities don't have a traditional rush at all, many hand out bid cards to potential members after speaking with them shortly at orientation, as early as March and April. 
It's also actually cheaper to live in a Greek house than in on campus housing, so that removes any stigma of Greeks being ""snobby rich kids"" on campus."
College Junior,2,"Not Much Interest – Most students don't come here to play sports, or spectate them. I enjoy attending games, but most of the student body is unaware or simply uninterested, and it shows."
College Freshman,2,"Not Much There – If your looking for a fun night life or plenty to go and do Rolla is not the place. Although, if you have 4-wheelers and/or love camping then there is plenty of beautiful nature as far as the eye can see."
College Freshman,2,"Subway Is Always Good – Only a few places close enough to walk to. Subway is the probably the most consistently tasty and affordable. Panera bread and Jimmy Johns are good too. Taco bell has given many students the ""runs"". Coltons steak house is real good but expensive for college students. The donut king is good for donuts and ice cream. I guess there's more to choose from if you can bike or drive a little further."
College Senior,2,Boring College Town – There isn't much to do because the town is very small but if you have friends you'll be fine.
College Sophomore,2,"Nightlife is for those over 21.  The school has many clubs that you can join.  They have many get-togethers to try to recruit more members.  I don't participate in clubs because I enjoy competitions in MAGIC card games and video, computer, and different game systems' games."
College Sophomore,2,"Thomas Jefferson Hall – My first year living at Thomas Jefferson Hall in Rolla, Mo was an extremely pleasing atmosphere. All the guys were very respectable and reminded me of the group of guys back at home. However, after my second year, my opinion has drastically changed. There are people who refuse to take showers and clean up after themselves. It has been an extremely disappointing second year, and I cannot wait to move off campus."
College Student,2,The dorms that I live at do not offer enough parking spaces for all the residents requiring some of the resident to park a few blocks away.
College Freshman,2,"I would say our sports are mediocre to average at best. As far as a division 2 school goes we are OK, but involvement isn't high and neither is performance or support."
College Sophomore,2,"The weather here is very unpredictable. One day its snowing, and the next its 60 degrees. Be prepared for rain. it rains a lot here."
College Sophomore,2,There are RA's that check our dorms each night to look for kids who are passed out in the hallway or doing things that they shouldn't be. I wouldn't say that it is very strict. I live in a holistic community so we are mature enough to know what we shouldn't be doing. Other dorms have more problems with drinking and smoking though. Campus police are very quick to show up if something happens.
Recent Alumnus,2,Focused on Academics – Looks are not really a focus with students on campus. People actually look down on you if you dress up. Most of the students are there for engineering so that is what they focus on... and drinking.
College Sophomore,2,"Make Sure to Stock up at Costco Before Classes Start – There are only three dining areas on campus. Two are in the dorms and all you care to eat. The food is basically the same from week to week- not very good. EVERY Friday at those two dining halls is taco day, but the tacos are not good. The third dining hall is more like a food court: sandwich place, Mexican food, pizza, burgers, and one that can best be described as home cooking. The pizzas are among the greasiest I've ever seen. The place I eat most often is Einstein Bagel Bros. They have most, but not all, of the offerings of a free standing Einstein's. Occasionally the bagels are a bit stale and it's usually fairly busy. Overall, the food is decent, occasionally quite good but usually that's not the case. I would suggest bringing a lot of snacks or even meals to your dorm so you can have something good to eat in case nothing on campus sounds good."
Freshman,1,"I've heard that it gets better when you become an upperclassman, but for those looking to start here instead of transferring in: BEWARE of weeding classes. Example: Nearly every major has to take general chemistry. There was one professor who taught 3 classes of 400 students per semester for that class. Atrocious. The highest class average grade for the quarterly tests was 48% and the lowest was 18%. This was not curved. Goodbye GPA dependent scholarships."
College Junior,1,School athletics are pretty sad. I only usually attend soccer games because I have friends that play.
College Sophomore,1,"This is a very poor school. All of it seems cobbled together and unplanned. There is no overall direction among the administration and the departments don't seem to communicate. The classes are artificially difficult and arbitrary. Parking is a nightmare and the school continues to admit hundreds more every year when the school cannot handle it. The campus food is atrocious and cannot meet demand, and when you can get through the line before the limited hours end, you'll end up with food poisoning."
College Junior,1,"Parking sucks, they are crazy about ticketing people and there are very few free spots alongside roads"
College Junior,1,"In Missouri it can be snowing one day and blazing hot the next, especially in spring and fall.  It is bipolar weather"
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms here are okay for the first semester and than you are ready to move out. The rules are very strict, worse than high school co-ed field trip rules. The dorms don't offer anything more than a pool table, volleyball court and vending machines. For the amount of money there should be more options at the residential housings."
College Sophomore,1,Very few buses or any transportation except for huge planned events
College Sophomore,1,"Unbelievably difficult to find a spot ANYWHERE. There are no where near enough parking spots for the dorms, classes or even the visitors parking lots. Its almost impossible to get a parking permit unless you sign up at midnight the day the registering goes out. And even if you park in the visitors lot for 20 minutes you'll get a ticket. The parking police are so difficult to work with  and sometimes don't even respond to your emails. It seems like they just care about that ten dollar parking ticket they gave you."
College Sophomore,1,"Our sports are very much overlooked. We are definitely mathletes or athletes but the people who do participate in them give it their all. They seem very dedicated, but are overlooked by most students I feel."
College Freshman,1,The food is very rarely good. I had better food at my high school cafeteria. The pizza in TJ hall is good sometimes.
College Freshman,1,There really isn't any transportation here. If you need to get around you either walk or use your own car.
College Senior,1,Guys to Girl Ratio Is Terrible – There are nerdy boys everywhere!! Not too many girls on campus it is getting better though.
College Sophomore,1,"Missouri S&T offers a great education; that should answer your question pretty well. The only great shopping you will find here is online. You will have a lot of free time on your hands which is sometimes a good thing because the schoolwork is tough. Unless you're used to that small town or rural atmosphere you might have a rough time getting used to it. Luckily, St.Louis and Mizzou aren't far away!"
College Sophomore,1,"A Lot of White Students – Being a black student on campus like MST's you feel somewhat out of place; like a hockey puck on an ice rink. (Lol,  a bit of exaggeration but you get my point.) Rolla is a very rural community and I have heard a good share of racist comments, from both the locals and students (depending on where they came from). MST does do their part in trying to recruit more black students and it is getting better. There is a good number of international students and a lot of different religious beliefs."
College Freshman,1,"You Better Be Lucky – Twice per academic year there are ""career fairs"" that students can attend to talk to employers to try to get internships. However the employers really only hire in fall so the spring career fair is a joke. That's it... that one fall career fair is the only help from the university that you will get to obtain an internship and you better be lucky because they go fast and you are considered a failure if you don't get one."
College Junior,1,"""The Odds Are Good, but the Goods Are Odd&quot – Title says it all. Rolla is a very male dominated school, and a lot of girls go in hopeful since the ratio works to their advantage, but the guys are pretty nerdy for the most part. A lot of average-looking girls let the ratio go to their head and develop ""Rolla Princess Syndrome"". Pretty self-explanatory."
College Freshman,1,Who Cares – This is an engineering school; sports are available but not a priority. I personally don't care about sports at all.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no option for transportation except for driving your own car to class, which is okay except the school is continuing to grow, but they refuse to put more parking lots on campus. The campus police are like Nazis and will give you a ticket in a heartbeat. Typically, a campus parking sticker is around $150. If you live off-campus, I would recommend bringing a bike or good luck finding an open parking spot."
College Sophomore,1,"Seriously. Some people drive, I just don't get it."
College Sophomore,1,"During the semester there is no nightlife. No life really, just studying. The way I see it, you've got parties, homework, and sleep. Pick two. Sure, there are parties to be had, but it's difficult to keep up with if you don't LIVE in a frat house-- which a lot of us don't."

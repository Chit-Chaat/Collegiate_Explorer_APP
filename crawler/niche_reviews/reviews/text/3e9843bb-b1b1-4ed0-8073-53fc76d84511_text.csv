Sophomore,5,"Everybody here is very nice and supportive. The professors do a great job with their students and most of the interactions with professors are very personal. My professors all know my name, and it is a very supportive environment."
Freshman,5,Marietta College offers a wide variety of courses I have never been able to find anywhere else. The classes are well-paced and the professors make sure that they are able to contact you within a short amount of time to address any questions you may need answered.
Freshman,5,Marietta College is providing me with a high-quality education in a welcoming environment. The administration and faculty are very encouraging and friendly!
Freshman,5,I love Marietta College’s close knit community. Everyone knows everyone. I wish there was more dining options but overall it is a great school.
Sophomore,5,"Marietta is a home away from home. In a more realistic sense, for me, it is more of a home than my home with my family. The people I have met have made me realize why I truly love Marietta. It was so easy to connect with people at a small college like Marietta. The students and faculty at Marietta push me to the best version of myself."
Niche User,5,I really liked the small-town atmosphere of the campus and that the professors cared so much about their students.
Freshman,5,"Great college that has provided me with a great college experience so far, and I'm looking forward to the next few years here."
Sophomore,5,I like the atmosphere put forward by current students here at Marietta College. Everyone has a positive outlook on everything from academics to athletics. The professors and staff are always willing to take the extra step to get to know each and every student on not only a first name basis but even some strong relationships as well. The professors work hard to help each and every student and even offer help outside of class and sometimes even office hours. The coaching staff at Marietta try their best to help each athlete achieve their greatest potential in not only their sport but their academics as well. Marietta College puts academics at the top of their priorities and has many resources available to students to help them stay on task and achieve their goals.
Junior,5,"""The second I visited the campus I felt like I was home away from home."" This is what the majority of people say when you ask what they love about Marietta. I like that the faculty/staff, and community are so welcoming and strive for all students attending marietta to have the greatest success and reach full potential. Academics could not be any better. As typical the food is not so great with only 3 campus options that are not always open."
Freshman,5,My experience was very nice and enjoyable! I cannot wait to attend Marietta in the fall. The students I stayed with were very easy to talk to and made everything not so awkward.
Sophomore,5,"I love the at home feeling I get when I walk down the christy mall. Anywhere you walk into you are always greeted with a smile by the staff or professor. Marietta College student,staff, and alumni feels like one big happy family. One thing that could be improved is the dining. The food is great sometimes other times it's not the best and sometimes you stay completely away from it."
Niche User,5,Marietta College is very focused on the academic success of the student but balances that with the care and concern of the student themselves.  Class size are awesome and does not allow a student to get lost in the crowds. The family feel on the campus is very comforting and the support from the community is reassuring.
Sophomore,5,"If you're looking for a small, academically-inclined college, this is the best place to go! It's easy to find your way around campus and there are so many resources available to students. It doesn't end after four years! Alumni can come back to receive help with finding a job or using any of the resources available."
Alum,5,"College is what you make of it so if you're looking to stay in your dorm all day and night, you won't like it anywhere. Marietta has many more opportunities than most other schools because of its small class sizes and residency requirement. You can easily find ways to get deeply connected to studies, friends, organizations, and the community."
Niche User,5,I’m really happy with my choice to come to MC. The teachers are great and the students are very nice.
Niche User,5,I took undergrad business classes for my MBA at OU. My wife and daughter are graduates in art and theater. Very nice small college and town. Great teachers who are here to teach and not primarily to publish.
Alum,5,"When I attended MC, it was nearly perfect. The student body was incredibly involved and respectful of one another—from athletes to Greeks to independents—and you would likely find yourself actively involved in several different clubs and hanging with a variety of friend groups (it's small, so it can't be cliquey). Professors truly go above and beyond—increasing your intellectual curiosity is not the only thing that drives them. They want you to succeed in life, no matter your political philosophy or outside interests, in fact, they take the time to get to know you as an individual, and will not hesitate to call you out on your crap (which you need sometimes when you are 18-22). The administration has changed A LOT over the last couple of years (killing some of the soul that made Marietta awesome), but they have responded by turning the reigns over to a leadership team that has their sights set on making Marietta the place it should and ALWAYS should have been."
Freshman,5,So far its been great! I'm a part of the petroleum engineering program which is amazing! The professors are all open and helpful. The classes are small and you really feel at home here. The athletics aren't bad but all the programs are improving such as soccer. The campus is really nice and clean. Everyone is friendly and open and willing to help you in any way necessary. 
College Freshman,5,Housing on campus is amazing. Dorms are spacious and the amenities are nice. I love my roommate and my dorm.
College Sophomore,5,"We have the long blue line at Marietta, where any graduate can have contacts that will help them find a job. There are many employers recruiting on campus, for some major more than others. However, all graduates have access to the long blue line."
College Sophomore,5,"We have the long blue line at Marietta, where any graduate can have contacts that will help them find a job. There are many employers recruiting on campus, for some major more than others. However, all graduates have access to the long blue line."
College Sophomore,5,"Our schools makes sexual assault a priority and makes sure students know the importance. While neither me or any of my friends have been victims of sexual assault,  I know our school makes sure any victim feels safe and able to come forward and get the help they need."
College Sophomore,5,"Marietta College is an engaging school the professors always know their students personally also the community is a vital part of their education. Service is a big part of the curriculum at Marietta; students stay actively involved in different service projects on campus, around the community, and in other parts of the world."
College Junior,5,I really enjoy living in the dorms. I like the variety of design in all the dorms that we have.
College Junior,5,You have your good and not so good professors here. I have been privileged that the good outweigh the others.
College Sophomore,5,"I have been very fortunate to have to found an awesome advisor who helps with picking the classes that are right for me. Most classes range anywhere 40 students to 6 students. There are a decent amount of classes offered, but one has to be careful and see if it certain courses are only offered during the fall or spring semesters."
College Sophomore,5,"I could not be happier with my experience at Marietta College thus far, it was easy to find professors who genuinely care about me and about my success. There are lots of ways to get involved and the library will become one of your best friends during stressful times with its quiet study atmosphere. It's also crazy fun to go to the basketball and baseball games!"
Recent Alumnus,5,School has a good reputation.
Recent Alumnus,5,"As a science major, Fayeweather dorms were right next to the Science Center. This was convenient as many of my classes were early in the morning. I enjoyed the quiet atmosphere and single living that this dormitory offered."
College Freshman,5,"The way that they integrated the students in was amazing! It gave me a chance to grow even more before classes started and I have made amazing friends! There's always something to do or look forward to on campus, and everyone is so nice, students and faculty alike. The staff are dead set on everyone doing well and everyone succeeding and it's a great positive atmosphere. I couldn't have asked for anything better!"
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus. There is nearly zero crime. We have a superb police staff. There are call boxes positioned throughout campus. Campus police will come pick you up if you need a ride late at night.
College Senior,5,"It's quiet on campus, comfortable for studying."
College Senior,5,The small class size is very comfortable.
College Senior,5,The career center on campus is very helpful.
College Freshman,5,the best smalltown in Ohio.
College Freshman,5,It is a great oppurtunity! Great for internships.
College Sophomore,5,I love the housing opportunities on campus. I always have enough room (and then some!). It feel very at-home here because the accommodations are excellent and the staff are very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,"I never feel unsafe on campus. There are some parts of town away from the college where I wouldn't feel very safe so I don't feel comfortable running alone that way (for exercise). However, I never really fear for my safety while I'm at school."
College Freshman,5,It is great. There are a lot of people involved and the fraternities and sororities on campus do a lot. They are very involved and they help with a lot of activities on campus. I love my chapter!
College Sophomore,5,I am involved in Greek Life and it's definitely one of the best decisions I've made.
College Sophomore,5,"Nightlife in Marietta is limited but a lot of fun. The students have fun with what they do and where they go, and make the best of what's available."
College Student,5,"So far so good, of course in time i will be able to answer in more detail."
College Student,5,"As far as academics are concerned i feel for it being a private college, it's the best the Mid Ohio Valley has to offer."
College Student,5,The reason i want to attend Marietta College is because of it's wonderful Psychology program.
College Student,5,Transportation is not a issue.
College Student,5,"Only have ate one meal from the dining hall, however; it was amazing."
College Student,5,Beautiful small historic town with lots of charm and class.
College Student,5,"Small campus, small town = security."
College Student,5,"When i toured the campus, everything was close. Weather would not be a issue."
College Freshman,5,very happy with the course chosen.
College Sophomore,5,Marietta college has an outstanding academic background. This school is meant for those who enjoy hard work and a high gpa
College Sophomore,5,"As an Early Childhood Education major- I will soon partake in student teaching. I feel that this is in a way an internship- a way to test your skills and knowledge. The time commitment will be large, as well as the expense as the gas money and travel will be coming from my own pocket. But I believe that this will be well worth it in the end."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I was a biology major at Marietta. One of the best things about the department is the professors. They're all brilliant! Also, seniors must complete a capstone project (as do all other majors). Although it was difficult I enjoyed the way the biology department organized the capstone process because I feel that it does a good job of preparing seniors for graduate level research or if research is even something you are interested in. 
The biology department also holds many events ranging from department cookouts on the lawn to speakers pertaining to certain fields of study. They spend  a lot of time trying to help students figure out what it is they want to do with their degree and a lot of speakers were invited to explain their career and the requirements to get a job. 
Another thing that is unique to our department is the summer trips they take. The department has traveled to places such as Costa Rica, The Cayman Islands, Utah and others. The trips are relatively cheap compared to what they would normally be if you were to travel outside of the college event and can even be used for class credits."
College Freshman,5,"Greek life at Marietta is pretty average. It is one of the best decisions I've ever made to join, and it helped me feel like I was truly a part of campus as I went to Marietta as the only one from my whole region."
College Freshman,5,"The College keeps the students aware of every situation through text messaging, email and even calling the students on campus if something were to happen."
College Freshman,5,I choose this college for the petro degree offered.  It is known to be one of the best.   I believe my professors do know what they are talking about.  Marietta grads are working all over the place in the petro industry.
College Freshman,5,My classes are very tough.  I have only been there since last fall and I an really learning alot.
College Junior,5,"I've never had any personal experiences, but the rules are the rules."
College Junior,5,The campus appears to be safe. I never feel scared.
College Freshman,5,"Marietta has multiple labs, both Macs and otherwise. Hermann Fine Arts has a Mac Lab specifically for the Arts Programs."
Sophomore,4,"Marietta College shut down campus and sent us home in the middle of the Spring 2020 semester. We changed our classes from in person to online. The online classes were a less hands on than in person, and not all the professors were not as engaged with their students. Marietta did the best they could with the switch to online classes, but I prefer in person classes."
Freshman,4,I have not taken any online classes. I do look to do some online classes in the future though. Hopefully that will safe some cost.
Freshman,4,Marietta is an overall very good college. From student life to the academics every thing is good. Also the city Marietta itself is a nice place.
Freshman,4,Marietta College had great plans laid out for remote learning that we didn’t miss a beat. It was an adjustment for all but the campus community was prepared.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Marietta College has been a windy road. I have really enjoyed the students, staff, and professors because they are willing to help you with anything. Marietta is my home away from home and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. I enjoy the tight-knit community and the way you feel welcomed as soon as you step foot on campus. One thing I would like to see on campus is everyone getting iPads to use because several classes do this, but not everyone is in one of those classes."
Alum,4,"Marietta is definitely a small school and I loved it. It had a good mix of student diversity, and the professors really care about you doing well. The only issue I have with it is the Office of Community Living is pretty bad. They have no idea what they are doing and it gets super annoying, but if you are able to avoid interacting too much with them, it's that much better."
Freshman,4,"I love the campus and most of the professors are very good instructors. Other than cost, Marietta is an amazing school all around."
Junior,4,"Marietta College fosters a strong academic community that really challenges and encourages students to always question, pursue, and strive for knowledge. I have been pushed out of my comfort zone in many ways that have allowed me to grow closer to the person I want to become. The food, however, is not the best at Marietta as compared to other campus cafeterias."
Freshman,4,Marietta College always has a lot of events both on campus and in the community to get students involved. Everybody on campus is friendly and willing to help out their fellow classmates and people in town.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy Marietta College very much. My professors have been very helpful, wanting us to get the best education possible, motivating us in the classroom. The campus is beautiful, and walking at night is a great experience. The small campus helps make walks between classes less difficult. The food on campus is good, but the staff is even better, happy to serve students on campus. The student life is great in that there is always some event happening on campus. Overall, my experience at Marietta College has been great, and I look forward to attending for the next few years."
Freshman,4,"It has been nice to be here! Coming from a very small town, Marietta has been a nice stepping stone for me to get used to larger populations. The teachers work very hard to help you, I have not come across any faculty member that would not greet you with a smile after some recognition! They are very flexible for office hours and for if you just want to talk! Some are the dorms are nice sized, but in freshman housing, prepare to burn alive in the summer and winter. The classes are intense, I have thankfully been getting by, but I had no idea how hard some of them would be. The food is okay, and Greek life is present but not pushy. A nice small college with a close knit community."
Niche User,4,I was recruited there for football and when I came for an overnight visit I absolutely loved it. I had a great time everyone was very friendly and helpful and I just had an overall great experience.
Junior,4,"I love Marietta College, but there are a few things I would change. The dining hall could use some changes, with more healthy food options. Also, freshman housing is older and needs improvement."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy college. I like most of my professors. I am not completely overwhelmed. It has been a pretty good experience so far.
College Freshman,4,Helping students find jobs and internships is clearly very important to the school. The career center does an amazing job of helping. Each professor really cares and they are constantly emailing students about internships and job opportunities
College Freshman,4,It is very good. Campus Police do a good job of being available and helpful to student. The school did an amazing job on explaining and trying to prevent sexual assault. One of the most helpful things about college orientation was their assault lessons.
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are very spacious and are kept clean. the freshmen dorms are especially large to ease you in to resident life. The social atmosphere is great with different communities to choose from so that you can live with people with similar interests.
College Junior,4,I like the small class size and how you can become close to professors.
College Junior,4,"For a small college, I think that we do have a variety of majors and minors for students to take advantage of."
College Junior,4,The campus police are really friendly and they really are there to help you!
College Junior,4,The men's basketball team has out shined most of the other teams. Baseball is also really popular.
College Sophomore,4,I think with most majors there is a club you can join that is in association with it. This is a huge benefit because the upperclassman can help the underclassman with similar problems they may have had and then when they underclassman eventually graduate they can always contact that people that were ahead of them and see if they can help them get employment.
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, the campus is extremely safe and well lit at night. The campus police can be to you in a moments notice and are always checking in and around campus at night and during the day."
College Sophomore,4,Freshman dorms are extremely spacious and have lots of lobby areas for social gatherings or study groups. The upperclassman housing has lots of options on what kind or groupings and room you want. Although they are generally a little small they are very nice and still fit all your belongings.
College Sophomore,4,Greek life on campus is very philanthropically focused and they help improve the school while having a fun time. There are some stereotypes that come along with each fraternity or sorority but it doesn't become your label and they aren't super strong and non-greeks don't treat them any different. All of the housing is close to campus and nice.
College Sophomore,4,"Athletics are definitely very important at Marietta College, especially considering a good amount of people on campus are involved because it is a smaller school. The fan support of some of the sports like basketball and baseball are not solely from the students but from people in the community and it was an incredible experience to see an entire town come together for a sporting event."
Recent Alumnus,4,Security has increased over the years.
Recent Alumnus,4,Many were involved in Greek life. They seemed to enjoy the experience.
Recent Alumnus,4,The school is a great small school experience with individualized attention in the classroom.
Recent Alumnus,4,"As a student athlete, I felt very important to the campus and appreciated by others for my hard work."
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe on campus. I do still get paranoid at times, I am sure everyone does. The campus police are very active and involved."
College Freshman,4,"The class were relevant and very professional. The professors knew what they were talking about and they also seem very professional. They were helpful and understanding. The classes were for the most part understanding, although there are many that are very difficult."
College Sophomore,4,Campus police were easy  to find and always willing to help
College Sophomore,4,This school was the best in the country for is petroleum field
College Freshman,4,The staff and professors working within Marietta have given me an opportunity to stay close to home and still achieve my goal of majoring in not only geology but petroleum engineering as well.  Throughout the application process the staff has greeted me with only kindness and tips. From the day of the college tour all the way to orientation they have blessed me with focus and good intentions on how to set me towards my goals. All information can be gathered quickly and used to put other events into place.
College Junior,4,The adminstration take care of the students. Not everyone is going to enjoy them but they do their jobs well
College Freshman,4,"There are four sorrorities and four fraterniites on campus. There's usually actiivty at the frats on weekends. Each has their own house. While Greeks usually sponsor or are a part of most social events, non-Greeks actively participate. There are no hostilities between Greeks and non-Greeks."
College Freshman,4,I love Marietta! It's beautiful here. There just isn't a lot to do.
College Senior,4,I really enjoy the academic side of our school. Small class sizes and focused attention from professors makes learning much easier.
College Senior,4,"Graphic design has its pros and cons. There's a lot of individual attention thanks to small class styles, but then again diversity is a good thing for art."
College Senior,4,I personally feel very safe on campus. The campus police are very personable and nice and the very few times there was a questionable person on campus everyone was notified via email or phone call.
College Senior,4,"Student life is great on campus. We have a pretty new rec center, library, and dorm building."
College Senior,4,"Athletics are a pretty big deal, but Men's basketball seems to be the favorite of the athletic director and fans alike."
College Freshman,4,great to be on a name basis with the professors.
College Freshman,4,"There is great variety of majors, even though there are a few that kind run the school."
College Freshman,4,the variety of off-campus dining is a great. There is a little bit of everything for everyone.
College Freshman,4,sports are fun to watch and everyone attends.
College Sophomore,4,"There are a few chapters that can be a little overbearing at times, but for the most part everyone is very excepting. I am considering joining and everyone seems to be very friendly."
College Sophomore,4,"The rules are very reasonable and they make sure that people are following the rules. If you break the rules, they are very fair with their judicial process."
College Sophomore,4,I love the education department. The professors are really friendly and care about how you are doing. The department can be very unorganized at times though.
College Sophomore,4,They really make sure that you go into your field prepared for what you are going to be doing.
College Sophomore,4,"Varsity sports on campus offer challenges and evoke pride, but if a student doesn't want to participate they have the option to focus on other priorities."
College Freshman,4,"I am one of the lucky ones. I have a really nice and spacious room. However, I live on the floor with the kitchen and sometimes it smells and is really dirty."
College Senior,4,I feel very safe on campus
College Senior,4,Facilities are high quality and nicely kept
College Senior,4,Living at home as a commuter student has worked out well for me so far.
College Senior,4,Nice dining hall with a few other options
College Sophomore,4,Marietta College is a small school which allows for students to have a closer relationship with professors who are extremely willing to help students at any time.
College Sophomore,4,"I love that I chose to attend Marietta College. I am very involved on campus and am also in a sorority, Sigma Kappa. Marietta has taught me so much and I cannot wait to see what else I can learn in these next few years."
College Sophomore,4,"I am a Psychology Major and within this program, they allow a five-year masters program which is very convenient for students enrolled in this program."
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is disappointing on campus.  Every few fraternities or sororities.  The Greek life housing is bad.
College Freshman,2,"Marietta College is a great school if all you want to do is go to class and do homework all the time. The social atmosphere is seriously lacking. If you're in a sorority or fraternity there are some things to do on the weekends, but otherwise count yourself out. Also, don't even think about doing anything moderately sneaky in your dorm room - you will get in trouble for having music that is too loud. Dorms are typically small and the heating and air conditioning (if you have it) is spotty at best. Also, the power goes out quite frequently. During the winter months, the roads are not salted, and the parking lots are not taken care of. The price is extremely high and still rising. Also, trying to negotiate with the housing process is impossible. I was explicitly told that ""We don't want you to like your roommate, you just have to stand them."" With tuition as high as it is, I would like to at the very least be comfortable in my living environment."
College Senior,2,"We have a couple good places to eat, but when you start going there for every meal, even they get old. The main dining hall is consistently pretty bland with questionable quality of food. The highlight of dining is the Pit Stop where you can buy food with declining balance until midnight."
College Senior,2,The Weather changes and does not like to stay the same. It rains a lot and the sun does not like to shine. Most of the time it is very gloomy and ugly out.
College Sophomore,2,"The selection is somewhat limited and unhealthy. Hygiene is not a big deal to those who work in the dining areas. they rarely wear gloves, and those who do, don't change them often."
College Sophomore,2,"people mostly find a circle of friends to associate with and don't make the effort to meet new people, but are still friendly. there is also what they call a 3 point differential , meaning a 10 here is a 7 everywhere else. IT's fairly quiet,  as people don't socialize much and don't go to the school planned events."
College Freshman,2,"There's not a whole lot to do here on the weekends if you don't drink. You can always go to the mall or watch a movie, but other than that there's not much to do."
College Freshman,2,The city of Marietta doesn't have a bus station so transportation is somewhat difficult. The only reliable means of transportation around campus is the campus police.
College Sophomore,2,"They really only give you financial aid, and then once scholarships are given to you your freshman year, you have no chance to get new ones or increase them... Very poorly run"
College Junior,2,"Average from What I've Seen – I have yet to live off campus, but I have been to a few off campus houses. The houses are old, dirty (without real hope of being CLEAN clean again), and some are dilapidated. Obviously the furnishings are scarce because we're college students, but cracks in the walls, dents here and there, old flooring and aged appliances definitely infest each home. No one will have a dream-home while going to college, so for a college student opting for off-campus housing that has a history of being rented out to college students, I give a C. Most homes are nearby and safety usually isn't an issue if precautions like locking your doors, are taken."
College Junior,2,"Diverse With Dissent – We are a small college, so pretty much everyone knows everyone. Ethnic groups tend to stay together, even at sporting events. Sometimes there are outbreaks of offense and lack of respect is found. Unfortunately these times happen, but otherwise everyone is usually quite calm and accepting of the other. It seems that people like to stay in their comfort zone. Sports teams usually bring a mix of students, and that is always something good to see. Marietta is really keen on diversity and acceptance, we bring in speakers to reinforce the necessity to bring this average grade of a C up to an A."
College Sophomore,1,Some of the dorms are better than others.  in my opinion the dorm I live in is the worst dorm on campus.  I was forced to live here as well.
College Sophomore,1,I hate this school with a passion.  Being a African-American student from the city it is hard to adjust to this majority white small school in the middle of no where.  Faculty and staff are very helpful and do genuinely care about your future.  The sports teams are terrible except for the baseball and basketball teams.  Overall this is not the ideal college experience.
College Freshman,1,What party scene. You get yelled at for having music too loud or even talking about drinking.
College Senior,1,Its hard to tell what off-campus living is really like because it is nearly impossible to actually get approved to live off campus by the school.
College Senior,1,"There is no off campus transportation at Marietta College. Ether you have a car or your friend does. That is the only way you can get around, because most fast food joints and walmart are only possible to reach with a car. "
College Senior,1,"There are never any parking spots next to my dorm. They fill up way to fast and is very annoying. The parking permit cost way to high, and ticket you about every other week for no reason. It is just ridiculous how bad anything parking related is. "
College Senior,1,"Campus events are terrible at Marietta College, nobody ever shows up to them."
College Senior,1,The school does not allow students to live of campus. They want more money so they force us to live on campus.
College Senior,1,"The financial aid process at my school is difficult and unreliable. There are no tips for getting more money at my school. That is why i cam applying for this scholarship. They do not help you find more money, they keep asking for more."
College Sophomore,1,"I always leave every class in the brown building wanting my hour back. Registering for classes is very tedious process that also involves tremendous time squandering. you have to go to your advisor's office(who is probably in class when you aren't) so he/she can click a button that allows you to make your schedule(pointless, and by then about 2 hours went by). After that, you are to make your schedule n your own. The selection is very difficult to work with and it takes up to 4 hours to make a schedule. When the semester begins, instead of checking in to confirm that you are at school through the internet, a slip, or them checking you in when you get a room key, they make you stand in line in the gym to get a card stamped, which is a problem when every student in the school has to do this. The library becomes a fairly loud place as finals approach, and the professors like to leave you on your own to figure everything out."
College Freshman,1,"Small town has virtually nothing to offer even the most bland persons. There is zero ethnic diversity, statistics show Marietta, OH is the whitest town in the nation. However, the University of Ohio is about 2 hours west and poses some sort of alleviation from boredom."
College Sophomore,1,"The school does not allow student to live off campus since it is a residency college. This poses a problem due to the fact that the tuition is so much, it increases dramatically due to on campus living."
College Freshman,1,"Student Health Center Is Awful – The current facility isn't even a part of the school. The hours that its open are terribly inconvenient for students, and the doctors/nurses there often don't have the slightest clue what they're doing. I went in there for a mild cold and they sent me out with a ton of prescriptions that we're completely useless to me. Also, if you go, be prepared to wait an hour before actually being seen by a doctor."
College Freshman,1,"Construction Nightmare – Good luck as a freshman getting parking. Due to construction the parking is congested. I had to park in the city public parking
2 blocks away just to have a car. It should all improve next year once construction is over. Just be very patient."
College Senior,1,"It's a small college with less than 1,400 people attending. There are parties but nothing like at a bigger college. All the bars are walking distance and most are 18+ to enter, super skanky and just about the only places to party. Coming from a big city to Marietta's nightlife is a big joke."
College Sophomore,1,It is very hard for students to get approved for off campus housing.
College Sophomore,1,No One Cares – The athletic scene at Marietta is about as bad as it can get.

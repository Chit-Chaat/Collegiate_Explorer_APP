Senior,5,"Shaw University has been a great experience for me. Coming from an area in the country does not have Historical Black Colleges and University this was an experience that gave me a different outlook. Being able to see so many African Americans with diverse backgrounds was an eye-opening experience and a learned a lot from many people. Having this exposure will help me in my career and help me socially in life because I have a better understanding of many different types of personalities. 
Having the experience of being around people of color all the time was new and enlightening."

This transition from high school to college will be a breeze!"
Junior,5,"I really love the campus and the size of the school! I would love to see the school raise more money and possible get a on campus football field. Also, I would like to see some new science technology. I think we are on the right track with our new president Dr.Dabroy!"
Freshman,5,"Shaw University is very diverse. Me coming from New York I look forward to being around that type of environment. Just  because Shaw University is A HBCU, it doesn't mean that only black students attend. I've met great friends so far and gained a lot of knowledge and experience in just short amount of time. If I can change one thing about Shaw University it would be that they offered more extra curricular activities because it is important to keep  students involved."
Freshman,5,My experience with Shaw University was great I went to  A visit to Shaw University with the Athletics -Football and just fell in love with the place for a African american black male that is the type of atmosphere I would love to be around its like everybody knows each other and care about each other from what I experienced

College Freshman,5,Shaw helps you get your foot in the door to be able to go into the real world. They help you with trying to find internships/jobs.
College Sophomore,5,Greek life here at school is mostly good at some point. Depending on an event the Greeks will host an interest meeting or some other event where non-Greeks students can come out and learn.

College Junior,5,The shopping mall is the best because it has lots of stores and the prices are affordable.
College Junior,5,"Financial aid has really helped so many students through school. I personally appreciate the government for granting permanent residents and citizens this opportunity. It is also a great thing because ones GPA is not used to determine their eligibility, most student with low GPA would appreciate it."
College Junior,5,"Basketball and football happens to get more recognized, whether they win or loose. Almost all the students watches both home and away matches. This is not right because the school has way more than two sports; the students are supposed to support other sports too, mostly male and female tennis because they always with championships."

College Sophomore,5,greek life here is great and they enjoy everybody
College Sophomore,5,campus security here is great
College Sophomore,5,everybody love the school football team
College Junior,5,Off campus dining is the best considering you can eat whatever you want and whenever you want. The only thing about off campus dining is that it gets costly after a while and you get tired of eating out but then thats where your kitchen comes in.
College Junior,5,"There are many pros of living off campus compared to the cons. Some of the many pros are having freedom, being able to go to your own room, having your own place to go to, and being to do nearly anything you want in your own house. The cons are having to pay rent and having to wake up earlier to get to class on time."
College Freshman,5,The police are pretty good when it comes to the safety of the students on campus.
College Freshman,5,My career goal is become an entertainment lawyer.
College Junior,5,"The Shaw Cape site in Rocky Mount, NC has been extremely life changing for me.

College Sophomore,5,"The instructors are up on their game, they teach in a way that makes learning easy and interesting."
College Sophomore,5,I do not know about the housing situation; I commute.
College Sophomore,5,There are many options available off campus.
College Sophomore,5,Raleigh is a very cultural oriented city.
College Sophomore,5,The dinning is the best. The variety of foods is large.
College Sophomore,5,I am majoring in Religious Education that will allow me to teach in a seminary. The opportunities are great in this area and the school goes out of it's way to provide job opportunities by posting jobs that are available.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Shaw is that they are willing to do the extra mile to help you with anything that you need, if you feel like you're doing bad in a class they'll help you the best way that they can. I would like to see a change in visitation"
Junior,4,"I really like the downtown location of Shaw in Raleigh. The professor are kind and gives you the help you need. They do need to remodel the dorms, the elevators always broke down."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Shaw University was very good. I had high expectations when first going there and for the most part, Shaw held up to those expectations. The school is small but it's a nice size for me. The environment is fun and welcoming. Everybody speaks to each other when they see them. The dorms could be a little better but it's nothing too harsh to complain about."
Junior,4,Very good place to earn a degree of choice . All my instructors are very professional and helpful and available to assist at any moment.
Senior,4,"I am an international student, as many other that came to Shaw. I met many different people coming from different countries. All the diversity at Shaw influences your experience in a good way. School wise, we have good staff, who is dedicated to make you succeed in your career plans. Everyone struggles during school, but there is many people (advisors, professors, students, and the faculty) who are there for us during those times. The only thing I would really like to improve at Shaw would be the quality of classes and doing the practical assignments during the classes instead of mostly theory."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I have loved my expierence here as a Shaw Bear. I do hope the school becomes more organized. Itâ€™s unorginzation sometimes causes students unnecessary stress."
Sophomore,4,"I love my school! Itâ€™s not to large, the campus is beautiful aside from some minor downfalls, and the faculty and staff make it feel Very welcoming. Two things that can be changed,  is the conditions of the dorm facilities, and the cafe food."
Niche User,4,Awesome HBCU!!! Satellite campuses need to be well equipped.  A lot of there financial offices donâ€™t have the information needed for tution
Freshman,4,Shaw University is a prestigious HBCU and the one of the first hbcus in the south in 1865. I love my school and I love the scenery of the town. The professors are fantastic especially my advisor. She has been a professor for a few of my classes and I like her a lot. I wouldn't change anything.
Sophomore,4,Shaw university is a good school to attend. They have a program for working adults to be able to earn a degree. They have a excellent education program. The professors are concerned about their students academic success. They go above and beyond for their students. Although i don't live on campus i am on campus for classes. I believe the campus could use beautification.
Senior,4,"I first attended Shaw back in Fall of 2010 and I left for all the wrong reasons, when I got a chance to come back I went for it, it hasn't been easy but I wouldn't change my decision for anything."
Niche User,4,Very helpful community classes are not that big so teachers are able to help and connect with you more
Sophomore,4,"As a sophomore at Shaw, I always felt at ease on the campus. Just like any campus, it is diverse, interactive and always outgoing. Everyone on campus knows each other because the school is so small. I enjoy the classes because professors are always interacting with students and the library has available resources. Located in the downtown Raleigh area, students can always find something to occupy themselves with on or off campus. One thing I will love to see changed at Shaw will be the lunch menu to serve more healthier meals and the dorms. Students complain about toilets breaking down, elevators being out of service, showers running cold water or being flooded. One time my team mate's room flooded because one of the bathroom water systems broke which caused water to run through out the night and flooding nearby rooms. I understand the building is very old which requires constant maintenance but other than that I am enjoying my time at Shaw."
Freshman,4,Shaw is a great place to network and earn a degree. The faculty supports you deeply and there are a vast of opportunities for students to engage with.
Freshman,4,"It has been a fun and great new experience so far, the food is great the people are okay but I would to like to see some improvements on the academic part"
Sophomore,4,"Shaw University is a very good potential school that needs to expand more, very great lenient teachers who do take time to work with you and classes are very small making it easier with one on one learning."
Freshman,4,Looking at all the academics and everything at Shaw University  its a really good school to look at far as where to go to college
Freshman,4,One thing I like about Shaw is the one on one time we can get with the professors compared to a more bigger college. One thing I dislike is the cafe food. Other than that you just have to stay involved and stay focus.
Freshman,4,I love attending shaw and meeting new people and learning new things and the professor they really do help you when you need help from them
Freshman,4,"my experiences at shaw are great i learned a lot about the history of the school and how each building got there name. also some professors are really willing to help you know the product and help you to make the right choices, overall i would change how the residence halls look and a safer environment where the school is built."
Freshman,4,"As I began my college career I thought it would be pretty cool fulfilling my dream of attending a historically black college. Shaw university is a small university; which is exactly what I wanted. Some of the  teachers cared for your success in college. Shaw University is right downtown with a lot of activities and museums to visit. The cafeteria food wasn't all that bad, but then again I barely at in the cafÃ©. one thing I would lie them to improve with is the dorms and bathroom situation. I think the dorms just needs to be rebuilt as a whole."
Freshman,4,"Shaw University is a good university. The university have history and it's prestigious because it's been around so long. Being around for 151 years is fantastic to me that's one thing I love about the university I attend. Also, most of the faculty and staff cares about the students and willing to help the students if they need it. That's why I love Shaw University because of the faculty and the area it's in."
College Freshman,4,Crime on our campus is <1%; Our school #1 priority is each student safety. Secruity and our police is very visible on campus and nonsense is not tolerated.
College Freshman,4,My first year as a Freshman at Shaw U was a little rocky. As time went on I was able to build new relationships with students and professors/teachers. I took advantage of everything that was offered such as tutoring and joining active groups on campus.
College Senior,4,I truly enjoyed every aspect of the process. I was excited to be a part of such a prestige College...
College Senior,4,I love the professors I can not express that enough. They really do care about your level of learning and they make an effort to make sure each student know the concepts and applications of each course and what is expected of each student..
College Senior,4,Wow my school is the best because the professors care about their students. They are professional and very serious about class work and participation. I would rate this school easily as one of the best schools in the country. Friendly atmosphere. Concern with students success.
College Senior,4,"I enjoy Shaw University and the professors are outstanding and they make you think outside the box, I have learned a lot this semester and look forward to next semester...."
College Freshman,4,At shaw their all of internship and jobs like work study.
College Freshman,4,I love going to shaw it like big family the education is awesome.
College Junior,4,"I love my Shaw U! During the two years that I have endured, I have learned how to manage time management, focus on my work, use my office hours wisely and how to ask for help with anything I need. It has also made me stronger in with being my own individual woman I have inquired to set high standards for myself so that I can come out on top."
College Freshman,4,There are a variety of off-campus residents.
College Freshman,4,There are a variety of places to eat from.
College Freshman,4,There are a lot of things in the vicinity.
College Senior,4,The campus has strict polices at the school
College Senior,4,I haven't had any bad experiences. My only suggestions is don't wait till the last minute.
College Senior,4,"I don't live on campus, I'm in the adult degree program. However, if I had to guess I would say in the popular person dorm. ( House Party)"
College Freshman,4,I love them. they are very active on campus with their educational events.
College Freshman,4,best parties take place at the newer spots
College Freshman,4,Our security guards are on campus all day every day doing check ups and making sure everything is run smoothly and correctly
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy the athletic program at my school for the simple fact that it is very hands on and gives us a lot of opportunities to learn new things. the program is also great for making sure we get internships and have a great start off job when we graduate. The workload is what I am use too and always keeps me ahead of the game.
College Freshman,4,"Shaw is right downtown, and if you get a good dorm room, you can even see the tall buildings. When most people go out, they go to Crabtree Mall. But be careful, because there are a lot of crazy, homeless people (even in McDonalds)."
College Junior,4,Indian restaurant is three miles from my school and it is very affordable.
College Junior,4,The student center is always available for students Monday through Saturday. They are always ready to help students excel.
College Junior,4,"The professors are awesome, they take their time to make student understand."
College Freshman,4,"They help me at every step, with FAFSA, scholarship and Grants. My tip would be to keep your school financial aid informed of what you want."
College Sophomore,4,Im a mass comm student. The department is great. Although the facilities could be better and more expansive.. Shaw does what it can.
College Sophomore,4,Shaws academics are great.. Small class sizes. Register early tho cause they be full quick !
College Sophomore,4,There are no campus shuttles.. campus is small. Public buses are $1 one way. And $2 for a day pass which is extremely reasonable.
College Sophomore,4,Shaw is right by downtown Raleigh.. there's always street fairs and events happening there. That's also where all the off campus food places are.
College Sophomore,4,living off campus is a great experience and gives you the independence that youve may have longed for
College Student,4,the computers are very great there they will help you with anything no matter what.
College Student,4,my major at the school is really great the classes aren't that big and I like how they try to make it fun as well.
College Student,4,the safety of the school is very good and secure
College Student,4,they are very strict at shaw university and am very happy about that to be honest it makes me feel even more safe about going there.
College Sophomore,4,"The professors are great, easy to communicate with, and always willing to help"
College Freshman,4,Everyone at this school is the same  we all are trying our best to make achievements and accomplish something in our lives but we just come from different places all across the country.
College Freshman,4,The major departments in the school are great we have a good criminal justice program all so a great Mass communications department. I am in the Mass communications department an I hear all the time that Shaw U has one of the greatest Jazz radio stations.
College Freshman,4,"The labs are great, your able to always find a place to do your work almost even if the main library is full. Shaw campus has about 3 labs and other places that computers are like the dorms and student centers."
College Freshman,4,The weather here is very nice. Better than most places .
Freshman,2,"My experience at Shaw so far hasn't been the best. Most professors are very welcoming and understanding, they show they care. Campus security isn't great, anyone can come on campus."
Freshman,2,"The main thing I enjoyed was the fact that I made friends with the same intentions. We all came to Shaw with high hopes of becoming more than what we were now. Shaw is a pretty average school, but to me it really doesn't have a lot to offer."
Sophomore,2,My freshmen year of college was not like I thought it would be it feel like I was still  at home. So of the thing I like about Shaw University is that the teachers know you by  names not by number and the people there will help you out and its easy . I would like to change the dorms and some of the rules.
College Freshman,2,"The housing is horrible, the water in the showers smells bad in which we have to wash in, the dorms are old, so a lot of things are broken like the shower heads and the door knobs on the closets in the rooms."
College Freshman,2,There isn't a lot of space and freedom in dorms.
College Freshman,2,I recommend to keep documents of any aid received.
College Freshman,2,"I have eaten in the cafe twice, and we're about to hit final exams next week. I do eat upstairs at BRB. The only downside is that you have to pay for it. My average meal from there is only about four dollars though."
College Freshman,2,Shaw is a horrific school.
College Junior,2,There is absolutely no option for vegetarians. Not good at all
College Sophomore,2,"Shaw gave me little to no financial aid. No grants.. no scholarships.. But 2 measly loans. $24,000? All they covered was $5000"
College Sophomore,2,Athletic center? Shaws gym is smaller than a high school gym. Students aren't allowed to use the workout room. Its strictly for athletes. We don't even have a football field..
College Sophomore,2,The facilities at shaw are old.. There are almost no newly built buildings. Most of them few buildings we have were built in the 1800s when the school was founded.
College Sophomore,2,students on campus usually smoke everyday and its noticeable and i dont think its even acknowledged
College Sophomore,2,at times people get food poison from the food we eat: the food is poorly cooked and not edible most of the time
College Sophomore,2,"You cannot print out anything in color anywhere on the campus, network and wifi speed and reliability isn't reliable."
College Sophomore,2,"I believe the drug safety on our campus is extremely noticeable, and lack control especially from the security standpoint. Shaw is a private university but has over a dozen entrances onto the campus itself. Many people who do not even attend the school enter onto the campus and cause disruption and trouble in which the university claims to have no control over."
College Freshman,2,"I believe we came to College for a reason an one of those reasons have to be to get away from our parents and their rules we want to be free, Shaw U is very strict with everything almost I do not think we have freedom of our own at all, that we do not have no trust within the student body."
College Freshman,2,"Raleigh, NC can be 80 degrees one day and the next it will drop down to 40 degrees with a percentage of rain, or maybe a thunderstorm."
College Freshman,2,"Mostly safe during the day , There is no health center"
College Freshman,2,The transportation for coming to and from home is easily accessible but it is very stressful for me in particular because I am so far from home.
College Freshman,2,"We are treated like children here. There is a certain time to be off the front yard, there is no co-ed housing or visitation."
College Freshman,2,"Since Shaw University is a historically black university; there are more african-american students. Occasionally you would find some international students, but they are only here for certain sports. Other than that when you walk around this campus everything is the same."
College Freshman,2,"Overall, I wouldn't say that the school is bad. It's the administration, the students and various other factors that make the experience a bad one. You make the best of it or if you don't like it, you can transfer. I think it's way too much money. Considering the price is going up to $28k, I'm not planning on staying much longer. One of the perks is that you see the same people everyday. Now, for some guys and girls, that's not a good thing. But, if you like having the sense of a family, you should think about Shaw. My experience, unfortunately, was ruined by failed roommate arrangements and many other social problems. You can hate school but love education."
College Freshman,2,"The police really don't do anything. I was walking into the backdoors of a dorm one day and the campus police were right there and didn't even pay attention to me. I could have been anybody. They're more concerned about not letting parents into the dorms, instead."
College Freshman,2,"For an HBCU, it's not as diverse when it comes to other factors. There is no LGBTQ club at the school and the community is seen but not heard. If you say that you are not Christian, not religious or do not believe in God, you will get crazy looks. "
College Freshman,2,"Roommates can be loud, so if you can get some sleep, you're lucky. There are three vending machines downstairs and two of them work. For the money you pay for room and board, you'd expect a lot more. The upperclassman dorms have problems too (mold, less spacious) but it's a better alternative to the lowerclassman. Security stands in the lobby after midnight but literally anyone can walk through the doors. They just recently started locking the backdoors at night as well. When the air is on, wear a snuggie to bed. If the heat is on, make sure you sleep naked without the covers. And you can't adjust the temperature like you can in the upperclassman dorms. "
College Freshman,2,"From time to time, the ""caf"" will serve something good. We have Fried Chicken Wednesday and Fish Friday. Those are the main days people will go and eat. I'm a vegetarian and it's frustrating that the school doesn't have much to offer those who follow different diets. There's a grille in the student center, Be Right Burger. It's open until 11 so once the caf closes at 7, you can go and get something to eat. It's not free, unfortunately. Not only that, there is a McDonalds across the street or you could go downtown and find a restaurant (Chick fil-a, etc.) but again, it's not free."
College Freshman,2,No where to hang out around campus only at the Den but it's mostly closed
College Freshman,2,Only team that is good is the womens basketball team 
College Freshman,2,The school did not have my major so I had to pick one that they had.
College Freshman,2,They don't have all majors so you have to a lot of research before coming
College Freshman,2,Sometimes it is cold or the food is not cook all the way but its ok sometimes. Have to live with it
College Sophomore,2,"The University can sometimes ruin all of the camous fun, well they usually do!"
College Sophomore,2,"The parking lot is very small, and parking spots are limited."
College Sophomore,2,Shaw was very unprofessional and unorganized. I'll pass.
College Sophomore,2,"The transportation kind of sucks. It onlt runs about every hour, that's kind of inconvenient."
College Freshman,2,I dont feel unsafe because im always walking with somebody but its kind of weird when you walk by a group of people and they just stare.
College Freshman,2,The police force can be strict at times but other times they just sit around .
College Sophomore,2,Most of the student do not have a lot of school spirit.
College Freshman,2,the major I wanted is not there anymore they picked biology for me. it ok but it not what I want to do really.
College Sophomore,2,"The food is ok it looks like you see the same food everyday. But if you are a person who loves food and dont care then you would love it here you have options from grill to like pizza salads, cook food."
College Freshman,2,iam not sure in wasnt told if there was anything to do on campus for my major
Recent Alumnus,2,The connection often does not work and there are very limited computers
College Sophomore,2,There are a lot of African American males and females that attend Shaw University. I have rarely seen any students of different race. But the staff here is more diverse then the students.
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus is the worst. We have a curfew on the yard, which is 12:30 every day. Sometimes we do not have visitation; if we do visitations are only on weekends from 5-11. In my opinion, we are of age why not have visitation all week. I think its better to stay off campus than on campus."
College Senior,2,"its promoted through emails and around campus, very few students take advantage and most of the time its not enough to cover expenses"
College Senior,2,needs a lot of improvement and needs to be more updated
College Senior,2,parking is fair but not enough space for all students that have a vehicle
College Freshman,2,everything closes at a certain time. Most people have late practices or study sessions and when they get out everything near Shaw is closed.
College Senior,2,The atmosphere could be better. The school is centered in a heavy populated area. Traffic is always congested and the signs can be confusing.
Recent Alumnus,2,I dont see a lot of greek life on my school campus. Once in a while I see the AKA's but im not really a fan of Greeks so my opinion may be a little biased.
College Sophomore,2,It Could Be Ten Times Better â€“ The dorms need a lot of work. Rooms have paint chipping and its dusty bathrooms are disgusting
College Junior,2,I wish we had more varieties of food on our menu's.
College Junior,2,"Personal Safety â€“ I feel fairly safe on campus,because I know that the security is always there when I need the."
College Junior,2,My Grade â€“ I'm at a  C because I transfer so many times and I have to get myself in the right path to complete my college. And also have a lot of thing going on with home.
College Senior,2,My Interested Major Wasn't Offered. Didn't offer my choice of accounting at CAPE site.  Took business to compensate.
College Sophomore,2,They Take  Punishments Sonewhat Serious â€“ The policy force is really strict.first time offenders get fined and second time offenders get sent home.You will get caught no matter how much you try to hide it.
College Junior,2,"Could Be Better â€“ Parking is not big enough, its in a grat location though. Students dont have alot of desinated areas to park."
College Freshman,2,"Computer Topics â€“ The Computers at school is very slow and some of the printers have no paper in them. The wireless connection is terrible, the only way I would get Wi-Fi is in the library."
College Senior,2,Cat Bus â€“ They are good up until 11 p.m. Once 11 p.m. hits its usually over for students trying to get home or to their location of choice.
Sophomore,1,"my experience with shaw university has so far been terrible. To start, the dorms have mold and dust, the hot water for the showers barley work, sometimes students even have to take showers in cold water. I had a stomach virus at least three times when eating at shaw university's cafe. The cafeteria is very unsanitary, there are bugs such as roaches crawling around the cafe as students eat, there are even sometimes bugs in the food. The living conditions at shaw are unsafe for students and this university needs a remodel."
Junior,1,As far as academics go this is a great school but the financial aid office and student accounts office hasnâ€™t been any help since Iâ€™ve been her I wish them the best of luck as well as upcoming students
Freshman,1,Donâ€™t waste your time. They are an establishment full of scams and crooked administration. A handful are honest and will help you to the best of the ability . School dorms are NASTY and filled with Mold. Residential life is non existent. Downtown Raleigh is amazing (and so is Raleigh in general) . But the school is just trash and nasty and has nothing for student looking for a real college experience . School security is none existent . You are not safe at all .
Niche User,1,"If you receive any sort of scholarship from Shaw make sure it is received in writing from the school itself. The school likes to promise the coaches less money than they want to give out. I committed to play soccer at Shaw, and then after the deadline for most colleges, I was informed that my scholarship was cancelled. And it happened to band students in the past. Last but not least it is an absolute chore to contact anybody at the school."
Freshman,1,Shaw University is very old school who is unorganized. The staff are rude half of time people are sitting in office want answer phones want email you back or nothing. My mom had to email president to get information. There system is old no direct deposit nobody telling you anything about where your money is going. The rooms do not have cable wifi have of time don't work. The charges for this school is crazy. All extra money they make you pay. I will be attending another college in spring due to these compliants.
College Freshman,1,"Fashion is definitely a thing around campus. Everyday I see at least five people wearing those Adidas soccer pants. A lot of people wear Timberland boots. Everyone dresses the same with joggers and all. Fashion is a thing, but it just lacks originality. There are a lot of attractive guys on colleges, and also attractive girls. Many people hang out with the same circle of people since the college is so small. Most people are nice, but some freshman are too immature to function. The only thing people are interested in is sitting in the yard, talking and staring down people, rather than doing their work. When it comes to relationships, there are just a few couples. The LBGT community is welcome, and I'll honestly say that they are just as many gay girls on campus than straight ones. When it comes to gay males, there are only a select few, but the ones who are stand out and are pretty popular among the girls."
College Freshman,1,"Either you go to Mirage or some other club downtown. I've only been out once, but when I did, it was a disaster. First off, the shuttle to the club was packed. I had to stand up the whole ride there and back. The line to the club was horrendously long.  People were jumping the line and letting their friends skip. We waited for about an hour and a half just to get in. And when we did, we had to pay an unexpected $10 (we were told it was free). The people in the club were having fun, but I couldn't. Every time I tried to dance, someone else pushed me out of the way to dance, since the dance floor was so packed. At one point, my back was rubbing onto some sweaty chubby dude. Boys try to grind with girls but can't handle it so they fall all into other people (quite rudely). One time I was sandwiched in between two dudes that were getting grinded on by some aggressive girls. Not cool, unless you're into that kind of thing."
College Freshman,1,"All I eat is McDonalds and BRB (upstairs from the cafeteria). I've been to Woody's on Wednesday's. They have a good wings special on Wednesdays. It's not a jam packed place, and you get your food in a decent amount of time."
College Sophomore,1,Very rundown and old dorm living quarters. Yes there is a cleaning team but they do a very poor job. Shaw University needs to manage their finances better to make the students more comfortable and safe
College Freshman,1,"Very strict , They fine us for everything we do here. There is no co-ed visitation and no dorm parties. I feel this does an injustice to the college experience.

."
College Freshman,1,I wouldn't choose this school because I don't feel like I should pay this much money for a bad living situation and food that's not healthy. I rather cook my own food because eating healthy is very important to me. 
College Freshman,1,I personally feel that we should not have to pay so much for housing because we don't really have that much and my dorm with 9 floors and 24 rooms on each has to share one microwave. They should change some things.
College Freshman,1,The food is very greasy and not exactly healthy for anybody. We basically have the same food all the time and many students complain about being sick after eating the food.
College Freshman,1,"Concerning health they send students to the hospital, but with no way to get there. Basically its like a nurse at a high school and she isn't around or on campus most of the time. There hasn't been any major crimes on campus just a lot of drunk students and students smoking marijuana. "
College Freshman,1,In our dorms the showers are horrible; most times the water is too cold and the shower heads are busted. There has been students complaining about ladybug infestation and bed bugs. There are no activities for students to do so we usually just complain and walk around looking miserable. 
College Freshman,1,"There is nothing unique about Shaw University, people fight, smoke marijuana, drink alcohol, and always party. Many students go to other schools to enjoy their campus because there is nothing for us to do here."
College Freshman,1,"Often times students are in a hurry to print something off for a class, but they spend more time trying to get the internet to work because all the computers seem to be slow. Although we have four computer labs many of our computers do not work or do not print. "
College Freshman,1,In order to catch the bus you must walk about 10 minutes to the bus station from Shaw University. Many students feel like it would be convenient if we had cars because on Sundays the bus doesn't run. By the time you pay $2.00 everyday for a round trip on the bus you can put gas in a car for the week and get somewhere much faster. 
College Freshman,1,"Although Shaw University is located in downtown Raleigh, North Carolina; most of the restaurants near it are too expensive for college students without a job. Other restaurants are too far out for students to walk, but we can catch the bus if we have the money for that and to eat. Many of my peers have complained because we want to go out to eat, but the restaurants are so expensive and we end up eating McDonald's on those days. "
College Freshman,1,Should of went to a bigger and better school! Students fight almost every week here.
Recent Alumnus,1,i was chosen for a scholarship but it was taken away from me
Recent Alumnus,1,hosing is not working properly and its not affortable
Recent Alumnus,1,"the financial dept is not organized neither is the registar dept., it takes them too long to handle your business, or even to he[p you, or to return a phone call"
College Freshman,1,"The clubs are so small, and it's in the rough spots of Raleigh. The shuttle comes for the girls who want to go clubbing on a Thursday night."
College Freshman,1,"It's not the fact that students drink. Most of the people that do the drink are sloppy with it. Students who are underage will go to the lengths of getting fake ids (which proves irresponsibility to be drinking in the first place). The drinking policy isn't as enforced as the drug policy. Sure students do drugs but the most that anyone ever talks about is weed. There's a significant pressure on you if you say you don't drink or smoke, too... "
College Freshman,1,"For a Christian school, there is often twerking, club music and drinking going on. Surely the admin know about this but they don't seem to care all that much. It's easy to go to the back of buildings and smoke without anyone even caring. If anything, visitation is a bigger problem for both students and the administration. Only the upperclassman dorms are allowed visitation. "
College Freshman,1,The wifi is bad here and there is only 4 computer labs 
College Freshman,1,No visitation so don't think that another sex can come to your room until second semester
College Freshman,1,There are some places but you will not receive a student discount
College Sophomore,1,"The campus life was cold, dirty, and sick. The water was cold, and the AC was always on. I caught a cold during the summer time."
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid process was one of the most unorganized experiences yet!
College Freshman,1,"The freshman/sophmore dorms are called Dimple Newsome for girls and Fleming Kee for boys. They SUCK. The rooms are small. Theres NO privacy. The bathrooms are filthy and old. The stuff in the room (beds, dressers, desk) are so old. Everything is old. Paint chipping. Its just horrible. Plus  you get NO visitation. They are so strict on that.The upperclassmen dorms are better, and they get visitation."
College Freshman,1,"The Drug Scene is very noticeable because mostly everyone part takes in it , people even smoke ob campus and i feel as campus security does not do enough."
College Freshman,1,"Shaw University is a historical black University. That's why this grade will be low, most students here are black."
College Freshman,1,"I wouldn't give it a F because it comes in handy when your REALLY hungry. I gave it a D- minus because when your not starving but just regular hungry the food sucks. They dont have variety, its like the samething everyday, some of the food is over cooked, undercooked, or just plain nasty. THe food just gets boring if their not surprising you with NEW things."
Recent Alumnus,1,There are few food options and the food is not very well thought through and prepared
Recent Alumnus,1,There is very limited space for parking on campus.
Recent Alumnus,1,"It was a very slow process, and the information was not very clear"
College Senior,1,In the Center of  Run-Down-Downtown â€“ The College is located near a highway and a very rundown part of the inner city.
College Sophomore,1,Apartments Cost Too Much â€“ the apartments around the school cost entirely too much.

Alum,5,"I attended RU and graduated in 2010. The small class sizes were so important for my success, and I am still closely connected to my former professors now that I've moved into my career- those relationships have been so helpful for mentoring and guidance. 
The friends I made at RU are still my closest friends today. Plus, I really grew in my faith during my time as a student at Rochester. I discovered a lot about what my faith meant to me and how it would impact the choices I made in my work, family, and other areas of my life. I credit RU for giving me a solid foundation to move through God's world and follow the example set by the person of Jesus. 
I encourage anybody looking for a small school environment to consider RU- it makes such a difference to be viewed as a whole person, and not just a number!"
Alum,5,"I didn't take any online courses, but if I had, I'm sure the experience would have been great- my experience was always that RU staff and faculty worked super hard to resolve issues, deliver great content, and connect with their students as people."
Junior,5,The teachers really value making sure you are learning in their classes and want to help you as much as that can.
Junior,5,Rochester University has a wonderful campus community as well as academics. They really prioritize your personal needs as a student and make sure they are met to their best ability.
Senior,5,"I have absolutely loved my time at RU. It is really easy to get involved and the location is great! You are so close to everything: downtown rochester, shopping malls, etc. I love the small campus feel and the fact that I know everyone on campus. It has such a home-y feel and that's my favorite part."
Sophomore,5,the campus is beautiful along with amazing and supportive professors. The athletic program is incredibly supportive and is a great opportunity to put yourself out there and meet new people.
Sophomore,5,"I transferred here from Madonna University and I am very happy. I would suggest this as a commuting college, the dorm life is not the best. Great professors, faculty and students. I truly feel as if I found a college perfect for me. Great for sports teams as well."
Junior,5,"When making the transfer to RU I found the staff to be very easy to communicate with. Very fast response times on digital conversations, and efficient communicators when meeting in person. My only real issue is the only site is quite clunky. It became easier to navigate, but was irritating at first."
Senior,5,Rochester was never my first choice of school. Actually I have never even heard of Rochester University until the volleyball coach contacted me. I can honestly say that ever since I came to Rochester I felt like I belonged. It wasn’t easy though but I plan to work extra hard to succeed.
Freshman,5,"I am an Incoming freshman for fall 2019, So far my experience has been good. I have really experienced enough to write a review."
Niche User,5,"The college is in the middle of a transfer from college to a university to better suit their students and allow for better opportunities. The college hires quality professors that not only want to help the students, but enjoy being able to work with people of all ages, genders, and political views. The campus is BEAUTIFUL, and you always feel welcomed."
Freshman,5,I am a freshman at Rochester and involved with their athletic program.  The campus is very welcoming to freshman students.  The professors are amazing and extremely approachable.  The surrounding area of Rochester Hills provides a safe environment to enjoy many activities.
Sophomore,5,"This is a very small campus with just over 1,500 enrollment, but I loved this school. It is very diverse. The professors are very helpful and will work with you. I play two sports here and my teammates are great. This college is a great for transferring from another small college or going from high school to college. Classrooms are clean, and dorms are ok. I love being here, and I have 3 more to go."
Freshman,5,I like that the classes won't be that big and it won't take me long to get to each class. I also like that I can receive help whenever I want. I just need to go to tutor center and ask for some help when I am struggling. Not many people go there and most of the people who do are athletes which I like very much.
Freshman,5,The community feels like a family and everything here is great! From the moment I got here there was a feeling that I truly belong here. Also the theater program at RC is amazing! I am not in it but they are so hardworking and dedicated and the shows are always above expectation.
Freshman,5,"Rochester College has helped me grow so much in just one semester. It taught me responsibility, and gave me a chance to use all my teachings about manners and put them to use. The atmosphere is great and helped me build my faith. It is a great opportunity and anyone should consider!"
Freshman,5,The staff was very welcoming and friendly! they made my transition from highschool to college a lot less daunting!
Freshman,5,I am going to be a college freshman at Rochester College in the fall of 2017. I had visited the college a few times during my senior year of high school and I was never disappointed with the campus or the staff who was always there to help with my endless questions. I am now apart of the Women's basketball team and I have never felt more welcome. The coaches and my teammates never hesitate to help me whether it be about basketball or life in general. My overall experience  at Rochester College has been excellent so far and I can't wait to move onto campus in August 2017.
Freshman,5,"They have a wonderful community built there, and it always seems to have a very comfortable atmosphere, allowing the prime working environment for students."
Senior,5,Rochester college is a wonderful place. There are all sorts of people that help you grow as a person and develop skills to use throughout your entire life. Student life here is enriching and useful. Rochester college is a place where everyone can fit in and grow and blossom as a person.
Sophomore,5,"Currently Rochester College is experiencing some new improvements including a new Athletics center, a new gym, and a hammock garden around lake norcentra. I have really enjoyed my experiences so far and am looking forward to next semester. The professors are very nice and won't hesitate to stay and talk about anything with you. The courses are challenging yet very interesting and can be applied to the real world. The students are all friendly, RC it is a small campus where everybody seems to know each other. This makes for a great environment."
College Junior,5,"Rochester is extremely safe, because it is so small the security staff is familiar with everyone who should be on campus, and is not afraid to approach people who seem out of place. No person can access the dorm after midnight without showing their official student ID (10pm in the freshman dorm). the campus is also well lit, and i have never felt unsafe walking by myself at night."
College Junior,5,"Rochester is a wonderful school where the teachers, and staff want you to do your best."
College Freshman,5,"Love the courses, professors are passionate, and class sizes are small. Lots of individual attention and support to thrive in your classes. School is really willing to work with you, as well."
College Freshman,5,I know two students who have graduated from this college. Both are employeed and happy with their field. The college itself seems very interested in assisting people with job searches and opportunities.
College Junior,5,"I love RC so much. The professors care so much about their students and are always helpful. The community is so strong and it is so easy to get involved. Since the school is small you can do activities that have nothing to do with your major such as theatre, chorus, sports, etc."
College Junior,5,I love being on campus at this school. The social atmosphere is wonderful
College Junior,5,The professors are wonderful and they work so well with all of their students
College Junior,5,I just chose to be in Mass Communication and the staff worked with me very well
College Junior,5,I love living on campus. The student activities they provide seem endless fun
College Senior,5,"Diversity here is a great thing! Rochester is accepting of all cultures, races, sexual orientations and etc. It's a Christian college, but anyone can attend."
College Sophomore,5,"I have had no problems with my dorm, car or other areas of campus."
College Sophomore,5,"We have international students as well as students from pratically every ethnic and racial class. Everyone is equal and we all have a blast. It is so comfortable, that we can joke (in a very good way) about some student's food choices or verbage."
College Junior,5,Program choices were the number one reason I chose this school.
College Senior,5,"I feel that I can do anything I please with Rochester college. The program I am in is Counseling Psychology and has been great. The instructors keep the classes interesting, and with the program being only two days a week and night classes, I can work my full time job while going to school. The instructors really care and want you to succeed. I would recommend my program to anyone."
College Senior,5,"This Is a Christian College – Any type of drug is absolutely forbidden, as this is a Christian College."
College Senior,5,Scholarships are always easy accessible to all students
College Senior,5,"Academics at Rochester are highly enforced through staff, student, administrators, counselors, parents, friends, janitors, and the animals."
College Senior,5,"Somerset Collection – Rochester College is an awesome quaint city located not too far from Somerset mall on West Big Beaver Road in Troy, Mi. Which is probably about a 20 minute drive from Rochester College. I love that mall, it houses all the high end garment retailers such as Louis Vuitton, Saks, Chanel and many more. However, if you're not in the mood of traveling, Rochester offers the Village shops. The Village of Rochester is like something out of a movie, at night it looks amazing, the attractions are captivating. Many bargain shops like Parisian and also really nice restaurants like Bravo. It's simply ""A Great Place To Be""."
College Student,5,It's a great place to get an education. The classes are small with a lot of individualized attention. The people are friendly and helpful.
College Junior,5,Clean Atmosphere – Although there is always the occasional student who sneaks around and does drugs or alcohol the amount of students you will find here on campus actualy taking part in the use of things is very very limited. Being based upon religion the campus is a very clean environment and one that there is absolutely no pressure to do in which every one has fun without the use of it.
College Freshman,5,The campus policy is very clear on this subject thank God.
College Junior,5,"Great Atmosphere – Rochester College offers one of the best programs for Early Childhood Education. The classes are small, personal, and very high in spirituality!  It is a great place to be."
College Sophomore,5,"Everything's clean and in order, helpful, and enjoyable."
College Student,5,I will have to say that this is the best part of the whole campus. I spend a lot to time there and the help is incredible. The environment is always pleasant and they always give help when ever it is needed.They really excel in this area.
College Senior,5,"Although I am at the Mott campus I decided to visit the Main campus before I graduate, the atmosphere is very peaceful and feels safe and the people a very nice."
College Senior,5,"My Rc – I love learning curriculum at Rochester College I am doing the CEL learning at the Mott Campus and I am enjoying the material that I am learning and the instructors are very well prepared and are very helpful and understanding, The only thing that disappoints me is I can not stay at Rochester to get my masters and PhD. I will miss going to school under Rochester once I graduate, however I know I will be prepared to do my job thanks to the teachers and curriculum requirements of Rochester."
College Freshman,5,"Local weather is not often a problem, especially with the lack of snow that we have gotten this winter.  However, the one snow day that we had, it was very helpful to have the campus alerts sent straight to my phone so I know that the campus was closed for the day and I could sleep in!"
College Sophomore,5,"FAST FOOD!!!!! Arby's, Mcdonald's, Subway, Burger King, pizza places, Taco Bell and all other major food chains"
College Sophomore,5,"There are ALWAYS things to do walking and shopping in downtown Rochester. Movie nights, bowling, ice skating, plays. close to 3 different malls in the area."
College Student,5,"Overall It's Lovely – the thing about rochester college that i love is, it is a christian based college. they except you as you are and do not push religion on you. they expect that you respect the campus. so being able to go to school without worrying about sex, drugs, and someone judging me for what i believe in is great. i love going to school here, and we have some that aren't christian that go here, but they are not outcasted from events, this is a well connected community that i can honestly say is the best experience i have had in college, and i have been enrolled in an university and a community college."
College Student,5,"Big Boys – Great service, the staff allows you to stay and study for class if you are getting something to eat, and very kind hearted. there is no student discount, but the prices are great!"
College Junior,5,"There are plenty of computers available at Rochester College. There's a computer lab, the Ace Lab, and a few in the library. I often print in the Ace Lab with no problem right before class. I tried to print in the computer lab once and there was no paper and no one around to help but it wasn't hard to just walk over to the Ace. The speed seems to be pretty fast and reliable. I never bring my laptop to school and don't have any problem getting access to one when I need it."
College Junior,5,"There is a HUGE apartmet complex across the street from the college, as well as a huge condo complex down the street, several of my friends live in both. Cost is pretty good, about $400 - $500 a month with all utilities including Wifi, they provide it all."
College Junior,5,"Malls Galore – We have several malls nearby, each mall has different restaurants, whatever you feel like eating is always within walking distance. We even have a 24 hour Dunkin Donuts/Baskin Robbins on the same block so if you want a midnight energy boost you can easily walk there."
College Freshman,5,Downtown Dining – There are a variet of different of resteraunts and caffees in the downtown area and around the area!
College Senior,5,I have never felt unsafe on the Mott campus that Rochester is located at.There is always a guard in the building and in the parking lot.
College Freshman,5,"i think the student center is a great place to hang out. it has some great entertainment, whether you like to play ping-pong, pool, or just like to watch television. also there is a nice little coffee house in the SC as well, so if you like a morning brew, thats a great place to get it at."
College Sophomore,5,"Night Life – There is no (or very little) clubbing or partying because we are a Christian college, but we do have movie nights and other fun activities."
College Sophomore,5,At Rochester College we get many international students. It is very comforting to see them being accepted into the RC community without hesitation. We are very accepting of anyone that comes to RC as a student or even just to visit.
Senior,4,The professors are amazing and actually CARE about you. I loved being a name/actual person and not just a number. I have been to dinners at professors' houses and you are important to them. I feel like I have been prepared for my field (education) and always had help if I needed it. Like I said: amazing!
Junior,4,"Small school but very homey. Met some really nice people here but also some that were not so nice. Professors in science department were great, they really worked with me and helped me out. They are a Christian school, which was a bonus for me. They don’t have a lot to offer Though if you are going into a science field, keep that in mind, but they did really work with me. That I appreciate. Overall I enjoyed my time there but make sure you really do your homework, and decide the field you want to go into to determine if it would be a good fit for you."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the price for classes, being able to earn my Bachelor degree on-line, and speaking to a wonderful person, name Ms. Sauger."
Sophomore,4,I’ve only been at the school for a year but it has helped me in area where i struggled a bit. This is a wonderful school with tons of helpful staff that go unnoticed at times.
Junior,4,"I play basketball, so the brand new gym is great. Also, it is a growing school with many phenomenal teachers. Also, a good Christian based curriculum that still isn’t overwhelming to those who are not Christian."
Junior,4,"It has a very nice campus, and they are working hard to make the campus nicer. They are adding some new sports every year to make the athletics even bigger. They are looking to grow the campus. They do have some professors that do not care to be there. Like for example some of the adjunct professors, one specifically in the communication department. Other than that the regulars on campus are very caring and want you to succeed"
Junior,4,"So far my experience at Rochester College has been positive I like the school the students and the campus I have been treated well and have made great friends
I like that they took my credits from my previous school and I am taking accelerated classes so I will graduate early over it is a great college to attend."
Freshman,4,"It's a very close-knit community and very religious. There are times where things are restricted due to religion or money, but things are overall very tight and nice. The people here are the best commodity. "
College Senior,4,I've never felt threatened when on campus but I've only been there a couple of times.
College Senior,4,I've heard from alumni and teachers at my other school that the program I'm in is respected in the field which should make networking and gettin a job easier.
College Junior,4,"i love Rochester over the past two years the school has become my home, and the people have become my family. if i ever have a question i know i can find the answer, and although the school is a little pricy i feel it is truly worth it."
College Junior,4,"You are never alone when you live on campus. Especially living far from home, Rochester feels more like a family then a school to me."
College Junior,4,"Rochester does not have a conventional Greek system. they instead have a social club system where the clubs are centered around Christian ideas like serving others, and spending time in community."
College Senior,4,"This school is great.  I applied and was accepted and just completed my orientation with Rochester College.  I love the class size, campus, accessibility and great staff.  The class sizes are very small in comparison to universities and other colleges.  These small class sizes are fantastic in that students have the ability to have more one on one time with professors to go over difficult concepts.  This aspect I feel is essential to success in the classroom.

In addition to this, the campus both the main campus and the satellite campuses are stunning.  Rochester College's main campus is beautiful.  There are brand new dormitories made of beautiful brick, perfectly maintained landscaping, and attractive architectural buildings all over the campus.  Not only this but they are expanding and building an athletic center which only add to the many awesome buildings there.  The satellite campuses are equally beautiful.  The campus I will be attending is located on Macomb Community College's campus (where I graduated Most Distinguished Graduate).  The University Center where the satellite campus is located is a beautiful building surrounded in part by the serene nature trail and forest.  It is so relaxing after a hard day in the classroom to be able to walk outside take a deep breath and take in the beautiful surroundings.

This last aspect, the satellite campuses, are more reasons why I love Rochester College.  These campuses make getting a degree from Rochester College much more accessible and attainable.  For example, if I had to travel to Rochester College's main campus for the entirety of my time at this school I would not be able to do it.  This is because it is just too far of a drive to commute and paying for room and board is not an option as I could not afford it.  With the satellite campus I am able to avoid that huge cost as I am able to commute to school.  The satellite campuses make earning this degree much more accessible for students like me."
College Freshman,4,Had great support from all professors during my first year and an excellent experience with all my instructors course descriptions and class schedules.  The sizes of the classes are smaller which allows for better communication and participation with the instructors.  The on line courses were also very good the professors of those courses were very easy to contact and available when needed for assistance.
College Freshman,4,Do to the dorm and campus curfews there was not much activity during after hours.  Security guards were present at the dorm facilities and around the parking areas of the campus.  Many safety measure and security services were in place that contributed to a safe environment for on campus as well as commuting students
College Freshman,4,Being a smaller private school the athletics are not the most important attention getter but are held with much respect.  The teams are part of the higher level placing teams in all athletics areas.  Fans are encouraged to support and school spirit is emphasized with the entire campus.  The facilities are very good and currently growing.  The baseball field just had new dugouts build and current ground breaking began for the new Gymnasium for basketball.  Many students involvement made these ceremonial projects successful.
College Freshman,4,This school acts like a small community and works hard to keep all students on and off campus in close relations with the school activities and functions.  Participation and support is highly stressed with everyone.
College Sophomore,4,"I love being part of a community, and I love living on campus. I have made friends that will last a life time, and I know that most of the people will be there for me if I ever need them."
College Junior,4,Draws the community together and serves a lot
College Student,4,"I love all the opportunities that are offered and I love being on the cross country team. I wish, however, that it was easier for me to make friends so that way it would motivate me to get more involved."
College Sophomore,4,"College has kind of opened my eyes to how big the world is and how sheltered my parents have raised me to be. I've never drank, swore, smoked, or done drugs, but even at the conservative Christian college I attend, most of the students have done at least one of these things."
College Junior,4,School spirit is awesome because it's such a tightly knit community
College Junior,4,"I just declared my major, so I'm not entirely positive, but i'm sure I'll love it!"
College Junior,4,It's a christian based school so I feel a strong sense of small community.
College Junior,4,"Being a small school, RC really works to make sure that all the students can attend to get the education we deserve."
College Junior,4,"I've never heard of any real crime on campus. I felt fine leaving my Wii in the student lobby, trusting my peers."
College Junior,4,"On campus, everyone has a pretty wonderful social life. Since it's such a small school, we all know one another and get a long pretty well."
College Senior,4,Soccer games are the best because we have one of the best teams!
College Sophomore,4,Rochester College does a very good job of maintaining their grounds and buildings.  The facilities are constantly cleaned and taken care of.  We have a beautiful nature trail behind the college which is kept in pristine condition!
College Freshman,4,"I am very satisfied with my education thus far at Rochester College. The classes are small, which allows a more personal setting between the students and the teacher. The work load is challenging and sizable, but nevertheless manageable and comprehensive. I have no doubt that Rochester College will adequately teach me all that I need to know for my future in education."
College Freshman,4,"I came to Rochester College because my mother graduated from the college and recommended it. I am now here with a major in education. I love the environment and how close-knit of a community it is. Everyone just about knows everyone, the students and staff alike are friendly and genuine, the classes are small and personal, everyone works together to make the college a desirable place to be. An added bonus is that I'm in the college's A Capella Chorus and I absolutely love that ensemble!"
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty of restaurants but they are pretty expensive.
College Sophomore,4,The school rules are VERY strict on campus. They have a dress code and everything
College Sophomore,4,"The fans are genuine, the coaches are usually on their A Game, and the athletes set a fairly good example."
College Sophomore,4,"Rochester is full of interesting places to go but the only downfall is that almost every place costs money. Also, Rochester is a wealthy city so it isn't cheap."
College Sophomore,4,The weather is just typical Michigan weather and is always changing. The plus side is that campus is not huge so you can make it to your classes easily and weather is not a huge factor.
College Sophomore,4,There are not always enough parking spots available. The permits are fairly cheap but I do not think they actually go around and check to see if every car has the tag in the window. Other than that the parking lot it in very nice condition.
College Sophomore,4,"We have a great Basketball team and there is some involvement. Games are played outside of campus. We do have a Baseball team that my brother plays on. During home games, students will watch between classes if they can. We have a good school spirit. Being a small school, we don't have a basketball facility so the team uses a beautiful facility at the local high school. It can be difficult to attent baseball games because they are played betwen 1-3pm, during most classes."
College Sophomore,4,"Since there are students from all economic area, no one judges anyone that I have heard, about clothes or looks. Most of the students have parents that have worked very hard to send them to this private college and no one really needs to proove anything. Dress code is everything from wearing your pajama pants to class to wearing a nice pair of jeans and a sweater and doing hair and makeup. Most of the students are clean cut to some wearing dreads and doing their ""own thing"". It is a great diverse group of students."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my program. It is a difficult program and I need to be serious about my studying and exam grades. The workload can be intense with a lot of information to absorb, but when dealing with medical professions, I need to learn them in a short amout of time. Not too much time to have fun, but that is ok since I feel that the job opportunities when I graduate will be plenty."
College Sophomore,4,"Rochester College has a great campus feel. Although it is a small campus, there are may areas to hangout. There is an activities center, a juice bar, a few study areas as well as a common area in each dorm building. The library is a great quiet place to study. There are also rooms available for group studies. There are tutor labs available. There are a few organizations to join, but not as many as at the larger schools. But if you can organize more that 2 people, you can organize a club of your choice. Because of a 18credit semesters, I do not currently belong to any club. But my roommate does and she has a blast."
College Sophomore,4,There are no permit fees. We do have to register our cars. Most students commute and some students have cars. I have a car and it is very handy. No trouble finding a parking spot.
College Sophomore,4,"I started out with a nursing program at the Community College, so most of my credits did not transfer. But I am not in the Physician Assistant program and I love it. The education I am getting should provide me with many opportunites for obtaining a job after graduation while getting my Masters degree."
College Sophomore,4,"This financial aid office is better than my community college. They have assigned a specific person to me that I can contact anytime with any questions that I may have. I always have a contact person. Also, last sememster they found a book voucher that I qualified for and gave it to me."
College Sophomore,4,"There was no application process for me to get into my program. My advisor assists me each semester with my classes so I don't take anything that I don't need or out of order. In my interview for admissions, they stress that they are looking for strong students who are committed to their education as well as following a Christian lifestyle. They have an average dress code, conduct policy that you would find in most Colleges and Universities."
College Sophomore,4,"This is a Christian school. Although some drug and alcohol activity is possible, due to strick campus policies, it is not in the open and most takes place off campus. It is not in the forefront of activies and therefore, not a distraction from studying."
College Sophomore,4,"We have wireless access. The school offers either a Mac Book or I Pad for students coming to the schools. I know that certain exceptions apply, so most of us on campus have their own computers and I don't really rely on the schools labs or printers."
College Sophomore,4,"The weather in Michigan is always changing. It absorbs the  4 seasons, sometimes in one week. Because of the small campus area, it is easy to walk through even in the toughest weather. Parking is all around and close to your buildings. Cafe and eating areas are also close by."
College Sophomore,4,"My major in Heath Sciences/Physicians Assistant program is the main reason for me attending this school. The PA programs are not availble in most Colleges and universities in my state. This is the only small school that offers this program. All of the classes necessary to obtaining a degree is at this school. Although I will need to go elsewhere for my Masters, there is a major hospital (within 2 miles) as well as another University that has my master's program. I would love to stay in this area and explore options for internships and employment."
College Sophomore,4,"I transferred to Rochester College from the local Community College. They had my degree program. I found that the small school environment as well as the smaller class sizes fit my needs perfectly. The course advisors, tutors, availability of assistance from the professors are exceptional. It is a very comfortable campus that has everything I need in a small package. The professors know your name, your major program and one on one contact if needed is a plus for me to become the best student I can be for achieving my degree goal."
College Sophomore,4,"I am a Youth and Family Ministry major, and for the most part you can branch out quite about. There is a church right next store that can be used for church related activities. One can also do an internship or participate in the ministry group on campus."
College Junior,4,Rochester College has all types and age groups attending which makes the class interaction extremly benefical.
College Junior,4,I attend a CEL Program at Mott Community College.  I do not attend the main campus.  Mott does a fairly good job helping the students.
College Sophomore,4,A nice variety. There are many places to go downtown rochester or at the village. Some are college budget friendly and some aren't.
College Senior,4,I do not have any issues getting to and from school.
College Junior,4,"No Complaints – Good community, generally safe. Best security is a locked door of course though."
College Junior,4,Although the campus is small it has a nice feel to it with a close personal level of friendliness. With many things accessible to you they create a good atmosphere.
College Freshman,4,"Rochester is beautiful and attracts positive, caring people to its community."
College Junior,4,"The college has a great atmosphere, very nice campus and excellent instructors.  The program is useful and can be applied to current and future employment."
Alum,2,"Professors are hit or miss.  Some are awesome and will do whatever it takes to help their students!  Others are horrible and will degrade your character if you don't agree with them.  There is nothing to do on campus, but there are often events in downtown Rochester you can attend."
College Senior,2,Rochester College isn't a very big school at all. The campus itself you could almost pass right by and miss it because it's so small and looks like random buildings from the 1970's. I don't attend the Rochester College campus I attend an off-campus extended learning center for my classes.
College Senior,2,The buildings look like a 1970's church and reception hall. I'm pretty sure the brick was whiter before now it's this ugly mustard yellow. The hallways are so narrow in the financial aid department only one person can fit in the hall at a time. The interior of the buildings look extremely old and outdated its embarrassing.The sports games are great to be a part of because we are known for our great soccer team!
College Sophomore,2,"The one problem Rochester College has is transportation.  The location does not provide students without a car with any form of public transportation, so the only option for students living on campus is to find someone with a car.  Commuters have parking problems as well.  With the enrollment increasing each year, this becomes a larger and larger problem.  If there is an all-campus event, there may not be enough parking spots for everyone depending on how many people show up."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not personally looking for off-campus housing at the moment. However, I have heard that because Rochester College is right next door to Downtown Rochester Hills, most nearby off-campus housing is expensive. On a positive note, the atmosphere Downtown is so inviting, and it's so much to do, the cost may not be such a disadvantage."
College Sophomore,2,"the athletic programs are great, but the athletes at the school take away a lot from the christian atmosphere. it would be a better school without them. they all receive the majority of the scholarships, even though they don't try in classes like some of the other students do."
College Sophomore,2,"I received some financial aid, but not near as much as i need. I get great grades, work really hard, and act in a christian way, but the sports jerks are the ones getting all of the scholarships. I need more money and they aren't willing to help much"
College Sophomore,2,It's Michigan so therefore Rochester Hills is no exception to it's bi-polar weather conditions. It can be sunny and bright out in the middle of December and then snowing in March. The school does a good job at making sure the grounds are safe in icy conditions and keeping the parking lots paved and salted.
College Sophomore,2,"The biggest one may be ""open house."" The dorms only allow the opposite sex to visit anyone's room freely for only 4 hours a week."
College Sophomore,2,"Not many places to socialize on campus since students are limited to either the Student Center, the Cafe, and the dorm lobbys. All are occupied by the same crowd which discourages many to occupy the same area."
College Sophomore,2,Unfourtantely Campus Life isn't very funat RC. Most of the students go home on weekends leaving the campus to seem like a ghost town.
College Junior,2,"There are some apartments nearby, but not extensively. Decent houses two miles away though."
College Senior,2,Very Few Computer Labs – The computer labs at Rochester College are very small and computers are from Dell. Not owning your own laptop or desktop would be a problem because it's hard to find computers opened.
College Freshman,2,"Not Close Enough – The most important buildings for class are in one main cluster. There are very few where we have to travel down to the lower part of the campus. That aside, I think that the parking spots are a lot farther away from the building the necessary. They have a lot of handicapped spots and employee parking spaces that never get filled."
College Junior,2,"Not the greatest quality of foods, much better options off campus for better prices."
College Junior,2,"There is A LOT of shopping in the Rochester area. There are many malls, shops, and boutiques."
College Junior,2,"Strict Rules – Because Rochester College is a christian college they have some pretty strict rules in the handbook. No excessive PDA, no sex on or off campus, and a pretty strict dress code. I see people doing what they want and haven't heard of many people being reprimanded but there are rules."
College Sophomore,2,I don't know – I am a commuter and I don't want to see games at high schools
College Junior,2,"Pointless General Ed Classes – While understanding that Rochester is a Christian college, being forced to take a certain amount of religious classes, and having to attend religious chapel as a requirement, isn't fair. Those credits could be used for classes that could go towards a degree. Those classes should be optional, not forced upon students who aren't comfortable with their religion."
College Freshman,2,"We get our own transportation - it is an extremely small campus, and everyone drives or lives on campus."
College Junior,1,"Rochester College's campus is only about 1 mile long entirely. This means that transportation services are not necessary, and are non existent, to get around our campus grounds."
College Sophomore,1,"There really isn't much nightlife on the campus. There will be an occasional lecture or some interesting event like Mr. RC. For the most part people tend to go home on the weekends and people don't really host parties. Rochester College is a good school, but it functions more like a community college."
College Junior,1,We use Mott Community College site but we are not allowed to use their equipment.
College Senior,1,"Cookie Cutter College – It seems to me that the majority of Rochester College consists of Christian white kids. There are the occasional black Christians & maybe a Catholic or two, but Rochester makes it really hard to openly identify as something other than the specific mold that is expected within the school. It's usually easy to tell who is fairly religious & who rejects anything to do with spirituality, but people are smart to keep their opinions to themselves."
College Junior,1,"SERIOUSLY? This is lame! Each person has different tastes and I am not here to find a ""boy"" don't most women want a man? Furthermore, we're here for an education!"
College Junior,1,"Its a small private christian school, so the athletics are meh"
College Freshman,1,"its called ""social clubs"" there really lame no one does anything or even know who are in these so called ""social clubs"""
College Freshman,1,"Nightlife at Rochester College has is ups and downs, most nights are downs. For those underage most people spend most of their time in the lobby in the dorms or up at the gym. Many people travel to other big colleges around the area to party and have fun. The underclassmen housing facilities have a strict curfew that can put a damper on the nightlife."

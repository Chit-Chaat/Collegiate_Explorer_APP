Sophomore,5,"So far it was been really good, the admission process was easy and you have access to counselors. Everyone calls back in a timely manner to answer all your questions and to help you with financial aid forms to completed"
Junior,5,Grate university to attend and play sports great atmosphere for anyone wanting to continue their education
Senior,5,Small classes make it easy to be a student athlete. You get to know the professors one on one and it allows us to travel and still get the full education that we came here for.
Junior,5,I am Lincoln Memorial Univeristy’s nursing program and I love it. The professors are amazing and want to see you succeed. It’s a tough program but they make students become great nurses. I would not change anything about this school or program.
Junior,5,"Lincoln Memorial University has helped me figure out what I want to do with my life, grow up physically and mentally. Every person who works at LMU is so nice and helpful. I am on the bowling team and my experience is great so far."
Sophomore,5,"I really like the atmosphere at LMU. They are really nice people and really care about how your experience is. They are easy to work with and very helpful. I was a first college attendee in my family and many things were confusing for me, but they answered my questions and didn't act like I was a problem. One thing I think they lack in is some communication. Sometimes they struggle to communicate between each other."
Junior,5,I love the environment. All professors are kind and knowledgeable. They truly want every student to succeed.
Freshman,5,The teachers are overall very caring and smart. They truly care about you passing and getting where you need to go. The housing the clean and nice. The food is also good. They provide us with many activities to keep us interested and active on campus.
Niche User,5,Lincoln Memorial is a beautiful campus that has a family community. Enrollment is small but it makes the students closer to each other. The athletics are great and the student body is supportive.
Freshman,5,I love how involved my professors were in helping me start my journey as a nursing student. I have enjoyed my clinical rotations and the help I received in learning new skills and the encouragement they gave along the way.
Junior,5,Lincoln Memorial is a small but mighty school. There are amazing athletic and academic programs. The students really care about getting involved and making sure that there is something that is always going on. The teachers will help you as much as they can and will do their best to help you succeed in any way possible. I have had a fantastic experience here at LMU and would come here 4 more years if I could.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy attending LMU Blount Campus. The nursing instructors are all extremely helpful and are interested in their students learning as much as possible. The clinical experiences that I have had thus far have been great as well.
Sophomore,5,Lincoln Memorial University has been such a great experience thus far. It is a university in the middle of nowhere but diversity of culture and the different personalities make this school very enjoyable.
Sophomore,5,"Lincoln Memorial University is a great place to send your graduate to school because it is a caring, learn-friendly, and safe place. There is always someone there to help you with anything you need and all the professors I have had were great. I love how the Freshman get an incoming UACT teacher who helps you to maintain your college life. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone!"
Sophomore,5,"Lincoln Memorial University is one of the greatest campuses I have ever been to.  This is the third University I have attended, and it is definitely the one I will be staying at.  The faculty and staff are extremely helpful and friendly, and the atmosphere is amazing.  Any questions I have are always answered, and help is always there when I need it.  The professors do an excellent job of teaching material.  My grades have improved by far when I transferred here.  I plan to apply to their Vet school in Ewing when I graduate."
Freshman,5,"My first year at LMU I have made so many friends the school is like a very big family. Everyone is willing to help you with anything you need. Academics are a big priority for clubs, especially in Greek Life. When I was pledging my active members always tried to help me with my homework. They even set up study times at the library for my pledge class and I to make sure we didn't get caught up in everything outside of school and clubs."
Freshman,5,"Even though it is stuck in what seems like the middle of nowhere, the campus offers everything you need to have a great university life. Not only is the campus absolutely beautiful, but there is access to anything you need. For example, free food nights, free gym membership, free tutoring, and a lot more. There seems to be always something planned, but it's never too crowded here. We are a small enough school to where you're friends with everyone!"
Graduate Student,5,My experience as a graduate student has been great. Very affordable program that is based off one of the best analytics programs in the nation. I genuinely feel like I am getting a steal for my education.
Freshman,5,I love how everyone at Lincoln Memorial University is willing to help. I also like how everyone is wanting you to succeed here. I wish that you wouldn't have to take so many pre requisite classes in order to study your major.
Freshman,5,Lincoln Memorial University is a great university and has been very good in helping me with my transition to college in order to help me succeed and reach my goal. They have helped me with everything I will need while being 5 hours away from home. They are very acomidating in every way and are willing to help as much as they can to be sure that I have a great experience.
Sophomore,5,"Well this is my first semester at Lincoln Memorial University. Everything is going good so far and the teachers seem very educated and focused on teaching their students all they need to know to become successful. I'm currently enrolled in the nursing program and even though it's tough and there is a lot of work involved already, I'm up for the challenge. I like that Lincoln Memorial University has many different campuses because it makes it convenient for students everywhere to attend one of the locations closer to their residence. The only thing I would like even more about Lincoln Memorial University is if the tuition was a lil but more affordable. I understand it is a private university and you get what you pay for so it still balances out."
Freshman,5,"I never thought I would end up so far away from my hometown to attend college! But, being at Lincoln Memorial University is one of the best decisions I've ever made! I love the campus, the teacher, and the classes!"
Freshman,5,"Coming to Lincoln Memorial is the best decision I have made this year. It is an amazing school with great academics and great people. In just one semester, I have made so many lifelong friends and some unforgettable memories. The academics here are not easy, but the professors are very personal and give extra help whenever you need it. The athletics are also awesome. I am a beach volleyball player, which starts in the spring, but our indoor season is going great and we are headed to regionals next week. Many of our sports teams make it to conference championships, regional championships, and sometimes national champions. LMU is the place to be."
College Sophomore,5,I have had many professors go out of their way to even tutor me in the class. The professors are very caring and do not want any of their students to fail.
College Sophomore,5,I've never had anything happen to me or around me on campus that was dangerous or alarming. I personally believe that this campus is very safe and secure.
College Sophomore,5,We have a safe environment.
College Sophomore,5,"Depending where you pick to live it can very, but overall all of them are nice."
College Junior,5,I play lacrosse for my university and it's literally a dream come true. We have very nice facilities and everything we need to perform successfully and safely. The other sports on campus are amazing as well. The sports environment is welcoming and so much fun!
College Junior,5,Best school I've been to and I've been to two others
College Sophomore,5,Our athletics are outstanding. I love watching them play. The men and women work so hard and are so dedicated.
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe and secure on our campus.
College Freshman,5,It's rare to none that students ever find confrontation here.
College Freshman,5,The professors are ALL helpful and easy to talk to!
College Freshman,5,We have a great variety of teams and they're good!
College Freshman,5,"If you're serious about school, this is the best school."
College Sophomore,5,The dorms are the reason i attended the school
College Sophomore,5,"Lincoln Memorial has a beautiful campus. Most of the staff are always willing to go out of their way to provide help to the students. As well as the classes are small, which make for a great environment to be a part of."
College Senior,5,"I truly feel that our administrative staff want every student to succeed in becoming a nurse.  They are always available to talk about how to become a better test taker and to discuss any other issues.  Because the college is an off-branch of the main campus specifically for nursing education, the staff and students are close and on a name-to-name basis.  Their goal is to provide us with the best education and tools necessary to succeed in our field and to pass the N-CLEX."
College Senior,5,"Although I do not party anymore, downtown Knoxville, where the University of Tennessee is located, has always had a great party scene.  There are always parties going on at fraternity and sorority houses, at houses around the campus rented out by students, and at the multiple bars and clubs on Cumberland Ave, also known as the strip, and even further downtown."
College Senior,5,"I received what is called a ""transfer"" scholarship of around 6,000 because previously I attended and graduated from the University of Tennessee.  Because the nursing program at LMU's Caylor School of Nursing is very expensive, any help in the financial department helps."
College Junior,5,we do not have dorms on the campus i am attending.
College Junior,5,"They are very helpful in the admissions department. adviser was wonderful, financial aid counseler was helpful to break everything down for me to understand. wonderful process i didnt recieve from other colleges."
College Student,5,I enjoy my program. Interesting classes. Enthusiastic professors.
College Student,5,"I love my major. Interests me, not many ""boring general classes"" like most schools."
College Student,5,Wonderful overall experience at school so far. Different than most schools; in a positive way.
College Student,5,Financial aid process very smooth.
College Junior,5,short drive into kentucky and you can have a variety of choices
College Junior,5,top of the line. always up to date
College Junior,5,you can use your private car
College Junior,5,"My school is small, and in a small town. Crime is to a minimum, and I've never felt in danger. There are policemen everywhere. I've never questioned my safety."
College Junior,5,"At Knoxville campus, we have many options available each day and they are usually delicious."
College Sophomore,5,"As a Philosophy/Religion major I love the program. There are a few downfalls to it though. There is only one professor in the program. He is amazing and very knowledgeable. He is interested in his students not only in his classroom, but how their lives are outside of it. There other downfall is where the university will only hire one professor, the classes are taught every 4 years so if you miss a class, you are doomed. After this year though (Spring 2013) they will be dropping Philosophy/Religion as a major and making it just a minor."
College Junior,5,"LMU consists of many people with diverse cultures, making it a great place to learn! It is nice to be able to hear different perspectives on a certain subject from others."
College Senior,5,"all nice relatively new, student services allow students to rent laptops each semester. there is wifi and it works majority of the time"
College Senior,5,"No Reason to Fail – All the professors are eager to help if you're having trouble. And if you can't bear to ask a teacher for help, we have a FREE tutoring service in the student center that's open every day until like 10 pm."
College Sophomore,5,There are students from aprox 18 countries at lmu.
Recent Alumnus,5,"LMU has a large amount of parking spots and is very rarely full. the peak hours of commuter campus time is the only time (8-2m-f) that it may be hard to find a spot near your classes, besides that it is very easy."
College Freshman,5,Relationships on Campus – there are a few married couples who live on campus with their children. the most important thing about this school is the basketball team.
College Freshman,5,Safety First – I always feel safe on Lincoln Memorial University's campus. It is in a quite little community with very little crime. Campus security is very watchful and they keep shenanigans to a minimum.
College Senior,5,Open Availability – You can pretty much park anywhere and parking passes ($40) are included in tuition.
Freshman,4,I have had a great time here so far. The campus is beautiful and I love the small atmosphere. The campus is hilly so I do have to drive instead of walking to all of my classes but it's a short drive.
Freshman,4,"The campus is small enough that we are able to have all of our classes in person. If you miss class due to illness, you can get online updates from your professors."
Junior,4,"The courses that are intended on being taken online are mostly functional. some are set up in ways that, without prior experience with inline courses, you will fall behind because of a lack of understanding on expectations and the course requirements."
Sophomore,4,"The university is in a very rural area, which makes it difficult to gain experiences in certain areas. However, the teachers are extremely caring and involved in their students education. Overall a great school, especially for those who are looking to focus solely on their education."
Graduate Student,4,"Staff truly cares about all their students and their success. Given that the location of the campus is  within an extremely small town, there are not many things to do unless you drive about an hour south to Knoxville. Despite that, each staff member from janitors to professors are the kindest and most accommodating individuals I’ve interacted with at a university."
Sophomore,4,I was drawn to LMU for it's unique pre-veterinary program. It allows for a lot of hands on training and the professors are very knowledgeable.
Senior,4,"I love how the teachers are very helpful at guiding their students in the right direction when it comes to their education. The one thing I wish LMU would do differently is by offering health insurance to their students if they need it, and also making it affordable for students to attend such a lovely school like LMU. i feel as if their tuition has increased and I have seen many classmates including myself struggle to pay the remaining expenses for classes."
Freshman,4,"A beautiful campus with wonderful people. The communication and scheduling could be better, along with the availability of information. Their website needs to be more user friendly."
Senior,4,"I enjoyed my overall experience at LMU.  Nestled in the mountains and the small community of Harrogate, it is the absolute best place to go if you want peace and quiet to focus on pursuing a degree.  The staff and faculty at LMU are very friendly and are usually available whenever you need them.  The small class sizes also allow you to build a good learning relationship with your professors."
Junior,4,I love Lincoln Memorial University. I personally would like to see the campus and university in general grow. I would like to see more programs become available for students.
Junior,4,LMU is a great university! The opportunity for a vast education is right at your fingertips. They offer some of the best professors and educational programs possible. The only thing that can be changed is helping students afford this private university so that more students can have the opportunity to learn and follow their dreams.
Junior,4,I have had an overall good experience at LMU. I had had fantastic teachers at this school and great advisors to help me along the way.
Freshman,4,"I am currently enrolled at LMU, and I love it. It gives the small town feel, there are small classes, allowing you to have close student-teacher interactions, and the science facilities are state-of-the-art. The only draw back I have is the honors program is not as developed as other universities' honors programs, but it is becoming bigger and better each year."
Niche User,4,"I absolutely loved Lincoln Memorial University. The staff are exceptionally nice and they genuinely care about you, your interests, and they want to make your college experience as easy as possible. I went to a preview day at the college and they did not ever try to convince you that you ""have"" to go to Lincoln Memorial. They informed you about what Lincoln Memorial had to offer. This helped me determine whether I'd like to attend here or not."
Niche User,4,This college looks very nice. I am very interested in possibly attending this school in Fall of 2018. It is my first choice for college!
Freshman,4,LMU was my first college choice. I really like the campus size. It's large (area wise) but most of my classes are within easy walking distance. I drive to my classes usually just because I'm too lazy to walk. The faculty and staff are always friendly and open to talking to you during or after office hours (use the office hours). The dorms are really nice. I haven't been in the traditional style but people say they're nice as well. I live in the village (apartment style) and they are really nice and all buildings on campus have really fast wifi. LMU is a very safe campus. They have fully armed police officers and security guards available 24/7 365 days a year. They can be seen patrolling campus often. There are also immediate police contact boxes on every floor of the dorms. They will even transport you to and from your destination if you feel uncomfortable.  The professors are good for the most part and I really like my classes. You should really consider LMU!
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman pre vet student at LMU. The campus is beautiful, safe, and small. The lab facilities are brand new and the math and science building is amazing. The professors I've had so far are great and really care about the students. The only issues I've experienced are the shuttles and the food. The shuttles are inconsistent and some times don't run at all. The food is hit or miss. Some foods are really good, but others aren't.(Most of the meat is really tough and/or dry.) At least there's always pizza and a salad bar, right? Over all, LMU feels like home and is like a family. I just wish the shuttle schedule and the food would improve."
Junior,4,Lincoln Memorial University is a great school located in a very small town with many opportunities to become the best possible student. The professors are great and there's very little distractions to get into any trouble.
Sophomore,4,I like how small classes and the professors. I think there should be a wider variety of majors as well as more diverse classes offered. The cafeteria food needs to be better and have more options since Harrogate doesn't provide much. The dorms are really nice. The school is definitely working towards expanding in most departments which is good.
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at Lincoln Memorial University thus far and I have been successful so far in my studies. The campus is lovely and the academic quality is great. The cost is a bit overwhelming, but there is financial aid available."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at LMU this year. I play tennis and I really enjoy being here. The problems I see are that their aren't a lot of activities offered and it could be hard to get involved, that's why I'm so glad I play tennis. I love the professors and the staff, everyone is very nice. One of the best things is probably the campus, it is beautiful. However, it is located in a very small town so there's not much to do."
Freshman,4,"I absolutely loved Lincoln Memorial University. However, some of the professors were difficult to understand which made the class harder than it should have. The dorm rooms, especially for freshmen, are not worth the money. The food was not half bad though. Overall, my experience was good."
Freshman,4,"Lincoln Memorial University is an overall great school. The professors want to see you succeed, so they will provide help if you are struggling in the class if you ask for their help. The students that attend here are overall a welcoming group of people. They will talk to you if you talk to them, and will help point you in the right direction if you become lost on campus. The school grounds are another plus toward the school. They have a quite campus, which makes great for  studying, and you are not that far from some form of entertainment."
College Sophomore,4,"The apartments are the best choice to live in on campus. I have not lived in the communal dorms so I can't speak from my own experience, but I have heard bad things about those."
College Sophomore,4,The gym is well-equipped and available twenty-four hours a day to students.
College Sophomore,4,All my professors were great accept one who was hard and the class was to big at the time. Most of our classes are small and small to me is 25 people or less. Smaller classes make it easier to work with everyone and meet your professor if you need them.
College Sophomore,4,To sum it up short they make sure that you really want to be what you are out to do
College Sophomore,4,I don't really have anything to do with Greek life but they are pretty good around campus.
College Sophomore,4,Our school is popular with sports
College Sophomore,4,Lincoln memorial university is a great school to be able to work well with others and the teachers are very helpful.
College Junior,4,I love my school. Lincoln Memorial University is a place to learn and grow as an individual. My school reminds me of home but is far enough from home.
College Junior,4,I've never experienced it known anyone to experience any problems. It feels very safe.
College Junior,4,I'm new to this school an everyone has been very helpful so far.
College Sophomore,4,Many of the professors are always available to help and we have a tutoring center. They do well to help students in any way possible.
College Sophomore,4,It's a very diverse campus and everyone is very accepting of others.
College Sophomore,4,They've got many options for different degrees that anybody might want to pursue.
College Sophomore,4,"I don't live on campus but from what I can tell, the dorms are in fantastic condition."
College Sophomore,4,I think it's a really great school. I'm getting a good education and the faculty and staff do everything they can to help.
College Junior,4,Campus very safe overall. There are a few bad apples as would be expected but no noticeable problems with alcohol or drugs.
College Junior,4,Lots of housing options on campus ranging from low budget dorms with community bathrooms to single person suites and 3 bedroom apartments. Housing community safe and friendly.
College Junior,4,Class sizes are small which helps students build close-knit relationships with professors and advisors. Math and Science Department very up to date and efficient with faculty conducting ongoing research with students through the seminar program. Campus very small and friendly. Most students get along with everyone and it's almost like a big family. Definitely much smaller that most other universities but there's a large national park and wilderness area offering many outdoor recreation opportunities and beautiful scenery.
College Sophomore,4,I feel pretty safe on campus. They had a scare last month and handled it well. See security cars on a daily basis.
College Sophomore,4,I am learning a large amount of new information in my field. The majority of the teachers are great. Happy with my decision to attend LMU.
College Sophomore,4,"The fan turn out is fairly good, although the fans do not make much noise. Most teams are very good, and are provided excellent facilities to preform in."
College Freshman,4,"I love all the students and all of the staff. The dorms are pretty amazing as well. The overall atmosphere is just great! Everyone is accepted, but most importantly everyone is given a chance."
College Freshman,4,"The professors (most of them) work hard to teach you what you need to know. The class sizes are perfect for me, coming from a small high school. The environment promotes learning. There's a lot to do outdoors around the campus to unwind, and some great coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Plenty of extracurricular activities to get plugged in on campus. The housing is some of the best I've seen!"
College Sophomore,4,It's a really good school. They're expanding very quickly.
College Junior,4,Rules are reasonable and fair.
College Junior,4,"It was great, I just wish I could have been offered more scholarships."
College Senior,4,"There are multiple apartment complexes and even houses for rent in the Knoxville area around Cedar Bluff, where the school is located.  The price depends not only on the quality, but also on the number of rooms - one bedroom apartments generally are more expensive.  The more rooms/roommates the individual has, the better deal he or she can get; the cost per person goes down.  There are a few apartment complexes within 5 minutes of the school; however, in the general Knoxville area, there are a multitude of places for rent."
College Freshman,4,The administration should not be as concerned about what hours visitation should be allowed.
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is a fun experience. Although, while living on campus there are too many unnecessary rules that do not allow the student to show they are responsible adults."
College Freshman,4,We have a great library.
College Freshman,4,Campus police are constantly on patrol.
College Freshman,4,I like living on campus that way I get the full college experience. I live in the village which is made up of apartment style dorms and it is very nice. Living in the village does cost more but it's better than living in Grant/Lee which is the oldest and cheapest housing option on campus.
College Junior,4,There is always security around.
College Junior,4,"everything is great and in this area and very close by to everything,"
College Junior,4,security gaurds keep us safe on campus. and are there if needed.
College Junior,4,this school is located in the city i grew up in. therefore i know it well and have lots of friends. love the downtown area and farmers market on saturdays
College Junior,4,there is a large variety of people at my school and all seem to get along well.
Junior,2,"LMU is a place with great potential. It's in a beautiful area, and the buildings are nice for the most part. Some professors are amazing. However, the School of Business is a dumpster fire. Less than five professors here have stayed longer than one semester. Classes are not offered often enough, and LMU does not hire professors so classes are online if at all. This school is too expensive to treat students this way. There are also few dorm options, a bad cafeteria, few clubs to join, and the area is underdeveloped. I would never go here again, and I would never advise anyone to come here if you want a business degree."
Alum,2,"I was a former member of the LMU nursing school. The program is very political and it shows in the comradery of the instructors. There is a strong distrust and unfriendly attitude toward each other. Most of the instructors in the BSN program are great and willing to help the student, however, there is one that will make it her goal to see failure in students she doesn't favor. Take my review with a grain of salt, however, I have always graduated with honors, both undergraduate and masters level. In fact, graduated another program with honors at the same school This instructor though, is high up in the chain of command and uses that power to her advantage. Know this going into the program and be careful. There are plenty of great nursing schools around."
Senior,2,LMU is a scam. They try to get more money out of you.  They don't know what they are doing either. I have been told things that aren't true or I have to figure things out myself.
College Sophomore,2,The sororities and fraternities look down on the other students and treat the pledges badly if they decide to quit pledging.
College Junior,2,Most people do not even know we have Greek life until they either visit or attend the university.
College Sophomore,2,The food is edible at best but meal plans are way over priced. It is not fair to make students buy a meal plan when they have kitchens in their apartments. Also they should have more then 2 meal plans. I would like to see a single wow meal plan.
College Sophomore,2,I think they are more strict than need be about pointless things like parking and visitation violations
College Sophomore,2,Greeks aren't really seen as a big deal on campus.
College Senior,2,"Gotta Be Sneaky – You can definitely get away with things if you're sneaky enough, but you better be prepared for a bunch of probations if you get caught!"
College Sophomore,2,Have to drive to about every class unless you have a bicycle to ride..Most classes are upon top of hills or so far from each other there is really no time in between..If you don't get in an get a parking spot you in up having to park long ways from your dorm....
College Junior,2,Not Very Many Options – There are not very many apartment options in the Harrogate area.
College Sophomore,2,"Guys Are Not That Attractive – The guys at Lincoln Memorial University are not that attractive. The guys consist of mostly one-night standers. They do not want relationships they are just looking for girls who will just ""hook up"" with them."
College Sophomore,2,"Not What Is Expected – When hearing about Greek life, usually students imagine parties and popular, preppy people.  At Lincoln Memorial University, it is quite the opposite.  They have few events, and non Greeks never really know about what is happening.  They seem to themselves."
College Senior,2,Plain Jane – This school doesn't have too much that sets it apart from others. It does have an amaxing view and wonderful people.
College Freshman,2,Total Boredom – Lincoln Memorial University is in a very rural area of Tennessee.  There is nothing to do on the weekends or during the week for that matter.
Graduate Student,1,Lincoln Memorial University will take you for every penny you have or don't have. I got my undergraduate degree from a different university and never had any problems. Almost every teacher at my last university truly liked what they did. The financial aid department was great. Transferring to LMU was the worst decision I ever made. Most of my teachers have been awful. The financial aid department is a wreck. No one knows what they are doing in this school. I would highly recommend you take your money to a university who genuinely wants to teach you and help you advance in life. LMU is not the place to go if you want to actually accomplish things in life.
Alum,1,"Absolutely horrible experience.  I studied at LMU diligently over the duration of three years and was satisfied until it was discovered that my official academic transcript had been altered, that my cumulative GPA was somehow 0.3 cumulative points lower than accurate.  Using the incorrect GPA the college forced me to withdraw from my academic program despite meeting multiple times with the deen and ultimately pleading with directors there and other school officials to address my dilemma and explain how such a reality having occurred was fair.  An inaccurate GPA should not have been assigned to my person and used against me but the school will not work with me at all and now attempts to ignore the issue however has been calculating all transcripts by hand!  The United States Dept of Education and The United States Office of Inspector General and other unnamed accrediting bodies have been notified and are investigating the school.  Avoid LMU at all cost!"
College Sophomore,1,There is no interest in soroties or fraternities
College Sophomore,1,Greek life is very small and does not offer many oppurtunities.
College Junior,1,Lacy did not seem very interested in helping me with my questions.
College Junior,1,The campus I will attend has no sports.
College Junior,1,the satalite campus i am a part of does not participate in sports.
College Junior,1,"The social life at LMU is awful. I've never met so many rude people in my life. The only interest is partying and drinking. It's like a big high school and there is drama everywhere. The jocks are mean, the girls have no self-respect, and people run in cliques. LMU does not have the social college experience I was expecting."
College Sophomore,1,It is almost non-existent. The shuttle is a good way to get to classes that are far away if you don't mind being half an hour late. The best way to get there is to drive and risk getting a ticket if you live on campus.
College Sophomore,1,It is terrible! The computer are slow and there is always something wrong with them and don't even try to print because you'll be late to class even if you get there an hour early.
College Sophomore,1,"The computers are old and slow and seem to always be riddled with problems. LMU really needs to upgrade technologically, especially considering how much they are charging students for tuition, residential and meal plans."
College Sophomore,1,"Off-campus housing prices have went sky high since the opening of DCOM. Mr Ball is partly to blame. Also, there is a big problem with drugs in the area. I actually did a little research and found a repeat felony offender lives above me. Makes me sleep well at night."
College Sophomore,1,"The food is horrible. The cafe area is nice, but food needs major improvement."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no alcohol allowed on the campus period. No matter how old you are or what your situation is, you cannot have overnight guests without the approval of the student Resident Adviser. (My wife and I have been on our own and I am a combat veteran. I see no reason that the two of us need to be babysat like children.)"
College Freshman,1,they suck! you can't park here or here or there!!! and you'll get a ticket over the stupidest things so watch out!! the LMU police will save the day!
College Senior,1,"Nothing Much – Our nightlife, that I've seen/experienced, is almost non-existent. There's a few parties here and there on and off campus, but they're not frequent, and you wouldn't want to be at them anyways. We're way back in the mountains, so unless you want to make the trip to Knoxville for some real fun, you better have lots of friends and plenty of food and board games."
College Senior,1,"The residential lots are always full, and I rarely find places to park close to my dorm building. Also they have decided that residents cannot park up at BE and MANS anymore, so if you miss the shuttle, then you've got a long walk up a small mountain to the buildings where most of your classes are located."

College Sophomore,1,"More Spots Please – It can be very difficult to find a parking spot.  There is limited parking behind the apartments, and there are few options where students will not get tickets.  The campus police are constantly finding cars that are not in proper places.  Sometimes you just have to park in those spots though because there are so few options.  Lincoln Memorial is building though, and more parking areas are popping up.  Hopefully this will continue to improve."

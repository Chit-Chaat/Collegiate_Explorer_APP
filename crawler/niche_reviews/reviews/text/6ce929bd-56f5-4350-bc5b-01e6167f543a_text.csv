Niche User,5,I liked that the instructors are very into making sure the students succeed. When visiting hearing and talking with some of the instructors I could tell they truly care about their students and go out their way to make sure the students get what they need.
Freshman,5,A wonderful school who really cares about your well being. They treat you like family automatically.
Sophomore,5,"Mid-Atlantic Christian University is like a family and its truly helped me grow as a person in multiple areas of my life, including academics,  spiritual and personal. Its amazing to be surrounded by God fearing people."
Freshman,5,The staff and student body make you feel like you are a part of a family even though there may be alot of people. I don't think there is anything i would change. 
College Freshman,5,We are Christian school. Drug and alcohol use are not allowed at all. I love that because it keeps students safe and teaches them responsibility. Honesty and integrity are important at Mid-Atlantic Christian University. Attendance is important and academics are encouraged more than anything else.
College Freshman,5,"While the athletes may not be in the Olympics someday, they are very important to the student body. However, academics before athletics is stressed at Mid-Atlantic."
College Student,5,It's best no parties except those thrown all together by student life very out going people and always safe
College Student,5,It's free and park at dorms with classes across the street
College Student,5,Huge out door on the river amazing activies and outgoing people

Recent Alumnus,5,Mrs Pipkins is the bomb! All of our faculty is amazing and work hard for their students :)
Recent Alumnus,5,"I pull into the same spot everyday, it's close to everything, and it's free :)"
Recent Alumnus,5,There is absolutely no toleration of drugs of alcohol at my school which I am proud of. :) 
Recent Alumnus,5,"I commute, but when I spend the night in the dorms, I receive excellent treatment and enjoy the atmosphere.  "
Recent Alumnus,5,"My school is my family, simply put. It is a very tight knit environment, and the professors are some of the most dedicated you will ever find.   "
College Sophomore,5,"Wifi has gotten much better. Only one computer lab, but enough for the entire school."
College Sophomore,5,"We have good parking, but we are a small school, so there is not much that could be considered bad."
College Sophomore,5,"Although there has been a bit of drama, my experience here has been the best in my life. I feel at home here and I would definitely choose to come back. I have learned so much, not just academically, but about myself as well. I absolutely love it here. "
Alum,4,"I enjoyed Mid-Atlant Christian University because it was small. I did not get swallowed up in a large school. I got to know my professors and my classmates. Because of the small classes, it was easier to ask for assistance when I needed it and we celebrated our successes together."
Alum,4,"Like other classes, online classes depend on the professor. Some professors are better at technology than others, therefore they have a better online presence. Other professors struggle with any technology more complicated than a calculator, thereby leaving the students to fend for themselves or (as what often happens) help one another."
Junior,4,Good because everything is put up for us to be successful. The platform made us prepare for the future and for what’s to come.
Junior,4,I rate it 4 stars because everything was layed out perfect for the students to continue learning with out being on campus
Senior,4,"I have loved being here. The courses are challenging, the professors care about you as a student, and the friendships formed on campus are life-changing. I have grown immeasurably through my experience here."
College Sophomore,4,"Professors are kind, caring, and charitable. They will do what they can to help you and will listen to you."
College Sophomore,4,Overall I feel that prospects are good they are adding a biology department and I am looking forward to seeing how that turns out
College Sophomore,4,"Overall the school is good, would love to see some more clubs formed, and would like to see some stronger efforts on helping students who struggle financially, especially if the student took a year or more off from school"
College Freshman,4,I am majoring in counseling and psychology. The program is very popular even though the student body is small. The workload is reasonable and the adviser is always available. The curriculum is Christ centered like all majors at Mid-Atlantic. There are a variety of job opportunities for this particular major and jobs for counselors are always in demand.
College Freshman,4,There are plenty of different restaurants where one can never get bored. There is always something good to eat!
Recent Alumnus,4,"The weather is pretty moderate all year round. It never gets too too hot or too too cold. It is literally right on the Elizabeth river, so thats nice :)"
Recent Alumnus,4,"The computer lab is highly available and rarely crowded. There is high internet speed, and you don't have to pay for printing in the computer lab which is nice. "
College Sophomore,4,"Living on the river means we have very nice scenery. There have been reports of a few things going down around town, but nothing too serious. Shopping is somewhat limited unless you are looking for quaint, small shops. There is no public transportation. Overall, I have received many good responses from the locals about our school. "
College Senior,4,"Mid Atlantic has an increasingly diverse population that is continuing to grow as the school encourages students from all over the globe to be a part of the community.  I enjoyed meeting a variety of people who came from a number of backgrounds, including home-schoolers, country folk, urbanites, beach bums, northerners, and southerners from a number of states as well as international students from several countries."
College Senior,4,"Mid Atlantic is a great college, and I treasure my time there.  Knowledgeable professors that care and a personalized educational setting make this college a great place to learn and to grow both academically and spiritually."
College Sophomore,4,The security is very reliable and makes students feel safe. Have key cards to enter the buildings with Resident assistants  to enforce rules and safety within the dorms.
College Junior,4,Team Performance – Our teams are doing great both football and basketball are tops in there division. The girls softball are as well top in the division.
College Junior,4,"Guy and Girls – The girls that go to my school are hot, the night life here is great, not only the girls are hot but they are smart as well."
College Sophomore,2,It does not exist on campus I heard there was some at one point but not for a long time
College Sophomore,2,"There is some support from the campus but it's still bad. The gym has carpet walls and pew seats as bleachers. There are very few resources for athletics and athletes. The designs of t-shirts and jerseys do not look official. The success of teams is largely dependent upon individual athletes with their own talents which they have accumulated without the assistance of the school, except for providing subpar facilities. To sum it up, there are sports teams at MACU but no athletic program.  It's an embarrassment compared to athletic programs at other schools especially those we have to compete against."
College Sophomore,1,Non existent. There was some student club with a Greek name but it turned out to be a preaching thing for students. I've heard rumors of trying to start a sorority but I'll be interested to see how that goes on this campus.
College Sophomore,1,"The school tries to act like its diverse by exploiting every individual that doesn't look white and conservative every chance possible. The large majority of students and staff look the same, act the same, and believe the same."

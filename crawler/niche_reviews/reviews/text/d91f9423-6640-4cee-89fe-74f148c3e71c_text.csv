Sophomore,5,I really like Davenport University. I will be a sophomore in the fall. I like the small class sizes and the one on one time with professors.
Sophomore,5,I love Davenport! Such wonderful advisors and teachers who are helpful and understanding. I never thought I would succeed in college until I came to Davenport.
Sophomore,5,"In the midst of the COVID 19 pandemic, my in seat classes moved to online. Although it was a bit hard, my teachers were very flexible and understanding."
Senior,5,"I have taken several online courses with Davenport. I thought it would be tricky, but really it was easy to navigate. The due dates and materials were easy to find."
Senior,5,I have had a wonderful experience with Davenport so far and I only have one year left! All of the instructors have an abundance of knowledge and are always so helpful.
Junior,5,My online learning experience has been great. There are a ton of resources if I ever find myself stuck or unable to understand a topic.
Junior,5,I like the flexibility that Davenport offers. Not only that but advisors are great mentors in helping lead the way.
Junior,5,"My online learning experience with Davenport University has been overall good. Most of my classes have been in seat classes, because I prefer it that way. This past winter semester when Covid-19 hit, and all of our classes were moved online, everyone involved made it such a smooth transition. Although it was very frustrating having to transition online and move out very quickly without much notice, I honestly think it went smooth. Professors were very helpful with being right there to answer questions and make things clear and I was able to end the year very strong."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love this school. When I was first interested in Davenport, all of the staff I talked to and worked with were so helpful and nice about getting me enrolled and helping me find my way. I got randomly placed with my roommates and we are all now best friends, I love all my classes and professors, and I am so excited to continue my education here. All of the professors are so helpful if I am struggling and are always so open to talking with me. I love life on campus as well, the housing is very convenient and I enjoy going to activities and sporting events and meeting new people. Everyone is friendly, helpful, and I never have to worry about my safety here."
Freshman,5,"So far they have helped me so much, they have helped me step by step do that i am comfortable coming in as a freshman.They have made sure financially I am ready and that im am comfort with the major i have chosen."
Senior,5,I like how professors are very accesible. Also the buildings aren’t that far apart so getting to classes are easy.
Senior,5,I took one online class with Davenport and it was great. The professor was very accessible and the syllabus was very clear.
Senior,5,The hands on experience in labs along with active SIMS. The one on one with professors and the Director of Nursing. The approach they have for students that are struggling through classes and always finding ways to help each student achieve their goals. The variety of clinical areas chose for nursing students. Students coming together as one during this adventure and always feeling welcomed.
Senior,5,"Through this pandemic Davenport University came together as one. The professors had online classes ready to go, along with the rest of our clinical hours. This is not a easy time for anyone but they took their time to make sure each of us students were ready for this big change in life. I've taken a few online classes before the pandemic, which also helped during this difficult time. In seat is amazing!! Hands on is huge in seat at Davenport University with labs and classes."
Junior,5,"I was a transfer from a larger school where I felt lost and unsupported, Davenport made sure the transition was easy and the faculty have been a big reason why I have been so successful"
Senior,5,Online classes were taught well and professors graded assignments in a timely manner. I appreciated the convenience of taking classes in the convenience of my own home.
Senior,5,Davenport University is a phenomenal school that truly cares about each and every student. They are well equipped to handle any situation that comes their way. I would recommend Davenport University.
Junior,5,"Davenport has been an extremely inviting university. Davenport is very big on equity and inclusion, which means they make a point of ensuring people from all walks of life feel welcomed and embraced on their campuses."
Junior,5,My online experience with Davenport has been great. All of my professors give prompt responses to my emails and requests. Their online platform is very easy to navigate; even for someone like myself who is not tech savvy.
Freshman,5,The campus is amazing.  Its nice and small and not overwhelming.  The dorms are also very spacious and everyone there is so nice.
Sophomore,5,I enjoyed the diversity and support staff> I also enjoyed how it felt like I was at home more than I was at school
Junior,5,"I have loved every second of my experience at Davenport University, taking the full online courses. I have since been relocated due to work twice and have lived in a total of 3 states since and it has been a breeze since I was in all online courses. I wouldn't have done it any other way, Davenport makes taking courses, registering for classes, books, etc. so much easier than community college was."
Niche User,5,I enjoy how nicely designed the campus is and the teacher to student ratio! It is great for students looking for help with courses and the student body and activities provide an outlet for fun.
Senior,5,Davenport University has made it so easy to go back to school.  Best college around! Everyone is wonderful.
Freshman,5,"This is my first year at Davenport, everyone has been great with registration and student loan information!"
Freshman,5,Davenport is great classes are small to get that one on one you need to pass your classes. Students are helpful. Library is great everything you need to write a great essay
Senior,5,Davenport has helped me to realize my dreams of becoming an accountant in the Genesee County area and helping to improve myself and as an extension the company I work for one class at a time.
Sophomore,5,"My experience with Davenport University has been nothing short of excellent from the very beginning. From the moment I applied, the admissions staff contacted me, getting me set up with the correct people and appointments to get things off to the right start. This university is very personable and makes me feel comfortable knowing that I have someone to reach out to, any time I need. The response time with questions I have are no longer than a day. I would recommend Davenport to friends and family, in which I already have. I know tuition is more expensive than some colleges, but it's more one on one. I feel that you are considered a student there and they want you to succeed. You're not just a number in the university's eye."
Freshman,5,I love it here! They have many opportunities and resources to grow! The class sizes are small and the professors are very helpful!
Sophomore,5,"Davenport University is an extremely intelligent, professional, and overall wonderful school. The professors are knowledgable and they really care about your success. The small class sizes allow for an intimate session that makes learning easier and more enjoyable."
Niche User,5,"I like how they are so nice and very helpful when it comes down to getting help to apply and all. Also I don't see nothing that they should change, they are great the way they are."
Junior,5,"Davenport University is an excellent school. The professors are extremely helpful, along with the rest of the staff. The campus is small, making is easy to get around. The course load can be overwhelming at times, but that is the case for any college! Overall, I love my school!"
Junior,5,"Small Classes with high tech. Professors genuinely care about your education and push you to succeed. The atmosphere is great and you get what you paid for, quality teaching."
Junior,5,"Starting in the fall of 2019, I will be a Junior at Davenport University Midland Campus. So far, I have had a great experience. The Midland center is a small campus, which allows you to connect with everybody in your program and spend one on one time with your professors. Personally, I am in the Nursing program, and I can say that the professors truly care that you are learning, and they are experienced nurses themselves. Keep in mind that since the campus is so small, there is no on campus dorms, housing, or cafeterias."
Junior,5,I LOVE EVERYTHING THERE IS ABOUT DAVENPORT. THE ADVISORS AND PROFESSORS ARE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. THEY HELP YOU WITH EVERYTHING YOU DO AND ARE ALWAYS THERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. I HAVE NEVER MET COLLEGE ADVISORS THAT CARE SO MUCH AND ARE WILLING TO DO WHATEVER THEY CAN TO HELP YOU GET ALL THE AID YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL
Freshman,5,I enjoy the overall environment of Davenport University. Admission process was simple and financial aid counselors are available and helpful.
Freshman,5,"Davenport University is one of the best colleges that I have visited when I was a senior in high school. They really care about their students, and they most definitely have a big regard when it comes to athletics."
Niche User,5,Davenport university is a small school where professors care about the success of the students and want to see them reach their full potential. The area of Grand Rapids is nice while the students of Davenport and other civilians in Grand Rapids are kind.
Junior,5,Davenport University is a college that cares enough to make sure you as a student get the best college experience. I am a learning disable student and Davenport has educationally embraced me by adhering to my needs and giving me the confidence to know I can succeed.
Freshman,5,Wonderful teachers and staff. They have been very supportive and accommodating when I had difficulty due to issues in life.
Sophomore,5,I chose Davenport because it is close to my house and has the major that I'm going into. I'm a second-year nursing student at Davenport and I LOVE IT! The campus is very clean and safe. I see a public safety officer at least once a day when I am at school. The school is always very clean and well kept. The professors are very invested in their students' education and are always willing to help. One of the things that drew me to Davenport was the small class sizes. My largest class this semester was 32. This worked out great for me because my high school was very small and my senior class was 27.
Sophomore,5,Everything within this university is so well organized. The school does its best to make this experience as easy as possible when it comes to getting everything set up and prepared for you to get stated at a university.
Niche User,5,"I am not a student there, but I am considering in attending after high school. I really like that it is a good business school and that the people that work there are extremely helpful."
Senior,5,I like the diversity on campus and quality education I have received at Davenport. I like that I can take many courses online. I would like to see the cost of attendance change. It is a bit expensive to attend the university.
Freshman,5,"Davenport University is a place that makes everyone feel welcomed. The professors make sure that the students know the material, and the people around campus are super friendly. Davenport is close to downtown Grand Rapids, and there is a lot to do in the area."
Junior,5,"Davenport has changed for life for the better. From the professors that actually care to the academics that are real world applicable, Davenport has inspired and pushed me to start my own business and to become a successful and productive member of society. Anyone who disagrees either has not tried reach out to others or was not serious about an eduction. That is all I have to say about these reviews."
Junior,5,"Upon applying to Davenport University, I was looking for a quality business school and I found one in Davenport. The courses are enlightening and informative. The instructors are informative and really care about the students and how they are doing. There are many resources that you can turn to for support if you are struggling with a course or if you just have an issue. The dorms are great, and the sports teams are fun! I got the college experience at Davenport and I am very happy to be a student in the land of the Panthers!

Go Davenport University!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Davenport! I am a nontraditional student, and DU made the transition back to school quite effortless. DU offers small class sizes, professors who actually care and want to see you succeed, and focus more on ensuring you truly absorb the material instead of just memorizing it to pass a test. I'm not sure of the nightlife here because my party days are long gone, but from what I've heard, it can be a fun time!"
Junior,5,I am currently in the Nursing Program at Davenport University. The classroom sizes are small and you really get to know your professors. They are very personable which was very important to me before I started attending Davenport.
Sophomore,5,"I like the small community and the new, up-to-date campus. Everyone is very friendly and willing to always help."
Junior,5,Overall my experience at Davenport University has been great but my favorite part are the adjunct instructors I have had. Most have careers in the fields they are teaching about and their perspective and the advice they give is very helpful.
Junior,5,Excellent college to attend.  Great staff and professors who really care about the students future.  I would suggest this school to anyone.  It is known for its business and nursing programs and after attending the college I would agree with this.
Sophomore,5,"Classes are small, but the learning is big. Very good resources, and helpful professors. Advisers guide you through your academic success. Lots of sports and organizations. Many activities for students, and ways to meet new people."
Senior,5,"I have had a great experience with taking online courses thru Davenport to achieve my Marketing degree. I find all of the courses new and relevant to my future career. The university is always updating and creating fresh new course materials. All of the instructors have been helpful and eager to teach. Overall, it has been a wonderful experience."
Senior,5,Overall I have had an amazing experience here. The classes are small enough to where students can get one on one help with from the instructors. I love that the instructors have real life experience and can give examples they have dealt with. The campus where I attend is always clean and there is always public safety there.
Junior,5,They are very willing to help you succeed! They took all my credits from all of the colleges I have gone to. They want you to feel comfortable coming to them for help.
Junior,5,"Davenport has brought many amazing experiences to my life since starting in fall 2016. The classes are smaller, but the environment is amazing and helps make learning easier. I also really appreciate the professors provided at Davenport, they are helpful and make the classroom personal with each individual. Lastly, my academic adviser is very helpful and has an answer for any question I have, she makes scheduling classes simple and convenient."
Junior,5,I love the smaller size classrooms and that you can have a 1 on 1 conversation with you teacher. Your professors are active in the studies they are teaching and have real world experience to pass to students.
Senior,5,Davenport has given me the flexibility to complete my degree completely online. It fits well with a busy young family and full time employment. The instructors are knowledgeable and engaging. I’ve had great experiences with the financial aid department and advisors. I would recommend Davenport University to anyone wanting a flexible schedule.
Alum,4,The Davenport University supported  me throughout getting two undergraduate degrees and helping me grow personally and professionally.
Alum,4,"I completed one of my two Bachelor's degrees completely online, and the staff did great. The professors were easy to contact and the requirements and expectations were laid out clearly."
Junior,4,What I love about Davenport University is the small class size. People end up having a better chance at succeeding because they can form a special bond with their professors.
Freshman,4,The teachers really connect with you and make things as clear as possible. Also due to Covid-19 Davenport University gives students options by offering classes on campus and online for fall.The university is currently creating hybrid models of instruction by offering classes that will combine online and face-to-face instruction.
Senior,4,The Nursing program is a strong program and produces nurses that are well equipped for their job. The classes are smaller so that is nice as well.
Junior,4,The advisors are always aware of your grades and how they can help so that you achieve your goals. They are very hands on and helpful
Sophomore,4,"I love most things about Davenport. I'm currently in the Nursing program,and feel very supported by the teaching staff. The only issue I have is financially being able to support myself and still pay for school. I wish Davenport could lower school costs somehow."
Freshman,4,"I had lots of trouble with my tuition and charges and also with my FAFSA which the office tried their best but it was all still confusing. As a first time college student I feel like they should offer more information about course credits, financial aid and finding scholarships, and about what I need in order to graduate. Overall my experience is going pretty well considering this is only my second semester there but hopefully things become clearer along the way."
Freshman,4,"I go to the Warren Campus.  It's a smaller campus so there is smaller instructor to student ratio.  This makes the instructors easy to get in touch with and get one-on-one assistance with assignments.  The staff is also incredibly helpful and they go above and beyond to ensure that their students have everything they need.  It is a commuter college, so there are no dorms or on campus eateries, however, it is close to several restaurants and shopping centers.  I only wish they had an onsite bookstore."
Sophomore,4,What I like about Davenport is the small class sizes in which you can talk with the professor about any questions you might have.
Sophomore,4,"I haven't had a long experience with DU, this is my first semester with the University and I start tomorrow. So far everything has been good. Looking forward to moving forward with classes."
Sophomore,4,"Loved it!! Loved the environment as well as the teaching staff!! Incredible education, athletics, and student life. Clean and wonderfully maintained campus as well!"
Sophomore,4,Davenport University has small class sizes and teachers that are willing to help to set you up for success. The resources at Davenport are amazing they have a high-tech nursing sim lab where you can practice real life scenarios so you are prepared. But since Davenport is a private school it is pricey.
Senior,4,I have transferred a few times and my favorite thing about davenport is how dedicated their advisors are to really helping students achieve their needs and goals.
Senior,4,"I love Davenport University overall. It is a very small University, but it is a great fit for me. DU has small class sizes, so it is easier for me to stay focus in class. DU has great living situations on and off campus, being ""off"" campus is still very close, so the drive is short. DU has a coffee shop, and a couple dinning areas. For being a small campus, I think DU does a great job of having campus activities year-round."
Senior,4,I really like the customer service that Davenport University offers. I get very quick responses when I need help from advising to financial aid. Everyone is also really friendly.
Graduate Student,4,"Davenport University is a tight knit community that provides a sense of belonging.  It is a great place for people seeking a great education that is unique to them for classroom sizes are small, which allows students to create a higher-learning relationship with the professors.  Also, almost everyone knows everyone on the campus, which promotes the sense of community.  There are many opportunities to get to know other students through multiple campus events and sporting events that take place.  I believe this is the optimal environment to become educated in an area that interests you."
Freshman,4,There’s lots of things to do on the campus. They often have news letters. I liked most of my teachers and the place is pretty diverse. Compared to other colleges this one is pretty straight forward and easier. It’s in Grand Rapids so you’re 20 minutes away from everything.
Niche User,4,"I have had a good experience with Davenport! I have received a good amount of help from the staff and students. It is a super well set up school! I love the size of the classes. The campus in GR is pretty lowkey, but still nice and good size for learning and asking questions in classes."
Niche User,4,A close campus that is also close to home. The professors are good but have little time to talk to students. The athletics are very good and I will be playing there soon. I don't like that the football program is taking away all the money from other programs so many other sports are now lacking in money while the football team sucks it all away. Other than that life is good and they set people up well with life after college by opening doors for internships and getting you real life experience.
Junior,4,Glad to be back at Davenport.  Transferred somewhere else for a couple years (part time) and wasnt as happy with the programs.  Great campus and support available
Sophomore,4,"The professors want you to succeed, and will help to the best they can. I didn't live on campus, so I can't speak much about the housing or food. The campus was always clean and the parking was free and not a far walk. The campus was pretty small, so all of my classes were very close."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Davenport University has been great. The class size is on average smaller, leading to better interaction between the student and professor. If I have any questions or comments about the class, i can either schedule a meeting, or email them and expect a quick an immediate response.  The campus is smaller so it is very easy to go from class to class. the food selection is great. Parking, unlike some local universities is FREE! Overall there is not much to complain about with DU. Become a Panther Today!!"
Freshman,4,"I’m currently a highschool senior dual enrolled with Davenport and I think this is a pretty good school for what I want to do, I am accepted and plan on attending for fall 2019. I would say, if you are unsure of what you want to do/think you might change your mind, Davenport might not be it for you. It’s a very business oriented school, and doesn’t offer a wide array of programs, and many credits don’t transfer if you change your mind"
Junior,4,"I LIKE TH STAFF AND THE CARE THAT THE STAFF EXCUDES EACH AND EVERYDAY, I ENJOY HOW THEY LOVE THEIR JOB AND WANT TO MAKE THE ENVIRONMENT THERE AN WONDERFUL EXPERIENCE FOR ME."
Freshman,4,"Davenport University so far has been a little complicating. I attend the Warren, MI campus because they have a nursing program that I found interesting. The staff along the program was a bit rude, they wait to the last minute to tell you things, can’t get in contact with anyone because they email you super late and it’s just unprofessional. Im hoping my classes and professors are so much better than what I’ve seen so far."
Senior,4,They have been so helpful getting me transferred. All questions answered quickly and if needed they get me in touch with the right people!
Sophomore,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at DU so far! It is a small campus so you will know almost everybody, and it is really fast and easy to get from one side of campus to the other. The facilities are wonderful and seem brand new. The staff and faculty are wonderful for the most part, they are always willing to help out."
Freshman,4,Davenport has been a great experience. They have helped me in so many ways! From financial aid to helping me apply for my program with a week before the deadline. Which I was accepted to thanks to all of their help. They have also kept in contact with me through email as well as face to face meeting on campus. They helped me to get my classes transferred from my previous school too. They are close to home so they allowed me to apply to the campus in Lansing instead of all the way in Grand Rapids. They truly care about their students. I am so glad I transferred to this school. It has changed my life completely. I can see myself getting my bachelors degree and finally having the career I have been dreaming of.
Freshman,4,Davenport is nice commuter school. It caters to the working adult forum. however does not offer weekend classes.
Sophomore,4,I like the location of Davenport University but I would like to see more majors like education and things related to that
Senior,4,"I have gone to Davenport University for more than 2 years now. Davenport faculty have always been very kind, knowledgeable, and supportive. From the professors to the financial aid staff to the receptionist you know you are in good hands. I have felt at one with the community of Davenport University and there is nowhere else that I would like to go. Even after you are done with classes Davenport is not done with you. There are plenty of alumni functions. Also, as you prepare to leave for the real world Davenport will assist you to find a job. I lost my job once and found Davenport’s hand reaching out to help me find another one."
Freshman,4,Davenport has very nice dorm rooms no matter which building you live in. The athletic teams are very well funded no matter if it is NCAA or a club team. The school is in a very safe area and is close to many places to eat and other types of entertainment.
Freshman,4,"Being a small campus, you really get to know your professors. Nice small class size, individual attention, free tutoring offered by actual professors, not other students."
Senior,4,My online professors showed a interest in me as an older student. From the bookstore to my concerned in the classrooms all my previous instructors and faculty welcome me with open arms
Graduate Student,4,Professors are very nice and helpful.  Taking the online classes.  Wonderful classmates that help each other out.  Very enjoyable experience.  Looking forward to finishing up my master's and ready to work as a nurse practitioner
Sophomore,4,"Great community to be a part of! The staff and students are, for the most part, friendly, welcoming, and helpful. There are always campus activities to participate in and new opportunities waiting to happen."
Niche User,4,"When I took my visit to DU, I was very invited by all of the people there. The admissions office was one of the best that I have ever been to. The campus is a smaller campus so you would not feel rushed when going from class to class because everything is right next to each other. I love how close it is to Grand Rapids because the city is always alive. There is always things to do in the city."
Sophomore,4,I like Davenport University a lot because I got to transfer credits from high school in so I came in as a sophomore instead of a freshman. I like the small class sizes because I get one on one attention from my professors and learn exactly what businesses are looking for.
Sophomore,4,The classes are very challenging and the course loads can be massive. But the instructors really do want you to do your best and go out of their way to make sure you understand the material and succeed in your chosen major.
Junior,4,"what i like about davenport is that the class sizes are small enough to accommodate the needs of individuals. advisors are very helpful in scheduling your classes and the technology is very up to date. what i would change about davenport is the parking (specifically lansing campus). there is not enough parking in the designated lot, therefore we are forced to park in a ramp, located off campus."
Sophomore,4,"At Davenport you will obtain a great education if you like the ambiance. The classrooms are small enough to communicate with your professor one on one. For students who need extra help there is tutoring available. There are many activities throughout the month for “fun”, but there is nothing major. If you want the college crazy fun experience this is not the place to find it. The college is not very big therefore there isn’t an extensive amount of things you can participate in."
Niche User,4,"I am not currently a student but I had a tour of the campus I would be attending if accepted on Sept 16th this year. My first impression on the business campus was ""this is small"". The area is a new building which is highly tech savvy, filled with smart boards, and  business ""meeting rooms"" (The meeting rooms were impressive, just pointing that out). This University is my fit because the classes are small about 8-15 students max in each class, also Davenport offers articulated credit. This means that with all of the AP classes I have had a B or higher in (even without taking the AP College test) I can still get the college credit. Overall, Davenport to me is the best college I can get into and I can't wait to be a Davenport Panther."
Niche User,4,It was good. The food was alright i mean they dont have a lot of options to choose from to study.                                                                                                        n .
Sophomore,4,"Parking is great. Food is amazing. Classes are not too hard. A lot of homework time in very few classes. They have fun events going on and people are really nice. Smoke free which is great. Campus is easy to get around, it is not to big."
Sophomore,4,Panther prowl was a really good experience for all incoming freshmen and.transfer students. Something that could be changed would be more opportunity for students scholarship and funds.
Senior,4,"Davenport has been an amazing college to attend. My biggest class size was around 25 students, making the face to face interaction between my professors and I possible. The professors new each student on a first name basis which really helped the learning experience. The only thing I can see needing improvement is their online education and the professors that teach those classes."
Senior,4,"I am a non-traditional student and Davenport is perfect for me. The  campus is the perfect size, there are two main buildings for classes which makes it easy to get from one class to the next. Most of the professors there are wonderful teachers and people. Davenport offers experiential learning which is one of my favorite things about their programs. The student life center is always offering fun things for the students to do like affordable trips to Tigers and Pistons games and day trips to Chicago. Davenport is private school and is a bit pricey but the school is smaller and the teacher to student ratio is not outrageous. I would change the requirement for rather expensive access to simulations for Word and Excel classes, it seems like that should be included in the tuition. Also, the Lettinga campus no longer offers Coke products. All in all, Davenport is a great school."
College Junior,4,Overall it's a good school.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm currently on the Track & Field team at my school and even outside of my sport, every sport is supported by everyone. The dedication as well as the motivation is above the charts."
College Junior,4,Davenport University is a career based college so it is a lot easier to get a job right after graduation. They prepare you well and have staff that is working in the actual fields they are teaching so they are very educated and have great experiences to share with us.
College Junior,4,There seems to be no problems with safety or health on the campus.
College Freshman,4,"Our campus is small, just one building, so things like assaults of any kind are really just not an issue. I feel safe and secure in our small community of students."
College Freshman,4,"I've only been at Davenport for a couple of semesters and have to say that I've enjoyed my experience thus far. The staff are highly competent and always helpful, the teachers know their stuff and are excellent at making themselves available and communicating with students and the programs of study are pertinent to life in the real world today."
College Junior,4,Davenport is a great college. I would recommend the school to anyone.
College Sophomore,4,"Great school, glad to be affiliated with it. I go to a satellite campus, and much is to be desired there than it is at the main campus"
College Sophomore,4,"Sports seem to play a huge part of the people at the school. New and improved sports facilities and buildings on campus, including a brand new football stadium for the new football team"
College Sophomore,4,"Very hard and small program availability. Once in, very difficult classes with tough curriculum and grading standers. Many students fail out of the program, but it is possible to time manage and learn efficient ways to study. Exams practically each week in class, must plan for lots of time to study. Teachers are great, know you by name, and will make every effort to make time and help you. Great small school feel and help."
College Junior,4,have had several job offers even though i am not quite done with school yet.
College Junior,4,have enjoyed my learning experience.
Senior,2,The program used for the online schooling was not the most user friendly. There were a lot of connectivity issues and it was hard to communicate with the teachers.
Sophomore,2,I have had quite a few issues attending Davenport University. I had multiple teachers that were unclear and left during the final weeks of the semester. Communication tends to be very last minute towards students and RSOs.
Freshman,2,"One good aspect of the program is that they have flexible school schedules, however; they select your schedule every semester and it changes. The only way to change  your schedule is to find someone who will switch with you.
If you have prior knowledge of the material you will do well. If not, important information is encompassed in slides and the teachers don’t always have enough time to cover them all in class. Class attendance is mandatory, despite a lot of the information being self taught."
Freshman,2,"Davenport University is made to look PERFECT on paper.  Keyword meaning ON PAPER.  Academically, the classes are great.  If you live on campus, you need a car.  The closest ""civilization"" is 4 miles away.  This is a commuter school.  No one is here on the weekends.  Everyone who lives on campus here lives within an hour of the school, and goes home every weekend.  The food is also of poor quality.  I am upset with my experience, and am transferring after only 1 semester here.  I highly suggest researching the school before attending."
College Junior,2,"I recently went to career services hoping to have help with resume and internship opportunities. My first meeting the councilor ""forgot"" about. This was a wasted drive and wasted time. I received little help with resume and career building. I found my own opportunities through online sites such as Indeed, and Monsterjobs. For Davenport having so many resources and connections it's amazing how hard it is to find a job in my career field."
College Junior,2,I am not sure why this is asking about Greek life on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Its an academic school therefore athletics are secondary, as they should be in an institution of higher education."
College Senior,2,Strict campus that has RAs monitoring floors
College Junior,2,Midland campus needs an option other than vending.
College Senior,2,There is no housing in Kalamazoo campus.
College Senior,2,no one seems to know whats going on. you have to talk to 3 people more than once to get even basic answers. there are fewer parking spots in student parking than students and no off campus parking anywhere nearby. never trust an adviser to know whats going on.
Recent Alumnus,2,Off campus dining is really bad unless you know exactly where to go the options are limited but there are a few spots that will provide excellent food as well.
College Junior,2,"Michigan weather, you can have all four seasons in one day."
College Freshman,2,"I had classes canceled a few time. We also had to leave early due to weather. It is not their fault, we just keep getting slammed with mass amounts of snow that makes traveling extremely dangerous."
College Junior,2,They don't offer many options for non-traditional students.
College Junior,2,Flint campus has no housing.
College Junior,2,"Flint, Campus does not have any sports."
College Student,2,DU has a decent library system but needs to have more memberships to more databases.
College Sophomore,2,"The snow can get in the way of getting to class sometimes.  Classes are very rarely canceled for inclement weather, so this can make things a little dangerous getting there."
College Freshman,2,"There is a shuttle bus for student use, but sometimes the schedule changes or the bus is late.  There isn't really anything in walking distance.  Having a friend with a car, or your own car, is recommended."
Junior,1,"Davenport is a terrible school. I've never had such a horrible advisor, any problem that arose or question I had, she would just direct me to someone else sending me on a wild goose chase. When packaged for scholarships, they put me into the wrong plan and wouldn't change it even though it was their mistake and I lost $4,000 because of it. Their website is set up to be incredibly confusing, making it that much harder to do online schooling! Lastly, once I finally got into the classes the professors were the worst I've ever had. They weren't flexible at all, graded extremely hard, and were unfathomably rude when conversing. Over half of the students in my classes dropped or withdrew in the first two weeks because it was just that bad. I then went on to read reviews on the professors to find that a majority that have had them had the same issues. Making me really wonder if the whole thing is just a racket to get money, because they obviously don't actually care about the academics."

Junior,1,Davenport University is all about their money. They do not care about their students' success. Their level of communication is also terrible. Getting them to respond to emails is like pulling a leg. I would not advise any young person to attend this university.
Senior,1,"Beware veterans attending this school. Davenport does not follow their own policies and will have you owing money to the VA if using your GI bill. I was dropped from a class after the class had ended and never notified until the VA called asking for the money I owed. I placed two appeals to Davenport to change my date of last attendance for the class. One was never responded to, the second one I finally got a letter stating the appeal was denied; Davenport’s reason is they “cannot honor the date change”. In the letter it states if you have questions to contact them at the given contact point. I have left numerous voice mails and have yet to receive a call back. You’re better off getting a TM and learning something rather than going to Davenport to waste benefits AND owe money."
Niche User,1,Davenport charges people for classes that they don't take.  Do not sign up for Davenport unless you want to be ripped off.  It's sad.  Universities do take advantage of people.

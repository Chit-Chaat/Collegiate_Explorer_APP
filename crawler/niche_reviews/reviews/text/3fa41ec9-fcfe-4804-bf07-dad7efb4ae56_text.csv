Graduate Student,5,My program was 100% online and I was able to complete my degree from home. The staff was helpful and made sure I had all of my questions answered.
Junior,5,Trident University is a great educational institution. I've been out of school for a few years and was a little nervous about starting school. The staff really care and helped me transition back into school. i made a great choice by attending Trident!!!
Junior,5,"With my current work location, I'm able to compete my degree online...which is a big help. Even though the classes are online, the workload is not too much to handle."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy how flexible the school can be with me. Since I am currently in the military, I am able to work and go to school. The school is very understanding of my situation and so are the professors. I have received so much help so far and can not wait for what is to come while enrolled in this school."
Graduate Student,5,"With over 6 years of active duty service I have accomplished more than I could have ever hoped for. I have earned my very first bachelors degree with TUI and hope to obtain my Dual Masters in Business and Health Administration with them in the near future. All of this is thanks to TUI for their flexibility, dedication, and availability to make this happen. Their staff is both professional and their faculty of professors and doctors are knowledgeable. Thank you so much TUI for helping me reach my goals!

-Andrew"
Junior,5,"It has been great, I even got $500 scholarship from them. They are really cheap and professors are always on time and respond your questions fast. They also give you time to complete assignments and give you extensions if you need it. Counselors are always communicating with you and telling you about your career path."
Graduate Student,5,I appreciate the setup of the doctoral program. The case assignment and the session long project are exemplary.
Graduate Student,5,"Convenient, flexible, applicable, relevant. Perfect for the adult student. Self discipline is a must and professors and staff are always willing to help."
Graduate Student,5,I have been very fortunate to have amazing instructors and faculty to assist me in my journey through the masters program.
Junior,5,"On-Line courses with 4 2-week modules is perfect for a busy life.  I can do the work on my own time, discussion boards keep you in touch with other students and faculty.  Courses are hard, but plenty of resources are available to help."
Freshman,5,"I had to transfer from a brick and mortar college to Trident University International. The staff have been very helpful, they have been very quick and accurate with my enrollment and financial aid. The best thing of all is that I have transferred more than enough accredited college credits to begin the Core classes of the Bachelors Degree I have chosen. I am very excited because as an adult learner and U.S. Army Veteran I love online classes. The discussions with other online students is very pleasing. I have taken and passed online classes from other accredited schools before and believe me, online school is not for everyone. If you are very young in age, it might be something very hard. I can cope with online classes. Overaol I know that I will do very well in Trident University International."
Alum,5,I am a student getting my MSL (Masters in Leadership) degree at Trident University.  I cannot say enough how great the professors are and how detailed the staff is.  What I like is they treat me like an adult and their learning method is preparing me for a more advanced and successful future.  I totally recommend this school to any adult learner.
Graduate Student,5,I love Trident University international. I started with them in 2014 after I transferred from American Military university because I was not getting the assistance I needed as an Active Duty military member working full time and going to school full time.  Trident university international got me registered and started within a month.  My advisor constantly checked in with me to get me through my course and that kept me on track.
Graduate Student,5,"From the time I enrolled I had access to many advisors via phone and email.  The web based academic portals are easy to navigate.  Overall, the flexibility they offer for me to obtain my MBA on my schedule is the reason I chose TUI.  Plus they really have it in their mission to serve veterans like myself."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at trident university was simply amazing. The couses were  streamlined and it was very easy to navigate through the coursework. Whenever I needed help or had a question, the professor or a fellow student (by posting the the board) would answer my questions. It was a great stepping stone to getting back in the college way of life. I have even had friends sign up and go back to college there after hearing about my experience."
Freshman,5,I like everything about trident university. I don't think they should change much about their college. It's an online college so you really can't do much much but it was a good start.
Graduate Student,5,"Trident University International doctoral program would help me accomplish my academic goals in several ways.  Firstly, a research based program would enhance my research skills through every course and would prepare me for dissertation phase of the program.  Secondly, the program is pay as go tuition payment, which is something important to me. The flexibility available to students in making tuition payment is critical to me, especially when compared to other doctoral programs in other schools, which demand tuition payments before class starts. Lastly, there is no requirements for books or expectation to attend on campus seminal, which also reduces the cost of the program.  Overall, I am excited to get started with the program and look forward to completing my studies within reasonable period."
Graduate Student,5,"Trident University facilitates a deep approach to learning.  The structure of the courses and content learned is always thought provoking and relevant.  This college is not for everyone.  In my experience, surface based structure of memorization, tests and examinations, and irrelevant facts and lessons pale in comparison to TUI's emphasis on grasping relevant knowledge, demonstrating a deep understanding of the material, and relating it to real world situations.  TUI has maintained my interest and motivation and has made me feel like every lesson and paper I've written has been important to my development and progression towards making a positive impact in the lives of others."
Recent Alumnus,5,With online courses it's at your own pace you have to be dedicated and focused. I find that if you like the social setting or peer-to-peer setting classroom is for you. Depending on your school some classes use both online and classroom. Which I find annoying because you're paying for a book just to use the computer for the majority of your courses. Normally online the schools provide links and websites for you to use to research your papers.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I am a veteran and I know lots of military Ret., Active, Vets that have attended Trident. I don't have much more to offer than that."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I have been attending Trident off and on over numerous years while figuring out whether I wanted to attend online or campus. I like online. Use the online dashboard and you  can't go wrong. Over the years they have updated their system dramatically. If your going to do Fastrac know you have only 1 week per session 3 separate papers and threaded discussion. If you have the time and patience Fastrac is for you. Me I like to take my time research, go to work take care of my family so right now I am taking advantage of their 12 week course."
College Sophomore,5,The best online instruction I have ever had. Timely responses.
College Sophomore,5,Excellent staff in human resources!
College Sophomore,5,Prospects are an immediate plus but they need to know hard work and dedication will move mountains. This university was established by tier one researchers. Enough said.

Ive been attending TUI X 14 months."

College Senior,5,I'm glad I found this school and only wish I would have earlier in my enlistment so I would have my degree by now.

College Freshman,5,The academic curriculum and topics in TUI are very great.
Graduate Student,4,Application process was simple and quick. The staff was great and easy to get in contact with. I constantly had staff reaching out to make sure all of my questions were answered along the way.
Graduate Student,4,Trident University International is excellent with the best professors. The courses are easy to follow.
Graduate Student,4,As advertised. Professors were a little slow in responding. Overall well rounded program.  Classes were current and the expectations were consistent. I enjoyed the program from day one. I capitalized on my past experience and felt each class brought further perspective and reason to my ultimate goal 🥅 of obtaining my masters. I have one reservation in the fact that I did not pursue the certification that I was eligible along with my degree.
Alum,4,TUI was a great experience for a student needing a flexible schedule.  All of my classes were on line giving me the ability to still be a mom and a full time employee.  The professors were always very responsive to any of my questions or problems.  The advisors were always available to help you decide when and which classes you needed to complete your program.  Over all I loved my experience with TUI.
Senior,4,I enjoyed the material and was able to learn from every course that I took. The courses were not too hard and I was also able to learn from the other students in the classes. The instructors were approachable and very helpful.
Alum,4,"Trident University offers the flexibility and support for Military Service members to further education in pursuit of excellence and maintain an competitive edge not only with peers but within private sector. Online education is becoming more recognizable throughout the country; Trident's student services, faculty and staff members offer the emotional intelligence and agility to accommodate the ever changing military environment to ensure Service Members receive premium education."
Senior,4,For an online college staff is very interactive and supportive. Easy to navigate online class room. Only negative is cost.
Graduate Student,4,I haven't started classes until the 13th of March. I have noticed the attention they have show and interest in my studies.
Freshman,4,"I've taken three classes with Trident University International so far and they have been great. I've learned a lot about my career path and I've been able to apply to my daily life. The instructors have been awesome so far, being there to answer any questions I've had and help guide me in the right direction when I got stuck. They are understanding of military folks, which is definitely helpful. I'm proud to be on my way to my BS degree with Trident helping me get there!"
Alum,4,"The class goes on your own schedule, which was great for flexibility and terrible for procrastination. The professors are helpful and knowledgeable, and will respond fairly quickly."
College Junior,4,The work load is the perfect amount. They give you enough work to learn the information and two weeks to do it in. Which is the perfect amount of time for me being in the military.
College Junior,4,I love how military friendly my school is. I think its so convenient that I can get called to go to the field out of the blue and one call to trident and my worries of not making the deadline for an assignment ceases.
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience has been very rewarding. Trident has an abundance of learning tools, and advisors that are ready to assist you with any problem or question you may have. I was very skeptical about taking online classes, and in fact had another school suggest that I take a computer class, before I even attempt to take on line classes.  Trident advisors were very encouraging, supportive, and reassured me that I would have someone that would be able to assist me with any concerns or problems that I encountered with the navigation of the computer. I would not choose any other school to complete, or further my education."
College Student,4,I honestly really like trident. Not only can I do the classes when it is convenient but I can also ask questions whenever needed. I think online schooling is only for certain people but if those going to an online college are dedicated to learn and succeed it is a wonderful choice. I love how trident is military friendly and understanding of most situations.
Recent Alumnus,4,When ever I have to interact with a professor they respond right away. Never had any issues with the course quality or style of course work. I had one class that I was extremely confused in understanding the assignment and called her she was at home. Answered my question and informed me that I could call her back it was 10:30pm.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The BA Health Science program at Trident touches on my aspects related to my field i don't feels as if the courses I'm taking are a waste of my time. The workload is fine, set aside at least 2hrs a course a day; and you'll be fine. Inform your professors early if you're confused the online TLC board is a one stop shop. Any and everything you need is available online. no fumbling around trying to figure out how to complete your assignments. Although if you work as a Gov or Fed employee not all the research library links will work properly under the network. FYI"
College Senior,4,"I enjoy the university's online classes because the assignments are short, the professors are straightforward, and the discussion board's are easy to use."
College Senior,4,"I found this school to be convenient because I am not bogged down with assignments, have access to great student advisors, and have learned from some great professors. I am glad I enrolled in Trident's MBA program."
College Senior,4,I am very pleased with the schedule
College Senior,4,Professors work with each student as an individual
College Senior,4,Too much interaction with other students. I thought online meant I would not interact with others but I am building networks all over the world with my classmates
College Junior,4,"My academic adviser has been absolutely outstanding. He keeps in contact with me, answers all of my questions, and always responds to my messages within a reasonable amount of time. This school really cares about their students."
College Junior,4,"The Fastrac classes are only 8 weeks long, so you cannot get behind or you will be lost!"
College Senior,4,Great experience if you are open to learning online!
College Senior,4,Very flexible schedule so able to work and go to school at the same time. Quick responses from professors and classmates.
College Freshman,4,I like the advanced access feature.  All modules are simple to navigate.
College Freshman,4,"I'm surrounded by other career-focused, working professionals."
College Freshman,4,"I'm paying a lot, but it's competitive with other universities"
College Freshman,4,I love that it's online and that there is dynamic library resource access.
College Freshman,4,"Getting enrolled and involved is easy, plus the student has the locus of control for most of their curricular needs being met.  Excellent online resources."
College Freshman,4,All of the instructors have been completely responsive and support sound learning through consistent guidance.
College Senior,4,Great and Smart Student Body.
College Senior,4,"Great PHD program, but hard to finish the Thesis because the professors int he program have very little time for you."
College Sophomore,4,The school is unique because you are given a opportunity to take a class get feedback and interact with your peers. The tuition is okay and not to much money.  the school offers a good selectino of majors to choose from and has eight sessions through out the year.
College Sophomore,4,You need a personal computer if you take online classes. The  service is rarely down or having any difficulties. The IT customer service personnel will help you with any computer issues.
College Sophomore,4,The process takes about 5 minutes. You ask questions about your financials. The staff will call you or email you and  walk you through the process and answer any questions you may have.
College Sophomore,4,I do not know much about the campus life because I take online classes but I like that the staff sent me a trident shirt to show school spirit.
College Sophomore,4,The Business Administration major is a great major. The work load is not too bad and you get the opportunity  to have additional resources provided to help you.
College Sophomore,4,I like that they evaluate the classes you have taken and let you know what transfer over and and how they fit into your degree plan.
College Sophomore,4,The staff are very polite and help you solve any issues that you may have or come across. The staff are their to help and advise on what you should pursue next. I enjoyed working with my advisors and  figuring out my degree plan.
College Sophomore,4,Mostly the interaction between the students who take online classes is through the threaded discussion. The threaded discussion is where the students write their responses to  questions. Ask a questions and just interact with other students and the Instructor.
College Junior,4,It is an online experience for me.
College Junior,4,I was prepared and had most of my financial aid ready.
College Junior,4,"The ease of returning back to school has been made simple at Trident University. I like working independently, taking online courses. I do not prefer the group setting, group projects, which has been the structure at other online universities. I can take more courses at my pace if I choose to graduate earlier. the prices are great and the University is military and military spouse friendly. Most of my previous college credits were accepted. I feel that TUI exists to help you further your education and does not exist primarily to recruit/profit."
College Junior,4,The professors are highly qualified. The curriculum is clearly outlined so there is no guesswork. The academic counselors assist all students with the preparation of a degree plan. The workload is not too bad compared to other schools that I have attended. There is ample time to understand the material that is being presented.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The ease of transferring credits was amazing, the tuition assistance on the other hand was not good."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The workload is manageable as long as you stay on top of the subjects week by week. it was never unbearable. The professor/student relationship was more one on one, even though it is online, and I personally prefer that type of interaction. "
Recent Alumnus,4,"It was simple to sign up for courses at TUI. Everything was set out for me telling me which courses I needed to take and I just chose online from there. The course curriculum is set in 2 week sections, with 3 different sessions to complete within the 2 week time frame, and then they have a required blog interaction where a subject is placed by our professor and everyone gets to respond to it, and also their classmates. "
Recent Alumnus,4,"Being a 100% online school, TUI's online library is free to students and provides access to multiple databases."
Recent Alumnus,4,So far its great. If there is a problem that I am having I can contact my professor or academic advisor and get a response almost immediately. 
Recent Alumnus,4,"Though the number of programs offered are limited, the concentrations in such programs are great. In my search for grad schools that offer MBAs, I have never seen one with a concentration in Criminal Justice Administration, until I found this one."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My undergrad major was in Criminology and Criminal Justice Studies. I was given the advice to continue my studies and to earn an MBA, that an MBA would open many doors for me. When I found that TUI not only offered a cost effective MBA program that was 100% online I became very interested, when I found out that they offered a concentration in Criminal Justice Administration, I immediately applied."
Recent Alumnus,4,"This is an online school, so the student body really isn't present so much."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Trident University International is an online only school. The Programs are designed for working professionals and for those serving over seas. For the convince of the students the University offers eight sessions a year with each session about 12 weeks long, we can take our classes at the pace that we want. "
College Junior,4,"I haven't had to do job searches yet, but they have a great alumni network."
College Junior,4,The school worked with me when I was unable to meet deadlines.
College Junior,4,"I enjoyed the online curriculum, interaction with my peer and professors."
College Junior,4,"They have an amazing library online available for student use, they leave us hyperlink trails to track down knowledge for ourselves."
College Sophomore,4,I like how the teachers are always responding to requests from students.  I have had a few occasions where I had to complete assignments after the course window; the dean and the teacher were accessible and understanding of my situation.
College Sophomore,4,"This is not a brick-and-mortar school (from my experience, I am taking classes online).  The network side for online classes is always available, I have never had an issue accessing coursework."
Alum,2,"TUI was the most educational online institution in 2011. Everything about the school worked for the military student.  What can I say about Trident today….Here is the downfall as a Veteran I have learned that in 2017 Trident University International had used misleading information to recruit “survivors” who have Post-9/11 GI Bill benefits. Survivors are the children of a father or mother who was killed while on active duty and their widows or husbands. Trident was sold and merged shortly after this became public and General Looney, General Metz and CSM William J. Gainey were replaced with AIU Board members and Trident was merged into American Intercontinental University who the VA intends to suspend enrollment of new GI Bill students ASAP. (After careful review and consideration of findings provided by the Federal Trade Commission and State Attorneys General Offices, VA has concluded there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that these schools have Ripped off Vets.)"
College Senior,2,Being so close to getting my degree and then I am told I cannot get any more Tuition Assistance
College Freshman,2,"See previous answers about fin aid. Long, tedious process. Always delayed and received after the class has already started. Gives 1st and second disbursement separately, and requires you to complete 1 module of current course to receive 2nd disbursement. Also, there is a rigid requirement to maintain a B avg on ALL graduate courses."
Alum,1,"Pointless curriculum, out of touch and out of date professors. The classwork is a joke and the staff are the worst there is."
Freshman,1,Read the wikipedia page on Trident and deceitful of practises. If you like writing papers like 2 a week and instructors that are proud of failing you this is the place. Try getting your financial aid. They will stall and even lie. Trust this school is way too difficult you'll end up paying double for having to take courses over. They target MGI bill recipients.

Graduate Student,1,I haven't been able to get a job a with my Associates Degree. Career services haven't been helpful at all.
Alum,1,"I have completed 1 undergrad & 2 grad programs with Trident. I once sang their praises, I can not in good faith recommend them or speak positively regarding my experience as I have been unsuccessful in using these degrees to secure employment.
When I was active duty, they were very supportive and accommodating to life's situations & were very accommodating to my peers with regards to deadline extensions and flexibility in completing sessions.
As a civilian, however, they have shown no concern or interest in helping me during a significant life changing time period. I was inadvertently dropped from their program with no recommendation or help in remediation.  I regret wasting my time and energy in their programs and wish that I could have spent my education benefits on a reputable school that wasn't in the business of exploiting veterans and discriminating against those with significant life circumstances."
College Junior,1,"I had one sorta of good professor, the rest were not working in their fields really, just grading work."
College Junior,1,The classwork was so easy. There was no text or resources. Wikipedia was an actual source for the assignments. Very cheap. I felt like I was teaching myself and paying for nothing. I was embarassed to put Trident on my resume.
College Freshman,1,There is a small discount for veteran's but no scholarship opportunities within the school.  The cost kept me from completing my program for the last two years.
College Senior,1,"The Admissions Department people seem to be the nicest people on earth but after you sign that enrollment agreement everything changes drastically. The Student Services Department and Financial Aid Department personnel are condescending, very negative, and very unhelpful. You would be wise to find another school."
College Senior,1,"Awful school, a waste of time and money."
College Senior,1,"Avoid this school, as you spend a lot of time fighting Financial Aid."
College Senior,1,"The Academic people and Administration people seem to be the nicest people on earth but after you sign that enrollment agreement everything changes drastically. The Financial Aid Department personnel are condescending, very negative, and very unhelpful. You would be wise to find another school."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I pay $1,000. per class with limited help. The military paid $4,500. for a fiscal year, and then my GI Bill was supposed to pick up where that left off but the advisor never got that far. When I applied for financial aid, I was denied by the school but was never told why. I understand why it is so expensive and cannot complain about the education I am getting at TUI but I think the tuition and financial aid process could be different and it would help out students a lot."
Recent Alumnus,1,They never went over that type of stuff with me

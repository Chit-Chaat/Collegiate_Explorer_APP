Freshman,5,Loyola University Maryland is filled with a welcoming atmosphere. Everyone is so helpful and encouraging and make people feel comfortable. I know that I feel safe and happy when I'm at Loyola. The school is well-known for their academics. Loyola has many wonderful professors who are amazing too.
Freshman,5,I am taking some classes online. I feel that the professors are very kind and helpful. If you have any questions your professors are their to assist you.
Junior,5,"I love attending Loyola. It was my top choice for college and I couldn’t be happier with the decision that I made. The academics are amazing, it is easy to get involved in a variety of activities and initiatives, and there are many opportunities to have strong relationships with staff and professors."
Alum,5,These were the best four years of my life. I loved learning on the beautiful campus and getting to apply it in real life scenarios while a student.
Sophomore,5,"The transition to online learning was difficult and abrupt, but the Loyola professors did everything in their power to help their students through the change. I felt that my learning was picked up where I left off and my professors were so helpful, it was as if I was on campus. I was completely pleased with how online learning went; so much so that I am looking forward to the fall semester, whether it is online or in person."
Freshman,5,"Loyola is by far the best decision I have made. It really feels like home for so many of us. When we all had to leave campus because of COVID-19, myself and so many of my classmates wanted to go back, we missed it every single second, we wanted to go back to where we belonged and the home that we all made- Loyola Maryland!"
Freshman,5,Loyola's an amazing place! The people are great and it really feels like a community. It's definitely a bar school but I think the nightlife scene is so much more fun than frat parties. Baltimore has a lot of great neighborhoods so there's a lot to do and explore. My professors show a genuine care for their students. There's a lot of options for food and the dinner is all you can eat. I even have an allergy and never have trouble finding options.
Freshman,5,Love it here. Home away from home. Everyone is awesome here. There is so much to do on campus. Truly a beautiful place. Baltimore isn’t as bad as everyone says it is. People have genuine care and concern for you. Not just a number here.
Sophomore,5,"Without a doubt, the people are the most special thing about this school. Everyone welcomes you with open arms and willing to answer any questions."
Freshman,5,"Friendly and confident staff who are all passionate about their subject. Tons of student-led organizations make getting involved in either clubs or activities easy for students and especially welcoming for first-years. The staff takes excellent care of students, housing is affordable and clean, almost all students receive some type of financial aid."
Niche User,5,I have not attended Loyola but I hope to get in and attend! It's the best college I've visited and I really want to go here!
Niche User,5,I toured Loyola 3 times this year to make sure it was one of the colleges I wanted to apply to! It has an excellent English/law program and I am excited about sending my application to the school.  It is my dream school do I hope I  able to get merit money and attend the law program
Senior,5,Loyola has provided me with a wonderful academic experience. I wouldn't trade my education here for anything.
Senior,5,"I chose Loyola due to the small class sizes, beautiful campus, and friendly student body. I'm a double major in Math & Physics here, and many people ask me why I would want to go to a school that is not necessarily known for its STEM offerings.  However, those people don't realize that small departments are where you find the professors who are there to teach, not solely research, and where you find the most individual attention. Not to mention, Loyola is ranked near the top for engineering among universities without a graduate program.

About the neighborhood, Loyola is in a perfectly safe neighborhood (Roland Park), and students are fine to walk around Govans as well. The people who write about how bad an area it is simply haven't taken the time to see it for themselves."
Niche User,5,"Loyola has a great campus with a rich culture. It embodies all the Jesuit values and emanates a real family feeling. The sports and school pride were all around you and everyone who is at loyola is visibly in love with the school . I am an incoming freshman and am very excited about the adventure that I'm about to embark upon at loyola. Easy to get help when you need it. I have friends who attend larger schools with great reputations, but who constantly have issues registering for the classes they need, understanding teachers who speak English as a second language, or taking classes in huge lecture hall settings. Overall, I like the smaller school size and individual attention I get a Loyola."
Niche User,5,Loyola University Maryland is absolutely beautiful! The campus is stunning and the overall feel is so inviting! I can't wait to spend my first year there.
Niche User,5,My sister goes to this university since she graduated at Parkville high school in 2017. Since then she got into the scholars program and attended the summer before school orientations. She stayed there for a week and made close friends that up until now she cherishes very much. She goes to multiple school trips that are both enjoyable and educational. She also does summer program that further enhances her skills in physics.
Junior,5,"You need to be able to seek out the opportunities available. Always talk to professors, not just to ask questions, but actually be interested in them. That's how you'll great good relationships."
Freshman,5,I love the setting and environment of Loyola University Maryland! I have never seen so many motivated individuals who strive for community service and academic excellence. I love the professors and the students are always kind.
Alum,5,Challenging academics but as an Alum it has lead to a great ROI! I'd love to see the Athletics Department pick it up a bit to get the University to the next level. Other than that.... great alumni network and life long friends!
Junior,5,"I have had an amazing time at Loyola so far. I love the community at Loyola and that I can recognize most people in my class, but not know every single person. I am involved in clubs on campus and volunteer. The academics are rigorous if you are in the right major and the school is absolutely beautiful."
Niche User,5,"The staff is amazing and helpful all around. I couldn't cover my book costs, as I lived by myself and the head of the chapel at campus took me to the book store and paid for them himself. The campus is clean and aesthetically pleasing, there is a wide variety of courses available. However, this is more of a full-time live on campus type of college because of the costs and class involvement."
Alum,5,"Loyola's location was one where we called it a bubble. Campus and streets directly next to it were good neighborhoods and left students not to worry too much about their safety. However, another street over and the environment would completely change. The classroom environment was great because they were all typically small classes. Only freshmen year did I have more than 30 classmates in one class. For the most part, the teachers are approachable but some can be difficult to reach out of office hours."
Senior,5,"Amezing college, amazing college, amazing college what you look for! ❤️❤️ The dorms are the best in the country and the campus is very beautiful. The best college to have the best experience ever and learn from it."
Junior,5,Great community. Wonderful facilities. Professors really care about you. I've made the best friends and had great times while here at Loyola. Abroad program is perfect. Helped me go to Australia where I had the best experience of my life.
Niche User,5,I have been to Loyola many times. I like the diversity of what you can do there. There are so many sports clubs and activities. I love how there are fairs and midnight snacks in the eateries.
Junior,5,"Loyola University is an outstanding Jesuit university that offers students a well-rounded college experience.  Not only is Loyola recognized for academic excellence, but also for community service and student engagement. I love being a part of such an inclusive study body and I highly recommned this college to an prospective student."
Freshman,5,"I love Loyola! Loyola is a great school for any student of any background to attend. While the majority of campus is white and Catholic, there are many students who are of different religious and race backgrounds. 
The academics here are challenging and you will be challenged each and every single day in the classroom. Don't skip class, your professor will notice since classes tend to be very small. You will have individualized attention from day one. Everyone at this school cares about you. There are so many opportunities to get involved on campus from on-campus jobs to academic, social, and service clubs. Students at this school work hard during the week and play hard during the weekend. This school is for the mature student who is seeking a well rounded education through the mind, spirit, and body!
COME TO LOYOLA! There is so much to love and I couldn't picture myself anywhere else!!!"
Freshman,5,"I love Loyola, the size of the school is great, it’s not too small but you don’t run into the same people all of the time."
Freshman,5,Great place. Amazing professors who are willing to take the time out to see you blossom into your fullest of potential. I like it here and I wouldn't choose anywhere else.  GO GREYHOUNDS!
Alum,5,"Loyola is an amazing opportunity and college to go too. It has an outstanding pscyhology, speech pathology, and business school. The professors are very knowledgable and caring."
Sophomore,5,Loyola University Maryland is a place that welcomes you with a spiritual vibe that takes on ones whole aurora. The second i had stepped foot on campus i had knew that it was the place for me. Not only if the campus beautiful but the academic rigor is competitive and the faculty is outstanding. Many of the Faculty are as of a matter of fact my friends that i can have casual day to day conversations with. Everyone at the school has a goal and that is to help everyone get to where they strive to be in life.
Freshman,5,"As an international student that had never lived in the USA before starting college, I feel as though Loyola was an excellent choice for me. Everyone (the students, the professors, the athletics coordinations/coaches) is so friendly, and due to Loyola's size, after the first few weeks of school you can't walk across campus without seeing a close friend! Despite the high acceptance rate, the academics are challenging yet interesting, and therefore worthwhile. Loyola's core curriculum, although intimidating at first, is extremely valuable in ensuring every student's education is well rounded (plus it helps to break up the classes for your major, which certainly helps me to stay focused by doing something different). Overall, I love Loyola, and am so happy with my decision to become a Greyhound!"
Freshman,5,"Loyola has really made me feel welcome. Being a freshman in college, obviously i was nervous about the new academics and life away from home but Loyola made me feel safe, giving me so many opportunities to forget about the homesickness. So many opportunities to stay on the right track with my grades as well with tutors available, office hours for teachers, even writing center help with papers. I have not once felt that i did not belong here this year, everything just put the pieces together for me and made me realize this is where i belong."
Sophomore,5,"Being based in Baltimore, you get the best of both worlds. Living in the city gives you great opportunities along with lots of things to do.  Loyola's placement within the city is ideal and the campus itself is so secluded from the rest of Baltimore that you can feel like you're in your own world.  The academics are challenging, yet always rewarding.  The professors at Loyola are very intelligent and a valuable part of the education here.  As a D1 sports school, there is always games to attend to things to do.  Loyola is rated as a school with some of the best housing on possible.  Almost everyone lives on campus for the entirety of their time at Loyola, which is different than other schools.  Although a bar school, there is a lot to do on campus and there is always fun things to do.  Overall, Loyola is a great school with great opportunities and constant rewards."
Sophomore,5,"The most important thing I could share about this school is that it is a real investment in education. The small class sizes, Jesuit values, and attentive staff will give you an education that other colleges lack. The environment at Loyola is excellent and if you are looking for a college with values than look no further than Loyola. The majority of students at Loyola seem to be natural leaders yet pressure of competitiveness found at other top ranking schools isn't there. Students are not put against each other or broken by being over worked, instead we are encouraged to enjoy learning, enjoy our social lives and ask our selves meaningfull questions that will allow us to grow as individuals. The only thing I would change is more school spirit, but with that being said you'll find that the Greyhounds are loyal to their athletics and dominate on most fields, courts, tracks and pools. Go Greyhounds! "
Recent Alumnus,5,"This school is a great school, but it is also small. If you don't like going out into the city for fun, probably not a great place."
College Junior,5,"Overall, my classroom experience has been absolutely enriching and excellent. I love the fact that I can walk up to a professor around campus and just talk about different topics. This approachability to my professors has allowed me to grow and to develop my ideas."
College Junior,5,I believe that one of Loyola's strengths is the large number of resources for students in all the fields. I'm certain that if I use my resources I will accomplish anything I set my mind to.
College Junior,5,"Loyola University Maryland's dorms are known for being the best! And after living in them for two years, I can tell you they really are amazing and spacious. It really makes living away from home a lot easier."
College Junior,5,"Loyola is known for their excellent athletics programs. I'm not a sporty person, but it's hard not to feel pride when the hounds win any event. GO HOUNDS!"
College Junior,5,Loyola is definitely an excellent place to discover yourself. It provides students with a friendly environment and the necessary support for them to accomplish any goal they set for themselves.
College Senior,5,"I have actually never had a bad professor at my school. Some professors can be super passionate about what they like so they talk all of the time and others like to joke around with students - it all depends on who you take. I always listen to the students who have taken upcoming professors in the past because that is definitely a deciding factor. A lot of the Communications professors have been in the Comm field for awhile so I trust what they say. I don't really like the 'core' classes that we need to take because I could have finished my degree in about half of the time I did without those classes. Class size at Loyola is usually around 25 which gives you enough space to know the teacher if you want to or just be a name on a piece of paper if that's what you prefer as well, just know that some professors won't keep it that way."
College Senior,5,"Loyola's different because we're a campus smack in the middle of Baltimore. We have the campus and city feel all in one. Loyola is also obsessed with athletics so the basketball and especially lacrosse games are fun. I would choose it again 100% because I have grown so much while here - from leading retreats, leading our student body and leading myself through this path; there is always somewhere on this campus that every student fits."
College Freshman,5,I always feel safe on campus. Like every college loyola has the problem of students drinking but unlike many colleges Loyola deals with this problem in an incredible manner. There are endless amounts of activities other than drinking and partying and in the case of drinking the school has a great way of dealing with discipline and above all the health and wellness of the students
College Freshman,5,Loyola's dorms are some of the best I saw in my entire college search. I believe they are closer to hotel rooms than the conventional dorm. They are incredibly roomy and provide many perks. They are exceptional in every aspect.
College Freshman,5,Loyola is a home away from home for me. It has offered me so many opportunities to try new things and succeed like never before. I love it and am so glad I chose Loyola.
College Sophomore,5,"Housing is very good at Loyola. I stayed in Butler Hall which is an older building (my 50+ professor was the first class to have it) but it did the trick. I could control the A/C and heat which was not the case in the newer building, Flannery O'Conner. ""Flan"" was basically the quality of a hotel. It was very nice but as stated before you can't control the temperature so a fan was necessary."
College Junior,5,I love Loyola. They offer eveything I wanted in a school.
College Junior,5,After graduation I feel confident in obtaining a good job.
College Junior,5,"Dorms are appartment style, housing 2-8 people. Most rooms come with a kitchen and a living room fully furnished."
College Junior,5,"Loyola is the perfect size, not too big nor too smal. Everyone is friendly and approachable. Overall your college experience is what you make of it."
College Freshman,5,Housing is awesome. Communal bathrooms don't really exist at Loyola.
College Freshman,5,"I love Loyola. Its definitely underrated, but between our academics and athletics its on the rise and doing big things."
College Freshman,5,I love it here. Cant imagine myself anywhere else
College Freshman,5,Best in the country. We are lucky
College Freshman,5,Love all the friends and opportunities I have here
College Freshman,5,"I got an apartment my freshman year. Let's just say that housing is worth the money you pay, and it rocks."
College Freshman,5,We have great dorms! They are top rated and for good reason. They are spacious and dorm services have always been efficient in fixing problems.
College Freshman,5,"Loyola U of M is known for their lacrosse but the school has many other great sports that are supported. School spirit is very high despite not having a football team. Facilities are accessible, safe and widely used by students."
Senior,4,Loyola has a great community and professors. They can always do more for the Baltimore community. There are many opportunities for the students but there needs to be more attention to presenting them to the students when they need it.
Sophomore,4,"Most of the professors seem to really enjoy what they're doing and truly care about their students. They make sure you understand what you're doing and help you the best they can if you don't. There were some bias reports and issues in the beginning of the year, but other than that I had a great first year."
Junior,4,"This semester, due to COVID-19, we did do the second half of the semester completely online. Loyola mainly utilized zoom as the platform to connect with students. Overall the experience was difficult to adjust to but considering the circumstances I believe that Loyola handled it well."
Alum,4,My professors adapted incredibly and my grades did not suffer due to the transition. Each professor used a different approach to online learning and each one worked well for the subject being taught.
Sophomore,4,"Loyola Maryland is an excellent university with regards to the education. The professors are outstanding and always willing to help, and I have yet to meet anyone on the campus who is anything short of happy. From dining hall staff to maintenance employees in the residence halls, everyone at Loyola is friendly. The overall spirit at the school is amazingly positive, and everyone goes above and beyond to help you. However, the social life is not the easiest to transition into, which is why I am rating 4 stars instead of 5. There is not much happening on campus, and while off campus is where the primary social scene takes place, it would be nice to have a mix of both. Not having Greek life can also be a positive or a negative depending on how it is looked at, and a lack of major sports like football can create a different college experience than one that is anticipated. Overall, the school is beautiful and the education is amazing, but the social life is not the traditional experience."
Freshman,4,"I am lucky because I found an amazing group of friends and really found myself here at Loyola. But, a lot of students struggle here because there are limited activities and ways to be involved. The events that the school plans all feel like middle school events and the only fun is in downtown Baltimore at a limited amount of bars. I've had some amazing professors and some not so great ones, you just have to know who to take.  Messina for freshman is great and CCSJ does some amazing community service in Baltimore. The core curriculum is very strenuous and people considering this school should really look at the commitment of the core curriculum before committing because it really is a lot."
Freshman,4,"I am a Freshman here at Loyola University Maryland and I'd say it's pretty nice, aside from the hefty tuition. 

The campus is beautiful with a lot of greenery and the food is not that bad. 

The class sizes are quite small ranging from 15-25 and I am happy with that because you don't feel unseen and you can have your questioned answered immediately if you wanted to.

This year, the diversity has been at its highest.

The university is located within Baltimore, Maryland which is a hub for good eats within a short distance from the university.

I'd say you have everything you need to survive and to flourish here at Loyola University."
Senior,4,"I am finishing up my senior year at Loyola and have had an up and down experience. The school itself has so much to offer; great professors, facilities, dorms, and food. But the school lacks diversity, not just race and gender but people. There are clones of very basic private school kids and if you don't mesh with that it can be hard to fit in. That said, people are kind for the most part and involved on campus, you just may have a tough time fitting in if that isn't your crowed as in my case."
Junior,4,"I transferred to Loyola my junior year from a tiny women's college, so Loyola is perfect for me with about 6,000 students. If you're looking for a college experience on the smaller side, with professors who will know who you are, a manageable campus, and city conveniences (UberEats at three AM), Loyola is a good place. I'm happy I'm here."
Sophomore,4,The atmosphere of Loyola is something like no other college. It is a small campus but everyone is friendly and it’s as if you feel like you’re all a family. Everyone is helpful and it’s pretty easy to get around.
Senior,4,"Although Loyola's academics are absolutely top-notch, It's hard to stay on track academically when nothing you do helps socially, yes that includes clubs which are limited to a bland extension of high school. Some feel like extra courses. Loyola's reputation for being cliquey is no joke. Lots of mean-spirited people. Diversity is somewhat present but very separate overall. If you ENROLL here you will notice it and it is very hard to fit in. I was attracted to Loyola for the supposed solid values such as ""Strong Truths Well Lived"" and ""Serve in a diverse and changing world"". Unfortunately, after going through almost my whole college experience I can honestly say that this is not what the majority of Loyola students fully stand by. If you think independently, save yourself the time. Exclusivity is embedded in the culture here and unfortunately it is here to stay. Too many left out are faced with the choice of adapting or transferring."
Freshman,4,"Loyola offers exceptional academics on its beautiful Evergreen campus located in the heart of Baltimore, Maryland."
Alum,4,"When I visited Loyola Maryland University, the campus and the environment was beautiful. The faculty and the students openly welcomed me and gave me great resources on their different programs. I would highly recommend it to others to check out Loyola Maryland University."
Freshman,4,As a freshman in the Honors program access to professors and resources is amazing. At a larger school there may be more classes and a larger campus but the professors and the opportunities they give you are unparalleled.
Niche User,4,I loved the atmosphere and how they seem to set you up with college. Everyone there is so incredibly nice and welcoming!
Sophomore,4,"I had a great experience at Loyola. The people are great (surround yourself with people you want to be around!), the facilities are top notch, the food choices are good if you make an effort to look around and the atmosphere is always positive and conducive to learning. The academics at Loyola are rigorous and you must stay on top of your game to earn a competitive GPA. Loyola students work hard and play hard!
The only downside to Loyola is that the school is expensive and the majority of ""parties"" are off-campus bars/clubs which can also become an expense. 
Diversity at Loyola is solid...could be better but the dedicated and newly expanded multicultural center is a melting pot for people of all different minority races."
Alum,4,Loved my college experience overall. Going to athletic events was always fun and there was always events hosted by clubs and school organizations during the week and on weekends. There are multiple colleges in the area so there is always fun things to do off campus inculuding going to the Baltimore inner harbor. I made lifelong friends and had the best time of my life! All while getting a great education. One thing I would like to see an improvement in is the diversity of students on the campus.
Sophomore,4,I love the campus and the people that attend the school. One thing I would change is to improve dining and the food availability.
Sophomore,4,I would like to see changes to actual academics side and the requirements for classes and to graduate.
Sophomore,4,It’s a great time. Tons to do in Baltimore along with on campus. The professors are very caring and help you in whatever way possible in order for you to succeed.
Freshman,4,"I loved the jesuit tradition that is enforced at this school. By having a core curriculum, it helps students to become well rounded people. You do not just take classes that are for your major. You get to take classes that you probably would never take and likely, most people end up really enjoying those classes, and even majoring in that field (which is what happened to me). The small classroom allows you to form close relationships with your professor that sets you up to succeed even more!"
Sophomore,4,"Loyola is a small community and one thing I love about being at college is the amount of school spirit for athletics. However, Loyola lacks that exciting amount of school spirit. Not many students often attend sporting events and I would really like to see that change."
Freshman,4,This is my first year and I think that it is a very good school all around.  I am not from the East coast so it was a huge adjustment. The location is my only complaint.
Freshman,4,"The campus is very welcoming, and has a ""community-like"" atmosphere that I believe can only be found on a small campus, although I believe this environment finds its roots in our strong Jesuit tradition.  The campus has a lot of greenery, but is situated in Baltimore, so although it doesn't feel like you are in a large city, students have easy access to job opportunities in Baltimore and DC, and great night life.  Small class sizes allow you to get to know your professor whether you are seeking help with classes or looking to make connections with professionals in your field of study.  There are resources on campus to help you succeed as well, as you can take advantage of the writing center, the study, where you have easy access to tutors, the counseling center, and the career center, where you can receive help with resumes, job searching, and job interview preparation.    If I could change anything about the university, I think I'd like to see more diversity on campus."
Freshman,4,"I like the small feel of the school, but also the expanse of the city around it.  As a freshman, my transition from high school to college was great.  Loyola made is easy for me to get comfortable at a new place."
Freshman,4,"Loyola University Maryland is fantastic. There's always a lot to do, both on and off campus, and you are encouraged from day one to get very involved on campus in clubs and various leadership capacities."
Freshman,4,"It's only the third week of school and the workload is insane. There isn't a uniform here, but there is definitely an informal uniform and it's called VINEYARD VINES. Everybody wears it. For a school in Baltimore there are a shit ton of white people here. There are nice people but there are also some snobs, like anywhere you go. The professors are great, and the classes are okay. You can tell the professors are passionate about the subject even if it might be a bit boring. Housing is great, in my opinion. Food is good too but only because I only ever eat at Iggy's."
Sophomore,4,lets just say it's not the most diverse school. the classes are small and the professors actually care.
Graduate Student,4,Lovely sense of community and professors that are truly engaged in the subjects that they teach. A beautiful campus based on Jesuit values.
Sophomore,4,"While Loyola could be better in terms of diversity on campus, I have had nothing but wonderful experiences with the academics. My professors and advisors are incredibly intelligent and passionate about their fields, and the small classes are ideal for students who go to college in the pursuit of further knowledge."
Sophomore,4,"It's a great school it just can feel very small at times. Sometimes I feel like I run out of things to do here but overall it's been great so far, the classes and professors are great and it's campus is beautiful."
Senior,4,"Loyola is a great school for academic purposes. There are many extra-curricular activities to get involved with. As a Jesuit institution, Loyola places a lot of emphasis on community service. There are no fraternities or sororities, so on-campus nightlife is virtually non-existent."
Sophomore,4,"Loyola University Maryland is a great University providing students with the best possible education. Professors are extremely helpful and encouraging. Student life always has events and gathering that helps keeps the students engaged and happy. Although the campus is not huge, it is not small either. It's the perfect size and the perfect place to spend four years to continue furthering your education."
Freshman,4,"I loved the size and academic opportunities, as well as the extracurriculars. The size was perfect because it is nearly impossible to walk across campus without seeing someone you know and saying ""hi""; however, I meet new people all the time! Loyola has really strong academics, with professors who take the time to get to know each individual student and are constantly available for extra help. The school also hosts activity fairs each semester, and it's really easy and fun to get involved in whatever you want!"
Freshman,4,"Loyola University Maryland is a Catholic school located in Baltimore, Maryland.  The classes are hard, but the professors care about how their students are doing and are available to meet with students.  The campus is beautiful but the surrounding area is not the best.  Even the freshmen dorms are nice and spacious.  There are large apartments on campus for sophomores through seniors.  Loyola's gym, the Fitness and Aquatic Center ( the FAC) is an incredible gym.  It has a pool, rock wall, basket ball courts, and many instructor led classes like yoga or zumba.  Overall Loyola is a great school with many opportunities for students"
Senior,4,"While I have no doubt enjoyed my 4 years at Loyola University Maryland, it has been much different than I originally expected when I was a prospective student. The campus is gorgeous, the staff is spectacular, and a majority of the teachers are amazing, but the rigor of the academics is severely underestimated. The school accepts a large number of applicants every year for the incoming freshman class; however, it is obvious that most students do not understand how difficult the classes actually are here at Loyola, especially the science courses. 
Loyola's campus has barely any diversity; however, the school itself is surrounded by a lot of diversity. CCSJ (the Center for Community Service & Justice) links students with many different and amazing service opportunities. Loyola is predominantly a bar school, but you can find parties on campus. The only benefit of going to Boulder or Iggy's is to see the staff. The staff is amazing, but the food is terrible."
Freshman,4,Loyola University Maryland is an overall good university to attend for your undergraduate degree. The programs are strong and the professors are very helpful when it comes to ensuring their students adequately understand the material. Overall my experience was worth the cost of tuition and has provided me with the necessary tools to succeed after graduation.
Niche User,4,Loyola is a great university with a lot of opportunities for students. What I really like about loyola is that professors care for their students. Is a Jesuit university but they still accept and respect all king of religions. 
College Junior,4,"Concerning sexual assaults, I feel like Loyola should put in more resources for victims. It's important for victims to feel supported through their healing process."
Recent Alumnus,4,My schooling has been great... I am not looking for a college or to further my class experience.
College Senior,4,"The dorms have always been a good thing for me. Freshman year I was put into a forced quad meaning I shared one room with three roommates and thankfully they turned into 3 of my best friends. The university over-accepted that year and so students over-admitted therefore I understand why we were put in that situation. I have lived in an on campus apartment since then and I love having a kitchen and a bathroom for me and my other roommates. The best options for freshmen are the freshmen dorms (Flannery, Hammerman and Butler). Sophomores for sure should live in Newman or Campion (close in proximity and Newman has Iggy's). Juniors tend to enjoy Newman as well but the other living areas like Seton and Southwell are good for Juniors as well because they are somewhat separate. Senior housing will always be a good thing - I would never want to live off of campus while in college."
College Senior,4,"School spirit and the Dog Pound are huge parts of Loyola! The FAC (our main athletic facility for NARPs) is the absolute best. It's difficult at times to get to Ridley, where the lacrosse and soccer teams play, but definitely worth it. Lacrosse is definitely the biggest sport on our campus so you never want to miss a game. Students are always involved from the facilities staff, to taking photos on the field to the student-run cheering section. The sometimes free Chick-Fil-A is always an added plus."
College Freshman,4,"Varsity athletics are great. Loyola competes at the NCAA Division I level, so it is the best of collegiate athletics."
College Sophomore,4,"Other than three classes, I have really enjoyed my professors. They have been interesting and helpful. The classes are interesting and I definitely learn a lot. My favorite class was Microbes: the Good, the Bad, the Ugly. The professor was great and I fell in live with microbiology after that class."
College Sophomore,4,Loyola is my home. I have become involved in numerous activities and made friends doing that. My major department is excellent and very helpful. I love the campus and Baltimore where it resides. I would choose Loyola in a heart beat if I chose again.
College Sophomore,4,"Loved most of my professors, they are very supportive and they truly care. The class sizes are perfect and I would not change a thing about classes."
College Sophomore,4,"I think the value of a Loyola education is tremendous. It truly is about the education of the full self. As a business school there is no question you will find a job right after graduation. But, getting into medical school is another story. We will see."
College Sophomore,4,Coming to Baltimore worried me a bit but the small campus of Loyola is unbelievably safe. I've never felt afraid walking on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Loyola is know for their housing. It is better than I could have every imagined. As a freshman having a kitchen, dining room, living room, and bathroom was amazing. Live in Campion freshmen!!"
College Freshman,4,"It's there if you want it but it doesn't have to be. There are other options available on campus but a majority of students have fake IDs and go out on the weekends to various bars on York Road, Fed Hill, Fells Point and the inner harbor. Hardly any on campus parties but the ones in senior housing are fun."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy it but ubers and alcohol add up quickly so keep that in mind.
College Freshman,4,Definitely underestimated how much work I would need to do. Don't let the acceptance rate fool you! Classes are hard.
College Freshman,4,Night life is big here but people do other stuff too
College Freshman,4,FAC is amazing. Lax is the only sport popular here
College Freshman,4,The ploice and nice and will drive you places. They genuinely care and are not just trying to get you in trouble.
College Freshman,4,Professors don't treat you like you are just a number. They honestly care about you and will meet with you right away.
College Freshman,4,"Our school is on the smaller side, so not as many people go to the games as a larger state school, but we can't help that. We have one of the best lacrosse teams in the country, so those games are awesome. They always give free stuff away."
College Freshman,4,"I love the professors, they really know what they are talking about. Also, diversity and education of the whole person is a really big deal here, which really helps create a more genuinely caring and tolerant environment."
College Freshman,4,Baltimore's a pretty interesting place.
College Freshman,4,"Loyola does not have a football team, so if you are desperately looking for that this school is not for you. The most popular sport on campus is lacrosse. The team is pretty good and the games are fund to attend, especially when the hounds are playing either Hopkins or Towson. Basketball is pretty big, but the hype only lasts in the beginning of the season."
Freshman,2,As a freshman i can agree with other reviews that the people here are so cliquey. If you don’t meet your friends during summer o or within I kid you not the first weekend of school you will have a VERY hard time making friends. The classes are small which is very nice and academics are definitely challenging but it’s nice to actually have something to do because there’s no social life here. Very expensive too... it’s a bar school so not only are you paying for your drinks but also the Uber’s there. All the popular bars are like 20 mins away. Everyone goes out during the week but usually not on weekends. Fridays are DEAD. I’m considering transferring
Freshman,2,"If you're preppy, from New Jersey, and like to destroy your body with drugs and alcohol, this is the school for you! But sarcasm set aside, the academics are pretty good I guess."
College Freshman,2,"Athletics here completely revolve around the LAX team. This would be okay, however the LAX players are some of the most atrocious human beings you will ever meet in your life. All they do is hang around and make fun of people, sit in the dining hall and eat everything they can find, and then, on top of this, they don't do work, and probably cheat their way to staying on the LAX team. I believe that this school should abolish LAX because of the atrocities at hand, however it makes Loyola so much money, that they would refuse to do so. I hope one day, they'll consider getting rid of the team because they suck (even though they did make it into the final four this summer :( )."
College Sophomore,2,"The school spirit is far from what you would expect from a D1 school. There is one group that cars and thats the Super Fans. Other than that no one really care which is sad, especially when your school is in the NCAA Men's Lacrosse Top 4. The FAC is super nice though."
College Freshman,2,"I was an athlete here, but I did not like the experience with Loyola Athletics."
College Freshman,2,There aren't many parties ON CAMPUS. Off campus is where people go to party (bars and frats)
College Freshman,2,The campus is majority white. There are minorities and we seem to all know each other. I have never experience racism (I am African-american) BUT I know that it has happened. Majority of students are friendly and people are visibly socializing and talking to people of different ethnicity.
College Sophomore,2,Nothing good around that is affordable
College Sophomore,2,No room to do anything so everyone goes out to have fun
College Freshman,2,There are no parties on campus so many students go to bars or other colleges.
College Senior,2,"There isn't much to choose from. Mostly Chinese restaurants with rude delivery drivers, who hold food hostage unless they are tipped. other options include chain restaurants such as Popeyes and McDonalds. For anything from that Towson is the way to go, and no where delivers from Towson so you have to find your way there to pick up"
College Sophomore,2,"I know people at this school who do not work as hard as me, and have scholarships or financial aid. I have consistently maintained good grades, and deserve to not be paying full tuition. Before coming to Loyola I tried to get some sort of financial aid but they denied my requests."
Recent Alumnus,2,Do not listen to or care about student opinions.  All administration processes and decisions seem to take too long. I felt like there were many restrictions on what we could and could not do.  Also the attendance policies are very strict and it made me feel like I was in middle school still. I attended a leadership conference with a student organization and we needed a faculty member to basically chaperone us.
College Freshman,2,"I honestly can't stand Loyola with its strict policies, requirements, and CORE. You are forced to take classes that may not interest you. Overall, I do not like this school and do not advise coming here. I have applied to transfer and I can't wait to leave."
College Freshman,2,They live to get you in trouble. All they want is money. They will walk the halls and bust you for the tiniest things. If they hear even the slightest bit of noise they will enter your room and search. If they find anything you will be written up and accused of any and every possible thing. You then go to a hearing where you have to discuss and plead guilty to at least some of your offenses. That is all that administration does here. Other than that they are not very useful.
College Freshman,2,"There's not many things to do off campus, and even if there was Loyola is located in a fairly bad part of the city. Students who go off campus get robbed fairly frequently."
College Freshman,2,The campus is extremely strict about social and academic lives. It is very easy to be put on academic probation or get in trouble to drinking on campus. Campus police have also teamed up to help Baltimore police raid near by bars.
College Freshman,2,not in the best area. we always get reports of robberies and assaults on york road (right next to campus where all the bars are)
College Freshman,2,if your a bar person this is your school  there are other options if you are willing to drive a bit but have fun finding other people willing to go  with you.
College Freshman,2,i like having many things to choose from and i enjoy eating healthy. the only healthy thing here are salads and a smoothie place the food is basically the same every night except for the special which is a fancy dish made with not so fancy ingredients.
College Freshman,2,Only two bars which get raided at least once a month and are expensive. The bars are usually crowded beyond belief and can barely take a step without bumping into someone.
College Freshman,2,"The local area is dangerous, but inner harbor is nice."
College Sophomore,2,"There are many policies regarding students' academic and social lives. It is possible not to get caught with alcohol/drugs but if you are caught you will be punished. Surprisingly, they try not to label it as ""punishment"", but rather, ""documentation."""
College Junior,2,"Loyola is known for its top lacrosse team. Other than that, Loyola is relatively unknown. The biggest gripe I have is that there is not a varsity baseball team. Like, seriously?! If there was one, club baseball would not be as competitive, and easier to get on the team. Also, there is not a baseball field anywhere near campus. This was very disappointing."
College Junior,2,"Being in Baltimore does not mean in the city of Baltimore. It is pretty difficult to get into the city without having to spend a ton of money. Cabs are essentially the only method to getting anywhere, as the bus is completely unreliable. The Inner Harbor is great, but getting there is a pain. I am hoping that this will be a complaint of the past, as I will be able to explore more now that I am older, and almost 21."
College Junior,2,"Loyola, being a Jesuit institution, does not offer fraternities or sororities to students, thus resulting in minimal parties. The only option left to students is to go to bars. While this can be fun, it is mostly a fruitless endeavor because half the student body is underage. I believe it will improve, however, as soon as I turn 21."
College Freshman,2,its not really diverse at all.
College Junior,2,You pretty much have to know your major going into Loyola and if you want to change you have to do the research yourself or with the career center since the advisers only know their particular subject.
College Senior,2,basically you need a car or a friend with a car if you want to get around
College Freshman,2,A lot of people go out on the weekends. It's hard to make friends if you don't drink. A lot of fake ID's at this school.
College Freshman,2,Not very many healthy options to eat. There are not places to get food after 9pm. Very expensive meal plan. Not an allergy-free school.
College Senior,2,Loyola is in desperate need of a free parking lot on campus for students and visitors. It is very inaccessible in its current state to not live on campus and attend meetings/classes etc.
College Sophomore,2,"it is bad but also typical of college campuses. loyola does provide a lot of opportunities to do things other than drinking, yet people still go to the bars 4 days a week..."
College Sophomore,2,There are the same bars that everybody goes to no matter how bad they actually are. Everybody seems to be going to bars instead of doing other things.
College Sophomore,2,Loyola has had a predominantly white and catholic student population. Diversity is becoming more apparent on campus but there is still an obvious minority. Students however are mostly accepting of diversity. The Jesuit values of Loyola values diversity a lot.
College Freshman,2,"It is pretty much a dry campus, hard to get away with anything."
College Freshman,2,"Lots of spirit for basketball, everything else gets no fans. Poor teams as well, nothing to root for."
College Freshman,2,Drugs are common and easily acceptable.
College Freshman,2,"It's constant bar scene after bar scene, never a change in outings. gets old fast and not enjoyable, not to mention the worthless dent in your wallet."
College Senior,2,"Permits are sort of expensive, but you just have to suck it up because otherwise, street parking is like hide & seek & you never win orrr you find a spot & end up getting towed "
College Sophomore,2,The campus is not very diverse. There's are not a lot of diverse ethnicities. Most people are Catholic as well.
College Senior,2,"Not much diversity, but they are working on it"
College Junior,2,Unable to grade as not involved with that population and commuting for grad school. I assume policies are in place for residents.
College Junior,2,"Not eligible for financial aid due to graduate school. Not sure for undergrad,but I know Loyola is more expensive in general."
College Junior,2,The financial aid office is the best. They helped me every step of the way and seem to understand they are there for me. not to just accomplish a job.
College Junior,2,I have lived here my whole life so I love it. To many people it guess it can get boring but its home to me.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I think Loyola should de-emphasize athletics. They spend a lot of money on new facilities, and it shows. Yet it comes at the cost of stagnating wages for faculty, all while athletics coaches are some of the highest paid staff at Loyola."
College Freshman,2,There are more girls than guys here and most of the people here come from upper/middle class families. Not much diversity
College Freshman,2,"The quality of the food is adequate but damned overpriced. I'm an advocate of apartment living mainly because of the kitchen, it lets you switch things up every so often. The food got old really quick but next year we have a new company managing dining so everyone is very excited about that (any other meal info should be posted here: http://www.loyola.edu/department/fcs/mealplan.aspx)"
College Freshman,2,"A complete bar school, no frats and very few on campus parties. Only way to get invited to an on campus party is to know someone throwing it. The bars are pretty s****y, the only ones you can get into as a freshman are the ones on York (craigs/murphys) or Maxie's. If you go to Maxie's you have no idea what being social is and you should reconsider your life choices. You can go to John's Hopkins frats but those aren't very good and can be sketchy. All in all the party scene gets old fast and is incredibly expensive."
College Freshman,2,"There is on campus transportation from east to west side. However, the campus is not that large and I always feel lazy waiting for the shuttle when it is only a 20 minute walk. It is convenient when you are tired or carrying heavy things though. However, if you want to get anywhere off campus, you must take a taxi which can get very expensive and time consuming."
College Freshman,2,"People are here to do three things. Study, workout, and go to bars. Not much else happens. But the people are very dedicated to those three things, and go hard at all of them."
College Freshman,2,Freshman are not allowed to have cars on campus. I heard parking cost a lot of money per semester
College Freshman,2,"There is hardly any parking spots available in front of your building. If you need to park you usually have to park in the York Road parking lot, which is across campus and can sometimes take a long time to get to."
College Junior,2,There is barely any diversity on this campus. Most people are from middle to high class roman catholic backgrounds.
College Sophomore,2,Bar Scene – Only going to bars can get boring very quickly. There is nothing to do on campus and if you don't like to drink you cant have fun.
College Sophomore,2,"Not Very Diverse – There is a lot of diversity here at Loyola, don't get me wrong. But it comes in very small spurts. A majority of the campus is composed of white, catholic, and most likely straight students. However, I do think the school accepting and very open to the idea of diversity and welcoming different people."
College Junior,2,"More Booze Than Drugs – There is alcohol everywhere, but drugs are far less common.  You can get them if you want, but the campus is very strict about drugs."
College Freshman,2,"Other than the athletes, and employees that work on campus, there is pretty much no diversity at Loyola. It is made up of mostly white kids who come from wealthy families."
College Freshman,2,"Hit or Miss – Some people do well with merit-based scholarships, but I encountered very few people who had any sort of financial aid from Loyola. The tuition cost was often a large concern for many students."
Senior,1,the student life department at this school is HORRIBLE. this is by far the WORST PART ABOUT LOYOLA.  they are unhelpful and completely neglectful about student concerns. they ONLY care when liabilities are involved.  please stay away from Loyola for the sole reason of Student Life and its professional staff.
Freshman,1,"Loyola might be one of the worst colleges. Transferring only confirmed that  it is completely backwards and doesn’t offer a true college experience. The students and staff are both judgmental and unkind. Also, if you make the poor decision to attend I cannot stress enough not to join the honors college. It is poorly structured compared to other universities honors programs and run by a condescending and pompous professor. The students are simply not normal for lack of a better word. The classes are small but even at public universities you can receive very similar one on one time with your professor. The professors at public universities that I have interacted with have been much more willing to help, more understanding, and easier to contact. Loyola’s location is also terrible. There are very few places to go off campus. It might be pretty on the outside but on the inside it’s full of people who are rude and entitled."
Alum,1,"Transferring out of this school was the best decision of my entire life. I really despised most people here and felt consistently judged by the entire student body on a daily basis. First of all, do not come here. Second of all, if you ignore this, and then read this a year later and realize your mistake, just transfer out and you'll be happier than this school could ever make possible!!!!"
Freshman,1,"Flanney is the only nice dorm, everything else is crap. Loyola tours will only show you flan because they know this is true. Most kids are terrible people which is a shame because there are some nice kids here. Overall this school is not what it pretended to be when I visited and im seriously considering transferring out after this year is done. Kids are not nice at all, academics are just okay but not worth price. Overall, I'm really disappointed, i thought I would love it here. Also, to any prospective students, take these reviews seriously. I didn't last year and now I'm in same position : ("
College Freshman,1,"No fun unless you want to go to bars every night of the week. I suppose you could also go to Hopkins frat parties, but they suck and they roofie Loyola girls. Pick and choose my friends."
College Junior,1,Alcohol is a huge part of Loyola's campus. There are not many options for those who don't drink.
College Freshman,1,On Loyola campus there is no greek life but it is common to go to John Hopkins for the frat parties and occasionally Towson frats
College Senior,1,"There is no party scene, just bars. If you want to party usually you need to make friends with Towson students of Hopkins students or follow the party pages on Instagram. Once you are 21 plus you can start to venture out to downtown Baltimore."
College Freshman,1,"You can forget everything you know about college and parties here. If you party, you will be caught eventually. They do everything in their power to prevent you from partying. Bars are being shut down or at least becoming very strict. Dorm parties are extremely risky. Being as Loyola offers virtually nothing to do on the weekend, I assume they expect us to be in bed by 7pm or burying our heads in books."
College Sophomore,1,"They're awful. They once diagnosed my mono as the flu. They also told me my hand was completely fine even though I had torn ligaments. And to top it all off, they wouldn't believe me that I had strep (I finally got them to take the test.. and yes, I did have strep)."
College Freshman,1,R.A.'s go through every floor ever hour or so to see if there's any unwarranted behavior. Most are always looking to write you up and get you in trouble. R.A.'s also have random room searches every month or so where they come into your room and make sure you don't have anything that could get you in trouble. They are very strict with violations of the student code. One of my friends who possessed empty alcohol containers in his dorm now has to pay a hefty fine along with taking alcohol classes for the rest of the year.
College Freshman,1,"there is no greek life, really wish there was though"
College Senior,1,"if you are not a white, rich, catholic, republican, male, of the heterosexual orientation brace yourself"
College Senior,1,its 350 for a year parking pass. if you dont have the cash. you are screwed because parking is bad and they love to tow
College Freshman,1,we don't have greek life.
College Freshman,1,On campus night life is very loud and revolves only on drinking.
College Sophomore,1,Little Diversity. With many students using racial slurs on a regular basis
College Sophomore,1,"Unreliable and runs infrequently. On average, could wait anywhere from 5-35 minutes."
College Sophomore,1,Very strict in regards to alcohol and living policies. Loyola has worked with Baltimore PD to close down underage bars in the city
College Sophomore,1,Not too much drug activity occurs at this school. Other than alcohol
College Sophomore,1,"If you do not have a fake ID, there is no point in going out"
College Freshman,1,"I hate it. My roommates are the only people i like on campus, everyone else is stuck up with too much money. The sports suck, going to bars every night sucks, and i wake up everyday regretting my decision."
College Freshman,1,Same foods served day after day. quality is a disgrace and makes people sick often.
College Sophomore,1,"Terrible, Two bars to choose from, if you like that then go ahead"
College Junior,1,"We have a lot of commuter students that go to our school that park on the main road because there isn't enough parking for everyone.  Even if you buy a parking pass, you aren't guaranteed a spot on campus"
College Sophomore,1,"There's only the bar scene, which is extremely expensive.  And if you don't have a fake I.D., then you don't have a social life."
College Freshman,1,"There are several places that take the Loyola Dining card, but they are not very varied. They are hard (and expensive) to get to, and do not offer many options."
College Freshman,1,There is little to no diversity on campus. Everyone seems to be beautiful upper middle class.
College Junior,1,DON't GO – Not worth the money you can get just as good an education at a state school for a fraction of the price and actually have some fun while you are there
College Freshman,1,Baltimore is filled with awful drivers and parking on campus is tough because it is ranked by seniority and freshman can't have cars. It is normally tough to find a spot on campus even when you have already paid for parking because so many students bring their cars down. You may end up having to park at the FAC or Cathedral and that just downright is a hike.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking Is Terrible. Parking is so stupid at Loyola. It costs $350 to bring your car here for the year. That guarantees you a spot SOMEWHERE on campus... might not even be close to your dorm. And, when the parking lots are full you have to park in the metered spots and then either move your car at 8am or feed the meter."
College Freshman,1,"No diversity at all. Just a bunch of whit rich preppy people. Every girl looks and dresses exactly the same. And every guy is a ""lax bro"".  Be prepared to see a student parking lot filled with BMWs and Mercedes."
College Junior,1,"Too Many White Students. I am in a small graduate program at a satellite campus, so maybe the main school is different, but I think that Loyola University could improve the diversity of their programs significantly. I think they are seeking to do so, and so I have got the impression that there are scholarships available to people of diverse backgrounds. Right now, though, they seem to be lacking in racial and economic diversity, in particular."
College Junior,1,"A School of New Jersey Kids – Loyola Maryland features an overwhelming number of white students. It isn't uncommon to see other races, however, those races usually only consist of either Asian or African American.  There are very few students from other countries. It is even rare to see students who come from any state south of Virginia or west of Ohio.  An overwhelming majority of students come from New Jersey or Long Island and this gives the entire school a feeling of being inhabited by rich, privileged, white men and women.  Anyone who does not relate to that demographic would find it very difficult to fit in at Loyola"
College Junior,1,"The Frustration in Printing – For the most part, everyone has their own laptop. What people don't usually have is printers and that is where computer labs become a necessity.  Unfortunately, for some reason these labs are constantly proving themselves less and less reliable (especially during finals weeks).  Sometimes computers are so slow that you never get past the login page, other times the printer is down or hasn't been set up.  It is one of those malfunctions that is a real slap in the students' face because for all the money we spend every year on college, we can't even expect efficient printing.  This is 2012. Printing off of personal computers should not be considered complicated technology."
College Freshman,1,"Very Strict – The campus police and RAs are incredibly strict. For this reason there are basically no on-campus parties and if there are they are usually busted. However, students are written up frequently here for noise or drinking so it is not a huge deal if you get written up. Obviously it is bad, but they are so strict and write people up so frequently, the punishments are actually usually not all that bad. However, the school policy with drugs is incredibly strict and punishment for drug possession is severe."
College Freshman,1,"Very Strict – Despite for how many Loyola students drink, it is very strict.  As a result,  students only quitely pre-game in their dorms before going out to the bars.  Weed and other drugs are strictly not allowed.  You could be kicked out if caught with them."
College Sophomore,1,"So expensive to do anything. It's like you're buying a social life. First there's no on campus parties. Second you have to dress up, get ready, pregame, etc. Third pay for a cab. Fourth pay for drinks. Fifth pay for a cab to get back. Sixth you need a fake id to do anything...Don't go here if you are looking for tailgating and parties."
College Sophomore,1,"There's next to no parking available. The main parking lot is reserved for visitors etc. Other lots are for professors and guests, but guests are only allowed to park there on weekends. THEY WILL TOW YOUR CAR AWAY IF IT'S THERE WHEN IT ISN'T SUPPOSED TO BE. And right away, trust me. It sucks. You can get a parking permit, it's just a bother to get because the ladies that give them out are crabby. If you get a ticket though and act innocent they'll most likely just ignore if it's the first time. Don't really need a car though. Collegetown Shuttle is the way to go! It takes you and up to two guests almost anywhere for free!"
College Freshman,1,"They're Trying but . . . Loyola is make an effort to increase diversity, but at the moment it's rich or well off white kids from Long Island and Jersey mostly."

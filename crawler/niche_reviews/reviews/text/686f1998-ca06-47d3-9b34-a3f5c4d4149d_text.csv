Alum,5,"A joyous & stimulating path to becoming a doctor! UNE has amazing faculty at both the undergraduate & professional level. UNE offers strong academics, research & volunteer opportunities while providing personalized support. We are now a 2nd-generation UNE family!"
Alum,5,"My daughter is a freshman in the 2020-2021 academic year. She has a mix of in-person & remote classes. Even during the pandemic, UNE prioritizes hands-on learning for health professions (with thoughtful precautions). We appreciate this!"
Freshman,5,"The University of New England has a very pretty campus with a water front view. There is also a low student to teacher ratio, so when ever you have questions you will here back quickly. It is a small campus and very easy to navigate. The professors are very nice and helpful, along with advisors and counselors. All of them will take the time to talk with you to make sure you are successful in what you want to do."
Junior,5,My favorite part of UNE is the amazing faculty. We have great professors who are accommodating and flexible to all patterns of learning. There also plenty of ways to get involved and do research.
Junior,5,The professors made the most of the COVID-19 situation and helped us students with transitioning to online learning.
Alum,5,"I did not take any full courses online, but there were online assignments for most classes. There were no issues; they were a welcome addition to the course."
Alum,5,"If you are looking to enter a health profession or any life science field, this is the university for you to attend bar none."
Freshman,5,I took all of my classes online and all of my professors were very understanding with due dates and workload. They were also very good with responding to my needs and any questions that I had throughout the rest of the semester.
Senior,5,Amazing professors that truly care about each individual student. Majors are tight and curriculum is challenging but fair.
Niche User,5,I am currently a undergrad and going to be committing here soon! This college is amazing from what I have seen!
Freshman,5,Awesome school but expensive. Professors provide active learning experience that promotes excellence. Student support center offers tutorial and study sessions for all courses taught.
Freshman,5,"Toured it back in April 2019, everyone was so comforting and nice. The overall energy in this University is great and should be recognized about it."
Sophomore,5,"I would change the food at the campus. Also, to have more events for the students. The professor at UNE are very helpfully when it comes to helping a student with their acedemics."
Niche User,5,This is an awesome school. My dad received his degree here and he always brings me up to visit the college. The food is fantastic and the faculty is really nice
Graduate Student,5,I loved the program of the online Masters of Social Work program. It was very informative and the courses were awesome with great instructors.
Freshman,5,"I am a first year student at the University of New England studying Medical Biology. I run cross country for the university which has been one of the best experiences as it has allowed me to meet so many interesting people. The campus is very small and cozy, so I pretty much always see the same people around. The one issue I have with it is the food. There are not many options to choose from and I find that they often make very complex meal options when keeping it simple is the best bet when serving so many people. The university accepted too many people so most freshman were forced to live with two other freshmen in a room meant for two people. Other than that, my experience here has been exceptional and it's safe to say I love UNE."
Niche User,5,I had a wonderful time at the UNE open house over the weekend. The campus is gorgeous and everyone there is extremely friendly and welcoming!!
Sophomore,5,"Love the school in its entirety.  The atmosphere, location, academics, and athletics are all exceptional.  The school spirit is like nothing I have ever seen/experienced before.  I look forward to my next 3 Years at the University of New England."
Sophomore,5,UNE is one of the best places that i can recommend for any person. just know there is more to college then the fun and this university will make work for your future
Freshman,5,"University of New England is a good place to not only learn but to gain experiences whether it’s meeting new people, trying a new club, or just simply learning how to do your laundry and living independently. They help make the transition into adult hood easier while also giving you a future."
Sophomore,5,"UNE has a great environment. The people and teachers that you are surrounded by make your overall experience positive. There are plenty of opportunities to meet people and enjoy your time whether it be clubs, sports, or never just in your dorm."
Freshman,5,"Just finished my Freshman year and loved it. The campus is beautiful and everything is really tailored to the students. VERY inclusive, and very helpful staff/social workers. Going abroad to MOROCCO next semester!!"
Graduate Student,5,UNE's Portland Campus is great. Faculty care  about student success. Multiple resources available to guide students and promote new learning opportunities.
Junior,5,"The academics and people are great here! If you are an in-coming student, you will have no problem making new friends and getting to know lifelong friends. The atmosphere here at UNE is always great. I never feel like I was treated poorly by anyone. UNE is a great place to express yourself and express your ideas. The athletics here are great too. If you can play I would definitely encourage people to try out and get involved."
Sophomore,5,UNE has something for everyone! It is the perfect balance of athletics and extracurricular activities. I fell in love with this small school because it felt like home yet there is always something to do. The small class size allows for a more 1 on 1 experience and everyone is focussed on helping you succeed.
Graduate Student,5,I currently am attending UNE Online and I absolutely love it. I have been out of school for almost 10 years and they have made everything so easy getting back in the swing of things.
Freshman,5,I like how much is offered and how many opportunities there are at the University of New England. I have already done and experienced so much in my marine biology major as a freshmen.
Freshman,5,"As a freshman on campus this school has made my transition to college extremely smooth. The professors are amazing and genuinely care about your success. They take the time to get to know you personally and will always be available to help you if you ask. The food on campus is delicious and I have never had any instances of not wanting to eat anything from the dining hall. The school is beautiful and the people are extremely supportive of one another. Wherever you go you always see a smiling face, even when it's pouring rain."
Graduate Student,5,"The universities online MSW program is elaborate and well rounded. Instructors are engaged and excited about classes facilitating a wonderful learning environment. The program is not only affordable (around a third less than comparable programs), but also rich in learning. Fully accredited and listed on the CSWE website UNE is a great choice for MSW students both on and off campus."
Freshman,5,"I am a current freshman at UNE, and I love it here! The classes are not only challenging (in a positive way), the class sizes are small, allowing each student to get one on one time with the professor. The largest lecture hall hold 75 students! 
The school recently added to its sports team with football and women's rugby, bringing in more students. Hockey will always be the most popular sport for Nor'easters though! 
While the dorms are small, they are well kept and you can make it your own space, your dorm truly becomes your home here. Along with that, campus life is great! There are fire pits in the quad that students can use to roast smores or just have a nice fire to sit by, you can kayak and paddle board for free, go to the schools own personal beach, or join one of the amazing clubs here! 
The new dining hall has amazing food!
As a small woman, I feel incredibly safe on campus"
Niche User,5,"From touring and visiting the campus, I have fallen in love with the University of New England. It is the perfect size and in the perfect location. The campus is beautiful, with a few newly built buildings. The walkways have emergency buttons, lights, and phones for extra security walking to classes."
Freshman,5,"UNE is located in a beautiful area, with it having it own's little private beach. The campus feels very homey, new, thriving, and exciting. They are working on expanding and building new buildings in order to create a bigger campus but still keeping it quaint."
Niche User,5,"University of New England is a beautiful campus, and it's focused on the well-being and higher education of it's students!"
Niche User,5,"This campus feels like a community. Everyone gets together for sporting events and always supporting the UNE colors of blue and white. Also, the dorms are super friendly. Basically everyone on the floor gets along, thanks to the RA's who hold meetings and do ice breakers. Building relationships happens with in the first day."
Junior,5,"The dedication of the nursing faculty to the student is apparent from day one. Not only is community involvement through interdisciplinary coordination fostered, it thrives in the small community setting, allowing all disciplines of medicine to collaborate for a future of patient-oriented healthcare."
Freshman,5,"I love this school! One of the greatest things about it is it's location, located literally right on the ocean (we even have our own private beach). It is also a short drive to downtown Saco, Biddeford and roughly a half hour drive to Portland. The school is good with keeping students busy (especially on weekends) and the new cafeteria is to die for!"
Junior,5,"At UNE, evenyone is invested in your future.  Your professors, the administration, the staff, the students... everyone is rooting for you, and is willing to do anything and everything to ensure your success, both in school and in your future career. Everyone at this University is kind and caring, and greets your with a warm smile.  This place makes you feel welcome, cared for, and unique."
Freshman,5,"At the University of New England we are a fairly small school, which gives the students the opportunity to connect with teachers on a more personal level. Extra help is always available when needed. There are also many fun things to do on campus in down time such as kayaking and going to the beach!"
Graduate Student,5,I like that fact the the schoolis so affordable for the degree I am currently presueing. It also allows me to take courses on line here in Utah while attending the school clear in Maine.
Freshman,5,"The University of New England has an incredible amount of undergraduate research opportunities. The professors that work with undergraduates are all entirely supportive and good at what they do. Class sizes are small and most professors know me by name. I also love the location and campus.
Be warned: freshman housing is less than satisfactory, but livable, and the only parties you will find are off campus."
Alum,5,Great small school.  Easy to navigate.  Professors were great.  Scenic area all around.  Beautiful Campus.
Freshman,5,I've been over at UNE over the summer of dental camp and I really feel in love with the campus setting of the school more importantly I love the school structure. They also have my major which is pharmacy.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love this school. I definitely made the right decision when applying here. One major problem, however, is the housing situation. Students are required to live on campus for 3 years, but the campus, and the student body, is exponentially expanding and there is not enough places for everyone needed to be on campus. This creates a MESS with housing"
Freshman,5,"I love it at the University of New England. I have found myself a group of friends that have similar ideals that I have. I found a work study job on Campus within my first month at school. I have joined clubs, and really stepped out of my comfort zone to become who I am now. I love how personable my professors are. 
The party scene at UNE is kind of underground which is nice because it isn't a huge party school like say UNH or URI. It is in a beautiful area!
I would like to see the campus grow in some ways to accomidate more living opportunities."
College Freshman,5,From what I have seen sports are taken very seriously here at UNE. I guess with all the down time what else are you going to do.
College Junior,5,"I love where I go to school, I couldn't imagine myself at any other school."
College Junior,5,"UNE has such great sports facilities, they're some of the best I've ever seen!"
College Sophomore,5,I often walk alone on campus at any given hour of the night and have never once felt unsafe or threatened
College Student,5,"I feel extremely safe when I'm on campus. I never feel like I have to worry about my safety when I'm there, although I should always be cautious wherever I go but I don't feel unsafe on campus at all. The campus has the blue lights which I'd be able to push on if I was ever in trouble. Everyone's friendly on campus."
College Freshman,5,"My overall college experience is great so far. Everyone on campus are so helpful and there are so many resources that can help you with whatever you need. UNE is small, so its easy to connect to people and professors one on one. I would choose this school again in a heartbeat."
College Freshman,5,"I have never felt unsafe on campus, the campus security is always driving around and the RA's always call if there is an emergency. The local police and fire department are quick to respond if there are any emergencies, but for the most part security makes the campus feel safe and secure."
College Student,5,"I feel very safe on campus. There are buttons on all of the streetlights to push in case you need somebody. There is also safe ride, which is a system in which a van drives around looking for kids to pick up and drive them to where they need to go."
College Student,5,"I feel as though UNE has some of the best professors which enables the students to get a great education. They are very friendly and helpful. Furthermore, the classes are very diverse and small which I like."
College Freshman,5,"We have a lot of safety features set up. One being the safe ride, which i have only taken once and it was because it was raining hard, not even because i felt unsafe. The last time a blue safety light button was pushed was years ago because of a skunk."
College Freshman,5,I love the athletic training program. I get to start doing clinical hours as a sophomore and i cant wait to start!
College Freshman,5,I really enjoy my classes. I feel like the professors really care about my grades and understanding of material. They make it really easy to learn. Even in the lectures i feel like im being spoken to one on one.
College Freshman,5,I play womens rugby and we are only club at the moment but we even get to train with and like the varsity sports.
College Freshman,5,I have loved every second of school so far. Even the classes i thougt i would hate i ended up loving
College Sophomore,5,UNE is not a party school. There isn't a drug scene and alcohol can easily be avoided. There is not much usage and policies are strictly enforced.
College Sophomore,5,"The courses are challenging but manageable. The professors are extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the subjects they teach. Class styles are very effective, especially the lab/lecture style of the science courses. Class sizes are relatively small."
Freshman,4,"I am going to be an incoming freshman so I haven’t  taken any real classes online. I have done a short 3 week math coarse that was all at your own pace, and that was very easy to navigate."
Junior,4,"For me, the University of New England has prided themselves with amazing classes and professors to teach them. I love the classes I have taken and have very easily found a place for myself in my department, developing personal relationships with my professors. For the college of Marine sciences, there are many great research opportunities that have helped me find my passion for future careers. However, the University has been slow in finding new professors when one leaves, leaving holes in the classes which other courses may not be able to fill."
Junior,4,I took online classes this past semester as classes were moved online due to the pandemic. My professors continued to try to make classes interactive and continued to teach clearly taking their time to explain when extra help was needed. Testing was similar to what it was in person with adjustments to time to make up for not being in person and able to ask questions
Freshman,4,I had a really good experience overall in my first year of college. My professors and staff were really nice and understanding of my needs and exploring campus and local areas outside of campus was a lot of fun as well.
Freshman,4,"In general, the staff is good and understanding. Quite a bit of activities to do on campus if you look at the emails they send you called the UNE Breeze. No parties anywhere though. The campus police is very strict with alcohol. Parking is also a problem as it’s always a nightmare trying to find a spot you can fit into."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, UNE is a great place to be if you are focused on academics-you learn a lot from your classes. The environment is very positive and accepting. Even though there is not a prominent party scene on campus, there are a lot of fun activities and clubs to be involved in as well."
Sophomore,4,University of New England is a fantastic school! All of the teachers really try to help you and it's not too large of a school so they actually try to get to know you as well. The only thing is that they are super expensive to attend.
Graduate Student,4,"Love the small, close knit community! You are not a number at this school, and with smaller class sizes, classroom help is available."
Senior,4,Small class sizes allow you to form amazing relationships with professors who all have your best interest at heart. This school has provided me with so many amazing opportunities outside of my classes.
Sophomore,4,"Very good school for a focused education in the natural sciences. If the desired education is more of a liberal or mathematical nature, there are considerably better options. However, the school does a fantastic job preparing those for a future in science, and provides opportunities unlike any other college."
Freshman,4,"The University is great; it does cost a lot to go here though, so if someone chooses to attend the school then they should plan to do something like Biology or Chemistry because of they payout. If you're looking to get a degree in education, UNE may not be the place to go unless you are offered a lot in scholarships. The teachers are invested and passionate about what they do and the campus is beautiful (especially in the fall). Overall, it's a great University, you just need to be invested if you choose this school."
Junior,4,"So far, this college is great. The campus is beautiful and I love how small the school is. I was able to go abroad to Morocco which was the best semester so far in college. We also offer a lot of research opportunities to undergraduate students."
Sophomore,4,The University of New England offers students a chance to experience different aspects of life in a safe and enjoyable way.
Junior,4,"I love the campus, it's right on the ocean! The professors have been amazing and appear to know what they're teaching us. However, they charge so much for in-state tuition. Further, they are so strict with parking. If you park in the wrong spot you'll get a minimum of a $20 ticket, even if you have a parking pass."
Graduate Student,4,"The University of New England’s online graduate program has been challenging and rewarding. The Professors have been excellent.
I initially obtained a graduate certificate in public health and am now returning to earn a masters in public health. The enrollment process is straight forward and my enrollment counselor was wonderful to work with. Of course, the cost is high but I believe I will receive a solid return on my investment. The University uses blackboard as its learning platform for online students. I have found it to be very user friendly. Overall, my experience at University of New England has been very positive and I look forward to continuing my studies there."
Sophomore,4,"A small campus allows for classrooms to consist of smaller amounts of students which allows for closer relationship with professor and easier learning ability of each student. wide range of diversity in academics and sports teams allows for everyone to be apart of the school community. The food really needs an upgrade though, beware the commons."
Sophomore,4,"I am going into my sophomore year here at the University of New England. Some of the things I like about this university are the size, the community, and the teachers. UNE is the right size so that you won't feel lonely, but you also won't get distracted too much when you'r doing your homework. Also the smaller size gives UNE a unique community vibe, walking from class to class you are most likely going to see some of your friends. In my first year the teachers I had were really supportive of me. The Teachers were also very helpful outside of class, and were willing to work with you on an assignment. Some complains about UNE are the food, lack of things to do, and dorm size. Advice I would give to a incoming student is get involved, don't get behind on your homework, and interact with your teachers."
Senior,4,"I studied Applied Exercise Science at the University of New England. This program was recently accredited, which is very impressive. The staff is extremely helpful and cares deeply for their students. The professors will know you by name and will provide help and guidance any time you need it. The university itself is very modern and welcoming. Sports are very popular and allow for a great community of students. This school is a great choice for anyone looking for a small school and an amazing education in a science field."
Sophomore,4,"Overall great school for anyone looking to enter a science or healthcare related field. Courses are often harder here than other campuses which is strange, but they offer a wide variety of science courses to fit any interests. The school is definitely a bit expensive topping $50,000 a year. The sodexo food in the dining hall is also not the best, but the dining venues are nice."
Freshman,4,They really challenge you to be the best student inside the classroom and outside of the classroom to get the best out of you. Being at this school has made me open my eyes us to more opportunities in the real world and has made me realize who I really am.
Alum,4,"Fantastic school, fantastic location. Little nit picky things are why it doesnt get 5 Stars, such as cost for room and board and how you cant opt out of the food plans if you dont use it. That's where some of my money was wasted."
Niche User,4,"Campus is very beautiful, and right on the water. Many new buildings around campus, and constantly getting updated. New sports building and facilities are very nice and are conveniently separated from the rest of the campus. UNE also owns lots of beachfront property, which is very nice when returning in the summer and fall. Multiple small restaurants and eateries around campus that all offer a variety of foods. Large hockey rink makes for fun hockey nights where many students can meet and have a good time. UNE also offers lots of parking, and enables students to bring their cars to school freshman year which is also very nice."
Freshman,4,"University of New England is in an area that is convenient to travel to many beautiful beaches, and you are very close to Portland & Boston if you enjoy
the culture and food of larger cities. Enjoy the school and students very much
and learning atmosphere. Cafeteria food could be better, but cafe has great food."
Niche User,4,My girlfriend goes to UNE and is overall very satisfied with the campus. I am going to tour there very soon and it looks like a school I'm definitely going to try to be accepted into.
Sophomore,4,"UNE is a great school to attend if you are looking to pursue a career in the medical field. The school is rather expensive, and the freshman dorms are very poor unless you get to live in Featherman. The classes are rather small, which allows you to build close relationships with the professors easier. The courses can be challenging if you choose to put little effort into them; however, most of the professors are there to help students pass because they do not purposefully want students to fail. Advisors are very helpful, and they are there for the best interests of the students. The new dining hall looks very nice, but the food is not always amazing. The school is very beautiful and sits near a beach. There school is not known to be a party school, but there is always something to do on campus (non-party wise because it is run by school involvement groups)."
Sophomore,4,I loved the campus itself and the location. I just wish that the board would come have one or two nights a year where they would just listen to students and their opinions on the school.
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience at UNE has been decent. I am a transfer student and the transfer was VERY stressful. I was always being directed to someone else there wasn't one person who could just help me with the overall transfer. I had to sign up for classes on my own which was very difficult being new to the college and their software system I had no idea which classes to sign up for that applied to my particular degree. Besides the transfer my experience at UNE has been wonderful the Professors are all very friendly and helpful, the school is clean, library hours are great!"
Junior,4,"I love the location, the student-professor ratio, and the opportunity to study abroad both for a semester or for a travel course.  The school's diversity is currently on the rise."
Junior,4,"I love UNE, I will be graduating next spring 2019. I wish there was more to do overall, but the campus has been growing. The surroundings and ocean is wonderful from studies as well as normal enjoyment. There are new buildings and sports teams. The community is very kind-hearted and welcoming. It feels like home."
Sophomore,4,"The University of New England is my college dream. I had no intentions of attending this university, but here I am, finishing my sophomore year, and couldn't imagine my life anywhere else. The environment is friendly and open, with light conversation around every corner. The professors are great and the class sizes are small, allowing a more personalized experience. With plenty of athletic and charity events to balance the academics, The University of New England is a great place to call home."
Sophomore,4,"This school offers excellent academic programs, with teachers who are enthusiastic to help you learn. Drawbacks include difficult and\or uninterested financial aid staff, who are certainly unhelpful and often rude to students. The school also does not provide excellent food service, and despite being on the expensive end for schools opts for a 3rd tier meal plan from Sodexo out of 10 tiers.

Despite some complaints about the school's administration, this school is very much worthwhile to attend. Nowhere else will you find professors and academic staff so very eager to help the students learn, nor will you find such a good community of students and teachers that will allow you to grow as a person and realize your full potential."
Sophomore,4,Small campus size with a endless amount of connections to be made. Professors are great and knowledgeable in their field of study. Highly recommend this college for students looking to go into the medical field.
Freshman,4,"I love that at UNE, you have so many options in the medical field to choose from and others as well for those interested in other fields. All of the professors love what they are doing when it comes to health profession classes because they were in that field before or during the class they are teaching. You are open to so many opportunities when it comes to getting hands on experience, and they really encourage you to study abroad to other places as well."
Alum,4,"This school's defining factor is it's staff.  The majority of the classes are small so professors can learn your name and learning style.  They make an effort to help when you are struggling with content (and will let you know when you are).  Most are very understanding of life outside the classroom and are willing to offer generous extensions on papers, exams, and projects."
Junior,4,"There is plenty of stuff to do around campus, not just including parties. Most professors go above and beyond for their students while there are also some that are subpar. That being said the academics are challenging yet obtainable and overall the University is 9/10."
Sophomore,4,"I just completed my first year and I am so happy I decided to go to UNE. The school is great, the people are amazing, and even though it has over 10,000 students, it doesn't feel that way because classes are small and you have a connection with the people you meet."
Freshman,4,"I love how nice everyone is around here. The scenery since it is on the ocean makes it that much better. The teachers do help you if you seek help. There are events planned on campus, while they are not as frequent as some students would hope; when they do happen they are rather great."
Freshman,4,"The location of the University of New England is situated right where the Saco River and the Atlantic Ocean meet.  There are not many activities to do on campus during the week or on weekends.  But, you do not have to travel far to the nearest shopping district or Portland, ME.  I would love to see a convenient store on campus because the nearest store is 10-15 minutes away.  Which means you would need to have a car on campus.  This is okay if you have a car because Freshman are allowed to have cars on campus.  Even if you don't have a car there is a shuttle to the shopping area of Biddeford."
Sophomore,4,"The University itself is fantastic, and as a Neuroscience major the academic rigor is what you would expect it to be. UNE is a pre-med and science oriented campus, so I there are some graduate students that you'll see on campus as well. There is a lot to do, but you have to find what you like. Some of the professors are hard to deal with, but the classes and curriculum are great. There is a variety of food on campus with 4 dining halls on campus, but the quality is around 6/10. The dorms are pretty basic until Junior year, but starting as a Sophomore you get a suite on campus. The local area is pretty, but it's strongly recommended to stay out of the downtown area, especially at night. A majority of the parties are hosted by Seniors and Juniors, and mostly on the weekends. Overall, the campus is good and the area is very nice, I recommend coming here if you want to focus on studying during the week and have fun on the weekends."
College Freshman,4,"So far it has gone wonderfully, the classes are what I expected, but Blackboard(the online system we use for homework and classwork) in rather difficult to navigate and to keep track of assignments, which in turn can be very frustrating. The professors are some of the best in their field and you can tell by the experience that they express to you."
College Freshman,4,"I have never once felt unsafe on campus, Maybe considering that we are essentially in our little buddle of a school, with strict as police in the surrounding town, even though it looks pretty trashy. Campus security seems like a joke though so I'm not sure how reliable they are past a room lockout and driving around on the back roads sometimes."
College Freshman,4,"I was lucky enough to be put into featherman hall, which is the nicest out of the freshman dorms. There is central air and individual shower, which are lovely and cleaned I believe every other day along with the rest of the hall."
College Junior,4,UNE has such a high job placement after graduation. I have faith that I can talk with career supervisors at UNE and find a job in my field within 6 months to a year.
College Junior,4,"You can go anywhere on campus and see security, it makes me feel safe and glad to be at such an amazing school."
College Junior,4,"I love my school, the professors challenge you, but also want you to learn so its challenging in a good way!"
College Sophomore,4,My school is unique and offers a lot of opportunities for academic success as well as personal success.
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are small and all of the teachers so far have been incredibly passionate. My major is very hands on and we are constantly in the field learning
College Sophomore,4,"The housing lottery is so stressful! You are assigned a number and physically have to go to the gym at a specific time and have to know exactly where you want to live and with who. The dorms are great, no complaints there"
College Sophomore,4,"This school is the average high school. I had a decent time there, and if I had to do it all over again,I would definitely still come here"
College Sophomore,4,"Very safe, but I prefer to walk alone only during the day"
College Junior,4,UNE has a lot of great opportunities to begin and enhance your career paths. Internship boards are posted and career services is very helpful in helping you improve.
College Junior,4,"I've loved my courses and my professors. There are so many different classes to take, and I've had great experiences with professors in those classes. They are all very involved and care about their students."
College Junior,4,"I've never once felt unsafe on campus, and the people who have had any bad experiences have been supported and helped from other students and faculty."
College Junior,4,"Freshman year is a struggle in terms of housing, but as you progress the dorms get better and better."
College Junior,4,"Personally, I love UNE. It's not the biggest party school, so if that's what you're into it isn't necessarily the school for you, but it's definitely a fun campus to be on with a lot of opportunities for involvement. I've felt at home on this campus ever since I first toured it!"
College Sophomore,4,Dont participate so not really sure
College Sophomore,4,could use a little improvement
College Sophomore,4,"Security is very fast to be there when something goes wrong, but that doesn't happen very foten"
College Sophomore,4,Class sizes are small which I love so my professor can get to know me
College Sophomore,4,I haven't gotten an internship yet but my advisor seems to be excited about the topic
Junior,2,"The only class I took was online.  See my previous entry (below):
I only took one class but it was unnecessarily difficult, a fact compounded by the odd requirements of the institution.  We were not allowed to go over tests, or even view them.  We were not allowed to use scratch paper during the test.  We were required to purchase an approved webcam FROM UNE, which was faulty and used when it arrived.  The instructors blame the institution and the institution avoids the questions.  The class itself, I believe to compensate for the online nature of the course, assigned a plethora of unnecessary and often unrelated tasks, such as discussions, multiple hands-on labs that were unrelated to the material, journal entries, online labs and multiple projects that were time-consuming and pointless.  All this was in addition to the textbook readings and the recorded lectures.  Overall, it was a poor experience for me."

All this was in addition to the textbook readings and the recorded lectures.  Overall, it was a poor experience for me."
Junior,2,All my classes moved online for the spring semester with COVID-19. too many of my classes rely on the in-person lab to build clinical experience and is impossible to replicate online
Freshman,2,"No party scene what so ever, very boring campus life, poor food. If you are not an athlete there is almost nothing to do. Most people leave or go to other schools on the weekend. Academics are pretty good however which is the primary reason for being at college. That being said you could get the same thing at other schools with a better social scene."
Freshman,2,"I am a freshman here and honestly not a huge fan of this school. It’s seriously a school only if you’re going for hardcore academics. The campus is completely dead by 8pm, and the dorms (all but one freshman dorms are built in 1964 or earlier) are not good. My floor has one shower and we can’t even get a shower head that doesn’t fall off every time (my RA has put in multiple work orders.) also muddy water leaks through the floor and the vents are sometimes moldy :). Oh and don’t even get me started on the food. Poor options and poor quality food."
Sophomore,2,UNE is a nice small school on a very pretty campus. Most classes are small and have good professors. The school needs to work on its diversity in all areas.
Niche User,2,"Went to UNE for a year and still regret going to this day. What they don't tell you at orientation is only about half of their students return after one year because the experience is below expectations. The food is AWFUL, the programming is miserable, and it's hard to get anywhere if you don't have a car because the location sucks. There's also a ratio of 4 girls to 1 boy on campus, meaning girls can get very mean and caddy over boys. For a school that makes a ton of money a year, they seem to make a lot of cuts, like for example, they told incoming marine bio students that they'd have a program with seals on campus, and cut it less than a month before school started. When I lived in the dorms, maintenance sucked. We had a broken shower that they kept claiming to ""fix"" but never did, leaving us with two showers all year for over 25 girls. If I hadn't made such good friends, I'd give it one star."
College Sophomore,2,"My dorm building was pretty run down, we had many ant infestations but learned to live among them. The building was also the farthest freshman building to where classrooms were, and some students didn't even know where it was."
College Freshman,2,"Sodexo provides all food options on campus. Plates and utensils in Decary are often visibly dirty when they are placed out for student use. Winward has excellent smoothies, but it's about 4.30$ for a medium, which is about 12 oz. The hang provides acceptable food, but it's over-priced and often has a wait. The forum is by far the best food on campus, and rarely has a wait. However, the forum is overpriced as well, and is a relatively long distance from the main part of campus. Flex dollars must be used by the end of the year- many students opt to buy a gift card from Panera Bread to use the remaining amount."
College Freshman,2,"There are some spots that are really bad around here if you want to be close to school and other things.  If you want to travel a little bit and spend more money, there are some really good places that people like."
College Student,2,UNE does not encourage off campus living.
College Student,2,Relax UNE let students be students.
College Freshman,2,"UNE is VERY strict and it is hard to do anything without getting in trouble. It is understandable that it is a private school so it is funded by the government, but it IS a college so they should let off the reins a little."
College Freshman,2,There are hardly any parties here. The most a party is at UNE is a couple of friends hanging out in a room drinking and maybe playing some drinking games.
College Sophomore,2,"We have grade D sodexo, while paying a large amount of money to go here. The dining hall itself it awful most of the time and can make kids sick. The hang, windward, and the forum are where everyone would prefer to go. But for that we need flex dollars, which run out quickly"
College Freshman,2,I do not party but I have heard about the party scene and it does not appeal to me at all.
College Junior,2,The only parties are held at beach houses and are usually busted very quickly.
College Freshman,2,"Many would say you really have to look for the parties. You kind of need an ""in"""
College Freshman,2,If you're a girl....then its slim picking. If you're a boy...you're in heaven.
College Freshman,2,There are extremely few parties going on on-campus
College Sophomore,2,It's Maine....during the fall winter and spring months it will be quiet because it is cold.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I am still not sure if I will be able to accept my admission at UNE because right now, I cannot afford to.  I hope to get more assistance in the next few weeks."
Recent Alumnus,2,I only know what my friends that already go there say. They say the nightlife is almost nonexistent but I will have to make up my own mind when I get there.
College Junior,2,"If you can time it right you can get a spot. Otherwise, prepare for a hike"
College Sophomore,2,It's not the best.  You really got to know people to know where the parties are.  It's pretty rural with only a select few bars and clubs available period.  Even with Portland being so close.  The underage nightlife stinks unless there is something worth doing going on at the university.  Transportation to anywhere except downtown and the supermarket is nonexistent
College Sophomore,2,If you enjoy warmth do not attend this college. It is beautiful in the summer and late spring. The winter is long and consumes most of fall and spring. It is very cold and there is always a ton of wind as a result of living next to the ocean.
College Freshman,2,There are not many parties here and there are really only parties in upper class dorms or off campus. There are some clubs off campus but you need a car to get there.
College Freshman,2,"Biddeford is a small and run down town. Not much to do during the night, or even in the day. How ever Portland which is 20 minutes away is great."
College Freshman,2,"The diversity of people is very well balanced, however i found many of the people judgmental and unwelcoming to new ways of thinking. many of the people I met were very immature and hard to agree with. also the campus doesn't really have anything to do that is moderately entertaining. the night life here is non-exsistant unless you have a car which i do not and the bus system is very unreliable."
College Freshman,2,They ticket everybody they have nothing else to do than check the parking spots so you can never get away with it.
College Freshman,2,There is NEVER internet acsess and the professors don't give you a break 
College Senior,2,They give out too many parking permits when there aren't enough spots to park.  Parking is strictly enforced.  Plan on arriving early to campus to find a parking spot.
College Senior,2,There don't seem to be a lot of scholarships offered by the school for students. I have had to look for outside scholarships.
College Senior,2,There isn't a whole lot of diversity from what I have seen
College Sophomore,2,I hate the food there are barely any options to choose from and they are all very unhealthy.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't much of a need for a car on campus as it is a small campus, but there aren't a lot of stores around so if you don't have a car then you must take public transportation to get to a store. A permit cost for a freshman to have their car is totally  outrageous. Parking is way to far from the dorms as well"
College Freshman,2,Our financial aid office is very unhelpful and does not give out much financial aid
College Sophomore,2,"It cost a lot to get a pass and there are not many spots close to the residence halls and classes, unless you are a commuter."
College Freshman,2,"Cars are discouraged. There's not much parking, nothing off campus. There are Zip cars."
College Freshman,2,"The school is bordered by the Atlantic and the mouth of the Saco river about 20 minutes from the nearest town. The homes along the ocean are well to do mostly, pretty poor towards town. Shopping is distant but a lot of good stores if you can get to them."
College Freshman,2,"The school tries to organize dances and things on a regular basis. Other than that, you make your own entertainment on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"At least to my knowledge, the night life here is fairly minimal. There are no frats or nearby bars, parties can happen from time to time but you have to be careful of the campus security/ biddeford police if its off campus. "
College Senior,2,do not know. do not need this
College Senior,2,did not include my outside grants and had to pay back money
College Senior,2,class schedule does not fit into work schedule
College Sophomore,2,There is generally enough parking (there are overflow spots) but most of the time it is far from the dorms and the best spots fill up very quickly. Parking permits are ridiculously priced.
Recent Alumnus,2,I find the bus system inadequate considering the large student population
College Sophomore,2,It costs a TON! I really don't think its worth it to bring your car.
Recent Alumnus,2,You can usually find an open computer but expect to wait in long printing queues when printing your assignments. There is only one printer per computer lab.
College Freshman,2,"Not very helpful, they lost my financial aid information and I had to wait an extra month before receiving it. Call financial aid to make sure they recieved your FAFSA information."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone looks the same. It's almost completely ""white"" here, but those that aren't are accepted. The LBGTQ community is also very accepted here. This school doesn't have much of a spiritual life at all."
College Freshman,2,Everyone looks the same here. There aren't many different races
College Junior,2,"The availability of parking has diminished, almost exponentially because of student body size growth. Especially in the area of commuter parking. Tickets are given all too often, and to students whom could not find a single parking space after circling campus many times."
College Freshman,2,It is important to have good professors at a college that specializes in medical degrees. UNE is greatly lacking good professors. They don't connect with students that well or know how to teach the basics in the courses.
College Junior,2,"The food in Decary is nothing short of gross and undercooked on a regular basis. If you go to any other food place on campus, you can get a decent meal. The issue then is you fly through your dining dollars. You can use your off campus dollars at places like Panera so that's not a bad deal but you only get $75 worth. If you are on the Portland campus, Alexander has really good food and you can use either your meal swipes or flex dollars there."
College Freshman,2,"UNE is a bunch of nice people from towns in the middle of nowhere. You won't meet many city people. There's a small amount, but the vast majority of students are small town kids. They're smart and friendly, but attractive people...close to none. 70% girls to 30% guys. Not fun. It's small and most of the guys that seem worth your time are either taken or real jerks. Sorry to be harsh."
College Freshman,2,"Well, I'm not sure about total amount of diversity but the amount of black people on campus are 30... There are a lot of christian/Catholics, there are a lot of different economical backgrounds even though the school is so expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"They have many choices but the quality of the food is not the greatest, and there are not many vegetarian choices."
College Freshman,2,"Busses run to and from the local stores, but long bus ride, and bad timing with busses"
College Junior,2,"The dining hall food is usually not the best. I have some vegetarian friends on campus who always complained about the lack of choices for them. There are also not a lot of healthy options available. The food is not terrible it's just not overly tasty.  The best time of day to eat at the main dining hall is breakfast because it's actually amazing! The Hang (fast food) and Windward (cafe) are not too bad, the food is mostly really god but again the healthy options are limited and both the Hang and Windward are more on the expensive side."
Niche User,1,"Disorganized, overpriced university with policies that only serve instructors and staff. There are so many other, better options that this school."
Niche User,1,"Disorganized, overpriced university with policies that only serve instructors and staff. There are so many other, better options that this school."
Graduate Student,1,"Attended school at the Westbrook College of Health Professions for a year. Initially I was impressed with the school and felt it was money well spent. Over time I realized it's actually more of a diploma mill. Some courses are well taught and matched with quality clinical rotations. Other courses, of equal importance, were taught in an inconsistent, out-of-date, and lackadaisical manner. I reached out to my advisor for help and found myself snubbed repeatedly. 

I'm struggling to think of something else positive to remark upon about UNE. I think they've invested heavily in broadcasting a false image with ""innovation for a healthier planet"" but behind the scenes it's an ""old boys (or girls) club"".  Very much hands off when it comes to supporting students in a matter-of-fact, meaningful way. Overall my time at UNE was profoundly frustrating and disappointing to the point that I chose to withdraw from the school and transfer elsewhere. If you're studying health professions, avoid UNE."
Graduate Student,1,Incredibly expensive for a lackluster service. Literally thousands of dollars for the same or lesser quality than I experienced at the community college level.
Senior,1,"Some of the professors truly love what they are teaching and it truly reflects on the materials being studied. But that is about it. This university accepts just about everyone and is one of the most expensive universities I've been to. The university heads provide low-grade cafeteria food that had made my whole class sick and constantly running to the toilets. There is no advocacy for their students whatsoever. There is a super high turnover rate due to so many reasons, mostly the toxicity of the environment here my friend became a RA and was harassed to transferring out of school because her BOSSES were bullying her. This is unacceptable and this school needs a major makeover."
Graduate Student,1,the worst experience overall. please don't waste your money and time here. the entire university doesn't worth a penny.
Junior,1,This college does not listen to what students want or their opinions.  The school doesn't have room for the amount of students they have accepted but instead of being smart and letting juniors live off campus which has been a long going argument.  They are only letting off some who meet a certain requirement.  The reason they do this is to take the money of students not because they believe it would be beneficially for the student.  Everything is expensive and they don't seem to care.  The staff they have hired is very disrespectful and talk down to students.  Don't come here if you want a good 4 year college experience.
College Freshman,1,I don't believe that there is Greek life. But I have seen little sneak peaks that their might be or maybe there was at one point in time.
College Junior,1,There's no Greek life at UNE
College Sophomore,1,We don't have Greek life at this school
College Freshman,1,"There is almost no party scene at this school. Not saying it doesn't exist, just that you have to look to find it."
College Sophomore,1,There isn't much of anything to do around here
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life at UNE.
College Freshman,1,We have a ban of any type of Greek life here in Biddeford....
College Sophomore,1,School is uptight about underage drinking and if you are caught good luck dealing with the school judicial review. The police could also be potentially involved as well. Very difficult to find parties at all and the ones that do happen are off campus but the police always tend to break them up pretty easily.
College Sophomore,1,Students that were caught with alcohol got in big trouble and sometimes the police would be involved.
College Sophomore,1,It was the worst food I have ever put into my body. I do not know how I survived eating it. People often complained
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life on the Portland campus
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,Biddeford Police as well as the campus security are assholes and will give people summons for anything. Parties off campus are risky and do not even think about partying in your rooms. The upside is that Portland is a great city and is 20 minutes away.
College Freshman,1,"for a real party need a ride (or your own car) off campus, and still need to worry about Biddeford PD off campus. On campus forget it, any good party will get busted by campus security because they have nothing else to do. even simply drinking in the dorms is tough because the smell and noise will just travel through out the hallway."
College Freshman,1,"Campus Security do the rounds constantly. Hard to drink in dorms, and lots of noise will often lead to a knock on the door from the RA"
College Freshman,1,There is never any wifi and all the work is online so I don't understand how they expect us to do the work if there is no way to get on the internet.
College Senior,1,We don't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,Absolutely hate the food! The choices are horrible! They always have the same disgusting foods 
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek life at UNE but I really wish we did because I believe it would make my college experience way more rewarding and fun.
College Freshman,1,We do not have any Greek life available at our school
College Freshman,1,No Greek life. We don't feel deprived.
College Senior,1,only one and it is very expensive and not much variety
College Senior,1,"it is the only BSW social work program located near Tulsa, OK"
College Senior,1,"northeastern state university, broken arrow campus is isolated, no transportation is available unless you have a private owned car. "
College Senior,1,There is only one sorority with no house and it exists (existed) soley for community service. 
College Senior,1,Internships are REALLY hard to come by. You have to work hard to find them. 
College Sophomore,1,School is very strict. Not much to do anyways. Have to travel to go anywhere really.
College Sophomore,1,The freshman dorms and living conditions are horrible.  We should have been paid to live there as part of a psychology experiment.  The upperclassmen dorms are completely different world.  They are new and have enough space for everyone to breathe and live together instead of on top of each other.
College Junior,1,"Quality guys and girls are hard to come by. Freshman girls don't be stupid and stay away from the hockey boys, otherwise you're just one of those girls."
College Junior,1,You will rarely get away with drinking on campus. There are strict rules in place. Security doesn't have anything better to do. Get used to feeling like you're at boarding school.  It's pathetic. They think by cracking down on the students and becoming more strict they'll stop the drinking and illegal activity. Whatever makes them sleep at night.
College Freshman,1,"Food at the main dining hall, Decary, while it is decent, gets old very quickly. There are vegetarian options, but they are few. Meat is tough and not very flavorful. 
There are two other places to use flex dollars: the Forum and the Alfond Center for Health Sciences. The Forum is excellent but it is about a 10-15 minute walk from the freshmen dorms. The ACHS is ok, but they have few options."
Recent Alumnus,1,It's Maine. There's literally no diversity besides a few token students.
College Junior,1,I could not find scoolarships in my field (Public Health)
College Sophomore,1,it is very difficult to find parking on the portland campus most days
College Freshman,1,"UNE focuses more on keeping kids safe than ensuring that they have a good experience at on campus events such as dances, concerts, etc.  Mandatory arrival times for events are in place to prevent kids from pre-gaming, but this makes it difficult for kids with earlier commitments to attend and forces people who do to stand around for long periods of time supposedly to sober them up."
College Junior,1,They are too strict on drinking and drugs. They give out fines for every little offense and don't realize that we don't have the money to pay more than we already are. I know a lot of people transferring because of the strictness.
College Junior,1,I don't even know what Greek Life is so I don't think it's a big deal at UNE.
College Freshman,1,"It's annoying, slow, and chooses to stop operating at the worst times; the transport system is non-existent when everyone is trying to get to the train station to go home after finals."
College Junior,1,"You get fees for having fees. Look at their policy online. It is really important to have a car but it costs so much money. 300 dollars for a parking permit plus 30 for unmarked spot parking, 30 for not displaying a permit, etc."
College Freshman,1,UNE students get to ride the campus bus for free but the schedule is not convenient at all. A round trip from my school to Wal-Mart was a little over three hours... and our campus is a ten minute drive to Wal-Mart. The bus does not run late. The last bus is at 8:00 p.m.
College Freshman,1,"A parking ticket for the semester costs over $300 for first year students. They give parking tickets out like it is nobody's business and the parking spots that are allotted for residents are not convenient at all. Campus life is dull, but having a car would provide access to many more opportunities. The campus shuttle does not run late on weekends or weeknights, so if you are looking to go off-campus one night a car is a must for convenience."
College Senior,1,"Pretty Much Nothing – Because UNE is so isolated, the off campus dining options are extremely limited. The only thing within walking distance is SeaStar which is overpriced. However, the nor'easter dollars that everyone receives are nice for eating at Thai Me, Panera, Papa Johns, etc but you still have to find a way in to town in order to use them."
College Sophomore,1,"This school does not know what nightlife is.  There are parties, but very rarely do underclassmen get invited.  They are usually only for people who play sports.  So unless you are a sports player or a ""biddy"" don't go looking for an invitation.  There is no greek life whatsoever, so that trumps the little nightlife that there would be.  Most of the bars are 21+ and are a half an hour drive away in Portland.  You can go clubbing, which is 18+ but unless you have a car, you are not getting there."
College Sophomore,1,"Dining Is Awful – The food is gross, just plain and nasty.  There are very little options for kids who have food allergies or who are vegan, and when they do have those options they do not taste good whatsoever.  They are very repetitive and their hours at the dining hall are awful.  They say that they are open from 7 until 8pm at night, but they close periodically throughout the day to ""clean and vacuum"". It's very inconvenient when you're in the middle of switching classes and need to eat.   They do not have many on campus dining options.  The actual dining hall takes the meal plan (mind you, there is only one big dining hall).  Then there is Winward cafe (overpriced), Alfond Cafe, and The Hang.  These places make you use your flex dollars, which will run out fast if you do not like Decary food.  All together I suggest getting a meal plan that is a balance or both meals from the dining hall and other flex dollars to use at the cafes.  If you have a car you will have a much easier time finding food.  There are many chinese restaurants around town that do take out, and also pizza places that deliver 24/7."
College Junior,1,"No Fun – Some RA's are ""out to get you"". At the beginning of the year, one RA informed me, jokingly or whatever, that he would use a flashbang grenade and breech + clear my room if necessary. RAs knock and enter your room on false pretenses regularly. ""Cool"" RAs get filtered out for not writing up enough people. There are some fair RAs who only write you up for blatant things but you can expect to have at least one incident.

The judicial process is a joke. I know kids that have gotten expelled, kicked off campus housing, or suspended for 2-3 weed/alcohol violations.

The security guards as people themselves may not be all that bad, but I know of at least 2 (the security team is like 6 strong) in my two years who have been fired for abusing their powers. The focus of security at this school is undoubtedly to punish freshmen and gather money in fines.

I can think of at least 2 incidents in my 2 years where fire alarms have been pulled by security under false pretense so they could search an evacuated room."
College Junior,1,"Very Strict – The Campus is very strict on many things.  If you get in trouble you most likely will have to pay a fine of an absurdly high amount, and attend a class."
College Freshman,1,"First of all, a parking pass costs over $300 for a year, which is outrageous. Secondly, there is not enough parking for everyone! They sell more parking passes then there are spots, plus people just don't know how to park (ie. over the lines, big trucks in compact car spots, etc). Commuter parking is nearly impossible to find if you get there after 10am."
College Freshman,1,"Way Too Strict – The punishments for drinking are waaay too severe. Some of the RAs are nice and lenient, but many take it too seriously. It's college, people are going to drink and have fun; they just need to chane the policies a little bit."
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life. People have tried to petition it but apparently it isn't allowed.
College Freshman,1,There's nothing to do.  Hope you like studying.  Closest bars or anything would be a 20 minute drive.  Under 21 fun there is sometimes some dumb and poorly attended event on campus.
College Student,1,"Unfortunately, UNE does not have fraternities and sororities."
College Student,1,"Antiqued and Over-Priced – You don't get the most ""bang for your buck"" when living on campus at UNE.  Especially if you're caught in the limbo of being a transfer student...I was placed in a run-down, antique building, where the walls were paper-thin and the windows are extremely drafty.  Meanwhile, the view outside is of the upperclassman dorms, that seem like the Hilton Gardens in comparison to the antiquated ""transfer student"" dorms."
College Freshman,1,Parking is expensive. The school issues more parking permits than there are spots to park. The police have a bad reputation here. Tickets galore. Car is a must if you want to go out on the weekends because public transportation is a joke.

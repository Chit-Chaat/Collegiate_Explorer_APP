Sophomore,5,I love my experience at Winston-Salem. The classes to the professors to the family vibe that’s given is just GREAT ! Wouldn’t have chose another HBCU
Freshman,5,"Winston-Salem State University is the most family oriented school and full of fun for the diversity of different people. They are well known in sports and very attentive with their students. I would wish they change the way things have been slowed and so many technical difficulties with the school, but other than that the school itself is very outstanding."

Also the school has many activities that you can get involved in. You will not feel like a number or get lost in the sauce. Even in the big classes teachers take time to meet with you.
Junior,5,Wssu was on top of everything. They let us know things head of time. Also we met on zoom and the professors explained everything. With everything going on they were very professional with everything thing and classes.
Sophomore,5,"It was great and not too stressful the school made it easy and accessible, I would only do it all over it. The experience was great."

Junior,5,"Throughout my senior of high school, I was looking for a university that felt like home to me. I went to visit Winston-Salem State University and it instantly felt like I was at home. Attending an HBCU never crossed my mind and I am glad that I am at one. So far as a junior, WSSU has helped me find my confidence, strength, and brought out a different me. My university provides everlasting opportunities and will stand by you till you reach your finish line."
Junior,5,"My online experience was hard at first but WSSU made sure to find a solution for our online learning experience. My professors and advisors work through me and were patient every single step of the way. One thing I do love about our professors is that they do understand that we are students and our personal lives. I have healthy relationships with my professors and appreciate their guidance throughout my college years. If WSSU did another online learning experience, I would not have a problem with that."
Freshman,5,"Due to Covid-19, all the courses were switched to online. I will admit I struggled at first. Professors had to switch in-person classes to online. The transition was not smooth at first, but over time it managed to flow. We all adapted well and my online experience has influenced me to consider online courses in the future."
Freshman,5,"My experience at  Winston-Salem State University was very interesting. As a first-time freshman, the staff went out of their way to ensure that I knew where to locate all the resources. My professors were thorough, meticulous, and eager to stay behind for additional assistance. The environment was extremely welcoming and supportive.  I stayed in the Martin Schneider dorm in the spring of 2020. The room size was the perfect size for two young adults. The distance of my dorm to classes and the cafe was favorable. The cleaning staff ensured the bathrooms and living spaces were well cleaned. Lastly, as a student-athlete the coaches, trainers, and medics are amazing. I've never felt like I've been in better hands. My collected experiences have influenced me to the best version of myself and a proud ram."

Niche User,5,"I acknowledged that Winston-Salem State was the right place for me because of the distinct, yet friendly campus, the university's global awareness, and it is renowned for my intended major.  The university's welcoming campus is another reason I desire to attend Winston-Salem State, the more modest scaled university allows for a lot more campus connections. WSSU remained my top selection in universities because of the school's goal to cultivate scholars who are globally aware. I consider that through research, internships, and challenging experiences, you provide a student with the proper tools for their following episode in life."
Freshman,5,I love Winston and I love how diverse it is. Being here makes me feel at home it’s almost like it’s my home away from home.
Freshman,5,The most thing I like about WSSU is that everyone is like a family making new friends and becoming close with a lot of people is the fun apart about college to me.
Sophomore,5,I love the teachers and how they work with you! We could use more food options and better housing. If you work hard and really want something you can achieve it if you set goals and put your mind to it. I enjoy how the campus is a big circle so it's not hard to get around.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Winston Salem State University has taught me the values of friendship and self love. Freshman year was an amazing moment because I realized that I fell in love with the school, Towards the end of my Freshman year I ran for Miss Sophomore and won. I quickly became dedicated to the improvements of my class, Going into sophomore year I was super excited, my schedule was quickly filled with events and meetings. After inauguration I lost my title as Miss sophomore because I decided to hang around the wrong crowd at the wrong time. I quickly fell into a depression but after meditating and practicing how to love myself my spirits were lifted again.Although losing my title was a pain for me to bear it has opened my eyes to goals I would have never seen before. My time at Winston continues to be amazing because of the new friends that I have made who are interested in bettering their life while encouraging me to be the best version of myself."

I've learned some lessons and made lifelong friends by being involved on campus and participating in campus events. I would definitely recommend this university to anyone wanting to know why it's ""so hard to be a RAM!"""
Sophomore,5,"I would not change a thing. We are a family at Winston-Salem State University and I honestly do love my school with a passion. The staff or front office is a little slower than some schools but that is very common and it is simply no big deal at all. Other than that it is a blast and so much fun attending SU. I would not trade the opportunity to be here for anything in the world, I mean that."

Freshman,5,I Haven't  yet experienced it but Winston-salem seems like home away from home were you can go out to the different events on campus make friends find a sport or club and talk to people
Sophomore,5,"Winston-Salem State University is a very diverse school and puts its students first. I really love how the advisors at Winston- Salem State University continue keeping a check on their students even in the summertime. If any student has a problem at my university, there is always someone there to help. One thing I would change about my university is the food and the cafeteria staff. My university pretty much has a set schedule every day of the week and on each day, it serves something specific for that specific day of the week. My favorite day is Wednesday because it has fried chicken for lunch and spaghetti for dinner. I love attending WSSU, it is like a big family.  The most important thing I love about my university is that it is an HBCU and every time I step on campus I feel at home."
Freshman,5,"Something that I enjoy about Winston Salem State University would be that no matter where you go on campus or who you talk too, you feel at home. Every single person that you many come in contact too will do their best to make sure that you get the help that you need. Something that I would like to see change about the campus would be creating more activities for the students to do on campus. Such as clubs or daily student activities."
Junior,5,"First off I would like to say, I love HBCU, but not every school is perfect. We have our flaws, but who doesn't. My college experience so far has been a roller coaster, but a fun one. The culture at my school is UNDEFEATED! My freshman year was exciting and a real eye-opener. I learned a lot that year pertaining to friendships, guys, the school, and even myself. I had a minor setback but I came back my sophomore year, somewhat. Now going into my Junior year and experiencing what I have experienced, I know that I just got to keep my head up and pushing forward to the end because I know I got this."
Sophomore,5,"This is the Best Experience I had in school my entire life, the culture here is amazing this has to be the Top HBCU in the world. The Professors and Staff are always helpful when u need something they will take there time to figure out a way to help you. The sporting event are fun , intramural basketball is a good way they help students to come together and play for a mini tournament. We have many clubs to help our fellow students get a job. Overall I would recommend visiting this school."

Freshman,5,What I like about Winston Salem State University would be that I feel like I never left home. I have had family members that attended WSSU and they loved their experience! I have attended games and freshman orientations to learn about my new journey at WSSU and I honestly cannot wait to continue my next four years at Winston Salem State University. I plan to gain various connections through my professors and let them know that I am a well educated and determined student.
Freshman,5,"Winston-Salem State University whole fully exemplifies black excellence and diversity in the best of ways. Though predominately African-American, this university is very diverse in the cultural backgrounds brought here from many different states and even other countries. Academically, the curriculum is extensive in providing essential life skills as well as building social justice advocates within the student body. There are countless events, opportunities, and organizations around campus every week for students to receive work field experience, community service movements and events, and a comfortable place to grow and find themselves whole fully. There's also countless social events including parties on and off campus, social connect days held by the student body, and much more. In conclusion, this University is a brilliant institution."
Alum,5,"WSSU prepare students for success! A large percentage of my classmates are retiring from their profession and they still give back to the institution.  I believe my education was first class, the campus is nice and the professors were caring which contributed to my success."
Freshman,5,It has only been one semester and I am so in love with my campus! From the students to the attentive staff everyone is routing for your success!
Junior,5,I am currently in the RN to BSN program at Winston-Salem State University. It is entirely online which would extremely difficult were it not for the resources and availability of the professors. The teachers quickly and professionally respond to any questions the student might have and they let the student know how to reach them. This is an exceptional school and program that I would recommend to anyone looking to further their education.
Niche User,5,I would tell others that wssu is a very good environment. I went to go visit there and everyone there is so friendly. Their campus is very beautiful and unique.
Niche User,5,I am only a senior in high school and I knew I wanted to go to Winston Salem State since 6th grade it is my dream school.
Sophomore,5,"I wouldn't change anything about my school. We have some of the best students and factuality that I have ever came met. Some might think we are a small campus, we are all just one little happy ramily."
Niche User,5,"Winston Salem is an very good, and interesting college. It makes you feel very welcomed, and a home like feel."
Senior,5,"The experience is unmatched. It feels like a huge family. Whether it’s falculty, staff, students or alumni, you will always feel at home. We succeed in every aspect and they make sure that you are ready postgraduate whether it’s the workforce or pursuing a degree in grad school."
Senior,4,This school is the livest HBCU on the planet. One drawback is people in the offices being unorganized.
Senior,4,"Professors are pretty good at teaching online courses. Overall, they are easy to reach and willing to help you."
Junior,4,"Online classes and professors have been great for my program. Communication can be difficult with other parts of the school, such as registrar and finance departments."
Junior,4,"As a distance learning student my classes have been very good, but communication with some departments can be difficult."
Freshman,4,Even throughout covid the school has made a way for us freshmen to get on campus and have a fun time. They are helping us and still making sure we get out college experience.
Senior,4,I've only taking several classes  online. They were  very well  set up and easy to follow.  The professors keep in contact with me and offered assistance as often as necessary.  I wished the offered more classes online.
Freshman,4,"Winston Salem State University is a great school that offer a lot of opportunities for minorities, I like how the professor's try to connect with the students and not only go and explain the class and that's it.  The only thing that I would like to change is the parking pass, you have to park far away from the campus if you didn't get your pass on time."
Freshman,4,"My experience at WSSU has been great so far! I like WSSU because everyone shows school spirit for all sports. The professors are also down to earth, whenever help is needed, it is given without any hesitation. However, WSSU could change a few things. For instance, they could answer the phone in a more timely manner."
Alum,4,Experience  overall as far as Professor engagement to worked on campus most of my tenure to the atmosphere was pleasant.
Senior,4,"My experience at Winston-Salem State University has been a very good one for the most part. On one hand, I love the culture and the fact that I can be with people that look like me that I can easily connect with. On the other hand, as a computer science major, it is not the absolute best program at my school. Since my school is more known for its nursing program, there seems to be a lack of focus for those that want to be in my field. The advisors that are not in my major have put me in classes that I never needed and that put me behind in some of my classes. There are also not enough classes that fit into my specific field (cybersecurity) except for a couple of classes so I would like for there to be more classes learning different security programs."
Junior,4,"The nursing program provides student with many different resources, and chances to improve their grades and critical thinking skills."
Senior,4,"I liked the students and my professors. The instructors were helpful and dedicated to help students succeed. They expect a lot from the students but it is for the students benefit. 

I would change the timely and orderly fashion of the financial aid and administration office."
Freshman,4,"the campus is nice, and not too large. the school is an HBCU so diversity is minimal. the city surrounding the campus is very small but there are plenty of things to do on campus."
Senior,4,Overall my experience has been pretty good. The nursing program alone is very unorganized so that’s a big problem for me
Niche User,4,"Winston-Salem State is a school I have dreamed about going to for years. I may not be a student but I have been on campus a lot. I enjoyed touring the school and I personally think it is a great school to go to. It's not expensive, the students seem nice and very accepting, the school has great programs and I can't wait to go."
Sophomore,4,I liked the people and the energy I witnessed while there. There isn’t much of anything that I would change. I have had a good experience.
Sophomore,4,"What I love the most about Winston Salem state university is the people. When I first set foot on campus the atmosphere was so welcoming. The students and faculty are very welcoming. If I had to change one thing about the entire school, it would be the food. The food in the cafe lacks variety and nutrition. Most of the kids would rather eat a burger or pizza rather than the main course. With help in that section the overall school will be much better."
Sophomore,4,I am currently a student at Winston-Salem State University and I love it! The people are great you just have to surround yourself with the right people.
Sophomore,4,I would like to see more financial aid opportunities offered other than student loans. Especially for those who are not extremely low income students but need a little assistance.
Junior,4,Winston-Salem State University is one of the top Historical Black Universities not only in North Carolina but the nation. The university offers top tier academic programs along with prominent student led organizations. The relaationships which exsist between faculty/staff and students is one which display there is genuine care. The athletic programs perform well over years.
Niche User,4,Close to home town. Options for study track.  Several friends have attended Winston Salem State and spoke well of their experience. Happy about the music programs like the band and love the football program.
Niche User,4,"From my personal experiences with the school, I have witnessed how intimate the school is and how they effectively prepare students for life outside of college. Like every school, Winston- Salem State University has their flaws but the exceptional opportunities that the illustrious university paves the way for outweighs all."
Senior,4,A lot of the professors within the nursing program are helpful! I can tell that they care about my future and academics!
Junior,4,"It has been a good experience most of the people are friendly and some not, but I never let anyone get me down and as for how it can be better well I say more scholarship opportunities and for me I would love if my school had a men's track team"
Freshman,4,It was hard to get any answers about how to enroll. The administration office staff was not very helpful.
Senior,4,Winston-Salem State is definitely a great school which is steadily on the rise to becoming one of the greater schools in North Carolina and an even greater HBCU nationally. The campus is becoming more diverse every year and overall it is a great family feel from academics to on campus activities. Class sizes are great and give great opportunities to create real relationships with professors to promote and create higher chances of success for you. There is always fun to be had around campus as well but nothing is better than not only getting an education but also having fun with it as well.
Sophomore,4,"Overall I love the school; I love how every year others, including myself, notice notice the growth that each school year brings. People have noticed my growth before I have. This school has some amazing teachers who really do go out of their way to try to help EVERYONE, despite the fact that the students can outnumber and overwhelm."
Sophomore,4,Well to be honest what I like about WSSU is that it is an Historically black college it is not that far and it has a beautiful enviroment and the staff are so friendly and they have a good sports team and last they have a wide variety of activities to do
Sophomore,4,I love the environment and positive energy WSSU gives off. It’s completely amazing and enjoyable! We’re always on top of our academics and campus events. We’re one big family.
Sophomore,4,My first year experience was the best. I can honestly say I cant wait to see what the next years will bring. Getting involved academically or just to have a good time was never a problem. The food choice is something I would change for the better as well as the campus housing.
Senior,4,"Winston-Salem State University is a great school to attend. Being that it is an HBCU, it still has a good amount of diversity. Student life is brought together through various activities from Greek life to activities planning board. I would encourage rising college students to at least take a visit to WSSU to get a feel of the Ram life."
Alum,4,"As a Alumni, I truly enjoyed my time spent at SU. From the ""homey atmosphere"" to the Professors who actually cared and had compassion in their crafts to want for us to succeed."
Senior,4,I Love the school. I would like to see more scholarships/grants offered for seniors whom have ran out of FAFSA. There should be more help for students whom is almoat done with school.
Sophomore,4,"I like that Winston-Salem State University makes me feel at home. The staff there are very friendly and most of them will honestly help you in any and every way to ensure that you're getting the best help you need. Campus grounds are always well kept and looking up to par except for the older buildings that need renovation or just old, unused buildings. Although it is an HBCU, our campus is very diverse with different races other than African American students. I do however feel that there could be more lighting around campus at night time. Walking anywhere by yourself at night isn't really safe even in a lit up area, but there still needs to be more safe lighting all around campus and not just in specific areas. The dorms all need some sort of renovation done, most importantly the freshman dorms. The dorm I stayed in was very old, closed-space, and just needs to be rebuild altogether."
Sophomore,4,"My favorite part about my experience at Winston-Salem State University is the family like energy that the students, faculty, and staff have towards each other. You can tell that the professors and other staff genuinely care about your success and are interested in your future. All of the students try our best to act as one big family and take care of each other to further each others success. The school provides countless opportunities for us to step out of our comfort zone and grow as students and also as young adults. This made my transition from high school to college less stressful and gave me the confidence to pursue success"
Sophomore,4,"I liked that when you stepped on campus it was more of a family feel and the treated you like family. Also, the classes are not the large and the campus is not that big. I also love the fact that everyone is so nice and respectful. The dorms are so nice and spacious."
Niche User,4,I am a sophomore student at North Edgecombe High School and I loved cheering with Winston-Salem State University in 2017. The students were ecstatic to be at the school and everyone seems to be one big family!
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at Winston Salem State University. I absolutely love it here! I love the environment, it is truly what is known to be a RAMily. (family)  Whether it's professors, faculty, or students, everyone shows pure genuineness. The professors work extremely hard to make students take responsibility to prepare us for life after college. I think this university could improve on the relationships with alumni. I think it is important for current students to engage with alumni for different reasons such as mentorship, advice, possible scholarships, and networking opportunities."
Freshman,4,Winston-Salem State University has a great nursing program and pushes its students to finish school and to even continue on.
Freshman,4,My experience at Winston-Salem State University has been great so far. I've met some very nice and friendly people while living on campus. WSSU is a very diverse and uplifting school. I would highly recommend people to attend this wonderful school.
Junior,4,"Though I have not attended Winston Salem State University long, I have enjoyed my experience. My only complaint is the difficulty of getting information from the various departments and bureaucracy."
Junior,4,The nursing program at Winston-Salem State is wonderful. The program really prepares students for nursing careers and nursing students have clinicals every semester. I also think it’s great that Winston Salem State is doing foreign exchange programs. This is increasing the diversity at school.
Freshman,4,My overall experience at Winston-Salem Sate University has been very good. The only thing i would change would be the people in Financial Aid. They have very nasty attitudes.
Freshman,4,"I would like to see the safety on campus improve. I love the family atmosphere at WSSU. The tradition is so rich here, the past meets the presents and prepares for the future."
Graduate Student,4,WSSU is a great HBCU. The only horrible thing about it - financial aid & office. Student life is amazing! It easy to find an awesome balance between work and play.  SO proud to be a RAM!
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Winston-Salem State University majoring in Nursing. Personally, I love the environment and how everyone is very helpful. Moving far from home was hard for me but attending this University has been one of the best decisions I've ever made. There are usually people around campus to assist you if there are any problems that you may have. This is most definitely a University that I would recommend to anyone who is seeking to be in a new environment surrounded by helpful people."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Winston-Salem State has been very good so far. Everyone treats each other like a family. The school is not too small where I know everyone but not too big that I have to constantly see different faces everyday. The school is big on nursing so many of the science classes like Biology or Anatomy are huge courses but as a RAMily at Winston-Salem, there is always someone there to help you of you feel like you're falling behind in the class. I'm glad I made the decision of choosing WSSU because i'm getting my best college experience and i'm not too far from home."
Freshman,4,"Overall great experience, the only problem I had was when I was first trying to apply. Lack of communication made it difficult to apply, and use of third-party companies made paperwork confusing."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about WSSU is the school Pride, everybody here loves to be a Ram! Also, the school provides enough resources to help you with your academics. In addition, they also have a lot of sports teams and orginizations that you can join so you will never be bored at WSSU."
Junior,4,Winston is a great school to attend. Its getting very diverse and the instructors really do care about your education.
Freshman,4,Freshman planning is very strategically planned. Administration can be tough but overall planning freshman year is great.
Freshman,4,The students and faculty are overall very nice. They have one of the top nursing and psychology programs. They are getting a Chic-Fil-A on campus.
Sophomore,4,"Winston-Salem State University has taught me the importance of networking, time management, and organization. Many college students tend to allow opportunities to pass, due to failure to openly network with staff. At WSSU, professors have assisted me beyond the classroom to push me closer to my desired career path."
Sophomore,4,"Attending Winston-Salem State University has given me hope and drive as an upcoming black man preparing to enter the working world after graduation.  In today's society I see more men of color on the negative end than the positive in the working  world.  At Winston-Salem State University I've found professors who look just like me that are doing positive things in the working world, encouraging me and supporting me to be likewise.   While matriculating in this environment I really believe I can be positive be a positive product in such a challenging world.  

Through networking and word of mouth I connected early with these professors starting out in my freshman year.  I would like to see Winston-Salem State develop a clearer, straight line or a required process to connect with willing professors."
Junior,4,"I like that WSSU is diverse and everyone is friendly. I also like the professors attitude and availability. However, I think that communication skills between the staff could be better. Overall, I would definitely recommend this school."
Niche User,4,"I toured this campus in April 2017. As a black person, I felt that I was home when I walked the campus. It really felt as if I were home. I live in CT so to be down south and find a school that actually made me feel welcome was a great plus. The tour guides were great, they even gave out their snapchats if we had any questions."
Sophomore,4,"The academics are great but the on campus housing is less than helpful. I found that if you involve parents, administrative staff will respond quicker."
Sophomore,4,Winston-Salem State is full of opportunities and abilities to to be the best you can be . WSSU help students of any race accomplish their goals at any level . I was blessed to be at Winston-Salem State .
Junior,4,"This was my first year back at Winston Salem State University after a three year hiatus.  I was pleased to see that a lot of the issues and concerns that I had during my prior years, have been resolved. I definitely had a good experience this semester."
Freshman,4,"It's great to experience the college life. It's something completely new to get use to and it's nothing at all like high school. If i could change anything it would be it would be the cafe hours. it closes so early we are still hungry every night, and freshman should have shuttles take them to grab some take-out. Overall i'm getting use to everything and it's a very amazing experience so far!"
Junior,2,"Nothing I like so far. They need to understand not everyone learns the same way, they must learn to be diverse and learn to teach differently."
Junior,2,"Not all but some of WSSU staff could be a lot more genuine, helpful, and connected with the students."
Freshman,2,"As a state school in North Carolina, WSSU is required for 70% of all accepted students to be a North Carolina resident. The school lacks diversity most students went to high school together, therefore if you're an outsider it is hard to get to know new people. The overall safety of the campus is very poor, as it is in a bad neighborhood and many locals and homeless people enter campus at night."
Sophomore,2,"Winston-Salem State faculty do not take their jobs seriously and the entire school is not worth attending I honestly don't recommend anyone to attend. Most teachers have bad attitudes for no reason and including faculty, all of there attitudes are unexpectable and they don't help you and work with you to send them your tuition."
Junior,2,So far in trying to get information on application is not progressing same information requested but not updated
Sophomore,2,The in-class experiences are great. The campus looks ran down and needs money to fix this issue. The employees working in the offices are very unprofessional and unorganized.
College Sophomore,2,They need to be improved! Some of the professors walking around does not be on their game when it comes down to putting in grades and responding to emails
College Sophomore,2,We don't have enough housing to even house all the incoming freshmen ; The need to remodel some of the dorms because they look a mess
College Junior,2,"There needs to be bigger variety of different classes to choose from, more professors that love their job, and the class sizes are just right"
College Junior,2,The housing is horrible. A few of the dorms have roaches and rats and lots of insects.
College Student,2,My overall experience at school was okay. My wasn't the greatest with teachers helping us student. Actually there was a incident where one of my teachers quit and we had non stop substitutes that gave us worksheets were not helpful to me. Overall I would have to say that if you want to actually learn something. you'll have to go the extra mile and look for help.
College Junior,2,Safety can be improved many things like check ins can be improved.
College Student,2,Start early and keep a check on things
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid offices offers very little help when trying to give help to a student. Their instructions are very vague and confusing. There are some counselors who will take the time to help a concerning student but overall it is a pain.
College Sophomore,2,They NEVER answer the phone. When you up there they give you the run around it's crazy.
College Senior,2,It is better to live on campus because there is more fraternizing with each other so I wouldn't recommend living off campus for the first years.
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid process here can definitely be a head ache because the process can be extremely long. During my freshman year, I did not receive my financial aid until the middle of the year. If you have to go through the verification process then you experience will be even worse because now you have to send in various documents to a separate entity and wait for that process and when that does, you still have to wait for the school to process that information."
College Freshman,2,Everyone in the financial aid office tends to not try to get you financial aid at all which is the purpose of why they are there for.
College Freshman,2,"It seems like it takes a long time for your financial aid to process and by the time it is processed, you're already purged. I had a hard time to being to come to this school because they barely gave me any money."
College Freshman,2,The food in the dinning hall is disgusting. We basically eat the same food everyday. There's no variety and the smell the dinning hall leaves in your clothes is awful.
College Freshman,2,My experience on campus is not that well. The people around me don't seem to care about their education and really don't show respect toward each other. My dorm build is disgusting and smells awful. The food is not that great and there's not a lot of variety. My overall experience has not been good at all.
College Freshman,2,they air bad services I don't see anyone change gloves or wash their hands when its time to  make sandwiches.
College Senior,2,Financial aid is often the worst of students existence at this school. Apply early!
College Freshman,2,"Super small, could be way better"
College Freshman,2,Needs more things around it
College Senior,2,"With the main fast foo chains just down the street, variety is very limited. There are a few locally owned restaurants but not much."
College Senior,2,"Depending on your age group it can be either good or bad. For those of us that are 21 and older, who may be out of state students,it can be frustrating not having our own designated dorm or housing that allows us to be an exception to certain rules."
College Senior,2,"The administration usually has an attitude no matter who walks in, I was often presented by a unpleasant woman at the front desk, though I did not stay long enough in the office to deal with her attitude much longer. Other than that I got all the information I needed."
College Senior,2,"I expected Greek life to be more extravagant, but the lack of one key sorority being missing/ banned in 2010 makes a big difference in campus involvement and the overall experience. A lot of students transferred because of it and many students who have stayed wished they would have transferred."
College Senior,2,Boring most students go home every weekend
College Sophomore,2,"The only place the had reliable wifi, is the library and even then sometimes it will still go down."
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus sucks. If your residence hall isn't 10 years old or less, Your getting crap. The newer buildings like Martin and Rams are pretty nice but there's crap like Moore hall with mold in the shower and no oven and Wilson where only the Resident Assistants have kitchens and the public kitchen on the fourth floor is dirty and most of the kitchen stuff doesn't work."
College Freshman,2,Not many options and not many healthy options.
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid processe here is slow. They wait til the last minute to give you your awarded amount and if you need extra money they are really not much help. I hope next semester they do better because I can't be waiting til the last minute to know how much funds I have.
College Senior,2,The parking tickets are expensive and the amount of tickets that are given to students are ridiculous.
College Senior,2,"The financial aid process at Winston State University can be very difficult and requires long hours of waiting. Some of the employees are not very helpful and rude at times of congested crowds.  I appreciate the hard work because I know at times it can be difficult dealing with people, but I would like to be treated with respect."
College Freshman,2,"The campus strictness at my school is unbelievable high. Some say it is for safety reasons, but at the same time we are young adults."
College Junior,2,Many of the students partying are freshmen.
College Freshman,2,"I stay in the oldest dorm on campus and it wasn't even one of the dorms on my preference list, but what can you expect out of a freshmen dorm, especially since we're basically the lowest on the totem pole.  The rooms are kinda small and cramped, and the bathrooms aren't always the cleanest, but that's mainly because they're community style and not everyone respects the fact that they're sharing toilets, showers, sinks, etc. with about 40 other people on their floor."
College Freshman,2,it's nearly impossible to connect the network from the dorms
College Freshman,2,You can't really depend on public transportation.
College Junior,2,Customer service and just the lack of effort by the employees
College Student,2,"You WILL get a ticket if you dont have a permit or if you park in the wrong lot. Permit costs are ridiculous, do not look foward to paying that. Parking spaces are available most of the time, you might have to walk a distance though. But yes, students and faculty will get ticketed, fined, towed, and booted. We have restaurants on campus though so food shouldn't be a problem. If you get tired of that, it is a few fast food restaurants right down the street, no more than 5 minutes if that."
College Senior,2,I don't think the parking prices are reasonable for students and they're not enough spaces for off campus students or visitors who may come on campus for an event.
College Junior,2,"At no point during my contact with the university has my status as an off campus student been mentioned. Thankfully, I will be living with my parents."
Recent Alumnus,2,My school has great programs in the sciences. They offer many research opportunities for undergraduates and partner with many Universities in that particular area which allows you to build many relationships and network for your future. The school has an awesome student facility and gym for the students it has just opened Fall of 2013. The rest of the school is average but there are some diamonds in the rough that allows the school to sparkle you just have to look for them sometimes. I hope this helps you eager college searchers!!!
College Junior,2,"The campus transportation is for exactly what it says, it only takes you around campus. That's why if your on campus and don't have a car it can be really difficult to get to the store, mall, doctor, or any other place that you may need to go."
College Junior,2,"There is not reallya nightlife at school, if you want to actually have fun you have to leave campus and go somewhere else. I think if the school offered more late night activities for students to participate in then there would be less violence, and people could enjoy themselves without worrying about how their going to get back to campus or worry about drinking while driving,"
College Junior,2,"The drug scene is underground, but everyone knows about it. Alcohol is more common. In WSSU, as long as you are with crowd, you don't have to worry about drugs."
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid isn't the best process. It can be very frustrating at times and you never receive enough financial aid.
College Sophomore,2,"There are alot of people who try to be the same as others, some even go to the school ""just because"" and do bad with their grades. some interests are the same because people don't like to try new things unless they see that it will get them higher social status. Because it is an HBCU you don't find many people that are too different. but there is a good number of different people."
College Sophomore,2,"It is just plain horrible trying to get your financial aid. I was in the financial aid for so long on move in day. It took a very very long time to get anything back. However, when I finally did get it back it was very helpful."
College Sophomore,2,i mean its okay for the most party but when you order out the places a kinda far so it takes a while for the food to get there and sometimes its even cold but the are kind enough that if that happens the will either reimburse you or bring you fresh hot food so like i said its okay
College Senior,2,A meal plan is very expensive on this campus.  Eating at the Ram Shack or Java city can deplete funds quicker than a football team can devour hamburgers!!!
College Junior,2,"The computers are okay, some places on campus we have to bring our own paper to print.  The computer lab they removed the printer, so there is no way to print there.  In the library we have to pay to print."
College Junior,2,"The parking on campus is average, parking permits costs too much.  Security is always giving out parking tickets or booting cars.  Parking is terrible if you have to go on campus for a short while, you can not find a spot to park, or you have to park at a parking meter.  As much as we pay in tuition, parking should be free."
College Junior,2,"The school is down to road from the ""hood;"" and it's men down there that will try to get you to buy things, look at you in weird ways and try to talk to you; however, if you go to other parts of Winston-Salem, its pretty decent."
College Junior,2,"Overall I am not a big fan of the cafe but in reality you can always find something in there to eat, even if you do not like it.  There are options such as the Ram Shack, C-Store, and the Pod as well."
College Sophomore,2,The athletics department at WSSU glorifies basketball and football. There's barely any recognition for other sports on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"No parking for freshman. Parking permits are pretty expensive, but usually you can get a lot close to your dorm and find a decent space."
College Junior,1,drugs are not seen around on campus at all
College Freshman,1,Its great depending on where you are staying
College Freshman,1,needs to give students a chance to earn a full scholarship from Winston Salem State after the first semester or year in college
College Senior,1,Campus dining is the worst they never have anything good
College Sophomore,1,"When it comes to financial aid, Winston Salem State University is absolutely horrible. The school says it doesn't have that much money but the students have no clue where it's going because it is not going to us. I did my financial aid back in January, way before it was due and they didn't even give me $10000. Me, along with lots of other students have an EFC of $0.00 and if we're not getting the money where is it going??"
College Sophomore,1,"I absolutely dread having to do my FAFSA every year, I have tried doing some of the scholarships that they offer at school but it never seems to work out, so every year my dad has to pay almost 3 thousand dollars out of pocket which is just ridiculous!"
College Senior,1,Fast food restaurants are on every corner near Winston Salem State University. Off-campus dining near the school is very cheap but also very unhealthy.
College Freshman,1,"Here at WSSU, we aren't that diverse. However we accept the few students that are considered the minority and treat them no different than others."
College Junior,1,It's difficult for students to park.
College Junior,1,Many students have access to drugs and alcohol.
College Junior,1,"Know the important dates, get a second opinion."
College Sophomore,1,I don't really notice illegal activities.
Recent Alumnus,1,The Financial Aid office is very slow and does not offer many grants and schoolarships!
College Senior,1,horrible. Campus needs more spaces and is always giving tickets when it's noy your fault
College Senior,1,"Every year is a struggle at Winston Salem State University. It seems that they always misplace some of your information which holds you back from validating. Currently, I'm going through the same thing which has led me to miss two days of class. Other than when they mess up, their  actually rated at about an B+"
College Junior,1,The ratio of girls to guys at Winston-Salem State is 32:1.  The school is majority women which sometimes creates a little drama when it comes to relationships.
College Junior,1,Parking is a hectic.  Parking decals are extremely expensive and sometimes there is not parking available in your designated parking lot. Campus police are extremely ticket happy.
College Sophomore,1,"Not much clubbing in W-S. Better to go to Greensboro, Charlotte, or somewhere else. But if you don't club, like me, there is the movies, cute places to eat, parks, etc. But all of this is only assessible if you have a car or a friend with a car. If your stuck on campus with no ride, sucks...SUCKS BAD. The weekend is dead because everyone goes home."
College Sophomore,1,"There's only a few places within walking distance really. A seafood place, McDonalds & Bojanges. If you want to eat something besides that, order WIngZone, pizza, or chinese for delivey or get a friend with a car."
College Freshman,1,"Ir is very easy to get a hold of drugs on campus, no matter how old you are."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is horrible on campus because some parking spots are positioned far from the dorms. Tickets are also given out too much, cars are towed too much and citations are given too much as well. The campus police seem to harass the students in the parking lot with issuing numerous amount of tickets daily."
College Senior,1,"The environment that surrounds our school is very unsafe. Gunshots are sometimes fired into the dorm rooms due to activity outside of campus.  Half of the time, the campus police doesn't want to help.  There have been several robberies and I don't think none of the suspects have yet to be caught."
College Junior,1,There is nothing but fast food locations near school. To get a good variety or if your concern with healthy choises you would have to drive about 15 minutes
College Freshman,1,Freshman are not allowed to have a car their freshman year and I do not believe its fair. They also need a car to be able to go through their daily duties in life.
College Sophomore,1,It is a diffucult process. They do not always answer the phone. In order to get results you have to physically go to the school.
College Sophomore,1,"Winston-Salem State has a majority of African American students, there are few white students that are starting to attend the university.  Overall the diversity level is increasing, but still majority of the students are of the same race."
College Sophomore,1,The Financial aid program does not help as mush as it should.  If college is a necessity to survive in the expanding world then why do universities make it so difficult to pay for.  Winston-Salem State has raised tution making it even more difficult for out of state students to pay.
College Freshman,1,"Not Much Mightlife – Though the campus always has a DJ playing music, the nightlife in town is awful here. There are no clubs really; We have one club that opens only for special events.We do have plenty of bars; Winston-Salem is a bar kind of town.Transportation at night is scarce, you might could get a cab, but that's about it."
College Freshman,1,"As a freshman youre not allowed to have your car on campus, which isnt fair to students with diffucult transportation back home. Even the visitors parcking lot is closed during the day and open up after 5 oclock."
College Freshman,1,"The Cafe Food – The food that they serve us are low quality food, that  result in stomach pain. The staff always have negative attitudes."
College Sophomore,1,"When a visitor comes to campus they have to park all the way across campus, after stopping through the security station and picking up a parking permit. If they are in a rush and want to quickly run into a professor's office the odds are that you will have a ticket by the time you get back. They even ticket after 5:00 when they claim that after 5:00 pm you are free to park anywhere."
College Sophomore,1,Non Existent – There aren't any good clubs in the Winston-Salem area and the ones that try to appeal to students at Winston-Salem State University aren't in safe areas. There are some parties at Wake Forest that allow WSSU students to attend.
College Sophomore,1,Campus Police – The campus police are mean and generalize students in negative ways.
College Junior,1,"The parking system at our school is horrible. You are only allowed to park in one lot. If you park in a different lot then you can get a ticket. If a tow truck passes by and sees that you have a ticket they are allowed to either boot or tow your car, both expensive inconviniences. You would think that by spending $150 on a parking pass you will be able to park where ever you want as long as you get there early enough to get a space."
College Junior,1,Crime Alert – The crime on campus is ridiculous because every week I receive an emial that a student has been robbed or something and I believe that this could be taken care of if we had better security.  I moved off campus because I feel unsafe in the evening/night due to the fear of being robbed.
College Senior,1,Parking and Towing. The campus police on Winston Salem State University campus are too strict on parking. There is a lot of attention focused on giving out tickets and towing cars rather than the overall safety of the students. So many crimes have been reported where campus police where no where near to patrol but you can find one whose overly willing to give out a parking ticket.
College Senior,1,What Parties? There are little to no parties on the campus of Winston Salem State and the local clubs are not safe environments due to high crime rate.
College Freshman,1,There are quite a few computer labs on campus to utilize if there is not a class in them. The email system is horrible and isnt reliable. The network speed is pretty fast. I think it is a great idea to have a personal computer and utilize the printers on campus.
College Sophomore,1,Kennedy Dining Hall – The food in the cafe is horrible most of time. The variety is not diverse. Usually the options are the same week to week.
College Sophomore,1,A Hot Mess – Although i don't drive being here at this university makes me glad i don't. If its not one thing thats going on its something else. either your car is being vandalized or your parking so far off you miss the class. they do provide shuttles but they run on their own time doing what they want to do when they want to.

Freshman,5,"Pine Manor is a very good college, and the professors are very supportive. One thing that I like in Pine Manor is that, the professors are very respectfully with their students. I would like to see some changes in the food service."
Sophomore,5,What i liked about Pine Manor College is how small the campus is. With the campus being tiny it reminds me a lot of home and high school so when i left high school i was not too nervous about my new surroundings. What i would change would be the dorms they do need a tad of an update.
Freshman,5,"Pine Manor's student diversity and professor involvement is a refreshing change. The professors sincerely care about their students. The only downside is the communication between faculty (not including professors) and students (E.G financial aid services, housing services, etc)."
College Sophomore,5,"The financial aid process was amazing. No matter how bad your financial situation is or how hopeless you are when it comes to paying for your college education, Pine Manor College will find a way, and will come up with all these aids that you wouldn't even dream of, to make you feel safe and covered. Therefore, make college affordable to you."
College Sophomore,5,"If there is one thing that I love about Pine Manor College is its diversity. From economic background, to racial diversity, to sexual orientation,  Pine Manor College is a mini-world  just on its own. The students are from all over the world, and  for just one year, it gave me the opportunity to make friends from places that I didn't even know existed."
College Freshman,5,Very easy to get accepted
College Freshman,5,Pine Manor has a wide variety of international student that reside here on campus. The higher percentage of this schools population is of those of many different backgrounds.
College Freshman,5,"its calm and nice, refreshing a lot of the time making it easy to study."
College Freshman,5,the shuddle bus is always on time. If students work near school the shuddle can pick you up from work.
College Junior,5,There are many different ethnicities and religions on campus and they are all accepted as who they are. Diversity can not be an issue.
College Sophomore,5,Theres lots of parking in aroud places around the campus and it is very affordable for commuters and residents.
College Freshman,5,"Senior Internships – Seniors are required to take an internship in order to graduate. With this, it gives students the opportunity to actually experience working in the major of their choice."
College Senior,5,Great School – I love the school and Pine Manor is very serious in Athletics. We do what it takes to become one of the best :)
College Sophomore,4,"Parties mostly occur on Thursdays-Sundays. They're scattered around each village. There are a good amount of parties in the South and West villages. The students love to party, so I guess there's that."
College Freshman,4,everyone does their own thing
College Freshman,4,Enviorment is Great Just little details can improve it very good
College Sophomore,4,"When I first arrived at Pine Manor I was excited and affraid. I was excited because I always wanted to live on the east coast, but I was affraid becasue of the school itself. I orginally did not like how small the campus was. Coming into my second semester of my sophomore year, I really love Pine Manor. There are so many opportunites provided by the school. My classes are great and my professors are so helpful. Honestly, if I could chose this school over I would, becasue you should always make the best out of any school, job, or opptuninity provided for you and thats exactly what I did."
College Freshman,4,"The freshman class has attended many career panels during the first semester. The school invited previous alumni to discuss how their lives have been since Pine Manor College. I think that was a good way of helping us see what is there for us in the future. There is a career office, but I haven't visited yet, considering I'm a freshman interested in transferring."
College Sophomore,4,"The local atmosphere is pretty great! The school not exactly being in the center of the city of Boston makes it even more charming. The people are a bit reserved, but they become friendlier and more considering as they become more familiar with you."
College Freshman,4,Very easy class and the professors are just awesome
Recent Alumnus,4,My schools for that size has a great amount of activities and I see them making progress each time so I think that is a good thing
College Freshman,4,With downtown Boston just a few stops away on the T there are many attractions as well as a shopping district that can interest the students here on campus.
College Freshman,4,there are a few on campus housing flaws but over all the experience is a good one.
College Freshman,4,School policies are stricted if anyone has loud music during exam perids.
College Junior,4,The professors are all great and what makes it better is that they have experience in what ever class they are teaching so it makes it easier for when they are teaching and if a student has a specific question or anything like that.
College Sophomore,4,Trains Are the Way to Go. From the school it is about an 8 minute walk to the train station. It's very easy to get to and can take you anywhere. The campus has shuttles that run every half hour so of you miss it your better off just walking instead of waiting.
College Junior,4,"Support All Around – I've never recieved as much support anywhere as I have at Pine Manor. We are a tight knit community and you are always a familiar face amongst professors and staff. The amount of encouragement I have gotten has boosted my confidence and made me sure in my capabilities. I have kept a 4.0 GPA throughout my sophomore year and there are tutors readily available should the need arise. Pine Manor has top notch programs for biology and English students. As an art student, I wish the program was better and that there was a wider variety of classes and more instructors."
College Junior,4,"Not Bad at All – Not a great number of students use recreational drugs on campus. Smoking cigarettes, weed and drinking are common but not over-abundant. There is no pressure to take drugs or party hard. There are various students who like drinking and there are others who enjoy a quiet night in or a movie. It depends on who you dedicate your rime too. There is a place for everyone at Pine Manor."
College Freshman,4,"The best thing about Pine Manor is that it is far enough from the city to be close to nature, but still close enough to travel into the city. It is very welcoming."
Freshman,2,The bathrooms are never cleaned. I leave to go home since the campus is a ghost town. Good here sucks and there isn't a kitchen on campus for you to cook. The dining hall hours are open for like 6 hours throughout the whole day.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't go out and party. I'm more of a bookworm/don't have the desire to be punched in the face by a man during a fight outside my dorm. If you're interested in smoking weed and drinking, this school is for you. But be cautious, there have been so many fights that arose at parties, one of which required the presence of police. It is really disastrous. But if you're into drinking/smoking, you can find a connect anywhere."
College Sophomore,2,"Most schools have this issue so I'm basically desensitized to drug and alcohol use. It is so common to smell weed wherever you go that it's basically become part of the campus culture. Alcohol (from what I've seen) is stashed in some students' (including underage) fridges or in some other hiding place. I personally have been pressured to drink and eventually gave in many times because I didn't want to be bothered by the people I was socializing with. The alcohol/drug policy is the same as the law - no one under 21 is allowed to drink and drugs are prohibited. But at this point, campus security really doesn't care. They'll only give you a warning if they receive a call from a student. That's it."
College Freshman,2,"The class sizes are very small, giving you the opportunity to get the help and attention you need from your professors. That's probably the only good thing abut the academics though. Many of the professors have good teaching to offer, but the students are lazy and arrogant, so many of the staff has given up trying to educate us. It is very easy to get an A here, which is good for many people. But if you're looking to improve your academic performance and be challenged, this school is not good for you."
College Freshman,2,"If you want to study, good luck because there is a party every night here. I often see the cleaning staff in the residential bathrooms, but they don't do anything with the gym or academic buildings. I wouldn't be surprised if the staff told me they hadn't been cleaned in three years. The social atmosphere is good for smokers. As soon as you walk into my dorm, you are greeted by the smell of marijuana. If you're into that and drinking, campus housing is good for you. We haven't had many parties, considering the last time we did, there was a massive fight, a girl got punched in the face, and the police came. It takes me a good 10 minutes to get to my classes. The cost of the rooms are definitely not reflective in the amenities. Everything is quite bad."
College Freshman,2,"There is a lot of stealing and breaking into the rooms of people on campus. Campus safety and the school don't really do much in the way of helping. There are only 2 blue lights on campus, do they work? Who knows. Will campus safety come if you press it? Maybe. As far as I know however, secxual assult accuring on campus isn't an issue or a great concern of the student body on campus."
College Freshman,2,"A lot of people drink with a couple of friends and play loud music in their rooms on Thursday nights. That is the extent partying on campus goes. If you want to go to real parties and dance, taking the train to Resevoir and walking to BC is your best bet."
College Junior,2,There is no party life!
College Sophomore,2,"Such a Hassle. The process isn't really that difficult, but they don't give you that much financial assistance. There's always financial aid staff to talk to, but they don't do to much to help you be able to afford college."
College Sophomore,2,The computers are really outdated and old. The school isn't really advanced at all when it comes to computers and technology.
College Sophomore,2,"A Small School – Pine Manor College is a school filled with women who are primarily looked at as minorities in society, but here they are the majority. As a black woman, I enjoy being surrounded by all types of ethnic backgrounds, cultures, religions, etc. I do not receive that at this school."
College Sophomore,2,"Apartments Are Expensive – the aparments in boston are very expensive, it is better if you get a roomate. the transportation is very good"
Freshman,1,I rarely like it here at this college. This school doesn't have my major but I must admit the people there are cool and friendly. I would like to see everything change about this school.
Freshman,1," Pine Manor College is struggling financially, so they will accept anyone. Most of the student body doesn't value their education at all. There is very limited work ethic. There is a handful of students who show up to class and participate, but they are very rare to find.Students who attend class once a week do not focus and are dreadful to have in class. They usually are found texting because they think that's suitable for a college student/young adult. Most of the teachers have given up on the students so they refuse to challenge them at all, fearful that the success rate will decline. This school may offer you a good financial aid package, but I strongly discourage you to attend it. There is a fair share of physical assault, stealing, and intolerance. I really discourage you to attend if you're an international student. Most of the Americans have some sense of superiority and will mock your culture."
College Sophomore,1,"The curriculum is not challenging at all. The teachers will barely punish you for poor attendance, which bothers me since I show up to class most of the time. You basically get a 100% if you turn your work in on time, but they'll drop it down to an 80% if they see that you couldn't care less. It is really easy to get an A. The teachers just want you to do well so they just give you a good grade rather than giving you the tools to learn on your own. I can't blame them entirely, since most of the students don't take their academics seriously and think this is still high school. The workload is really manageable, which is cool. The most popular study areas are of course, include psychology, but also business and biology. The biology class was actually really challenging."
College Freshman,1,There has been a fight on campus that involved a girl getting punched by a boy. There has also been stealing and I myself heard stories about girls getting abused by their boyfriends. My friends have been harassed by some boys because they weren't straight. Campus safety does an awful job at protecting the students and incidents are rather hush hush. A boy has told me that rape isn't serious. This school accepts the most awful people.
College Freshman,1,"The athletics board only cares about the boys' team, which is ironic because the school used to be all girls. The misogyny is very apparent to me, especially when hearing how faculty and athletic staff talks about how bad the female teams are. The recruiting staff puts much effort into the boys' teams, but definitely not the women's teams, which explains our awful records."
College Freshman,1,"The classes are way too easy; not challenging at all. The teachers let the students get away with lazy effort. Waste of money. Do not attend this school! I came here for athletics because I knew that I would get good playing time. Completely regretted my decision. The school does not care for the women's teams' successes, which seems very misogynistic and ironic, considering it used to be an all girls' school. This school has the lowest standards when admitting its students. Many are rude and ignorant. The school is so desperate to gain profit that it will accept anybody. If you want challenging academics, good facilities, and a great environment, you definitely should not come here."
College Freshman,1,"Most people here aren't the brightest. Or, if you're American and not from their country of orgin, they aren't interested in speaking with you. The only guys on campus at this point (since the school is so small) are loud basketball players who care about nothing else but basketball."
College Freshman,1,"Overall, I am so sad that I wasted all of this time, money and effort. Do not let the admissions counselors sweet talk you in. This school has an awful retention rate, everyone leaves once they see what's really going on. The money they give isn't worth the kind of experience you'll have."
College Freshman,1,"There are sports teams, and I would say most students are involved in some kind of sport. BUT, none of the men's teams are in the league, the women's teams are awful and often get crushed at games. Unless you are on the team, or dating someone who is, nymo one really pays attention.

The gym was recently renovated. But it's hard to tell. The court looks like a highschool gym, with only one side for bleachers. The weight room is awful. All of the workout equipment is very outdated. The treadmills have giant dents in them."
College Freshman,1,The only issue they have is people smoking pot in front of the dorms. Otherwise campus safety is utterly useless. They never answer the emergency or normal number. Good luck trying to figure out what the normal number is because it is no where on the school website or the pamphlet given to students at the beginning of the semester. All of the gaurds are mostly young men and women in their early 20's with bad attitudes.
College Freshman,1,"The food is 8/10 awful. At first, in August and the first half of September the food is decent. There is variety. But as the year progresses, everything gets worse. You will be surviving off of pizza, fries and bagels because everything else is either 

undercooked

overcooked 

or undesireable. 

The vegetables are either dried out, rotten or overcooked. If you're a vegetarian the only options for you are limp lettuce and cubes of firm tofu thrown on rice. And I'm truly sorry if you are non-meat eater. There is very rarely fish, and if there is it is small and thin. 

There a fruit flies and bugs EVERYWHERE. If you come to visit this school for an event, you'll get a pretty decent meal; know that is not what you'll be eating if you attend here."
College Freshman,1,"Living on campus at Pine Manor has made me reconsider whether or not I should be in college at all. 

I got a roommate that had beat the crap out of her roommate from last semester had to be briefly moved from the campus. Which, is cool (not). The bathrooms are disgusting. The tiles are lifting, there is a lot of mold and our school does a crap job of making sure the cleaning staff is paid so sometimes no one comes to clean for weeks. The common rooms, or as we call them, the ""pits"" are as appeasing as they sound. Dirty, moldy, various stains, rarely vaccumed. RA's are never around, so if you need some guidance, you're on your own. All winter all of the rooms, hallways and pits were leaking water. Provided, this past winter was a very hard one, but the buildings need to be renovated to hold SOME kind of integrity. The water was pouring from the ceiling like it was raining inside. The school had to pay for the damages of peoples things. Because I'm sure that cost a few arms and legs, do not expect to have wonderful accomodations for fall 2015. 

The social life here sucks. Everyone, regardless of age, is pretty immature. So unless that's the kind of corwd you can have fun with, you will proabably be spending a lot of time here by yourself. There aren't really parties (at least not anymore). It's usually 4 or 5 people getting drunk in someones room and putting it on snapchat. There was a very big party in November that ended with a bunch of police cars, a bottle over one kids head and 3 or 4 young women arrested. PArties have all but ceased since this incident. 

Speaking of incidents, in October the were a mild thunderstorm where the power went out. Without the power, anyone had access into any of the dorm buildings. Thousands of dollars of belongings and credit cards were stolen from the international students. The 2 of the 3 young men who took part in robbing those Chinese students were brought back to the  over winter break to be on the basketball team"
College Junior,1,Do not provide off campus housing.
College Sophomore,1,"Greek, What? The only thing that's Greek around this class are a few students/professors and classes that have ""Greek"" in their name."
College Sophomore,1,well in the Dorms student are not allowed to have more than 1 overnight guests and nobody can have parties at Pine Manor

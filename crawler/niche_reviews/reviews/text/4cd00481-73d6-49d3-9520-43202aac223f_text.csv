Sophomore,5,Alcorn State University is overall a great school. The students and faculty there are one big family.
Alum,5,"A family atmosphere where you learn more than academics.
You create life long friends and learn about life's ups and downs and how to cope.
Beautiful campus and amazing people who truly care about each other."
Alum,5,"I  am originally from California and my father is a born and raised Mississippi boy. I  attended Alcorn for a new life changing experience and to be experience my fathers home state. It was a culture shock at first, Mississippi has a totally different economy and scenery.  It was definitely a challenge since I went back to on campus living at the age of 25.  Although, has changed my life forever. Alcorn taught me patience, peace, grace, discipline,  how to save money, etc. It taught me grace because I  got to experience living in a low class town of poverty, but it was probably the most humble experience I've had.  The people were lovely, we started off as friends and now I  consider them family.  The Southern life is full of people that are open to embrace others and teach outsiders their history.  Even though I experienced some hardship on my journey, it was all well worth it.  I am a better person than when I left California & I have Alcorn to thank for that!"
Alum,5,"I took most in person/hybrid classes. A few online classes I attended and online is probably a little harder than in person classes due to the fact that you have to be disciplined to stay on track of everything.  Teachers were very attentive with their students and I couldn't be more grateful.  I worked a part time job 20-30 hrs a week while in school full time each semester.  I could have easily slipped up on my studies, but I didn't. Teachers were also always willing to meet up with me if I  had any extra concerns or questions regarding coursework.  I am grateful!"
Junior,5,Teachers make sure students have everything they need. Teachers filfull every lesson in a proper manner. The communication skills are good.
Junior,5,"The teachers are always readily available. They understand when people are having problems, and they try to use their resources to resolve the issue. The communication skills are up to par."
Graduate Student,5,"I only
Moved on campus to to avoid the online aspect but after the pandemic of COVID 19, I had no choice but to move back home and complete all 3 courses online. It worked out well, I completed wi th all A’s in my courses."
Freshman,5,I love my HBCU! It has been an awesome experience thus far!  It has been an honor to be a part of a great institution of higher learning!
Sophomore,5,"First I would like to say, I love Alcorn State University. It's the perfect school for me. It closes to home and has all the sources I need. I love the biology and chemistry department because we have a lot of organizations and activities to help bring us together as a family. The professor are very nice and helpful. They work very hard to help us learn. Alcorn has a lot of places to go to if you need any help and/or resources. The school had different labs such as the writing center and math where you can get help for English classes and math classes. There are multiple computer labs to go to if you are in need of the internet and a computer. There are many organizations to join. There are different events that occur that promote diversity. Alcorn has many sports for all students. Alcorn also have many jobs for all students to apply for.  Alcorn is a really great school and I'm so happy to be there."
Niche User,5,I love Alcorn State University! It was the best experience I ever had on a college It’s very relaxing and motivating
Junior,5,"Best school to attend. I stopped going but I’m trying to get back in so I can finish my degree. 
The type of person that should attend this school is any person that is dedicated and motivated to get a great, quality education, but most importantly it is the family environment Alcorn State University has to offer that should attract a person to attend my college. We have a warm community-based environment and can count on one another through every day. I believe as a student attending college that is the most important thing to have as one makes the transition from high school or a community college to a four year university. Choose Alcorn u can’t go wrong."
Sophomore,5,These two years that I have been at Alcorn has been great. The school environment is different from others. The students have to make the campus fun because we are about an hour away from food places and more. So we have to get together and plan stuff so we can enjoy our campus. Not only do we have fun there but we also take academics to another level. Students can get help from anybody on campus. We love to see each other succeed and do good in school. I like Alcorn State Unversity so much because because when it comes to the students we come together like one big happy family. The football games really brings us together because we love to see the our favorite SWAC football team and band out their on the field and in the stands. The only change I would make to Alcorn State University is by getting people the letter saying they have been accepted more faster because some people get their letter late and they decide to go to another school.
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed the campus when I came to visit. The campus was so lovely and beautiful. All of the students had books and looked as if they were ready to hit the books.
Niche User,5,"Alcorn State is so welcoming. I feel great energy when I step on the campus of Alcorn. I love that people always have good things to say about Alcorn State, especially about their Nursing Program. They influence me more and more everyday to attend Alcorn State University. Brave Nation!"
Alum,5,"I absolutely LOVE my HBCU. I was able to meet some of the most amazing people and my professors were astounding. Everyone tried to help in ANY way possible. Every teacher was available and everyone is understanding. The air is cleaner, the water is sweeter, and the grass is definitely greener."
Junior,5,"Having a great experience, love this school and the community here. There is a lot of school spirit and everyone is warming."
Freshman,5,"At first I don't know how my first college experience was going to go,but as I got to know the campus and my classmate  my experience turned out to be great."
Sophomore,5,"Even though it’s in the country, it wasn't all that bad. It gives you a chance to figure yourself out and learn about yourself. My overall experience was great I had a blast my freshman year! The students, facility/staff, and alumni really take pride in their school!!"
Sophomore,5,I love the professions and the way the classes are setup. Also the living conditions are very good.The food is amazing as well.
Junior,5,"This school overall is a excellent choice. Everything about this school  is wonderful, the professors care and will help in anyway  necessary."

Niche User,5,I have never attened ASU but i have heard that the academics are very succesful. I have also heard they they have a great nursing and agriculture program.
Sophomore,5,"Alcorn is a family oriented school that makes you feel at home the minute you step on campus. Fresh and friendly faces, beautiful dormitories, mouth watering cafe with high end foods.. Although the school is in the country, it definitely has that Southern hospitality vibe to it. Alcorn has the number one nursing program along with other top ranking programs in the South."

Senior,5,The teaching staff really cares. All of my professors have been knowledgeable and work well with students. It’s a small friendly campus. Beautiful scenery!
Junior,5,I love every single thing about Alcorn State University. I been apart of this institution for 3 years now. But I will say that during my time here I've learned to make the absolute best if what I have and it has paid off so far. A change is like to see at AUS is student parking.
Sophomore,5,My experience was excellent everything I expected at a HBCU school. This is the best college to attend. The only thing I would change is bring more restaurants on campus.
Junior,5,Alcorn has been a great experience because the environment is like home. It feels like family because of the small campus size. The faculty and staff are always ready to help and guide you.
Junior,5,I love Alcorn State Unversity. All the staff is so wonderful. I would recommend anybody that want to learn and be loved at Alcorn.
Freshman,5,I like the education I got there and that I could explore my heritage of begin black with other people. My grandparents went there and I am glad to follow in their footsteps.
Junior,5,My experience with Alcorn State has gotten better since attending. I've gained a lot and learned a lot the time that have been attending.

I would recommend others to attend Alcorn to get the learning experience that I have endured and to get the education that is entitled to you from experienced professors.
Niche User,5,I would love to go to alcorn the experience was the fun i had going to any other college i have been to i would like to be accepted into the college when i graduate high school.
Senior,5,The school itself it’s just a wonderful environment. The atmosphere has a warm welcoming feeling. All students are friendly and easy to get along with. There is no one left behind at this great institution.
Alum,5,I loved every moment on campus. I would urge anyone considering Alcorn a state to Ben involved on campus in some way. I was apart of the Sounds of Dyn-O-mite marching and I don't regret a single moment. The campus is beautifully landscaped and even though it's far in the woods there still so much to do on campus!
Alum,5,"Alcorn was a great school, they welcomed me with open arms and treated me like a family. I also had a chance to be a part of a championship football team."
Junior,5,"I have been going to Alcorn State University off and on since 2010.  The staff is really nice,and they do a good job to help you in any way they can.  Even though it's a big campus everything is in walking distance, food,classes, library ,etc.  All of my family has graduated from Alcorn State University from my grandmother all the way down to my sisters and brothers.   The only thing that I would like to see different is more classes offered online.  In today's world we sometimes struggle to find that balance between work and commuting  to school.  Having classes online makes it so much convenient."
Freshman,5,Great school love the campus.  I chose Alcorn because of the excellent nursing school and I have always wanted to go to a HBU university

Recent Alumnus,5,I am actually a Greek member. I am a member of Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity Inc at Alcorn State Universty and we do ally on our campus and community. We reach out to others and several schools and remain positive. People on campus look up and admire the work and service we do
Recent Alumnus,5,My school is great learning environment and great place to be at
College Student,5,I feel very safe on campus because the guards do their job.
College Student,5,The professors teaches were everything is understandable. Everything is very organized.
College Freshman,5,We have 3 dis at the school which are very nice and travel to every event and make things better

College Freshman,5,"It is very easy and flexible. I get done with classes before 11, eat, workout, do work and still have time to do anything happening on campus"
College Freshman,5,"We have campus police around all day 24/7 out watching and also cameras and safety tolls if we need any help by our dorms, are police office is open 24/7  if anyone needs to call"
College Freshman,5,Alcorn is known for it back to back swac championship! Whenever ALCORN plays anywhere be prepared for a nice crowd of purple and gold.
College Freshman,5,Alcorn is the best school ever. I wouldn't transfer to any other school. Although we may not have as many options far as buildings it is still a great school. I am so comfortable here and it feel as if I am home here at Alcorn. Let's Go Braves!
College Student,5,I love my campus housing. I sometimes forget that I'm there temporarily for school.
College Sophomore,5,Alcorn Police are always protecting the students.
College Sophomore,5,My overall experience here at Alcorn State University is highly recommended to every student.
College Sophomore,5,Alcorn State University student career prospects are aware of the degree. So that when the students graduate he or she will find the right job.
College Sophomore,5,Alcorn State University athletics are always hype and enthuse whether it be the Football Team and the Cheer Team. By me personally knowing this is; I have seen and observed so much excitement. Alcorn Football Team has won two championship trophys Back to Back 2014 and 2015.
College Sophomore,5,"Being part of an Historical Black College, is what I dream of my whole life, so much to learn about this prestigious college. I love my HBCU. Alcorn is define to be one of the best HBCU so many great legacy has came from here Steve McNair,  Michael Clarke Duncan and Medgar Evers. As I continously to press forward in my learning. I will always keep Beneath the shade of giant trees in mind."
Alum,4,I really didn't have an online learning experience.  I attended on campus and had in-person classes.
Alum,4,I didn't feel I received enough preparation from Advisors or my teachers.  I definitely don't remember a whole lot from the program I was involved in.
Sophomore,4,My online experience was great. I could email my professors when I needed to get help with assignments. I could also message my peers to ask questions about assignments too.
Graduate Student,4,"I enjoyed attending Alcorn State University, the campus was spacious, beautiful scenery and the students and professors were friendly. I would recommend Alcorn to others to attend."
Freshman,4,"I had a fun freshman year, I wish I could’ve experienced the Spring part of it. This pandemic crushed everything. I went home for spring break. I never knew that I was going to stay home for the remainder of the year. Everything was just getting started in the spring. Fall showed me we all care for each other as family and in a matter of time, we all became closer even with some sad tragedies. Cafe is great, and the parties are fun. It was a great experience and I pray that Fall 2020 is even better."
Freshman,4,Alcorn State University has the best professors and very easy to apply and they have rolling admissions.
Junior,4,I love that alcorn has a family environment. If I could change one thing it would be the customer service through administrations to the students.
Junior,4,I like Alcorn's atmosphere and classes. One thing I would change is faster service in the financial aid office. There are many students here that are doing it by themselves and need extra help with it.
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love my university! The atmosphere and people are very warm and welcoming. Classroom sizes are fairly small which makes the student/teacher relationship more intimate. It's a small campus which makes the student body much closer than others. Football, Sounds of Dynomite (the band), tailgating, homecoming, and Greek life are all big aspects of life at Alcorn. Ultimately, Alcorn State University is a true HBCU experience and I honestly believe I made the best decision by attending this institution."
Niche User,4,"When I first visited the campus it was the Annual High School Day, so it was a great time for me to see the student life and school spirit that the University has to offer. The only con about this visit is that I wasn’t able to also see the educational benefits that are available. Then, I decided to schedule another visit to get a better look at the academic programs. This personalized tour gave me the opportunity to see that this is a college I can see myself at and still feel at home."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy being in college because I can make my own decisions without anyone’s opinion or comments. I can effectively manage my time and responsibilities. And also, having responsibilities to achieve everyday. I spend time with my friends and do my work at the same time. We find ways to keep ourselves entertained and busy but we enjoy having a little fun every once in a while. I would like for us to have more activities and associations on campus as well such as movies, swimming, and bowling but HBCU’s doesn’t contain the most profits. I wish people will give back more to HBCU’s because black excellence is going in style."
Niche User,4,"Alcorn State University has a great family environment and inclusive atmosphere.  The Alcorn Braves are  very school spirited and have a variety of on-campus activities for students to be involved in. The sports program is phenomenal and the HBCU atmosphere is amazing. Students will love seeing all different typed of organizations including SGA, fraternities,sororities, and other student success oriented clubs. Alcorn is a great choice for any student wanting to have a great academic experience"
Junior,4,"The campus is isolated which is good to keep students where they belong. However, the basic needs have tobe met and the nearest resources os 15-25 miles away. There is a need for shuttle service for outside providers in mental and physical health. Shuttle service for basic neccessities and toiletries required to survice college life."
Freshman,4,I like that it is a HBCU that really does alot with the students and encourages us but what can really change is the financial aid going up for low income students who cant afford college. I dont want to pay loans back all my life
Senior,4,"Being a student at Alcorn is no walk in the park but it is definitely a place that builds character and if you are open, it can help you grow."
Freshman,4,alcorn state university is very culture school easy to get along with people an get to know them football games are live parties are ok could b better getting around if a little hard us less  you have a car thing that could be better is revel bathrooms them thing are disgusting 3rd floor the best but still be nasty that should be improve
Alum,4,Alcorn is a good school and has a great environment for studies.  It is continuously growing and improvement to the campus is a plus.
Senior,4,"Overall, I like the fact that Alcorn State University is a relatively small school,and that I don't have to worry about any burglars or robbers much. The people here can be pretty cool to hang around, and most of them always speak. However, I wish that we had more extracurricular activities to do such as skating,playing poker,etc."
Junior,4,Alcorn State University Is A Great School To Attend! Great location with and beautiful campus. Its very home feeling and the people are great. When I first got there I knew thats where I wanted to be. Campus lifeis awsome. I wouldnt trade my experience for the world. Also it made me a better person in so many ways. Especially becoming an adult.
Freshman,4,"Do you like learning but with space? I'm talking acres students! Well then Alcorn is the college for you. Learning doesn't stop in the classrooms, it floats like a butterfly on campus. Everything is essential. Students, professors, and the staff work together to help recreate everyone's obstacles, so that they may have a broader path to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"I love it here on campus. It is very peaceful and quite. Everyone is very friendly! campus is an advrage size campus, its not to big or to small ,but it is in the middle of no where. but do not let that discourage you we have fun on our reservation. "
College Junior,4,"This school is overall a great school. Improvements can be made in certain departments, such as the financial aid department."
College Freshman,4,"I really love this school. Even though many people are quick to say ""Alcorn is small and it's in the middle of nowhere, how could you possibly learn anything"" I strongly disagree. if you are a person who loves small class rooms, down to earth students, and fun weekends this is really the place for you. The only downfall that I would say that Alcorn has is the Financial aid department because they are extremelyyyy slow!"
College Sophomore,4,There is always some sort of health and safety display for students to be informed.
College Sophomore,4,I believe that the Greeks on campus bring about positivity.
College Sophomore,4,"Our football team has won the SWAC championship two years in a row, and I had the pleasure of being a cheerleader this past season. The amount of support they receive is unparalleled."
Recent Alumnus,4,I have had great experiences with my professors
Recent Alumnus,4,It's value means a lot especially coming from an HBCU
Recent Alumnus,4,Campus life is good because everyone interacts with one another
College Freshman,4,The classes are a good size and easy to focus in. We have good professors that know the material they teach.
College Freshman,4,"In my area of study I have a lot of access to different internships, and I know once I get a degree in this area that I will be guaranteed a job."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is also a big part of the school. At almost every function you will see them, they are very active when it comes to participating in different functions."
College Freshman,4,"A lot of focus at my school goes to athletics, mainly the football team. Our football team are the SWAC champions. We have awesome school spirit, and our team performance it great."
College Freshman,4,"Despite that fact that Alcorn State is in the middle of nowhere, the school is very family like. Everyone always make sure to look after one another and make sure each other is safe. If I could do it all over it again, yes, I would without a doubt come back to Alcorn State University. Its very different from living in the city, but once you get used to it, it won't be an issue."
College Student,4,Everyone I have seen that participate in sports is dedicated and seems like they love it.
College Freshman,4,The teacher are relaxed and willing to help in anyway. Also have many different fiacilities to help with work like the writing and math center. Need help in chemistry or any science we have study session and groups during the week to help out.
College Freshman,4,"Greek life at ALCORN is amazing! It starts with the probates, to the stepping in the cafe, to stepping at games and after parties!"
College Freshman,4,"The school is more interesting because we are in the middle of no where. We become a unity and have actual gathering and events to attend as an ASU Family. ALCORN is a well structured university with its many supporters such as Greeks, Alumini, Professors, Students, and neighbors of the Mississippi area work much wonders on the campus!"
College Freshman,4,The Greek life is pretty big here at Alcorn. But the people that are part of the Greek life doesn't treat the non Greek people any different than their sisters and brothers. The Greek life makes campus so much fun. They are always having things for the non Greeks to enjoy and participant in. The Greek life is pretty cool if you ask me.
College Freshman,4,"Alcorn has a great football team. Softball, basketball, and baseball needs a little more although they are good I feel like they can be better! We have a pretty good golf team here at Alcorn. I don't really know much about the soccer team."
College Student,4,The athletic programs here are wonderful. For this to be an HBCU it s great.
College Student,4,What I love about Alcorn State University is that the professors put a lot of focus into our futures and ensure that we become successful.
College Freshman,4,"Compromises of our safety on campus is rare and is usually made known to the campus community by email. There may have been late night robberies if persons walk alone, however, no detrimental issue has taken place in the past few years. Campus is relatively safe. All are required to use caution and common sense when travelling around, however. Who wouldn't?  It's a smart thing to do."
College Freshman,4,Employers come around campus quite regularly to advertise and recruit. The prospects of getting a job are moderately high. Alcorn is the place to be.
College Freshman,4,There has bee no conflict. Professors are lenient and courses are offered from a variety of majors. Classed hold no more than 20 students making then more personal and interactive.
College Freshman,4,"The faculty, staff and student body are accommodating and the environment is conducive to learning."
College Sophomore,4,I see Greek life here at Alcorn State University doing great things for the community.
College Freshman,4,if you want to do greek life all of the fraternities and sororities are here on the campus
College Freshman,4,"if you love sports come here to alcorn state university, where we are BACK to BACK SWAC champions"
College Senior,4,We love each other at Alcorn
College Senior,4,They always have intreships an the alumni visit all the time.
College Sophomore,4,I am really enjoying it so far
College Junior,4,"Professors are helpful. You need to discipline yourself and figure out ways to study. I usually study in the library, my room, or with classmates. The registration process is a bit long, though."
College Junior,4,Teachers are really passionate about teaching. Just be on time and be prepared for class. The teachers will try their best to make sure you don't fail.
College Junior,4,"The best option is the new dorms (Medgar Evers). You'd see a lot of socializing in the parking lot, and it's nice inside. But it's also furthest from the classes. Every other dorm is closer to classes, but a little older."
College Freshman,4,The professors care just as much effort you put in. Don't try to give them a hard time and you'll be fine. The registration process is okay. call the school before you show up to make sure everything is lined up right.
College Freshman,4,The value of a degree from Alcorn State is very convenient. There are tons of chances to get internships or help out nearby schools to get experience with your degree field.
College Freshman,4,"The courses are easy to pass as long as you are getting your homework done. I make better grades At Alcorn State University than I make anywhere else. I used to never think College was for me and I was scared when College had begun. but when I came to Alcorn I noticed that the class sizes were more small. This gave me a upper hand with getting help and understanding the subjects we went over in class. The professors can be great but ask about the professors from the upper class men to get help on which professors are recommended. My favorite part of being an Alcornite is being involved with the Band, Sounds of Dynomite."
College Freshman,4,If your up for being hazed or a daredevil  there should be no problem joining the fraternities and sororities.
College Freshman,4,Alcorn State University definitley lives up to it's school standards while being very convenient to out of state students who apply to pursue their education becoming a Alcornite with no out of state tuition fees.
Freshman,2,Online classes could’ve been better. Teachers need to explain things more and respond to students in a timely manner. Some professors didn’t even really give work to bring up grades or anything.
Junior,2,"Since transferring over from Hinds Community College, the transition has been mediocre at best. Alcorn has a lot of pros don't get me wrong, but has just as many cons if not more. Lets's start with the pros first; the classroom settings aren't like your traditional universities. 
     Another pro would be the campus food. I come from New Orleans, LA and I know good when I see it and taste it. Of course, on some days there are some hiccups, but overall the food is pretty decent.
   Now on to what makes this school terrible. For starters, some of the faculty members are the rudest people I've ever met. Now granted There are some people here that actually do their job, however, they are over shadowed by the other's laziness.  And Lets talk about the damn wifi here. How are you a university in 2018, but your still running on bell south speeds? The wifi works when it wants to which makes it a lot more difficult to perform task for the school."
College Freshman,2,"The shower stalls in Burrus Hall might as well be replaced to be honest. Not trying to be rude but although some of the girls could pull through and not leave pads in the showers the shower stalls have rust, mold, and not all the drains work which means someone else's showering water seeps over to your side which is nasty and unhygenic."
College Freshman,2,Football is the only thing that matters and the players are mostly full of themselves. There is no drug or alcohol testing and the facilities are only available to major sports
College Freshman,2,There is nothing around. We are legitimately in the middle of nowhere.
College Freshman,2,There is nothing close so it is not possible
College Freshman,2,"I currently stay in honors. We ha many things prided hat have yet to be followed through on. For instance, we do not have wifi and the showers - which were supposed to be finished over the summer- have yet to be starte on reconstruction."
College Freshman,2,The police do a very poor job of making us feel safe. I can't even walk to the cafeteria at night without a fear that I might get jumped or raped or shot.
College Freshman,2,"It was a complete run-around. People would send me to other people so they didn't have to deal with me, these people never had the answers I needed and just lead me back to the original people."
College Junior,2,I honestly do not know if i have any financial aid from the school. I know I need more scholarships so I can afford more books and pay my fees. This school is frustrating when it comes to scholarships and handling money.
Recent Alumnus,2,It is a hassle receive financial aid along with trying to manage class.
Recent Alumnus,2,There are very few clubs to choose from without traveling a great distance from the campus.
College Senior,2,Greek life is boring. They're all a bunch of followers. if one greek does something then the other will do the same but only certain times of the year.
College Senior,2,The campus police do not stop crime they mainly participate in it.
College Senior,2,"everything is remote, there is nothing close off campus to do unless you find something in the next city over. there are no attractions, fun, sports,"
College Sophomore,2,"Get scholarships somewhere else, their's dont do much"
College Sophomore,2,It's hard to trust anyone including campus police
College Sophomore,2,"There's not much, and one may spend 100s on food"
Recent Alumnus,2,"You basically have to have your scholarship(s) on-hand prior to the first day of registration on campus. People have been turned back around to go home because of no financial aid on the first day. There needs to be more financial aid (grants, scholarships, paid internships) for EVERY student, and not loans."
Recent Alumnus,2,Transportation is like never around.
College Sophomore,2,i need help financially or i have to go back home and i don't want that.
College Sophomore,2,their is really no diversity
College Sophomore,2,they don't enforce the rules like they should
College Sophomore,2,their is really nothing to do here
College Sophomore,2,it could be better and the students could be better too
College Sophomore,2,we are in the middle of no where their is no place to go and their is not enough stuff on campus
College Senior,2,"THEY love to tow and write tickets!!! follow all the parking rules if you know them. if you question your tickets, go talk to the dept asap they will work with you. The parking is horrible. you are limited to where you can park. "
College Freshman,2,it is best to bring a bike for some reason it would be better with transportation. 
College Freshman,2,"Financial was really a hassle and a headache and if you dont do it on time it will get even worse had a hard time my freshman year but its trying to get better
"
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many scholarships a student can apply for. Scholarships are mostly available to athletes and band members.
College Junior,2,"There has been a recent slew of thefts mostly relating to carelessness, but campus security is minimal. There are gaurds at the gate but dont expect them to prevent too many tresspassers"
College Junior,2,"I am an Accounting major at Alcorn State, and I would have to say that I am not too pleased with the education I am receiving.. for a lack of a better phrase. I feel as if the teachers are lazy and are just trying to get through the material that they are supposed to get through without trying to actually teach the material. However, I find that the further along in my courses I go, the more the teachers are trying to teach."
College Junior,2,"Although Alcorn is surrounded by plenty of beautiful land, it is literally in the middle of nowhere. Wal*Mart and all fast food places are about 30 minutes away, so it is hard fulfill your hunger needs late at night. The local community is usually very welcoming, but if you're not used to the ""rural"" areas, then it looks farely run down and not modern."
College Freshman,2,"The off campus housing are not furnished, but the rent is cheap."
College Sophomore,2,there not much at Vicksburg has to offer but at least you can get what you need from walmart and plases like that
College Junior,2,"There are just five places you can eat at other than the cafateria. I would only recomand three. The three that has not made me sick after eating it is Starbucks,Wing Stop, and CJs. These places have a good verity of food and has a clean resturant."
College Senior,2,"I received enough financial aid, but it was not easy speaking with staff. Registration was almost over before I was awarded funds."
College Senior,2,They are slowly improving dorms and other facilities on-campus. There is still room for improvement.
College Junior,2,Off-campus housing is nothing to die for. There aren't any student apartments provided by the school. The only sources of living outside of the dorms are beat up trailors that are majority owned by people who work for the institution.
College Junior,2,The club is only ever open when fraternities or sororities are throwing parties or the football team wins a game. The house parties are nice though and they are free as well.
Niche User,1,"If you are black then this is the school for you!  If you are white, don't even entertain the thought! Very prejudiced and you will fail, my niece failed her last test and missed graduation by 1/2 point!! Horrible place, run run run!!"
Recent Alumnus,1,You are not expected to do very much to earn a decent grade. Teachers are lazy.
Recent Alumnus,1,I would give the school at two. It is an embarrassment.
Recent Alumnus,1,"After attending for colleges I have come to the conclusion that this school is terrible. The teachers are under qualified and unprofessional.   All employed with the exception of a handful, have an entitled attitude and are lazy. In all of my classes but tWo,  much effort was not required and there was not much room for learning."
Recent Alumnus,1,Entitled and under qualified teachers. Terrible administrative staff.
College Freshman,1,There is a total of one place to eat off campus. And that's if you walk 25 minutes to get there. The food at the offcampus places is not good for you so it is definitely a treat but it's best to make friends with someone who has a car.
College Senior,1,the closest thing you have is Sonic which closes at 9 pm
College Senior,1,No one wants to help you get a place to stay off campus
College Senior,1,there is nothing surrounding the school. nothing but trees and wild animals
College Senior,1,If you are planing to dine out you will need to drive at least 40 minutes or more to nearest restaurant chain. Horrible
College Senior,1,"My financial aid experience was the worst ever. For one, i waited for three hours to be seen by a counselor for them to tell me I do not have enough funds so i will have to leave and come back with different types of forms putting me back at the end of the line and by the time i get seen again it'll be time for them to close and i will have to come back the next day meaning i will also have to get a hotel because i stay far away from the school"
College Sophomore,1,"On Alcorn campus, a female is rarely seen as a human being, and relationships have no honor."
College Sophomore,1,is bad and still going
College Freshman,1,"Every place there is to go for nightlife is far because ASU is in the middle of nowhere.The clubs are subpar and the people typically get sloppy drunk and smoke inside. Underage nightlife is the same as of age nightlife, there are no limits. "
College Freshman,1,"I got accepted to ASU on a full academic scholarship, but I was still made to pay out of state fees. The people at financial aid are slow and incompetent. Students on campus call the process the ""Alcorn Runaround"". No matter how many times you call the office or how many transfers to higher level people you get, it is almost impossible to get your financial aid on time. I did not even get my scholarship funds on time. The financial aid process really needs improving at ASU. "
College Freshman,1,"Anybody who wants to smoke marijuana has the ability. Anybody who wants to drink alcohol has the ability as well. It is too easy for drugs and alcohol to be used and abused. People sit outside on the benches or in the parking lot and drink and smoke as they please. It is very frustrating to me, as a person who neither does drugs or drinks alcohol. The police officers do nothing to really enforce the rules, they only occasionally decide to show off their limited power and detain those who use alcohol and drugs. Peer pressure is inevitable at every school, but at Alcorn it is almost expected for one to participate in the drug scene. It is utterly ridiculous."
College Sophomore,1,I think the employees need to park at the football stadium because they are stationed for eight hours and the students need to park on campus with closer access to the classrooms during each hour class changes.
College Freshman,1,they need to do a lot better because spending all the money on sports that anit no good is a waste of time to me
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is dreadful. There aren't enough parking spots by the brand new dormitories for all of the occupants to park. Or people end up parking so far from their dormitory, they might as well park their car where the class for the next day is. Students must get to the parking lot right after another class ends in order to get a parking spot before their next class."
College Freshman,1,Only a shuttle bus at ASU that hardly every comes around. Most students who don't have cars walk to class.
College Sophomore,1,You must provide basically you own transportation.
College Senior,1,"Most girls received the grade D, from not attending class, most guys as well"
College Junior,1,there isn't enough parking at school and people are constantly fined for parking in places other than parking spaces
College Junior,1,the government issues me the full amount of financial aid but the school took 1000 away from that amount did not fully explain why this was so. then most of my aid was put on a side of my card that I can only use in limited locations
College Junior,1,Lorman Mississippi is a very rural area.  Not a lot of rent houses or apartments are available.
College Sophomore,1,we only have on small shuttle bus and it only runs every thirty minutes. It use to take us to walmart on the weekends for the ones who don't have a car last year but they cut that out. It also stops after 4:30 so if you have night classes you have to walk
College Sophomore,1,It is VERY easy I get involved or get access to the drug scene at Alcorn State University.
College Junior,1,There is no of off campus housing through the school.
College Sophomore,1,the computers work verywell in the computer labs. We have access to wifi in our dorms but the connection is n ot so great unless we go in the study room.
College Senior,1,The diversity is minimum. Most students are African American.
College Junior,1,We are a college off in the middle of the woods at the end of a highway.
College Junior,1,The campus officials are extremely serious about their jobs. Professors conduct class by the book. The absentee percentage is in full effect; no student who does not attend class will pass. The campus police are strict as well. They actually tow cars parked in inappropriate areas.
College Freshman,1,"The city is so country. There is really no attractions or etc here. If you want to go to the mall or something then you have to drive to vicksburg, jackson and Natchez."
College Junior,1,"Nothing to Do – Lorman, Mississippi, is a small town but the atmosphere is very family oriented. Lorman, however, does not have much area attractions, activities, events and shopping malls. The weekends are spent mainly on campus unless you have a car to go home or go out to the nearest recreation areas. The bonus is that you won't spend a lot of money!"
College Senior,1,"Safety on Campus – The safety on the campus is very poor because we do not have enough police officers on the campus, and most of them are not around when you need them. They do have rules for the campus, but the officers do not enforce them well enough. There are speed bumps on the campus, and most people try to dodge them to keep from going through them, and i reported it to the assistant to the president to deliver to him because i almost got hit several times. i made a request for traffic lights, but it would cost the school so much money. Saftey has been one the main issues on our campus"
College Sophomore,1,Campus Life – This is not the best school but overall I love attending this school.
College Sophomore,1,Needs Serious Attention – Parking for students on campus is extremely unacceptable.  You have to make sure you are one of the first ones trying to find an appropriate parking space or you will be highly disappointed!
College Sophomore,1,There are so many students on campus and it is hard to find a parking spot and the campus police are always giving tickets because of this.
College Senior,1,During the day sometimes its hard to find a park before class starts so many students walk which can be a benefit.
College Junior,1,Security at Alcorn – I did not like staying on campus. It was accidents were people where breaking into rooms and stealing peoples personal belongings. The campus police are horrible seems like the only thing they are concerned about is harrassing students about campus decals.

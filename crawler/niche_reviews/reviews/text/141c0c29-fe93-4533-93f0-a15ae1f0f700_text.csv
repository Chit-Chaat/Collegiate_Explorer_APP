Junior,5,The overall learning experience at Fayetteville State University is pretty fair. The professors adjust to your learning needs and offer help whenever available. They don't overload you with too much online work. I am able to work a full time job while also pursuing my intended major.
Sophomore,5,All of my classes are online and I love it. It requires a lot of self-dedication to your student but if they have and are able to focus this would be a great fit for you. I am going to take online classes until I graduate.
Sophomore,5,I like how organized Fayetteville is as well as their communication skills. They provide you will everything you need to know in order to be successful in school. They also have different clubs that you can get involved in that pertained to your major which is really nice.
Senior,5,"Online classes have set expectations with due dates. Work at your own pace but all homework has to be completed on time. All professor are accessible via email or phone. Site has a one stop shop through canvas. You can apply for Financial Aid, view grades, submit papers, pay your tuition, or email advisor.  I've been focused, the last 2 years and only have 7 classes left! I will be graduating in 2021. Financial aid is expired but I will make sure this gets done. I work full time, have a family and home that I need to also prioritize. My online classes make everything I have going on much easier. I hardly sleep, but I have to finish. I want to show my children that it doesn't matter how old you are, education is very important and it should be taken seriously. I will graduate with my bachelors in Business at the age of 43. I'm grateful for the opportunity to be able to take my classes at home."
Senior,5,"I transferred over from Fayetteville Technical Community College. Where I graduated from with my Associate in Business Administration in 2014. I decided to go back to school for my Bachelors in Business 2 years ago. Website is very easy to maneuver, no surprises. I was able to apply, view campus, purchase books, speak to advisor and register for class within a months time frame. I finished FTCC with 178 credit but only 45 were transferred. I've taken most of my classes online except for public speaking and accounting. These classes on campus were at night as I work all day and have a family. Six to nine pm on certain days of the week made this process manageable. At this point I have seven classes left and will graduate in 2021. Financial aid has expired and I have taken loans to continue my education. Advisors are assisting with scholar ship information, in hopes of funding help. Everyone I have been in contact with online or on campus have been great, I have no complaints with FSU."
Sophomore,5,God I love this college so much. It has given me pathways to so many opportunities that’s I’ve never would’ve dreamed of. Most teachers are so friendly and are willing to go out of their way to help you and the counselors are very vocal about how they can help you through your college experience.  One change I wish I could see though is that I wish there were more social networking things on campus
Senior,5,The staff are friendly and helpful. They give a variety of resources to help me to succeed during and after college.
Senior,5,All of my classes are taken online. My professors do a great job with helping provide enough resources to do good in the class. They also have zoom meetings which make class seem live like in person classes

Senior,5,Online platforms were used to maximize the learning taking place in class. The change to online for many courses during the current COVID-19 occurance was smooth.

Alum,5,Majority of the online courses were overall well planned and developed.  Teachers were easy to get in contact with regarding any questions or issues by email.
Sophomore,5,"My experience with Fayetteville State University was amazing but stressful. It was my first year so I wasn't used to doing work on my own. The staff was amazing and the students made it feel like home again. I would only change the activities they had, I wish we had more things to do on campus but I know they try there best with making sure everything is safe. I appreciate the resources they had for students such as therapy for students who was in need, lab/library that was open to reasonable times, along with providing kids money on out student ID cards so we can buy snacks. They have an amazing staff on some teachers that they are really involved in helping students pass. They have an amazing tutoring staff who also help students. A lot of there resources really help students."
Graduate Student,5,"I was hesitant at taking online classes at first but they were honestly very efficient. I didn’t have to get up for class, I just had to finish by my due date. I still learned a lot and got all the information I needed to finish the course."
Graduate Student,5,"Fayetteville State University is a great school. My freshman year I felt like I met a whole new family and grew with them for four years. I was a business major, they had great relevant courses for my major. I wasn’t able to graduate due to COVID-19 but FSU made sure we knew how important we were and made us feel special."
Sophomore,5,"It’s fun to be on campus and while it it is a small campus, it packs a lot fun and engaging activities and many clubs. I like my experience at the college and the people there are supportive of the students."
Sophomore,5,The fact that my classes were switched to online format was a little overwhelming but it got better the more I got used to it. I personally don’t like online learning as I work better in a face to face setting.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Fayetteville State University was very rewarding and a fun experience. Living on campus is a great way to have school resources near you anytime of the day, you get to make new friends, you can eat at the cafeteria anytime, and everyday you meet new people. College has made me take school more serious and I now know what I want to do for my career life. Fayetteville State is very opening and it feels like a big family, the professors are very professional and are they work with you to make sure your'e doing your work and passing. Overall my experience was one I will remember for the rest of my life and I love my HBCU because it makes me feel welcomed."

Sophomore,5,"My experience at Fayetteville State University was great! The professors are great. They want to see you succeed at Fayetteville State University. Student life is fun because Fayetteville State is always looking for new ways to get people involved around campus. For example, even though we are in quarantine they are holding virtual events for students to attend. As far as housing, it could be a little better. The food could he a little better as well. I wish that our campus had other restaurants within it. Sometimes Chick-fil-A, the grill, and the cafe could get a little tiring from eating the same thing over."
Senior,5,"I love Fayetteville State University because it gave me a free space to grow professionally and personally in four years. Fayetteville State University is a HBCU full of tradition and culture, that has developed extremely over the years. Being apart of the Bronco community allows you be become a member of a growing family."
Senior,5,Fayetteville Statue University is a very prestigious university. I am very pleased with my experience there. I love my HBCU!!
Alum,5,"I LOVED being a student at FSU!!! The culture there is unmatched and the experiences were once in a lifetime. A lot of people in STEM worry about being able to compete in the work force after graduating from an HBCU, but I received a quality education from FSU and I felt more than qualified when I entered vet school. During my time at Fayetteville State, I learned invaluable lessons surrounding education, job searching, networking, business and professional apparel, and general life skills. The one thing I think needs improvement is on campus housing. Some of the dorms could use some updates. In all, I would not trade my experience for the world."
Freshman,5,This is my first year at Fayetteville State and I absolutely love it. At FSU you are constantly supported by the professors and staff. Student wise everyone is friendly it’s like a family environment.
Alum,5,"Fayetteville State was a different, but fun environment for me. They made it really easy to be away from home, and had a good balance of academic life, and social life."

Niche User,5,"My experience has been great. I enjoy the environment. I like the food a lot. The Chick fil A, was a great investment."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Fayetteville state university during my freshman year in my first semester was an overall very stressful time for me. My roommate and I had to change dorms due to mold invading our belongings. Minus that issue, I had some good moments and memories during my freshman year attending Fayetteville state university."
Sophomore,5,"I love the fact that we have student resources like the SI, tutors, to help students understand a course better. And every teacher has a office hour, when students can visit with any questions or concern.
I wish the library hours will increased on the weekend, and also they school authorities should stop cancelling an already registered course for students."
Junior,5,"I enjoy the family feeling on the campus. The professors strive to ensure that everyone is learning the material and are properly taught. If there are concerns that you have this is the environment in which encourages you to speak up to receive answers to those questions in which one may have. Many school clubs, and programs are offered to expand your knowledge and understanding as student. I appreciate the schools efforts to provide internships to its students that are wanting to gain experience within their desired field and the school strives to make that a success."
Niche User,5,Its campus is very nice and everyone there is also super nice! Theres no other college i'd want to go to especially since it's in my area
Sophomore,5,I'm rating my college on academics for the overall rating. I feel that the professors and courses of this college have enhanced my desire to become a successful youth psychologist. The dorms and food need a great deal of work. Wireless internet and cellphone reception are horrible.
Senior,5,"Am a transfer student from African and I like the lecture method and hospitality of every professor, willing to help students in every ways to understand power points materials. I also love the grading system of all course in Fayetteville state university which is the standard for all American university."
Alum,5,"I graduated May 2015 in the BSN program. The staff are amazing and are very helpful. The selected students are a very diverse group I graduated with. The program was intense but I felt set up for success. I passed NCLEX on the 1st attempt. I felt like I graduated with more knowledge than skills, but the skills come with getting into the field and repetition. I want to say the price of attending was very reasonable in comparison to the rest of the east coast. I drove 45 minutes one way each day which became the normal. I’d recommend requesting to do your capstone at the hospital you’re looking to get hired into. I felt like practice questions and digging into the big picture from the powerpoints truly were a key to my success. Good luck to everyone starting their journey."
Senior,5,"It the best place for a higher education. Smaller classroom along with individual attention. Dorm rooms are clean and spacious. There is always something exciting to do on campus from team pep rallies, concerts, workshops, inspiration speakers, football  and basketball events. We have a lot of fun to gather at Fayetteville  State University."
Sophomore,5,"I love how welcoming everyone was the first day and how nice they were. It's a really good campus and it feels sort of like a family.  I love the school spirit. One thing I would like to see is more fun, active events on campus."
Junior,5,I had some problems getting transfer classes in and seeing how things worked in my degree plan. Once I got the right advisor things worked so much smoother. I am well on the way to finishing my program.
Niche User,5,"I am an early college student who is enrolled at the university. Although they do not have my major, their professors and academics are really great. A worth while education. 10/10 would recommend enrolling if you have a general major."
Graduate Student,5,"My experience at Fayetteville State University was an incredible experience as a college student. Most of my instructors and my college advisor were concerned about me passing all of my courses and they were making my time there in school was not only educational and challenging, but also easy to manage as a college student. I recommend Fayetteville State University to anyone who is looking to attend college at an affordable tuition rate ."
Freshman,5,It's a very good environment and it makes you feel like your at home. I also like how there are different types of people communicating with each other and how they are extroverts and not introverts. I like being at the basketball games because everyone is having fun and there's no drama which is a good thing.
Sophomore,5,"I have fallen in love with my HBCU! Our family is genuine, tried and truth. I have yet to meet with a counselor, professor, SI, nor our amazing dean that did not strive just as hard as I did in the success of my college career! #BRONCOPRIDE"
Niche User,5,"Went to homecoming, and it was amazing! Going to high School in Fayetteville I've learned about FSU, however I never got the chance to attend college other then precollege. I am so eager to learn at this school."
Senior,5,"Fayetteville State has greatly exceeded my expectations, being a Fayetteville native I automatically disregarded the school because I heard so much about it from others. After attending the university and gaining first hand experience, I can attest that I have grown a fond love for my hbcu! The campus is much more diverse than people assume, almost all students are actively involved in organizations and communities, and there is never a dull moment because the SGA ensures that students voice is heard when it comes to planning events. I would rate Fayetteville State University at a 10 out of 10, overall this institution is well organized, professionally staffed, and academically rewarding; This is one University you don’t want to overlook!"

Sophomore,5,As a first generation student at Fayetteville State University I am very happy to be attending this university. I have advanced in my education and will continue to progress and move forward while attending this university.
Sophomore,5,"I like how Fayetteville State University is a family, nobody is left behind. We all come together and speak to each other, even if we don't know each other.  I also like how the classes are small. it makes me have a bond with my teacher and meet other students. The change I would like to see at Fayetteville State University is more programs at this school and more activities on campus for students. I would also like to see the bookstore being on campus instead of off campus. Some students don't have cars or transportation to get around. It will be a good idea to have that resource on campus."
Junior,5,What I like best is the college is big enough to be known but small enough for my instructors to know my name!  I like the fact that going to FSU has afforded me the chance to play the sport I love while I get a chance to grow and to get a quality education.
Junior,5,"This is my second year here at FSU. Fsu is a great school transferring here was one of the best ideas. I was able to gain knowledge in my Social Work Courses. The campus is very clean. The campus is well protected. The chancellor  is always around helping student and making the university better. The alumni was a very big help, they support fayetteville like no other. Our city our Team."
Junior,5,A great HBCU to go to for sure! I've enjoyed my time there learning these last two years and look forward to completing my degree from here soon.

The professors are really nice, the classes are very well coordinated, the diversity is amazing, the students that attend are friendly and outgoing. This is a college for anyone. The faculty are super nice and will help you with anything you need. Professors are willing to go out of there way to help students succeed.

Junior,5,The atmosphere is different than other schools.  The campus life is fun and there are plenty of activities and organizations to join.
Freshman,5,"I like Fayetteville State University because everyone is a family and they don't leave anyone out. When I went on tours, it really was good to see what's like to live on your own and be around others. What I would like to see change at Fayetteville State University is the Admissions of office could change by helping undergraduates better with applications and letting students know ahead of time what else they need and to know if you have gotten accepted or not."
Senior,5,"I absolutely love my University! The professors are awesome and are dedicated to your success. There are rental programs for your books; the price is included in your tuition. They have on-site tutoring, several cafeterias/ cafe's to choose from, a few computer labs, a pool, gymnasium, and plenty of parking."
Junior,4,"Overall, I think my Fayetteville State University is a pretty good university. Its not your typical HBCU where you see alot of campus and greek life. But I am a commuter student , so I go there only for educational purposes. The food is pretty decent and there are alot of active organizations to join."
Sophomore,4,The University works really well with helpful tools to keep their students engaged and learning. There are many resources available outside of professor office hours that are available to help a student succeed.
Freshman,4,"What I like about Fayetteville State University is its pride and goal for all students to achieve their goals. I first discovered Fayetteville State when I attended Upward Bound Math-Science during my freshman year in high school. Fayetteville State has so much diversity and an expanded variety of meals, games, etc. The only noticeable change that I would like to see is the cleanliness of their restrooms."
Freshman,4,"I haven't taken any classes in Fayetteville State yet, but the online learning experience with Fayetteville State has an engaging learning technique. The fun part about it is that if I choose to take classes online, I can have a flexible schedule to finish all of my academic tasks."
Sophomore,4,"It was alright, even though many professors were still unfamiliar with online teaching they still went out of their way to help their students adjust to their new online classes, which was pretty nice."
Sophomore,4,I was only able to take online classes towards the end of spring semester which turned out to be okay. It wasn't the best but under the circumstances it was doable. I liked how some of my professors was very lenient when it came to assignments and the due dates was manageable. Some classes were better for me to have face to face so I can have a better understand.
Senior,4,Overall Fayetteville State University is a great place to attend college to gain a diverse experience that will evolve students into the right path of careers with knowledge that will lead them to success. I had a great experience and would only change the safety of the campus as well as for its students. Surrounding areas can lead to unsafe environments.
Junior,4,I love the HBCU atmosphere everyone supports one another. I played Two sports and just recently won the CIAA Championship for Volleyball and the support of the entire school and athletic department was unbelievable. This school is a family.
Alum,4,"I loved the close knit, family oriented atmosphere that Fay State has. Peers and Staff members were always looking out for the betterment of you !"
Junior,4,My overall experience at FSU has been great actually. I enjoy the lower number of students because it gives us all a chance to get that one on one time with our professors and other faculty.
Freshman,4,Fayetteville State is a really great school and I plan to spend my whole 4 years here . The only thing that bothers me with FSU Is that they seem to linger behind with information when other school have already answered and solved the problem .

I also like that they host Upward Bound Math-Science for high school students, it helps me to get prepared for the university that I'm applying as well as additional help on multiple subjects. I don't wish to see any changes to FSU, they're keeping up the great work."
Niche User,4,I would say my experience with Fayetteville State University was a great experience. I was able to interact with a variety of people across the campus. The professors help students and actually want you to succeed. They make sure you get the help you need with whatever you need help with. I like how the students are helpful and help one another. It's a great environment to be in. I would not change anything about it.
Works Here,4,"Most people like to bash Fayetteville State University, but this university has came a long way to where it is now. I've grown up on this campus and it has given me so much to start from and I appreciate that. Now I'm not saying that this university is perfect because it definitely has flaws. However, I am grateful for some of the good people here who have given me opportunity to learn and grow. Fayetteville State University has opportunities if you look for them. They may not be the big ones everyone desires, but they give you the support you need to get to that really big opportunity."

Graduate Student,4,The teachers make a genuine effort to make the classroom feel like a family. The small class sizes make it ideal if you want a lot of one-on-one assistance.
Niche User,4,"I go to the early college at Fayetteville State and I get to go to college classes on Fayetteville States campus. The campus is welcoming and a lot of the professors  are understanding. Yes, there are some that are not so understanding, but quite a few are and are willing to help you if you're willing to help yourself."
Niche User,4,I like that the campus isn't too big and the class sizes are small. I feel that these factors are appealing when thinking about attending a college.
Sophomore,4,"As a current student enrolled at Fayetteville State , I can say that my experience so far at this University is overall very good. The campus is a nice size to get acquainted with fellow peers and obtain a great relationship with their professors and faculty members.

Senior,4,"The faculty have all been extremely knowledgeable in their fields and eager to help in any way. 
Sometimes I feel like the institution doesn’t quite have everything figured out, though."
Niche User,4,"I am a Early College student on Fayetteville State University Campus. I also plan on going to Fayetteville State University after I graduate. My experience has been very great, as in my high school experience, mostly because I do experience the college life on the campus as well. What I would like to see changed is how better the professors know and understand Canvas and their students lives. I don’t mean to know their personal background, but, to understand who they are teaching, both high school and college students, and if their lessons are being impacted in a good way to their students. Canvas, because I found that not a lot of the teachers I had were very knowledgeable about something that everyone on campus uses. If they could understand Canvas better and figure out how to put their lessons on Canvas, that would, I believe, have a really good impact."
Freshman,4,"So far as a first time freshman I am elated to be  a bronco till I die. Fayetteville State University (FSU) is what i breathe, sleep, and preach. I love representing my school anywhere I go. I would recommend this school to all who are interested in being in a diverse family and love enjoying life. What FSU can improve on is help bettering our school by making our bathroom waters more heated, get rid of this bugs, and have better food and hospitality when it comes to us living. The people around campus are very friendly and are open to anything. When it comes to volunteering, to get your hours for community service, their is a lot of volunteering options."
Senior,4,Great HBCU. Food needs improvement in the Cafe. The professors are very helpful and really care about your education while attending.
Freshman,4,"It is an HBCU university that has a lot of diversity within students and teachers. The university is small but the classes are very easy as long as you pay attentiion and always turn in your work in time. When you have any questions, the professors always tries their best to help you."
Niche User,4,I just like how professional they are and I intended on attending there as a full-time student as of the Fall of 2019. I have friends that go there and they stay telling me that it is a good school and is very worth your money. I will go to get my bachelors degree in business management and management in information systems if I can.
Sophomore,4,The campus is lively and well kept. The students are very friendly and nice! The professors have good attitudes and make sure you will suceed. The dorm rooms are clean and there’s always RA’s on call to assist you when you need it.
Senior,4,"I love the small ""family-like"", close knit environment provided by FSU, but I would like to see more renovations made to the campus."
Senior,4,My name is Ronnie Woolard; I’m currently a Business Administration student at FSU. I am on track to graduate in Spring 2019! Sense attending FSU SPRING 2018 I've received so much information on how to become a better student as well steps to take to develop and further along my career once I graduate. My advisor make sure that all of her students stay on track with what classes are needed and offered.  FSU makes you feel like family and seems to have the best interest for me. Spring 2019 is my graduate year and I cant wait to use some of the things I've learned at FSU to reach my career goals.
Graduate Student,4,I have enjoyed my experience with FSU and the only thing I would like to see changed is the response time from administration. Response time from professors is amazing!
Senior,4,As a student in high school I've had plentiful opportunities to participate in on Fayetteville State University's campus. I've been exposed to many advisors who work there and provide me with incredible guidance to do great things. I am apart of the Upward Bound program and I like being a member. Leading me to success I am educated almost every Saturday  with SAT/ACT prep with a strong goal to attend college after I graduate high school. I like being able to make friendships with others in the program along with learning and preparing for life. Without the Upward Bound Program Fayetteville State offers to me I wouldn't have gone as far as I have today. I'm proud to say that I am now an Upward Bound Alumni and there's always places to improve but in my opinion I wouldn't change a thing.
Sophomore,4,"Like any other college, Fayetteville State is what you make it. It is a family-friendly oriented university. There are many amazing organizations you can join that helps you socially, academically, or however you decide to take that advantage as. At the time, it was the only school that offered a Forensic Science program, plus it is affordable! It is a small campus so it wasn't hard for me to learn my way around. It actually only took about 3-5 days to know majority of where everything is at. Fayetteville State has some caring staff and peers that help you succeed. There are many resources to take advantage of as well. Overall, Fayetteville State is an excellent university. I am able to maintain good grades, along with having fun and a social life. If I could go back and make a college decision again, I would still choose Fayetteville State. I felt like I was at home the very first visit here."
Sophomore,4,"I love Fayetteville State University.  You're treated like family here. All the faculty and staff here are great at their jobs. Campus involvement is outstanding. We always have each others back. It's also close to home, which I also love. I get to see my family and be close to my academics."
Senior,4,FSU is a great school to attend. The only thing I would change is for them to bring December graduations back for December graduates. I don’t think it’s fair to make them walk with the following year graduates.
Junior,4,Fayetteville State University is a wonderful school with great professors! They are willing to help you any possible way they can that's what I love about my school.
Freshman,4,I am a first time freshman and my experience so far is going great I love the atmosphere here at Fayetteville State University.
Junior,4,FSU is a great school with diverse teachers and students. They have amazing resources for the students to use
Sophomore,4,"As to choosing to be associated with Fayetteville State University, I had several reasons. One reason would be as to how, despite not having strong or efficient SAT Scores or not taking any AP or honors courses in high school, they seen potential in me that other colleges didn't see. It was a boost and motive that definitely gave me drive into wanting to persue something better. The second reason would be the professors on campus. I can't speak for all of the professors, but as to the ones I've had courses with, they expressed passion and enthusiasm that was contagious in inspiring anyone's mind. The third reason choosing Fayetteville State University was how the atmosphere within was not entirley diverse, but showed no judgement as to any individual that steps on campus. It gave me good self esteem that affected me in a positive manner in wanting excel."
Junior,4,"I am a returning adult transfer student working on my bachelors degree 100%online. I have found Fayetteville State University work for my needs. The instructors have been awesome, my Advisor has been very helpful. Only issue I have had is attempting to reach departments by phone . Long wait time sometimes up to a half an hour or no call back . Easier for me to physically drive to campus and talk to someone. Otherwise happy with the experience so far."
Freshman,4,"I’d give my school 4 stars as a first time freshman who just completed my first semester.  I will be returning next semester.  Otherwise I wouldn’t return outside of the “family” like setting they provided great study sessions group or tutors, if I needed it for free. And there are programs you can sign up for if u need more help there are always someone there to give u advice on just about anything and excluding RAs , they will be honest if they don’t know the answer and tell u who might know or get back with u and not just say it like some others schools may do just to get out their face.  professors are different but I hear that they are working on upping there requirements. The ones that I’ve had were and are great !  I’ve learned something from all of them not just on the subject be as a person and a student at heart 🙂 all I can say is Thank you to this HBCU for a chance ...& opportunity"
Sophomore,4,I love the campus! Majority of the professors are willing to help you succeed and the student and staff are pleasant. Some of the buildings and dorms need renovations.
Sophomore,4,I love my HBCU. The school is very family oriented. Full of energy and you're welcomed with open arms. The alumni is great and very involved however I feel there needs to be more events happening on and around campus.
Freshman,4,I like the ROTC program they have. It is rigorous and really helped me on my career decisions. What is also great is the attitudes and behaviors of the professors. They are willing to help you no matter your situation.
Freshman,4,"Next fall I will be an upcoming freshman at Fayetteville State University. There are many reasons why I chose this school but a few of the main reasons would be that Fayetteville State provides a fair and diverse learning environment, FSU has a prestigious ROTC program that I would love  the opportunity to be involved in, and that this fall I have also been offered to play on the FSU football team. Go Bronco's!!"
Sophomore,4,"Fayetteville State University is a great school. They have the #1 nursing program in NC, which is why I decided to attend."
Junior,4,Here at Fayetteville State it's feels like you come to a family reunion. Most of the staff and students are extremely friendly and it feels like a big family. But I would like to see some more improvements on some of the housing areas like UPA. But over all the school is an amazing place to be.
Sophomore,4,"Fayetteville State University is what you make of it. Me personally would like to see a change in the cafe, better food. Also having more events outside, to get people out and mingling. Last, spreading the events that do go on around to all people. This is another reason why people don't come to stuff because they either here about it late or don't check there email or have to hear it through a friend. Getting the information out to others would be a great! Other than that the school is okay academic wise."
Sophomore,4,"The programs are great, but the financial aid could be better. I should have to run around to figure out how to pay for school. It would be easier if they sent out a detailed billing statement that tells you what you were charged for specifically."
Senior,4,"Fayetteville State University has its own kind of charm to it. I enjoyed the smaller classroom sizes. I did, however, have issues almost every semester with the limited number of sections for the classes that I needed. Because of these limitations, the classes that I needed would often conflict with each other."
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at the illustrious Fayetteville State University has been an excellent one. Not only have I created bonds with professors and my fellow peers, I have also grown to have a strong love for my education. I would love to see more student involvement and volunteering."
Senior,4,At Fayetteville State we have so many network connection we can link up with there is never a time  where you will be blinded or do not know what was going on around campus and if there is it is because you did not keep your self informed.
Junior,4,I am liking what I am seeing thus far from Fayetteville State University. So far there isn't really anything in particular that I can say that needs to be different.
Freshman,4,"With FSU being an HBCU, there's not much to say as far as diversity goes. It's a relatively small campus, but I don't mind the size, I actually think it's a perfect fit for me right now. Everyone is so warm and welcoming here, I instantly felt at home. The teachers are great, course work is easy; though, speaking as a Freshman, I know that's bound to change. Campus dining is also great, man, am I in love with the pizza here. After about two weeks, it starts to get monotonous, going to class, going to eat, going to sleep. Because this campus is so small, a lot of the time, you do have to make your own fun. Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone and try something new, depending on what degree you pursue you are here for a minimum of four years, after all. It's really a great school overall."
Sophomore,4,I love Fayetteville State University because it has affordable tuition and meal plans. They also have tutoring sessions when you don't understand a subject as well as an extension grade contract.
Sophomore,4,"It's been a fun experience , met new people. I would change the food in the cafeteria after awhile it gets boring to eat . "
College Freshman,2,The athletics as a whole is very lacking in terms of equipment. Thusly producing not very effective athletes . Our more exceptional athletes have a lot of training outside of what is available to them at school.
College Sophomore,2,They are good st basketball but there football team is trash.
College Senior,2,The city of Fayetteville can do much better at providing opportunities for the students
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is open and accesible 24/7. On the first day of school Fall 2015 a gunman was on campus and we were on lock down. 2014-2015 there were multiple instances where there were caution taped areas on the two streets adjacent to campus. There were murders, people across the street in the apartments were robbed on occasion, many football players and other men raped females and disagreed that it was consentual but according to warning emails about lack of safety, it was not."
College Sophomore,2,People know of the terrible hazing done behind the scenes so most pass on crossing in to a fraternity/ sorority.
College Freshman,2,Some of the buildings looks bad and need to redone.
College Freshman,2,students like to attend the varsity sports games.
College Freshman,2,Financial aid takes forever here. It's like they're always backed up
College Freshman,2,It's The Hardest Thing Ever.
College Freshman,2,"It can be difficult, especially if you're a first time freshman because they insist on sending three or four bills to try and get you to pay them. Then if you call and ask questions about it they act like you have no idea what you're doing or talking about."
College Freshman,2,old building need to be updated and outside grounds needs some curve appearance
College Freshman,2,Not really on campus but on the street next to the campus you always hear the police catching someone.
College Senior,2,I'm not really informed on internships and there are non locally
Recent Alumnus,2,"Since I was not awarded much financial aid, my parents were paying a lot out of pocket or I got loans that I have to pay back now."
College Sophomore,2,The music at the local college night is horrible. The djs don't know how to play music to engage everyone.
College Freshman,2,The wireless internet is horrible. In the dorms you barely get wireless. so it is difficult to complete homework and other assignments
College Freshman,2,I don't like the lack of construction that's NOT fixed in certain places in the dorm.
College Freshman,2,"I'm personally still paying on financial aid, I would like more scholarships..."
College Senior,2,not enough classes are being offered
College Junior,2,Fayetteville needs more attractions and malls and more stores should give discounts to students.
College Sophomore,2,every body here smokes and drinks police try they best just walk accross the street and you good 
College Sophomore,2,If you are trying to come here to party turn right back around they dont tolarate the drinkin on campus bs
College Junior,2,"I've been here a long time so I may be a little bias on my perspective of the college however I believe that the attractions are great if you like clubs and strippers, the safety depends on where you go, the shopping is okay we have a mall, the sports could be better wayy beter, and the local attitude towards students is fine."
Recent Alumnus,2,You definitely need a car. Public transportation may run until 10 pm. There is a shuttle that goes to Wal-Mart on Skibo Road. Those are the main sources of transportation outside of owning a car.
College Freshman,2,Fayetteville State is pretty decent when it come to off-campus housing. The university apartments are located conveniently across the campus. And are at a somewhat good price
Recent Alumnus,2,I got the impression that most of the teachers could care less if you succeeded. If you are not a self starter you may want to consider another school.
College Junior,2,"You have to know where you want to park for basically the day, at certain times of the day it can be really hard to find a parking spot, so most likely it's easier to keep a parking spot so that you don't lose your place and just walk to class since the buildings arent as far as other colleges may be."
College Junior,2,"The weather here in fayetteville is different than other places, it always changes from warm to cold, theres basically no set weather around here."
College Junior,2,Not musch variety. could be better but better than 2 of the other colleges i visited!
College Junior,2,I am not that happy with the program. I am being told that the program is about to shut down. There are not enough of Professor to teach the program. I have no mentor within the major. My career goal was to become a research scientist. I have researched and found that prior students in this program are having a hard time finding a job. Right now I am considering going to PA school after graduation.
College Freshman,2,There is only one off campus place that i know of so that is kinda not good. The cost is acceptable it is right next to campus and seems pretty safe.
College Sophomore,2,"Fayetteville doesnt have much to offer. Attractions are very limited, events happen certain times of the year and locals are pretty friendly and they love Fayetteville State Marching band!! Even though people proclaim that the area is bad that Fayetteville State sits at, its actually not that bad. Fayetteville is home of Fort Bragg military base, so you will actually see more military people here than in most places."
Recent Alumnus,2,Needs Help – needs revitalization project.  school is hidden within a residential community.
College Freshman,2,Computer Availability and Quality – The computers at Fayetteville State University sometimes shut down while you are using them and the computer labs are often filled with students trying to get work done at the last minute. Having your own computer allows you the flexibility of being able to be anywhere where there is WIFI and you are the only one using it.
College Freshman,2,"Not as many people attend the Games as they should.  During football season, the stands are packed. But during Basketball season, the bleachers have many empty spots."
College Senior,2,little availability for sports participation for those that have day jobs
College Senior,2,Internships Are Unique Opportunities. Fayetteville State University offers unique opportunities for students to intern with various companys. Also the volunteer opportunities are very plentiful.
College Senior,2,Can't Eat Here – Restaurants in Fayetteville are unsanitary. There are not enough variety places to eat. Many times you find yourself eating at the same places constantly to the point you just want to go home for good meals with your family. Its nothing different than any other places in other cities they have the same restaurants and less.
College Senior,2,"Parking on campus could and should be a lot better. There are just not enough spaces, and the increase in permits costs really affected a lot of students."
College Sophomore,2,"Food is ok, prices are worth it, as you have a good variety of choices.  Cafeteria staff are impersonable.  Not very helpful"
Senior,1,"I'm not sure about other departments but the science department is below subpar. I've had professors who have never taught said subjects and randomly get selected for teaching the course. They had no idea how to work the computers or online website (canvas). Some students are very disrespectful to professors, causing disruption in the class like they're in middle school. I've had online professors not respond to emails for over a week, take weeks to grade things and not be in contact with students so we had no idea what was going on. This is the second university I've attended and I've never dealt with such things on a collegiate level, it's actually embarrassing to even say I'm taking classes at this school."
College Sophomore,1,"I wanted to transfer to uncp partly because they actually have internships, relationships with businesses, a great career center, etc. that fsu does not."
College Sophomore,1,"Roaches, nasty people, thousands of dollars wasted because it is dirty, mold infested, washing machines and dryers often break, etc."
College Sophomore,1,It is a kitchen size weight room with only big weights for lifting.
College Sophomore,1,"Fayetteville state is dirty (roaches, duck poop all over the ground), the professors could care less about the students, the people in general are hard to be around (I keep to myself), the career center is useless, I personally wanted to attend UNCP because it is the better, updated, community feel that fsu will never be for me."
College Senior,1,It's hard to get in touch with them and they always give you the runaround
College Sophomore,1,Not safe to live in Fayetteville
College Sophomore,1,Fayetteville is very run down
College Sophomore,1,The school lost my paper work on multiple occasions and took me well into the semester to fix the problems
College Sophomore,1,The school is a HBCU so it doesn't have very much diversity.
College Junior,1,There are almost no transportation options except having your own car.
College Junior,1,"They aren't very strict, most people get in trouble but get ought through the judicial board.... but its rediculous the crime on campus"
College Junior,1,"Parking sucks.. its always full, and on top of that majority of the parking spots goes to teachers.. so tip get there early and find a spot that is close to the majority of your classes!"
College Junior,1,I live off campus the closest place to eat is the campus cafe.
College Junior,1,"Not Passing Grade – FSU needs a lot more campus police, the campus is an open campus , and is not well lit"
College Junior,1,"If the buses ran a little later, or if the shuttle ran on weekdays and not just weekends the grade would have been alot better."
College Freshman,1,Not Very Safe – There was an abundance of crime on and near the campus in the past couple of months. Campus police did not make me feel much safer about being on the campus. It had students wondering where all of our tuition money is going to cause it obviously isn't being invested in safety measures.
College Junior,1,"Well its only a few that we can choose from, because most of us, don't have cars, so I would give my school a D+."
College Sophomore,1,"Financial Aid office is the worst ever.  They will not help with scholarships, as they tell you to look into it yourself.  Worst college financial office I have ever encountered."
College Sophomore,1,"Getting help from financial aid is very tough.  You receive a cold shoulder form when you first walk in the door.  We all dread when it comes time for financial aid, as you will be there for hours with no help and peopel who do not care."

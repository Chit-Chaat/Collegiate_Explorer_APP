Freshman,5,My online experience this semester was perfect! The professors were so nice and they gave us enough time to get our work done.
Freshman,5,Radford University is so a beautiful campus. I think the water fountain is the best scenery. Everybody on campus is so nice and friendly.
Freshman,5,I have 3 online and 3 in person. So far my online are going really well and the professors have done well at adjusting the work to an online format and helping us when needed.
Freshman,5,The online experience is good but it's not like being in a classroom and learning first hand. I miss being able to be with other students
Freshman,5,I like the campus and the people here who are making it possible for the students to stay safe. Radford University has provided COVID testing and has told us that cases are going down.
Senior,5,"I really enjoyed the small campus aspect of the college, everything was in walking distance of each other. It made me feel like I was really part of a community."
Senior,5,"This question is not applicable to me. I did not take any online classes, nor was any of my material submitted online."
Sophomore,5,"I love how diverse the campus is and their push to have a safe and friendly environment for all students. The professors aren't there for just a check, they are actually there to help the students become the best students they can be. the campus is very small, so its easy to commute and nothing is ever hard to find."
Sophomore,5,The online process was a little tricky at first but after the professors and students understood what was going on and how to handle online classes it was great.
Senior,5,"Instructors are Amazing!! I appreciate what the instructors have done during covid for online learning. I know it wasn't easy but I did learn what I needed. it wasn't easy, some online classes are, some online classes aren't made to be online. just look at rate my professor.com before choosing a professor and class"
Sophomore,5,"In my first year at, Radford, I was able to get quite close with most of my teachers. They were all open to having students visit them during office hours or by appointment to help us students out with anything we needed. All of my teachers had one goal and that was to start us freshman off with a great first year. Encouraging us the entire way to only do our best. Each teacher that I had the opportunity to learn from were stellar scholars. All having the ability to accommodate to those who would need a little extra help, but never showing favoritism towards the ones that were always on top of their work."
Sophomore,5,"Radford, my home away from home, is not the biggest school with the best sports or biggest parties, but we know how to work with what we've got. The people in Radford have the best attitudes I have been able to witness in my 19 years on the earth. Everyone from the staff to other students have made my first year attending, the best year of my life, so far.  I knew from my junior year of high school that I would have the pleasure of calling this place home for the next 4 years. The campus is beautiful and not too big so everything is within walking distance. Our athletics teams, are stellar for the division we are in, and the staff are some of the most caring people out there. They strive to see their students succeed in life and from experience, they only want the best for you."
Sophomore,5,"I love this school, the atmosphere and the experience so far! The professors are very friendly and always willing to help any student and answer questions."
Junior,5,I like how small the campus is because you see people you know all the time. Class sizes are also small so your professors know your name and how you learn so they are more willing to help you out.
Junior,5,I took 3 classes online in the past 2 years and it really helped my schedule not be too crammed. I liked how flexible they are because usually they will upload what you need to do every week and you have Monday-sunday to finish it. The teachers are usually pretty good at getting back to you in a timely manner.
Sophomore,5,Radford University has provided me with more opportunity than I could've ever imagined! I have made many advances to my academic and professional career because of my connections at Radford University. I am forever grateful.
Niche User,5,"very nice campus, clean and friendly. very helpful and quiet. many friends there. small but easy to find where your going"
Freshman,5,"Radford University is an outstanding school nestled in the heart of the New River Valley in Southwest Virginia .  It is located in the beautiful, peaceful of Radford, VA, and has a nice, walk-able campus.  The students and faculty are very nice.  I love going there."
Freshman,5,"It has a Great community, but sadly The town is small and lacks places to go to for fun without leaving radford"
Freshman,5,"The college I currently attend is beautiful, the campus is nice everything is updated.Everyone around the campus is friendly and nice. The food is wonderful. Classes are fun but expensive ."
Freshman,5,I am entering my second semester of freshman year and I have never been excited to actually go back to school during a school break. I love the classes I have taken and I am really looking forward to the classes I am enrolled in next semester. I have met outstanding people and amazing people I can call my friends. I have also had a great experience with the professors I have had so far.
Senior,5,Radford is one of the top schools in VA. It has the perfect campus size and an excellent amount of diversity among the students and faculty. The professors are very hands on with their students and are also well connected in their respected fields.
Junior,5,My experience at Radford University has been wonderful! I love how they include everyone and their diversities. All of my professors have been wonderful! Radford staff truly wants their students to succeed.
Junior,5,"My experience at Radford University has been a great choice in my life for one and many reasons. Going to Radford as a first generation college student, I had no idea what to expect. I was scared and alone, far away from home with no friends or family for the very first time in my life. Yet, Radford made me feel at home. Radford's student and staff body is one of many and they have a deep connecting bond within. The professors really care about your well being in the class and the campus people are more than friendly. Radford also hosts several events where new people can go and meet other people and feel at home with different interacting activities. I would love to see Radford to continue to blossom as the great school it is."
Alum,5,Radford is a beautiful school with excellent professors! The area has lots of options for eating out and things to do. The campus is easy to maneuver. I’m so glad that I chose Radford as my college.
Freshman,5,Radford University is by far the best place to be if you are wanting to further your education past high school. Everyone is welcome here and it has been a blessing to meet lifetime friends.
Sophomore,5,Radford University is a very friendly environment with a great student to faculty ration. The campus is gorgeous and all faculty members truly works their best to give you the best experience.
Junior,5,"Currently getting my second degree here, great school and recommend it to anyone! The professors are great to work with and really care about their students."
Freshman,5,Coming to Radford to further my education has been the best decision I've made in my life so far. Radford is all about catering to their students and their needs.
Freshman,5,My experience at Radford was quite different from what I imagined but I am learning to adjust. This is a really good school and most of the teachers really want to see you succeed.
Freshman,5,I like the smallness of the school and how dedicated the teachers are to helping students. There should be more majors offered and more potential for students to have scholarships. Would like to see a football team
Senior,5,"As a student in STEM, I am so happy with my decision to go to Radford. Unlike a larger 4-year school, the attention of professors is given solely to undergrads. My research opportunities are limitless! I know all of my professors well and they know me. I have worked closely for years with several of my favorite faculty members and making lifelong connections I don't think that I would have had I have gone to a larger school. I also know all of the students in my program, which is great because I love my peers! If you want to work closely with your professors and peers as an undergrad, I highly suggest you give Radford your consideration! Also, if you like to party, this is your place."
Sophomore,5,"I love Radford! Everyone is super friendly and out going. There is always something to do, and the parties are wild: 6-7 days a week. All of your professors care about your education and are great at teaching their subject!"
Senior,5,"Radford University has a diverse community full of caring and generous people. The student life is amazing! There is always something to do at Radford University whether it be extra curricular activities, sports events, or the parties. It is easy to find friends or people to relate to. The professors are extremely nice and cooperative with assignments. The professors also lend a helping hand for things that do not involve class work."
Sophomore,5,"Radford University offers many opportunities for its students. The campus is beautiful, the teachers are caring, the community is welcoming, and the peers are overall enjoyable to be around. However the cafeteria food could be better."
Junior,5,"Radford is a very supportive community. The professors and staff want to see you do well and are great at helping you achieve your goals. There are an endless amount of clubs and activities, so no matter what your interests are, there will be something for you!"
Freshman,5,The faculty and students are extremely nice making the orientation and tours a very wonderful experience that makes me eager to start school in the fall.
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student that wanted to stay in a college that wasn't small, but wasn't extremely huge either. Radford is a nice school for those looking to move away from home, but are intimidated by schools like JMU or V-tech. So far my experience has been a pretty good one and a lot of the teachers are amazing and very helpful for my major! One thing i would like to see change is an addition of a football team, and maybe better food...but otherwise this is a pretty cool school!"
Junior,5,"awesome staff, beautiful campus, great dining services, wonderful professors, pretty good tuition rates"
Freshman,5,"Radford is an above-average public university located in Radford, Virginia. It is a mid-size institution with an enrollment of 8,049 undergraduate students. Admissions is somewhat competitive as the Radford acceptance rate is 74%. ... Graduating 55% of students, Radford alumni go on to earn a starting salary of $36,400."
Sophomore,5,Small school. Caring teachers who want you to succeed. Good people to surround yourself with. Lots of good memories are made.
Freshman,5,The campus is just the right size. It small enough to were walking to class is easy and convenient but also big enough. The classes are well put together and the professors are extremely helpful. Theres so many helpful things available campus to help you in your classes for free.
Sophomore,5,"I began Radford in the Fall of 2018. I really enjoy my time here, professors are amazing and very accommodative. Campus is not huge nor small. It is a perfect size with good sized classrooms where it is possible for your professor to know your name."
Sophomore,5,Radford University is an outstanding college. The campus is beautiful and the people who go here are friendly. I wouldn't change a thing about radford except free tuition!
Niche User,5,"Radford University is a wonderful school. The campus is gorgeous. The students are always helpful and friendly. The professors aren't there for money, but for the students. Overall, the University is amazing and I will highly recommend it for others to attend."
Freshman,5,"I love how caring the professors are and how willing they are to assist students. The campus is beautiful and everyone is friendly. It's a smaller school so it is easy to make friends and know lots of people. There are lots of clubs you can join. If you're into parties you can find plenty, but if you're not you won't find parties unexpectedly and no one will judge you for not partying. The only bad things: depending on what dorm you're in there may be a lot of fire drills and sometimes the dining hall food isn't too great, you just have to find what suits your taste-buds."
Freshman,5,"I'm only a freshman but its amazing here so far and I would never consider anywhere else. Everything about Radford University is everything I could have ever imagined and more I LOVE it so much and I'm sure you will too, but always come visit to get the full experience of this new river valley school."
Freshman,5,I love everything about it. The campus is great and the academic programs are outstanding! The student life is one like no other. The housing options are great and you won’t be disappointed!! There are endless opportunities at Radford. The areas surrounding campus is awesome and there’s so many options for fun activities or somewhere to grab and a bit and eat! The atmosphere is very positive and adventurous at all times. There will always be someone to help you will any questions you may have about anything. You’ll never feel alone or left wondering. There are new experiences brought to you every day.
Niche User,5,Radford University is an amazing School with great diversity and provides for a great student lifestyle. The university also has an amazing campus with many classrooms and many buildings including lots of student housing and even a planetarium.  if I could change one thing about Radford it would be the student housing even though it's not the worst  Radford University could stand to do a little bit of updating.
Freshman,5,Radford University was one of the easiest colleges to work with during my application process. They were very open to answering any questions I may have had to help me decide if Radford was the perfect college for me.
Freshman,5,I'm currently in my second semester as a Freshman here and I love being here. I do plan to stay at Radford for the full four years and probably even go to graduate school here.
Alum,5,I attended Radford for three years and graduated in 1989.  The best feeling I can recall from attending RU is that I felt like I belonged there.  I felt comfortable and welcomed by my professors and friends.  I believe I succeeded because I was wanted and expected to succeed.   My Daughter is a Junior attending Radford and she also feels the same.
Sophomore,5,I’ve enjoyed my time here at Radford. Greek Life is an amazing organization and has helped me in so many ways. If I could change one thing it would be the food. I would just like to have more of a variety to choose from.
Freshman,5,The professors were so kind and helpful. They really care about giving all their students the best higher education possible.
Niche User,5,Radford University is in an excellent location of me personally.  Good pricing and excellent education.
Junior,5,"The people is great, environment is great, it is second home to me. Every is super friendly and helpful. The campus is beautiful and has many unique shops and food places all around close.It has a bus that travels to places in area to take you to like Walmart, VT, and mall. There many groups and events that students can see or join. The food is getting better every year."
Freshman,5,"I absolutly love this place. It was voted second most conservative in VA. The campus is beautiful. The students are the friendliest people, you'd ever meet. Oh and Tech sucks"
Graduate Student,5,"I am an international graduate student. Radford University is my big family. I never felt isolated or ignored. People are friendly and love to help. I love also my professors who treated me very well regardless of who I am. I love also, Radford Community. People, in general, are nice and love to talk."
Sophomore,5,"The thing I favor and cherish most about Radford University is that there are many opportunities for you to be involved in extracurricular activities. Far too often people are going away to school to focus on the ""college experience"" (partying) and eventually end up wasting their time and their money. Students need to be driven by success and the extracurriculars that Radford provides help you focus and branch out while maintaining your good academic standing."
Junior,5,The staff and teachers at this school are second to none. Every class I have taken has felt very involved and interesting. The school is very safe with resource officers being on campus and a police station located just across the street. The facilites and services available ensure a well informed and comfortable stay while attending Radford University
Freshman,4,My first year has been unfortunately moved online but all of my professors have been super helpful and I could not have asked for an easier transition from high school to collge.
Freshman,4,Radford University as always been my dream school and I was very blessed to be accepted to attend school there. I fell in love with every aspect of the campus and cannot wait for the next four years here.
Sophomore,4,One of the main things I like about Radford University is their resources they have on campus. They provide everyone with free tutors when needed and people to assist you with writing papers when needed for free. They even have a building that students can go to for laptop trouble and the staff will help you fix the problem. I had a good overall first year at Radford University. I would recommend it to others.
Sophomore,4,My experience with Radford has been pretty good but there have been a few bumps in the process of trying to get my degree. The financial aid office is a little tricky and it is difficult to get the type of housing you want. Other than that the campus is great and student life is fun. They offer many things you can do for fun and have a great amount of groups and clubs you can join.
Senior,4,Nursing program is where its at! thats what I came for! radford is a blackhole but if thats what you want then sign up!!! you get what you pay for! I came for the nursing degree because its worth it!
Junior,4,Online classes are good for simpler classes however if you taking a harder class I do not recommend it atall.
Junior,4,I really like radford i feel like it has some problems but it isn't as bad as it is made out to be. Very good health programs.
Junior,4,"I love Radford, but I wish the school was more diverse. I like the small town feeling but when you want to have fun off campus you'll have to drive 20+ minutes to the closest town."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Radford has been wonderful. The students as well as the staff are very kind and helpful, not to mention very welcoming to new students. Personally, for me, it is too far away from home. However, the atmosphere and small town vibes make it bearable. This town is super small, yet big enough to see new faces everyday, which is my favorite part about this university."
Sophomore,4,The courses at Radford that I’ve had to taken online have been extremely hassle free. Radford uses the same platform my high school used so I’m accustomed to the mechanisms of the site. The professors were also very understanding and helpful during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Junior,4,"Despite Radford University not being my first choice for college, it has surpassed my expectations. I had grown to love it, with Radford's smaller campus and class size, I was always able to directly engage with my professors if needed. They obviously care about your education and will do all that they can to ensure  opportunities are possible no matter the major."
Sophomore,4,"Radford University is a smaller University situated in Southwest Virginia. It provides a calm college experience with several opportunities for students to be engaged on its beautiful campus. Residential life gives on campus students a home away from home feeling with staff ready to help with every need. Classes are engaged, hands on, and have professors that assist you in achieving academic success. School spirit is kept at a high due to the amount of opportunities students have to share their Highlander Pride with their school and surrounding community. There is a true sense of family in the air at all times which encourages myself and my fellow Highlanders to continue making our school, and our community, the best and brightest place to be."
Niche User,4,"I think Radford is a pretty magnificent college overall. They(administrators) really try and help out as much as they can and aren’t stuck up like the other colleges I’ve visited. The campus isn’t huge but big enough to have some fun and not get bored. They always provide something to do. The students and teachers there are also extremely intelligent and driven. This is the exact energy I need around me in a school setting to stay focused and motivated, all while still having fun."
Junior,4,I would love to see more restaurants or more food places on and off-campus. I do not feel like there is a lot to do on the weekends at Radford on or off-campus.
Sophomore,4,"This school has a great feel about it, there is a place for everyone. The dining options on campus aren't fantastic but are tolerable, Each major provides what is needed for the students to succeed and even more if they want it. There are varsity, club, and intramural sports teams for all interests and skill levels. The gym is equipt with a little bit of everything so that students can do what they want or need to do."
Freshman,4,"The class sizes are smaller which allows the students to get more individual time with the professors. There is lots of diversity and opportunities for academic achievement and growth. The surrounding area, the New River Valley, is beautiful!"
Alum,4,"My first couple of months at Radford University were a little hard, as I was trying to adjust to being away from home and being in what it felt like, a secluded place. After finally getting involved and getting to know different people in my class, I was starting to like it a little more. I liked the fact that I did not have big class sizes. There were maybe a few science courses that were bigger than normal, but even then, it would only be about 60 people. Student life on campus grew each year I attended and from what I am hearing now, it is still growing. There are many organizations at the school to be a part of that allow you to be yourself or find yourself."
Niche User,4,"Radford has a wonderful admissions staff! They have always been so kind, caring, and willing to help throughout my college search. A friendly, diverse college it is."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman going into my second semester at Radford University. During my freshman orientation, everyone was so welcoming and friendly. I felt very at home and comfortable with the school. There are many resources that the school provides to help students with classes. Including the writing center, professor office hours, and even student tutors. The campus is a moderate size and classes are about a 5-10 minute walk.The campus is very well lit and there are towers that will alert the police if you feeling unsafe. There are not many choices of food to eat and after a while it gets kind of repetitive. There are shuttles that can take you to stores and surrounding areas which comes in handy. If you are interested in working out the gym is very up to date and nice. It includes three floors with many styles of equipment. Overall I believe I made the right choice of going to Radford University because of the many resources they provide and the welcoming feeling when staying on campus."
Freshman,4,"Radford University is an amazing campus with professors and faculty who show they care. The campus life isn't as enriched as it promises to be, but nonetheless they try and sell it. The professors at this institution genuinely care about the success of their students and their safety. If I didn't live in the Honors College dorms, the dorms for other freshmen would be sub par to the conditions people should live in. The food options are extremely limited and get very old very quick. The dining hall will upset your stomach and the on campus vendors will become monotonous.  The new tuition policy regarding the extra expenses burdened on students who take over 16 credit hours is asinine and discriminatory. Behind the scenes Radford is just as corrupt as all higher education, but the face it presents is nice and welcoming."
Freshman,4,"People are friendly! Great campus! First time away from home,so I have hundreds of additional family members!"
Junior,4,"I love the size of the campus, its not too big and its not too small. The school offers a wide selection of majors and minors for you to pick from. It is also one of the most affordable 4 year institutions in VA"
Sophomore,4,"I chose Radford University because of the smaller campus. This little campus has a lot to offer, but still has some work to do. All of the dorm rooms need to have central air and heat. Muse Hall is the largest dorm and it doesn't have air conditioning. Depending on who you have and what major you decide to pursue will dictate your experience."
Alum,4,I learned a lot throughout my years at Radford and participated in many extra curricular activities. I ended up getting experience that other students don't even realize that they missed!
Freshman,4,"Radford University has a much larger campus than my last college and requires a lot more walking and to rush to class much quicker. The Bonnie and Dalton offer a variety of food options, as well as some other places close enough to campus to walk to."
Junior,4,Radford's education program is wonderful. One thing I would like to see change with is clubs and social organizations.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman at Radford,  I haven't been able to completely explore all of the aspects of activities and clubs to join. However, my stay here feels completely welcomed and natural while arriving on campus. As of now, the only thing I would change are the food choices, there should be more of a variety."
Sophomore,4,The professors are welcoming and have no problem helping you when you need it! They have a great variety of food so you’ll never get bored. The campus is beautiful and the walk from class to class is also reasonable .( ~6min <)
Sophomore,4,"I'm an upcoming sophomore this fall. Radford was quite different for me to say the least. It was an experience but I'm not sure it was one of my best decisions. However, I'm still here so the school overall is a good place to go academically. The party scene is pretty good as well. I  think the situation here is to each their own and Radford may not have been for me, but I need this degree so ill keep pushing through"
Sophomore,4,"Radford University Academic programs are slowly progressing, and the diversity rate is growing as well. The support system is good as well. They really shoot for their students to achieve more and above. The sky is not the limit there is more to life then what we see through our life span. One thing about Radford is I wish they had more food choices for us to eat from. I believe the gym should be open 24 hours, but other then that I wouldn't choose any other college to be at rather than Radford."
Junior,4,Radford is a very welcoming university. It really feels like home. The Radford community is like one big family. Very supportive of all your needs.
Senior,4,"My experience at radford was a great one actually. It is very diverse and there is something always going on on campus like events, concerts, and other things that are being held. I wish there were more opportunities for minority students since radford is a pwi institution."
Sophomore,4,"I honestly really love Radford University. Yes, it took a while for me to get to the point where I was content with my decision but ever since I have really been involved with the school, I wouldn't want to go anywhere else. The school has been so good to me and therefore I have done so much for it like being an ambassador for Radford University. The campus is very beautiful and President Hemphill is amazing!"
Senior,4,"When I came to Radford University, I did not know what to expect. However, over the course of these past four years, I have made numerous connections with individuals of many different cultures and backgrounds. You will absolutely feel at home and welcome at Radford University, but unlike any college or university, your experience is what you make it. Top 5 university in the state of Virginia, if you ask me."
Freshman,4,"I believe Radford University has changed me for the better. When I came to Radford out of high school I was relatively immature, but being a college student changed that very quickly. They have many programs to help students strive and grow in their respective fields and majors. They also have many clubs and activities to get every student involved someway, somehow. Your time at Radford University won’t be wasted on just going to class and going home. You’ll meet new people, life long friends, brothers, sisters and you’ll develop into the better version of yourself. I’ve loved my time here so far at Radford and I know every who will come will love there time as well."
Niche User,4,"The professors I’ve had so far have been really excellent and really have a passion for their program. They all have very nice personalities and super approachable (making asking question very easy). The school is very small and so are the classes, which is something that is enjoyable but I’m not a huge fan of smaller schools."
Freshman,4,"My overall experience with Radford University has been very good. I have not had too many problems so far in the short amount of time I have been here so far, but when I have has a problem arise, the staff that needed to help me understand and fix the problem helped me. Something that I would like to see change is that when it comes to paying for college, if someone is using a GI Bill, that they are made aware of the fact that their scholarships will be taken away, rather than just taking away the scholarships without warning. Students should be made aware of what happens to the scholarships they are given, especially based on academic, when they use other things to pay for their education."
Niche User,4,"I love Radford's campus, the scenery is so beautiful. While the scenery is good but their food is not the best. They need to be better with their food services."
Freshman,4,Radford is an amazing school where the professors and faculty care about you and your success! I love my school and can't wait to finish my years out there.
Graduate Student,4,It is a great place to study where you can feel the support your professors  and grow constantly academically.
Sophomore,4,"All aspects of Radford are wonderful, from academics to student life, there is something for everyone."
Niche User,4,"I have had so many questions about whether or not I could even be accepted into college based on my GPA and my SAT score. I have caused a ton of stress on myself and I finally decided to contact Radford and ask them questions involving the application process. I have seen the campus and it is very open and students seemed happy as I was touring but my main worry was "" Radford is a party school"" and I did not want to be a part of that lifestyle I want to be fully focused on my academics so I can advance my studies. I really have a hard time getting things in my brain instead of seeing it I have to hear it over and over again and I feel that I will not do well in college but they informed me about tutoring and professor hours where you have a certain period of time to ask questions and receive the help that I will need."
Sophomore,4,"Radford University has allowed me to figure out what I actually want to do with my future. While we may have a reputation as a huge party school, academically we are held to high standards and our courses are rigorous. Almost all of my professors have been wonderful and they’ve helped me improve in many areas. Radford may not be in the biggest town, and we may be on a small campus, but it helps us to be a more close knit campus community. This makes being away from home much easier. I can honestly say that by choosing Radford, I’ve helped to further my life in so many ways."
Senior,4,I love the experience I have had at Radford. When I first visited the campus I fell in love with it. There are several eating places located close to campus. I also can go to Walmart and a mall via the transportation bus. Sticking to policies of how selection of housing is done.
Senior,4,"Fell in love with Radford during my first visit as a senior in high school four years ago. The campus size is manageable and well-kept; the city itself is close-knit and convenient as everyone both on and off campus are but a short walk away. Though the environment may not be fitting for everyone, those who experience Radford know of its one-of-a kind like quality. I don't believe I could have went anywhere better."
Sophomore,4,"My name is Emilie and I am currently an incoming  junior, currently still a sophomore, at Radford University. Radford is a very comfortable, homey, and inspiration seeking college. I had the hardest time picking somewhere that felt right for me as I already have major social anxiety, and the connections, people, staff makes it feel like I am leaving my home every time I leave there."
Niche User,4,"Beautiful campus with stunning facilities and resources. Blown away by my tour and couldn't wait to visit again. Intrigued by the activities available for students. My sister had the time of her life on a study abroad trip to the Bahamas. Once again, it's a one of a kind place with great academics and people."
Sophomore,4,"Radford University is an affordable school. They work with you in the financial aid department and try to help you receive the most funds as possible. Not only is the school affordable, but it is a beautiful campus. I felt like I received my moneys worth with the multiple things they offer on campus, from the amazing food, on-campus activities, and location. There are plenty of things to do on and off campus, I never got bored."
Sophomore,4,Radford University is a very good university. I love the campus and all the activities the school offers! I also like that the classrooms are a good size and the professors actually know the students by name not some number.
Junior,4,I transferred to Radford this past year and my transition was very easy. I am still learning the ins and outs of the university and plan to maximize more of the available resources this upcoming year.
Junior,4,"During my time with Radford so far as been an experience to say the least. Everyone there has been welcoming and nice. The campus is always lovely to look at and walk around. Granted the party scene can be a bit much, but if you're into that then you will like it. As for someone who is not a big fan, there is enough to do to keep you busy."
Junior,4,Radford University is a diverse campus and tries to get studies involved as much as possible. Students are able to connect with professors inside and out of class.
Junior,4,"Radford is an amazing university. As a communications student, the new College of Human and Behavioral Sciences (CHBS) building is updated and perfect for learning. The professors are easily available outside of class and are happy to answer any concerns. The one complaint I have is the food quality and the selection of food. Radford is a small town, not having very many off-campus dining possibilities. The on-campus food is lower quality than most and seems to not live up to what college food should be."
Niche User,4,"I think they have an interesting way of expressing their how much they want you to attend their college. Also, they have a cool program for the arts."
Freshman,4,My experience so far has been good. I am an athlete at Radford University and my involvement on campus is pretty good. The people here are very nice and it is a homey place.  It is a beautiful place and there is a lot to do around Radford. What I would like to see change would be more food options restaurant wise and better parking convenience. The busing service does help with parking though.
Senior,4,"Radford allows me to have a more hands on experience then some of my other colleges. While being a smaller school opportunities are extremely plentiful and professors get to know us one on one. Having gone to other schools before Radford, I can honestly say professors here want you to succeed, even staying late at night to accommodate students with difficult schedules."
Freshman,4,"I love how Radford is full of fun and activities to keep us busy after classes. Theres something to do everyday, even if its just a movie in Bonnie Hall. The only thing i would change about Radford is the diversity with the students."
Alum,4,The small class sizes made it easy for  me to get the most out of my education. Forming relationships with professors and classmates alike was much easier than it would have been in bigger classes.
Junior,4,"There are many enjoyable qualities about RU! My top three would be on campus living, accessible teachers, and facilities. This school makes living and transitioning a breeze for the freshman and the upcoming semesters. 
For things to change, I would like to see more food options on campus and easier work study applications to be found."
Sophomore,4,Radford is such a great place with small classrooms to meet professors that help you as much as they can. The campus does everything in its power to make sure we have activities going on at least once a week for free. Not only is the campus beautiful but the people here are all so nice and friendly.
Sophomore,2,My online learning experience was not so good. I did not like the online learning because it is not as easy to contact professor whenever I needed it.
Freshman,2,"Radford is the perfect school for someone. That someone just isn't me. The teachers I have had were all willing to work with me in and outside of class and wanted their students to succeed, the staff on campus is friendly, it's easy to get around, there's plenty of food options unless you're a vegan, and housing doesn't suck. However, clubs are hit or miss, parties mean people will be loud as hell on the weekends, it's got that small town homophobic/racist mentality, and things seem chaotic and unorganized when it comes to big events."
Niche User,2,"Attended my freshman year and hated every minute of it. The people are rude and close minded, and there is nothing to do on campus if you arent into partying. The food is horrible and consists of only fast food opinions. There isnt many good off campus options either, unless you want to drife to Blacksburg or Roanoke.If you aren't into partying and Greek life and actually care about your education, then stay away. Almost everyone I know transferred out including myself."
Freshman,2,This should be your last choice school right behind community college. The education here is a joke and most people could care less about their academics. The food is appalling and a complete waste of money. I could not recommend this school less to anyone.
College Sophomore,2,"I lived in muse, which is so dirty. The only perk was meeting a bunch of friends/freshman."
College Sophomore,2,"In the middle of no where, a lot of kids drank every night so the freshman dorm was always loud at late hours M-F."
College Freshman,2,No AC in Muse Hall and the heat is horrible in Winter and
College Freshman,2,Radford is known as a party school which makes people think less of the education that you receive here because people think it is easy and you don't have to work hard to get good grades.
College Sophomore,2,The health center on campus either thinks you have a cold that doesn't need a prescription or an STD.
College Freshman,2,There is a lot of sexual assaults on campus that aren't being reported I feel like there should be more measures in place for situations like this. Other than that I feel pretty safe and secure on campus.
College Junior,2,"I did not like the school I attended my freshman year of college and I was a little upset that my college years started off that way. I did make awesome friends that I still stay in contact with to this day, though. I'm now a junior and I am starting school at Jefferson College of Health Sciences in the Fall and I'm so excited to finally be done with my general studies and starting on my Health and Exercise Science major! I can't wait for what Jefferson has to offer!"
College Sophomore,2,"Cafe food is rarely good on the second floor. CT food is good, but it is very limited."
College Freshman,2,I'm transferring; I think that's about all I need to say.
College Freshman,2,"The student body is my biggest problem with Radford. It's very hard to meet and get to know people because they don't seem interested in forming friendships often. They aren't very outgoing but once you talk to them, they'll typically talk back. There are some attractive guys but most are average. Girls seem judgmental but if you're nice to them, then they'll sometimes reciprocate."
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid has given me so many problems. I did not receive any scholarships and am here only on loans.
College Junior,2,"I've fought with financial aid every year over getting anything at all. I've gotten 2 scholarships from the university over the course of attending 3 years. I've had to take out multiple student loans and my parents have taken out many parent plus loans to help me pay for school. I've applied to as much scholarships as I can and hardly receive any, and it's really discouraging when people who hardly work to maintain a good GPA and party all the time, receive the most financial aid help or work study positions. I don't know how the financial aid department can get better, but something needs to be done. It takes quite a while to even talk to anyone or have questions answered."
College Freshman,2,There are emails sent out for Basketball games or other games but I don't see school spirit here at all.
College Freshman,2,Barely any off campus dining
College Freshman,2,My only experience with Greek life was approaching the tables at club fair and being utterly ignored.
College Freshman,2,The new fitness building hasn't opened so the sports aren't wonderful
College Freshman,2,There are about 3 restaurants within walking distance and they are mostly bars. The Christiansburg mall has great chain restaurant options but that's about a 20 minute bus ride.
College Freshman,2,"Radford is in the middle of nowhere. The nearby town has about 10 shops because most of them are closed down. These range from run-down restaurants, to antique shops, to old consignment stores: basically, nothing a college student would be interested in. However, Radford does boast that it has a lot of outdoor activities. There's tubing (but don't get too excited, because that's only applicable in the early part of the year and late spring). There are hiking trails about 30-45 minutes away that give you a little something to do on a couple weekends."
College Senior,2,Housing is expensive off campus
College Junior,2,"I am a young, married father--financially independent and have a hard time receiving financial aid.  I'm hoping something will work out soon."
College Freshman,2,"My family is middle class- not overly wealthy by any means- and getting financial aid is as hard as getting into Harvard. I filled out multiple applications and got turned down because my parents ""make too much"". Basically don't bother trying unless you have a single parent or you're homeless. You're better off just putting time and effort into securing scholarships."
College Freshman,2,A lot of people drink on the weekends
College Sophomore,2,Apply really early because it's hard to get money out of this school otherwise
College Sophomore,2,There are only a few places immediately off campus. If you want to go anywhere else you have to drive thirty minutes.
College Sophomore,2,Athletes were pampered until Radford decided to cut out a lot of its sports teams. This includes swim and track.
College Sophomore,2,Radford doesn't care what any of its students participate in.
College Senior,2,"Often very cold, rainy, or snowing. However, the summer is wonderful in Radford!"
College Freshman,2,"They need to really work on the capus, forget the open fields we need buildings to learn not grass. "
College Student,2,It is so cold at Radford. Just stay warm and bundle up.
College Junior,2,Having to par across the bridge is very inconvenient. 
College Freshman,2,"Whenever I go to a party, someone is either taking drugs or talking about them, and they are drinking. "
College Freshman,2,"Radford's wireless is bad. It's pretty slow, you have to re-log on every time you use it. I can't keep the wireless on any of my portable devices because it always drops it the second you exit a building even the ""the whole campus"" is supposed to have wireless. They also make it sounds like we have computer labs galore but a lot of time professors have classes in there so you can't go in and do what you have to do. I suggest bringing your own laptop and printer to avoid the hassle."
College Student,2,"The parking for Radford is terrible, they need to create lots closer to student dorms. If you live in a dorm room, then the place students park is about half a mile, to a mile away from campus walking distance."
College Junior,2,The only place to park is down by a river that every so often decides to flood. Parking is far away from everything except the basketball stadium.
College Freshman,2,Parking here is impossible. Not lenient at all when it comes to parking.
College Sophomore,2,The availability of food just varies on the day of the week and most of the time you cannot get food past 8pm which is hard for people that enjoy late night meals. There is not much of options for what you want to eat or even things that would help people who have to eat specific items. 
College Junior,2,It is very easy to get ahold of drugs and alcohol. But You don't hear too many things about heroine and cocaine and painkillers
College Junior,2,"Radford weather is terrible. It is unpredictable, and most of the time you weather app is wrong. It can be hot and sunny one day the rain the next. It will even have a day where it snows in May. "
College Junior,2,"There's not much at all to do unless you're an outdoors person (you still have to travel at least 30 minutes). But other than that, many people travel a 30 minutes to the nearest school."
College Junior,2,There are not enough spots on campus for students or teachers. 
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is dominate at Radford. Although I am not involved in these social greek organizations, I have chose the academic greek organizations. The Social Greeks provide hazing and a strong stereotype across campus. Even though it is a great way to get involved and meet life long friends, it is not for everyone."
College Senior,2,Parking is close to class and affordable but there are less spots available every year.
College Sophomore,2,We only have one dining hall but it has decent options and it varies from day to day. But there are other place to eat on campus as well as many other places off campus. The Bonnie has a few options like Chick-fil-la and Pink Berry etc.
College Junior,2,The apartments off campus are somewhat expensive. I pay $430 a month plus utilities. And I have to pay for the apartment during the summer when I'm not their. It would be nice for them to work with the students a little.
College Freshman,2,"I receive almost no financial aid. I am a foster child, with no parents or help from the foster care system. I receive the full pale grant but that is it. I am also a first generation college student. The financial aid office never reviewed all of the areas of my financial aid form. They haven't sat down with me and helped me figure out more options or anything like that."
College Sophomore,2,"Radford is trying to accept more students from a diverse background, and the school is slowly becoming more diverse."
College Sophomore,2,Police can be really strict regarding drinking/partying in general.
College Sophomore,2,"There's a lot of diversity on Radford's campus however ,I believe it isn't as promoted as a lot of the sororities and fraternities are on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The food itself isn't too bad however, the hours are terrible during both the weeknights and weekend. How am I supposed to eat dinner on a weeknight when I have a night class from 6-9PM and all of the places are closed aside from Chick-Fil-A? Being a college student, I am trying to eat healthier and when I am limited to just a few options on the weekends, such as Austin's Grill or Wild Greens it gets VERY old. We need more options and better hours of operation- period."
College Junior,2,"We have a lot of ""incidents."" Girls, DO NOT WALK ALONE AT NIGHT OR LEAVE YOU DRINK UNCOVERED! The police do what they can but we are in a small town with a lot of college people. We have several robberies a months, most of them cause no real damage. Lock your windows and doors, don't be stupid, and you will be fine. Understand that we are in the south and guns are a big thing, therefore armed robbies are not uncommon."
College Freshman,2,"It is extremely bipolar form day to day, one day it will be spring and the next there will be 3 feet of snow"
College Freshman,2,"Greek life isn't a really big deal at Radford. Poeple don't look up to you, or look down on you because of it. If you're in it, you're in it. It's nice for parties and stuff but other than that, no one really cares."
College Junior,2,"Even though I am giving my personal experience with financial aid a C- does not mean it is that way for everyone, I have quite a few friends that financial aid paid for everything. For me, they said my parents earned too much and that they could only give me 7500 for the whole year so I, by myself, had to pay almost 3 grand each semester. The FAFSA goes off your parents finances from last year not from the now, even though my parents are having some major financial struggles now, last year they weren't and that is all FAFSA sees. So if FAFSA can't give you the money you need, try other routes like student or parent plus loans."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I went in recently to speak to someone in financial aid about getting money to return to school to become licensed. The person I spoke with was very nice, but did not seem very knowledgeable about what I needed. Instead of finding me someone else to speak with who could help me find alternate forms of financial aid, she told me they could not approve financial aid in my situation and gave me information about personal loans, which are out of the question for me, and no information about anyone else to speak with or about scholarships. I was quite disappointed that I may not be able to return to school after speaking with her, but later found out there are scholarships to apply for."
College Junior,2,"As an RA in a mostly freshmen athlete dorm, I can say that athletics are not the biggest deal at RU. I have only been to one varsity game in my four years here. We do not have football, but our Rugby club team is very good. It is annoying that non athletes cannot use the better gym that is saved for only athletes, who honestly do not bring much money to the school."
College Sophomore,2,"The few options that are given are relatively good. However, there are not very many healthy choices. I usually alternate between Au Bon Pain, which is a type of sandwich/soup/bagel place, Chick-fil-a, and Wildgreens which has salads and flatbread sandwiches. These places are expensive and I barely made it through the semester with my meal plan and I also never ate on campus during the weekends. (To be fair I also got Starbucks at least 3 days out of the week and that's also on the meal plan.) Overall the food is actually really good, there just aren't that many options. After a few months it gets old but I think that will happen anywhere."
Niche User,1,"They offer close to 0 dollars in scholarships for international students. I applied as a transfer student with a 4.0 GPA and all they offered me was a 3,000 dollar scholarship for an attendance cost of almost 40,000 dollars."
Freshman,1,"I got bed bugs twice and possibly three times. The housing department wouldn't help us until our parents got involved. The health center saw my bed bug bites and told me they were bug bites, without saying they were from bed bugs. The university never reached out to accommodate or help us in any way."
Junior,1,"Food is terrible. The student workers who make the food/take your orders at all of the restaurants don't care at all.  They look at their phones, talk to their co-workers, have no sense of health and food safety standards, it's disgusting. Litterally workers at Create with big poofy hair refuse to wear the required head gear because it would ""mess up their hair"". So you're forced to watch them make your food and pray that their hair doesn't get into it. Not only that but anywhere they refuse to take your order, when you finally get their attention after waiting patiently for 20 minutes they give you a dirty look, as if you did something wrong. Who hires these people?"
College Sophomore,1,"There are so many different places to choose from you think you'd never get tired of them. There's Chik-fil-a, Wild Greens (byo salad), a new chinese place, Starbucks, Papa Johns, Wendy's, Au Bon Pain (health but pricey place ~15 for a whole meal). But by second year, I am so sick of everything on campus. All the food tastes disgusting after a while except maybe Papa Johns but eating pizza everyday is unhealthy. And then there's Dalton Dining. Dalton is like your typical dining cafeteria. There's a homemade section, hot dog/hamburger section, vegetarian/gluten free section, pizza section, salad/wrap section, sandwich station, breakfast foods section, and desserts. And if you have any meat there at all you get sick to your stomach. Plus DD is only open certain hours of the day and costs $9 to eat there. 

For the flex junior meal plan, it costs ~$900 for ~$300 flex cash. You get half price each time you eat. So a $2 burger is $1 in flex money but in real money its $3. Total ripoff."
College Junior,1,"I can count the amount of off-campus restaurants that haven't gone out of business within the last year with one hand. Even though when you find a good restaurant, you need access to a car if you don't want walk 35 minutes either way. In a positive manner, when you reach said restaurant, the food will not disappoint. Here at Radford I am quite embarrassed when I have out-of-town friends visit and I run out of eating options after two days. There are three main reasons for this - 1. Out of the five good restaurants, three of them are the same type of food - 2. When we, as young people, want to go eat at night, they're 20 minutes from closing their doors - 3. As stated previously, they are mainly too far away from residence halls to walk too in reason. In addition to this mess of things, the student discounts are absolutely none."
College Freshman,1,I barely didn't get any financial aid and it was very sad.
College Sophomore,1,I hate the snow. I don't even know why I came here.
College Sophomore,1,Literally everyone at this school participates in weekly binge drinking.
College Sophomore,1,I have terrible wifi in my dorm. I'm surprised I can even make it through this survey.
College Sophomore,1,The classes are way too easy to be college classes.
College Junior,1,Wi-fi is always an issue. If it will let you connect then it's probably running slow.
College Freshman,1,There are very few to apply for.
College Freshman,1,There is nowhere to eat on campus it is so sad.
College Freshman,1,There are many different beliefs. 
College Freshman,1,The weather at this school is so unpredictable.
College Freshman,1,The school needs to work on getting more computer labs.During exams its hard to get to printers and find a spot to print out on.
College Freshman,1,There is no where to park so inconvenient. 
College Freshman,1,The on campus police do not exist besides the local cops near 711.
College Freshman,1,"I do not live off campus, and do not look for apartments."
College Freshman,1,"There is not a lot do do, unless you go to Blacksburg. The town is so tiny."
College Student,1,Yes drugs are always there. You have to know someone that knows someone to get ahold of them. Sometimes at parties there is sources but only if you want them you can partake in those activities.
College Freshman,1,"Filling out the financial aid is not that hard, but Radford does not give a good amount of financial aid. Instead of giving me financial aid, they wanted me to take out a loan. It's ridiculous!"
College Junior,1,a parking garage next to campus is needed
College Freshman,1,THERE ISNT A NIGHT LIFE
College Freshman,1,DONT GO HERE THERES NOTHING TO F****** DO 
College Freshman,1,It is cold at the end of fall until spring. It snows whenever. that is all.
College Freshman,1,Radford does not have many off-campus dining options at all. There are a few places within walking distance but they all get old after just a few times. Everything else is about a 15-20 minute drive which is not convenient for students who do not have cars on campus.
College Freshman,1,ont really understand the process to go through to get financial aid
College Junior,1,"Two major groups of people on campus, those from Southwest Virginia, and those from Northern Virginia. Most people are into the same things, and the lack of diversity on campus was why I decided to transfer. There isn't enough free speech, there aren't enough weirdos, and there isn't enough eclectic-ness. Also, almost everyone is in greek life. If you aren't into greek life, I'd look at another school."
College Sophomore,1,The price of a parking pass is reasonable. Parking on campus is terrible due to renovations and new construction.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is terrible. Whether it is off-campus or on campus you'll be lucky to find a spot, and you'll never want to move your car in hopes of having to find another one."
College Junior,1,Parking is a nightmare. You cannot park on campus if it is before 5:00pm. You can park in a meter spot but only up to 30 minutes (shorter than any class). Radford LOVES to give tickets. You are basically guaranteed to get a ticket your first year hear. They also love to tow. Parking for students who live on-campus is awful. It is all the way down the river. Over 100 cars got flooded and ruined this year because the river overflowed into the student parking. If you live off campus your realtor sometimes has parking but you may be on the street. The commuter parking isnt awful but you have to live over 15 miles away to qualify.
College Junior,1,"They really do not care what you do. They have the 3 stikes you're out kid of rule. In some of the programs if you get one strike you are out, but the cops really do not care what you do."
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid is really hard to get. I received no financial help at all. When I talked to my advisor about it all she could really tell me was to apply for scholarships, which I never ended up getting even when I did apply."
Recent Alumnus,1,"While most apartments in Radford are affordable, they are noisy, poorly managed and not maintained well. The ones that are not as noise and are maintained and managed well are out of the price range most students are able to afford. Radford students are notorious for destroying apartments and for parties almost every night. I do not recommend."
College Junior,1,"The on campus rules are pretty strict compared to other schools. We have a dry campus and police that patrol the campus frequently. Also, many of the buildings are locked at night or on the weekends, which effects possible studying time. The library is closed at midnight, and earlier on weekends, which makes for very limited study areas."
College Junior,1,"HORRIBLE.  Parking sucks and they keep taking it away, which I have yet to figure out why.  Beware of tickets! Even if you are a minute late, you will get one.  This is a major issue at my school."
College Senior,1,"Although RU has many computers available for students to use, the internet speed is slow. The university also sponsors the Lenovo brand computers and require many students to purchase the expensive brand that are not liked by many students for several reasons. 1. they are heavy and is a burden to take to class. 2. the battery life does not last long for the $1300 laptop. 3. although i was required to have this laptop, I have yet used it for anything special."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The area around Radford University is huge and has a lot of parking, but the catch is that its about a 20 minute walk to campus from off campus parking. Towing is highly enforced and freshman get the worst parking. Parking on campus is a joke and unless you arrive early to catch a spot, good luck"
Recent Alumnus,1,"The small town of Radford honestly is such a rural area that no amount of buildings or stores could change the atmosphere. The area around the school is pretty but its very country, so unless you like waking up to chickens and cows... literally, then maybe reconsider the school. Also if you aren't living on campus theres so much more to do. You aren't confined to being on campus at all times. The area is beautiful but way too rural"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Too Many White Students – It was totally fine, everyone was different but it was great. No one was the same and it was so cool because everyone knew it and accepted it as it is. The school in general is so nice along with the people, everyone was so friendly. I really felt welcomed and saw how other people integrated and cohabited with another who may be on the opposite end of the racial spectrum."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Many Options – From the few options that are available off campus they are well priced and taste, however only a couple restaurants have student discounts and the majority of the restaurants are not diverse at all."
College Freshman,1,The police are rarely on campus. They are very busy getting underage drinkers off campus.
College Freshman,1,Ticketing and Fines – If you park somewhere other than the student parking then you will get fined or get a ticket for parking there for so long.
College Sophomore,1,"Not Too Bad, but Not the Best – Radford recently added more transportation which is free to students. It goes to Roanoke, VT, and all around Radford. This ""freedom"" is great especially because it's free to those who show their student I.D.. Unfortunately, the hours are awful. They stop extremely early, and when a student realizes they need something from the store, the bus has already stopped running. With regards to parking, a permit costs $70, which I think is a very reasonable price. Unfortunately, there is NEVER any parking on campus or off. It's awful. In addition, if you do manage to find a spot, you always get a ticket. I have paid almost $200 dollars in tickets this year alone. I understand that tickets are a source of revenue for the school, but I'm already paying $18,000 to attend, so I think it's a joke."
College Senior,1,"For commuting students and faculty parking on campus is pretty easy if you arrive early enough. On campus parking is almost impossible after 10am. On campus students can only park on campus during the weekends, and park further away during the week."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus can be a long and frustrating experience. When going to class, I must leave 20 minutes early just to get a parking space. There are no residental parking lots on campus at all! However, faculty parking has many lots."
College Sophomore,1,"The parking situation is awful. It is hard to get a spot, and the parking lots are so far away from campus. You have to cross over a bridge to get back. There is a bus system that goes from the lots back to campus, but it can be difficult to find the bus stops in the dark."
College Sophomore,1,"It's a White Sea – Radford University is really lacking in this area. It is predominantly white and female at this school. I am sure that every race, creed, color, religion, sexual orientation, etc. attends this school, but it is over 85% white. There are students that are rich and there are also students that come from poverty. Most of the students at Radford express a disinterest and general apathy towards politics and social issues. The area itself leans right on the political spectrum. When I was at Radford I never saw any serious clashes over differing backgrounds. Generally the student body is accepting of other individuals from differing backgrounds."
College Freshman,1,"There is nooooooo diversity. I heard it was mostly white before i came but there are so many white people its ridiculous. I have been the ONLY black person in my class which is pathetic, What is even more pathetic is that I have also been the ONLY MINORITY, no black, asian, spanish or any minority and its ridiculous. Im not racist but when i see another minority i notice becasue there arent nearly as many as there should be. I've even seen confederate flags hanging in people's room. Despite all this, people are not really racist, its just if your not white its too noticeable. But to most it doesnt seem a problem ( cuz their not a monotrity) but compared to where im form and my experineces its frustrating at times"
College Junior,1,"Lacrosse and basketball are the only teams I'm certain we have. There may be others, but you don't really hear about them. We don't have a football team, which I'm sure is because RU could never have a team like the Hokies. Kids at VT are probably laughing at us. Not to mention no one has time for athletics, because half the school is partying on light side."
College Junior,1,"What a joke. There is practically NO diversity. Period. Middle class, white, country-folk or middle class, white, NOVA kids. It's pretty depressing to go to a school where you get looked at like an alien if you don't match everyone else."
College Junior,1,"Recently they have removed even more parking lots, although there was never enough parking to begin with. If you intend to commute to campus, you practically have to be on campus an hour before your class even starts and you have to stalk people to their cars and wait for them to leave. Otherwise, you'll be walking at least 10-15 minutes to campus from wherever might have some parking available."
College Junior,1,"Homogenous in Body and Mind – When 18% of Virginians are black and only 6% of your fellow collegians are, you know your university isn't hitting even average in terms of diversity. While the color of your skin isn't the only thing that determines diversity, minorities of ever kind, whether it be race, religion, or creed, are shockingly under-represented at Radford University. 

Statistically, this is beyond argument, but it's not exactly the students' fault that they were born white and middle class. What is shocking, however, is how many students think Radford is actually diverse. The field of experience for most students is so narrow that they do not even recognize how homogeneous their school really is! Radford students have grown up in Virginia, have not traveled, come to Radford right out of high school, and in other ways have not stepped outside of their comfort zone very much, if at all. Those that do belong to minorities are easily turned off by this ignorance, and stay away from Radford, perpetuating the cycle. Coming to this school from New York was a real shock. The lack of diversity in this school is not superficial."
College Freshman,1,"The people are arrogant and can't use their own brains to formulate their own thoughts, they're party going idiots. Not to say I don't party, but it's all students at radford are concerned about"
College Freshman,1,"Campus Life – Athletic centers are under par, no football team, lack of interest in athletics, and involved in a bad conference. Library is small and is constantly noisy. General Campus is in a beautiful area."
College Freshman,1,Not Very Good – The majority of the parking is across a bridge that is about a 10 minute walk from campus and can be creepy to walk across at night.
Niche User,1,"Public Transportation is definitely not good. You have to walk to get anywhere, luckily the town is small."
Niche User,1,Public transportation is limited but accessible at various times. This is an issue that needs to be redeveloped so that there is more transportation at night for students.
Niche User,1,"Either you walk or drive – There is no public transportation, either you walk or drive."

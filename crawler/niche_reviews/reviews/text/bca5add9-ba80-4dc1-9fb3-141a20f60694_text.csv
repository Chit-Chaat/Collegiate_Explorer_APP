Niche User,5,They are all so amazingly helpful and nice.  Not to mention the women's hockey coach was so amazing.
Senior,5,"I started there last year. They have been nothing but amazing with everything. Create communication, no run around and VERY helpful staff. They give you the time you need and always reply back in a fast time. I am really happy with Finlandia."
Niche User,5,"Sending my Son And Daughter in Law. I love the place. With sports and the turn over, The ones who left after one year are week glad they left! GO LIONS"
Freshman,5,This school is the most beautiful small school you can go to!!! I am a baseball player in the Finlandia baseball team and I have great times with all my teammates and I am so excited for the season.
Freshman,5,"I love the small class size! You can meet up with your professors during their office hours or make an appointment! It's a located in Upper Michigan and the best part of it is they embrace it. Finlandia is a private university, which is really nice. They have one building for dorms, two buildings for classes, a gym near by with a new weight room (it's really expensive and open all day!)."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I can not speak for every major, but the faculty in the art program are fantastic. The 300 & 400 level classes were very tailored to the student. I actually went on to receive my master's at one of the top art schools in the country and I always make the joke that my education at Finlandia was much more valuable."
Recent Alumnus,5,The community and campus is very safe and I never once had a problem.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Compared to other colleges, the dorms are pretty large with 2 people per room, 2 rooms share a bathroom."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Finlandia is exactly what you put into it. The teachers are very dedicated and if you show a passion for any particular niche field, the faculty will do whatever they can to support you. The school is also really dedicated to servant learning and giving back to the community with an annual trip to Tanzania, Africa and lots of volunteer opportunities."
College Freshman,5,The professors really get passionate about what they teach.
College Freshman,5,We as students do everything possible.
College Freshman,5,The new workout facility is amazing!
College Freshman,5,"Finlandia has a brand new work out facility. It comes equipped with everything from a weight room, a sauna, open gyms, cardio rooms and much more. Its open to all students not just athletes."
College Junior,5,There are lots of choices form fast food across the bridge to pizza delivered to the dorms. and a good mix of different types of food.
College Junior,5,I had a great experience! it was easy and I got what I needed.
College Junior,5,great parties. also ones close by at tech.
College Junior,5,We have excelling teachers who make our classes the best.
College Freshman,5,"Everything in the school seems to revolve around athletics, and not being in sports makes it harder."
College Freshman,5,"The student to teacher ratio is very impressive. Students often work closely with teachers, teachers ate often involved greatly in students lives."
College Sophomore,5,It is not difficult to get into a program
Sophomore,4,Finlandia University is a great school to go to. All of the professors are extremely kind. They all will know your first name and do whatever they can to help as long as you put in the effort too.
Junior,4,My experience at Finlandia has been great since the first day I arrived. I'm the first of m family to go away for college and play sports as well. I had no idea what to expect coming from California and then coming to school in Upper Peninsula Michigan. But the U.P. has grown on me and I love that place a lot. To me its an escape from California the real world things and just all the people and everything that's going on. I love LA but we don't have the same stuffs as Michigan does. I'm on the Men's Soccer team and have been captain. It's a dream come true to play in the collegiate level. Winning our independent conference my sophomore and also becoming #1 in the Nation for assists per game for 2/3 weeks during the season. I have made some great friends that I will forever know. I've met some great people out there in the town.
Sophomore,4,"Because the university is so small, the faculty and students are very close. There is are small community that feels like family. The professors are very kind and considerate. They know the material. The class sizes are small which makes learning easier. The campus is small and easy to navigate. The overall atmosphere of Finlandia is welcoming. It's a great school for someone who likes a small town."
College Senior,4,"The school is small, but thy are very helpful with assistance in finding jobs"
College Junior,4,The professors mean well and genuinely care.
College Junior,4,It is small but you make great relationships.
College Junior,4,Being an athlete slightly impartial.
College Freshman,4,Classes are small and the professors encourage students to talk to them is they are having trouble. They list multiple ways students can contact them.
College Freshman,4,"As part of the volleyball program, I have had a great time here. We had a decent season for a budding program. We just put in new men and women's locker rooms for the teams and have a new gym and trainer center that we are putting to good use."
College Freshman,4,"Finlandia is great! It is very,very small which is what I prefer, even though I wish it were a little bigger. It is located in a beautiful place, unfortunately for some there may not be a lot to do on the weekend. All the professors I've had so far are great and encourage students to visit and ask questions if they are having trouble. As an art major I can say that is pretty neat to have artists come once an month and display work in the gallery on campus and talk to the art students."
College Freshman,4,Its great but needs some rebuilding.
College Freshman,4,The school is amazing but it does have its downfall.
College Freshman,4,"Once enrolled in school and you get into the groove of school and campus life, it is what everyone said college would be."
College Junior,4,The staff on campus are friendly and there to help. Finding a time to meet with them that fits both your open times and theirs is hard.
College Junior,4,Its cute small town but i could never live in a small town like this
College Junior,4,"stuff is going to happen, but our school deals with it the best way possible"
College Freshman,4,I believe that we all have been well informed of the actions we need to take in order to be safe.
College Senior,4,The town is small and as long as you are nice to the locals they will be nice to you.
College Senior,4,The teachers are wonderful. Many of them have no problem relating to the students and are always will to help them when they need it.
College Senior,4,"It takes a while to get a straight answer of the financial aid office, but eventually the problems get worked out."
College Sophomore,4,Not too strict and rules arent out of the ordinary
College Freshman,4,The art programs are great the teachers are very good at what they do and are very open and helpful. In the classroom sometimes it can be a bit competitive with the very small class sizes.
College Freshman,4,"I received a nice scholarship and they match a church scholarship up to 1,000  "
College Freshman,4,There are a few house parties but the huge parties are over at tech
College Junior,4,No complaints with any of my instructors. the art department has a great staff dedicated to teaching the students.
College Freshman,4,They seem to have a wide variety of choices. There is always salad bar open if you don't like the meal.
College Sophomore,4,"the integrated (interior, product, sustainable) design major at finlandia university is a great program. you learn many many design skills and the instructors ready you for whatever you see after graduation. i could not be more pleased by the level of knowledge and dedication the advisor of this program has."
College Sophomore,4,"the integrated (interior, product, sustainable) design major at finlandia university is a great program. you learn many many design skills and the instructors ready you for whatever you see after graduation. i could not be more pleased by the level of knowledge and dedication the advisor of this program has."
College Junior,4,It is a safe area. The only thing missing is a shopping center.
College Junior,4,"There is a lot of housing. The only issue is when classes start back up, all the places are taking."
College Junior,4,They offer a wide variety of programs surprisingly for the size of the campus. I do wish however they would offer more class/topic specific courses so we could really get into our majors. But there is most definitely a fair variety!
College Sophomore,4,best parking university ever. small campus and student body. you can be late to class and still find a spot within a minute walk of your classroom.
College Sophomore,4,A good amount of scholarships are available to go along with the financial aid. very good experience and staff to help with applications.
College Sophomore,4,I went to Finlandia's International School of Business because I heard they are a growing school in marketing and other business degrees. Next spring semester I plan on getting an internship in Chicago through the marketing degree here.
College Sophomore,4,Always Available – Finlandia University is a very small campus so here you aren't just a number to the professors. The professors get to know their students by name and know what areas they are struggling in. Classes are very small so discussions are encouraged and is really helpful.
College Sophomore,4,Good Selection – There are apartments everywhere you look at a good cost! Some are a little expensive but there are others at a very good cost. You just have to look around.
College Junior,4,"Not Noticeable. When you get on campus, everyone is friendly. The only way you will see anybody drinking is if you go off campus. Everyone I knew that did drink and liked to party, they never stayed on campus to do it."
College Junior,4,"The Computers are really good. Sometimes take awhile to log on, but they are pretty quick and run smoothly. Printing in the computer labs are free. Wireless is normally good."
College Freshman,4,"Very Safe – I've been living in finlandia university residence hall for about 4 months now. There have been a couple minor insidences that happened, but all was solved. It is located in a great crime free area and a lot of the students, faculties and employers are wonderful people.There are always ready and willing to help no matter what the problems are. I have never felt unsafe here at finlandia. I leace my doem door unlock everytimes and not afraid of anyone walk in to steal. Its a very small campus which make it even easier to solve any crimes that goes on."
College Sophomore,4,"Off campus housing is available to you.  Depending on were you live, safety is always good.  There is not a very high crime rate around the area of the school.  The cost can be average to expensive, depending on your preference."
Junior,2,A lot of time and money is dumped into the sports.  The buildings are falling apart and the programs options are shrinking. There is some teacher bias during classes so you get a skewed experience in some of the courses. It seems like all of the good teachers leave after a semester or two and the ones that stick around are subpar or no long up to date in their field. Some key people have left the school and instead of replacing them someone else gets stuck with extwork that might be outside of their abilities. There are a lot of cliques. It’s worse than my high school was. A lot of the nursing students fail out of the program because of unhelpful teachers and shifting teaching methods.
College Junior,2,We don't have greek life.
College Junior,2,Not much goes on around campus. if there are events happening I never her about them other than Finn tv.
College Junior,2,"they are confusing, and unorganized. and the refund checks come SUPER late"
College Sophomore,2,Courses are limited at a small school.  The classes I need are not offered every semester and many courses I need/want are not offered at all.
College Sophomore,2,There is no criteria for getting into this school.  They take anyone they can get.
College Sophomore,2,"There doesn't seem to be a lot of crime, but the security staff is lazy.  Most students consider them a joke."
College Sophomore,2,There aren't a lot of places close to campus and the ones that are close are run-down and lack parking and involvement from the land lords.  There isn't a lot of crime in the area so I guess the area is fairly safe.
College Sophomore,2,"There are a handful of places, but none that have good food and within walking distance."
College Sophomore,2,no student involvement. teams are awful. no school spirit. special treatment for athletes.
College Senior,2,Most people do not believe that it is a real school because of the name.
College Senior,2,The campus is old and needs many repairs. There are many classrooms that have leaks in them.
College Freshman,2,"The dorm room are the second largest in Michigan, but the food is shit, security is a joke, the laundry machines are expensive and always broken, the lounges are gross...theres only one building and you're basically surrounded by the same 100 people all day everyday."
College Freshman,2,"Its a small town. There's a couple frat parties on fridays and saturdays, a club and many bars, but it all gets out very quickly and the good parties are always hit and miss. I almost prefer drinking with just a couple friends in the dorm because going out is so so."
College Junior,2,"very little student involvement, fan support, school spirit... There are quite a few student playing, I just feel bad when we go to games and there are like 30 people (if that) in the stands."
College Freshman,2,The buildings are old and outdated. Dorms are fairly outdated. 
College Freshman,2,"There are 4 parking zones front, side, gym, upper. You can't park in front after 12am or you get city and school tickets. Sidelot needs a pass. Gym you just can't park there. Upper is up a huge hill and like a death wish with crumbling stairs. I gave upper lot a nickname Mount-paavo."
College Freshman,2,Who what's to live in the UP except yoopers.
College Freshman,2,They are pretty old the art programs are nice tho.
College Freshman,2,Finlandia has small parties but most people go to tech for the huge parties.
Freshman,1,"I was there as an exchange student from Finland. There was a boat trip arranged for exchange students to a lake. A storm happened somewhere in the middle. Whose idea was it to go to a storm? All passengers had gone into the cabin and one seat was left, the unpleasant person who sat next to the empty seat insulted me and told me to go on the deck so i spent the rest of the travel on the deck where it was very windy. It was a bit close call. 

It is a rather homophobic place. Soon after i moved to the dormitory the word fag was carved in the elevator. I got called that quite often there, sometimes even by the ""teachers"". There was an openly lesbian who called me one too. Disgusting, one could think that lesbians would be a bit less hateful."
Alum,1,"Don't waste your money, go into the military. They don't care, your just a check. Look at the place. It's falling apart and costs to much."
Sophomore,1,"STAY AWAY. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE.  Do your homework (fight clubs in dorms, break&enters, assaults, sexual assaults, racial tension).
There is a reason this school is the doormat in sports. The university over promises and under delivers. There is no reason to bring in 55 hockey players other than to collect extra tuition. Even when a player is on the varsity team they are at risk of being demoted to the JV team. The university does not commit to the player once at the university. When the varsity coach says ""there are 45 players on this team"" there really is no team.  That is why they lose.  All other schools solidify a team of 25 players. Not here. Can only assume that this is an approved tactic by the university to collect extra tuition. Sour grapes? You bet, but look at the yearly turnover on the team. I am not alone. Awful unscrupulous school."
Freshman,1,"It is a small school.  That in itself is not a bad thing but its size does take away from the university experience.  Cliques are everywhere.  Worse than high school.  The academics are barely okay and not overly challenging.  In the end, a four year degree doesn't get you much.  Looking to transfer and having difficulty finding schools that accept Finlandia's classes. The athletics are not NCAA 3 caliber.  They can barely compete with JuCos in most sports. There is very little ""team"" in the teams as most recruits are not welcomed by senior players.  This could explain why they have difficulty keeping recruits.  If you are looking for a good college experience I would go somewhere else.  This has been a waste of time and money."
College Junior,1,It is the most miserable place on earth
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek Life.
College Junior,1,"we have a McDonalds, Tacobell, Culvers, Jimmy johns and a Dairy queen. -_-"
College Sophomore,1,"We have no Greek life.  Some of the houses at Tech allow Finlandia students, but very few bother."
College Sophomore,1,Little aid is provided and getting a clear response is impossible.
College Sophomore,1,"There have been violators of policies that have received no punishment.  People smoke on campus, right outside the dorms.  They drink in the dorms, but if the bottle isn't visible then it apparently doesn't matter.  If a club doesn't have enough participants, it is no longer considered active.  The website is only updated in certain aspects and is impossible to navigate so students don't know which events are actually happening."
College Senior,1,The dining hall on campus is only open at certain times. The food is always questionable. It has gotten to the point I only eat certain things and the salad bar is always iffy.
College Freshman,1,"THERE IS NO GREEK LIFE.

You can rush at a few frats/sororities at Tech that allow finlandia students, but its so troublesome that few of us even bother."
College Freshman,1,"We don't have a health care center, theres mental health care off campus. 

The security is a joke, but its not really needed either. Its such a small community, nothing terrible really happens."
College Freshman,1,It's hot during the first part of school but the winters are crazy the amount of snow is crazy. And there are no snow days. 
College Freshman,1,One of the best things about the school is the community sense. You get to know everyone who lives on campus and some off. The school is very isolated and there is not much to do 
College Junior,1,There is no Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,There are not many choices. They consist of mcdonalds and taco bell. Nothing for vegitarians which really sucks. This is a meat eater kinda town.
College Junior,1,There's not many places to go in the area. Everything closes early.
College Freshman,1,"Finlandia is a strong powerful school, locate din a town full of absolutely nothing. there is nothing to do in the town."
College Freshman,1,It's cheap for up here but expensive for students. You pretty much have to live in the dorms.

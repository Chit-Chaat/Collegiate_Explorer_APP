Graduate Student,5,"Walden has not only excellent programs, but excellent professors (who are all working in the fields they are teaching) and the support staff is out of this world!!  From Financial Aid to Veteran's Assistance to Disability Services, Walden has someone (an actual person) you can speak with to gain assistance."
Graduate Student,5,"Walden not only has professors that respond in a timely manner, but also has other student services where assistance can be obtained, such as the writing center, the lab, the library, etc."
Graduate Student,5,The classes that I am taking are real-world prep. The class on Business Architecture was very good and it touched upon topics that I have addressed in interviews with engineering firms and government facilities. That tells me that Walden has taken the time to offer courses that the student can immediately use in the workforce. Several of my classes have taught me programming and design and I could update my resume with this information. I love this!!
Graduate Student,5,My only regret is that I did not enroll in Walden back in 2017 after I received my master's degree. I spent 2 years at a different university and transferred to Walden in January 2020.
Senior,5,I am new to Walden University but I am so excited and eager to see all that Walden has to offer me. Walden is the university for me and I am proud to be a part of it.

They are accredited in so many degrees that will secure your future.  They have a student support system that is ready willing and able to help.  Great student advisors that will guide you down the correct path at all times.  Great university."
Graduate Student,5,"Walden University is an excellent online school.  The classroom is easy to navigate, and the professors have been outstanding.  I've enjoyed the coarse work, and it is very easy to fit school into my adult life.  I'm a wife, mother of 3 small children and I have a full time job.  Walden has made it possible to all of these things with minimal stress."
Graduate Student,5,The online coarse work is easy and leaves time for me to lead a full normal adult life.  The classroom is easy to navigate and there are many resources to help with older returning students who may not remember much about APA formatting etc...
Graduate Student,5,"I enjoy Walden University and the time I have spent at this school.  I completed my Masters degree in Nursing Education, which was beneficial to my career in nursing academia.  My satisfaction caused me to enter the PhD program in Nursing from Walden University.  My current work during the dissertation process will allow me to finish this degree in the next 9 months.  This will allow me to be a two time alum from Walden University."
Graduate Student,5,"The benefit of the online environment are the resources that Walden provides for each student.  Regardless of the time day/night, I realize that I can virtually reach out for technical support, faculty assistance or library information and receive a timely response.  The doctoral resources are also beneficial for the dissertation process and program outcomes.  This has been a good experience to complete my graduate degrees online."
Junior,5,I thoroughly enjoy the freedom that online learning creates. The classes are pretty streamlined. It's not common to have to purchase a lot of unnecessary and expensive books. They use a lot of real world content. Most professors are professional and work with students to best support them in their academic endeavors.
Sophomore,5,"All of the classes are online and they have so far been amazing. I love the professors, they are easy to work with and give some really good feedback. All of the professor are wanting to see you succeed. The online learning is easy. The supply the materials or links to materials. They have their classes organized and easy to follow."
Graduate Student,5,I've had a wonderful experience here at Walden University. The on-ground residency is off the chain. There are students from all walks of life and countries. Meeting them and exchanging ideas is extremely insightful. The whole Walden staff are vitally helpful to the student's needs.
Graduate Student,5,"The Professor is helpful and encouraging. Answers question that makes things easy to understand. Are open to listening to the student's point of view. Professors are empathic, caring, supportive, and ethical."
Graduate Student,5,"Walden University makes you feel like family. They are involved in your program with you. You have support from your peers, counselor and professors."
Graduate Student,5,The writing center is my favorite spot. They have tutorials and information to help anyone become a better writer.
Freshman,5,what i love about walden is that they give you different options and payment arrangments for classes and also they will help you get a job once you are fully done with your courses

Graduate Student,5,Professors are accessible and available by email in 24hours or less. I am approaching my 3 year as a Graduate student and am truly grateful for the online path I have chosen with Walden University.
Graduate Student,5,"Initially I thought online school would be an extreme challenge.  However, Walden University has alleviated those fears by providing consistent support throughout my time of enrollment. Without the accessibility and consistent availability of the advisors, online classroom participation and 24-hour support I would not be nearing the end today. Thank you Walden!"
Graduate Student,5,My online experience was exciting and creative so far and I look forward to continuing my education endeavors with Walden's PHD program.  I want to give credit to the caring professors that provide a comfortable space for the diverse community that Walden serves.
Graduate Student,5,"My online experience with Walden University was expiring and personal.   Walden University provides structured learning for all subjects by skilled professors.  The advisors are able to navigate the students to the proper destination of study, while providing the academic support necessary.  Walden is the oldest online University and provides accredited courses for any profession.  During the semester the professor was available to answer all my questions giving me the insight about the assignments.  I look forward to my next semester at Walden University as a graduate student of social work  studies.  I should be graduating 2021 spring semester and look forward to start my PHD courses in the fall.  I would like the choice of contacting my professor by video, phone, email, and texting according to the situation. Reaching for success is possible with the motivation, dedication, and guidance that Walden University provides with every stride."
Freshman,5,"The online blackboard is very easy to use and comes with a calendar to make sure that I never miss assignments. The teachers are great, and the information is organized in such a way that learning it all online flows very smoothly. The feedback on assignments is excellent, and I feel that I have really improved both academically and professionally thanks to Walden University."

Graduate Student,5,Walden University has a wide variety of programs that would suit any students career interest. They offer students both on campus and online classes which offer students the availability and the flexibility to work their education needs into any life situation. I found the cost of their programs to be similar among other universities. What I have found to be better at Walden University than other schools I have went to is the support system and networking opportunities they have available to all students.
Graduate Student,5,My online experience has been exceptional. The coursework has completely met all course objectives. The online course format is easy to navigate and there is no mandatory login times making it perfect for full-time employees and single moms like myself. I was undecided on career path and they were very helpful and supportive when I chose a pathway and when I decided to change my speciality. They made the transition seamless. I could not have asked for a better experience into graduate school.
Graduate Student,5,Customer Service reps are always active and responsive in a prompt manner. Updates are always accurate with calendar events as well as grading. Professors and colleagues uphold ethics and standards expected from a recognized college. I would definitely recommend it to friends and relatives.
Graduate Student,5,"I am about to finish my Masters degree in Public Administration (general) with two more semesters left. From day one, I connect with virtual advisors and professors confidently and I knew I would have no problem completing my degree. So far, I'm grateful I decided Walden University for my MPA. Classes, professors and colleagues are great. Ethics and standards in terms of responses and feedback are always upheld. Truly appreciate it. I would definitely recommend Walden Uni to friends and relatives."

Graduate Student,5,Classes are easy to navigate. All resources are easy to find on the website. Assignments are easy to turn in.
Alum,5,"I absolutely love Walden University. So much so that I returned for second degree. Both times my experience was great. With each experience it started with admissions advisor. She answered all of my questions and was quite helpful. Once you are approved to attend school, you have a live session to help you navigate their virtual learning platform which is very user friendly.  They are constantly improving their instruction, all of my instructors were well qualified and had their doctorates. The work load was manageable yet thought provoking. I definitely learned a lot during my experience. Each class was consistent in procedures which made the transition from class to class smooth. Overall I enjoyed my experience with Walden University. I recommend them to anyone who is looking to do distance learning. Like I said before, I enjoyed my experience and trust them so much that I returned for a second degree."
Alum,5,"Walden University has a remote learning school environment. This was perfect as I was working full-time and had a family. The schedule was flexible in terms of due dates, yet structured in a sense that allows you to stay on top of your assignments. The assignments provided thought provoking lessons using platforms that were current and applicable to everyday life. It definitely brought me out of my comfort zone in a manner that was safe and guided by highly qualified professionals. The instructors feedback was timely and precise enough to help me grow professionally and as a student. I really enjoy the diversity of the classroom. I’ve not only had classmates from different states but different countries. This is an experience I definitely would not have gotten from any of the schools in my area."
Junior,5,Awesome Faculty and Staff! They are always available and willing to assist me! I could not have chosen a better online university to complete my Bachelors of Social Work!
Junior,5,I love the classes and the flexibility of it. The staff members are very helpful and encouraging. I would strongly recommend Walden to anyone!

Graduate Student,5,I like how Walden goes beyond traditional outlines for PhD programs. Much expansion on how to effectively conduct research in each course is valuable beyond articulation.
Graduate Student,5,"Helping reach my goal in healthcare, so I can help others one class at a time. All classes fit my needs and help me learn all I can to help make healthcare better for everyone. Learning how to designs programs to help people in rural areas is my long term goal, because of Walden I will be able see that happen one day."
Senior,5,Over my years at Walden University has been great! Each professor is will to help you receive your goal of graduation!
Sophomore,5,"I like going to Walden University. It is my first-time experience being an online student, and Walden has a great plan that works for my lifestyle. I love the schedule and flexibility. Also, the available help is accessible; Walden has a 24-hour support line. There is a lot of training and webinar support. The student advising helped me too. I cannot express how delighted and satisfied I am a student at Walden. Being an online student gains me more knowledge using the computer. I was scared at first, but Walden helped me step by step to achieve my goals being an online student."
Graduate Student,5,This is a great school.  I do my courses online and the professors are great and Academic Counselors are also great.
Senior,5,I started my journey at Walden spring of 2017. It has been one of the best decisions that I have made. I love how I can access my classes from anywhere. My professors always respond back in a timely manner. Walden is simply a school made for working adults with families like myself.

Freshman,4,"I have experienced many good things at Walden.  My experience thus far has been more than I initially expected.  I have had amazing, patient, and well-experienced professors thus far.  The professors take the time to explain work as you need.  The classes are very diverse, and I've obtained a lot of knowledge throughout my journey. I look forward to my continued journey at Walden, and I'm thankful and appreciate the educational journey thus far."
Freshman,4,"When I first started my journey at Walden, I was nervous about completing a degree entirely online.  I wasn't sure if I would receive the knowledge I needed to obtain my degree solely online. As I advanced into my classes, I was delighted with the outcome. Walden has many resources that make online schooling a lot easier than I expected."
Junior,4,The academic experience is based on personal learning style and levels of intrinsic motivation. It is best for students who like and independent learning feel with some small input from a Professor. Deadlines are imposed and fairly so. The only drawback so far is the amount of time it can take to contact someone from the administrative offices.
Sophomore,4,I love the professors they are the greatest and always willing to help. The classes are great! Working with their financial aid department can be really hard. The technical support is amazing. I have loved going to this college.
Graduate Student,4,Walden University has been 98% online for me. The only time that I have had to be in person is for a Lab and it was only a few days.
Graduate Student,4,It has been enjoyable. Assignments are due with realistic time mandates and most professors provide flexibility.
Junior,4,Classes are well formatted. Instructors are knowledgeable and helpful. The 6weeks classes are not easy but worth the effort.
Junior,4,Classes are well formatted. Instructors are knowledgeable and helpful. The 6 weeks classes are not easy but worth the effort.  Classes are structured well.
Sophomore,4,The teachers are understanding. Some of the programs we have to download and use are a little confusing at first.
Junior,4,I have really enjoyed my experience at Walden so far. They have been responsive and I am challenged by most of my teachers. Taking one class on at a time really fits in with my life style and they offer the option to take more after you have completed the first few classes.
Graduate Student,4,I like the school and the classes.  The classes are on my time and having kids that makes things a lot easier for me.  They can be very helpful when I am having an issue.  Overall I do like the school and have been attending for a few years now.
Senior,4,Walden helped me to complete my bachelors online when life was so busy. I was working full time and still could complete my classes. The work load is the same as a brick and mortar school but with lots of flexibility. The professors are helpful and engaging. One thing that I would have to say was a downfall is being ready for my Praxis. I don’t feel that I was as prepared as I should have been
Graduate Student,4,Walden University is an amazing school. Faculty and staff are extremely helpful when needed. One thing I would like to see change is the course work. I would love more interactive assignments other than discussions and papers.
Graduate Student,4,"Good follow up with professors, good academic programs, helpful student assistant programs, semester graduate programs, timely responses."
Junior,4,Walden University so far is a great online program for the working person.  I feel that the concepts that are being taught have a great strength of understanding that will catapult me into a great career.   Time is not an issue with Walden University.  Each course gives you ample time to complete assignments and build a vast learning portfolio.  I wouldn't change anything about the university.
Alum,4,"My experience as an online learner at Walden University was great, as I had great professors who were very engaging; the workload was  bearable; assistance from staff and/or resources to succeed was always available; and the tuition is competitive.  In terms of what I'd like to see change, this would be how to find ways for ALL students who complete their degrees to be able to attend graduation OR at least incorporate the graduates name when showing commencement online."
Graduate Student,4,Great online learning platform and promptes student success. Extensive online library and access to databases.
Graduate Student,4,Thus far Walden University has been an excellent place to further my education based on my work schedule.  The flexibility has provided a pathway towards a better work-college-life balance.
Senior,4,I have meet a lot of professionals people that have help me throw these 4 year..I have never meet such caring professorsI plan on pursuing my masters as well.
Graduate Student,4,"Challenging, but help is available if you need it. Professors are knowledgable and helpful. Online classes make it easy for me to study and submit assignments when I am ready. I was able to get an extension on homework when I was ill, and I really appreciated that."
Senior,4,"Walden offers online degree completion programs, which are great for the adult learner. As an adult with a family and working full-time, Walden offers the flexibility I need for online learning."
Graduate Student,4,Walden has instructors that are very knowledgeable. On the other hand all of the instructors should be on the same page so there won't be any problems when someone else takes over.
Sophomore,4,"It's online and convenient. Also, the staff are very helpful and seem to really care what's going on with my progress."
Graduate Student,4,The instructors and advisers have been very helpful. I have struggled with mental health and they have done all they can to help me succeed.

I highly recommend this school for people who want to obtain their degrees but have a very busy schedule. Walden is flexible and is willing to work with you and your family!"
Junior,4,"Access to the university is very simple. The admissions process was simple. The cost of the university though is astronomical. On a five year program, I maxed out my loans by year four and am having to search for third party financial assistance or scholarships."
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed being at Walden. They have a lot of resources. Should a student spend time checking out their student portal and all of the resources, I am sure of their success. The intructors are great. They are very helpful."

Graduate Student,4,Walden has been an amazing experience for me; it has helped me grow educationally. It has also opened new doors for me and has created many different opportunities.
Graduate Student,4,"The classes are good, however the experience will vary based on the instructor. Some instructors are very dedicated and accessible, which aids in the value that you receive for your money. I also found that the knowledge, expertise and active involvement of the instructor impacts the overall experience as well. The classes are online so you have to put in additional effort to be social with classmates if you choose."
Senior,4,"So far the programs are right on schedule and faster compares to other colleges considering  the classes only last six week. Such approach to online education should be useful to anyone with difficult work schedule or limited on time. In any case, Walden approach lessen the problem."
Graduate Student,4,"I got my Masters and working on PhD at this University... Great school! My graduate study at Walden will contribute to me becoming a Psychologist with a private practice; my goal. The jobs that I have experienced has brought me to the realization that much is needed in this world. I think that this is the consciousness of social change; the changes in human interactions and relationships that transform cultural and social societies. That is why I consider myself a constant or lifelong learner. I feel it keeps me obligated to my future. The many roles of women, mother, student and partner keep me as a continuous learner."
Junior,4,"I was grateful that they helped me get back into school, and I have been happy with my classes thus far, however if I don't win this $1000 scholarship i will have to quit again. In would recommend Walden to anyone, they have been pleasant to work with."
Graduate Student,4,This is one of the best online universities! It has great professors and easy to use online library. The technical support is great and is 24 hours.  The online advisors are there when you need advice with any part of your online scholarly experience.
Graduate Student,4,"I applied to Walden University and within the same day I had emails and phone calls from people trying to answer my questions and help me make the right choice for me. I continued to e-mail questions to them and would have a reply usually within the same day. I have not started the schooling at Walden University, but if they are as helpful as they were in the beginning I feel it will be a good experience."
Graduate Student,4,Walden has been a very good experience.  Communication from instructors could improve with the grading process.  Academic advising is helpful and replies quickly.  Tech support is a available 24/7 and easy to contact.   The courses are easy to access and navigate.  Overall Walden is a good school !
Senior,4,I think that Walden University is a good online school to attended. I like online school over the campus because I can do my assignments before the due date and I can access the portal 24/7
Graduate Student,4,I obtained my BSN through Walden University online.  The staff is great and Walden provides additional resources so that a student can successfully pass all classes.
Graduate Student,4,I would like the academic advisors to be more responsive  They are often busy but sometimes it is over 48 hours to get a response from them.
Graduate Student,4,I was scared for online classes but so far so good. Walden's site is very easy to navigate and stay on task with not only classes but also financial aid and connecting with an advisor.
Senior,4,Walden help me in transitioning from Community College to University Online. I love Walden because the classes are online and allows me to maintain my personal and work schedules at my pace. The Academic Advising Dept. is there to assist when you run into bumps and assist in scheduling with the right department to get your situation resolved.
Junior,4,"Walden University is competitively priced, easy access, and does a good job with transfer credits (even if they're 25 years old). They have multiple paths available to finish credits beside their own courses, so you can finish even faster. Portfolio writing for credit for experience, CLEP, and even partnerships with other online college courses (that are very inexpensive) are available."
Graduate Student,4,Just started and so far it’s a great program. My first two courses are very rigorous and I hope to learn a lot from my professors.
Graduate Student,4,Walden has a been a great online learning environment and offers many graduate programs. The online graduate program allows me to work and attend school to reach for my goals while maintaining a family lifestyle.
Graduate Student,4,I love that I do not feel alone. They are always available for help and there to answer any questions. The writing center and library is amazing!!
Graduate Student,4,"This is my second term at Walden and it has been a wonderful experience thus far. I am completing my MS in Clinical Mental Health Counseling with them and with my busy work schedule, the online courses they offer have been very convenient. I feel that I am learning the material at a steady pace and am being challenged appropriately to grow as a future counselor. The staff has been very helpful and are interactive with students even though there is not a traditional classroom."
Graduate Student,4,"Walden's high academic standards promote a desire to strive for excellence. Even with an online university, I find it imperative that my classmates and I are nurtured in a healthy, ambitious path of growth in our academic endeavors."
Graduate Student,4,Online programs with expansive variety.  They are constantly changing things to help students have a better learning outcome.
Graduate Student,4,I like the online learning environment and the self pace. The cost is a bit high but the length of the terms are good at 3 monthsz
Alum,4,"Online schooling can be a bit challenging, but once you put your mind to it, you can achieve anything. What I liked most about going to school online was the ability to take school with you wherever you went. It was a major convenience."
Junior,4,"I wish there were more undergraduate scholarships. There are a ton for graduate school, but for the 2018 year, there are only two compared to 6 from the previous year."
Freshman,4,I have truly enjoyed my time at Walden University. The professors have all been so helpful with any questions I may have. The only thing that needs  fixed is the financial side but there are problems at every school with that. I look forward to the next 4 years until I receive my master's degree in psychology.
Graduate Student,4,I have had a great experience attending Walden University. I have learned a lot and look forward to furthering my career because of my academic experience
Senior,4,So far my best experience was my enrollment advisor and my first quarter class. Never heard from the next advisor. Financial aid dept was helpful. I am now taking accounting class which i will enjoy
Graduate Student,4,"I enjoy the fact that Walden University is so flexible with assignments. I still have to put the effort in to do the tasks, but for the most part I get to them when I can. It makes being a working student a little easier."
Niche User,2,"I started Walden some years ago and wanted to return to complete my education. I started turning everything in  for enrollment in June before June 13th so that I will start class online. When the week of June 13th came I was told Walden needed to verify my high school transcript again. Now mind you, I have already completed 2 years under them and have not went to any other school after them. Until this day, I still have not started school because they still need to verify information on transcript after the school I graduated from already verified information. I was told additional information is need and now here it is August and classes starts on 31st. I'm definitely going to transfer to another school and further my career. I know for a fact now that Walden is not going to honor the $2000 that I qualify back in June and not going to be able to attend class on time. I am disappointed because I thought this was a great school but enrolling process for a returning student  is sad."
Senior,2,"While talking a fine talk about quality, training leaders, and social change, Walden does not deliver. The academic rigor of many of my courses was lacking. Some professors apparently think that having a course online means they don't have to teach anything and one even had the nerve to tell me ""It's in the textbook,"" when I asked a question. I had read the assignment and needed additional assistance. A peer with a dangerous disregard for scientific method and facts, preferring to make all decisions based on gut instinct rather than studies and best practices, and who did not apparently retain any of the information from our courses, is graduating with me and will certainly be a detriment to justice as a whole if she maintains her current path. The capstone is at best a debacle and at worst unethical, asking students to draw conclusions based on literally no evidence pertaining to the question at hand. Courses in need of updating. Classes do very little tie in to social change."
Graduate Student,2,"Misleading and difficult to navigate. The program offerings are not clear. I was accepted to a program, only to find out that the program is not accredited as reported by the university. 
Admissions required several complex and inconvenient steps."
Graduate Student,2,"I have not been happy with this school since my enrollment. There is information given after the fact even when questions are asked. I didn't appreciate being hounded and called during my sleep hours when I made it clear I work night shift. An instructor is cheating out of a grade I earned because of a mistake they made. I wish I could undo my entire experience with this school. I started to suck it up and just finish my degree, but I cannot put my all into my work when I am not happy, and why should they get the money?"
Junior,2,It’s very hard to get aid money and they do nothing to help you. They encourage you to take out student loans and give you a crappy video about being responsible. They change advisors every month and the teachers tend to mix grades up. But you can go to class whenever you want in your pjs.
Graduate Student,2,"Course work is mostly self directed with some input from professors. Overall, the classes were fairly easy. Communication was somewhat lacking. I would like to see more involvement from academic advisors in helping students coordinate preceptorships for clinical ours."
Graduate Student,2,Poor faculty and glitches with there online Blackboard system. Since I have started it has been one problem after another. I have had better experiences with other online learning universities. I would not recommend this university to anyone. My class date have been changed a few times during the actual class. The class has closed out before the end date. The end date fluctuates. Everything seems to be nonchalant even though this is dealing with the livelihood of individuals. Investing time and money into programs that have this many mishaps is a downfall. The only good thing about the university is Mr. Hagy/Enrollment Advisor.
College Senior,2,"I have been very frustrated with the time it takes to complete assignments and balance work, school, and family responsibilities."
College Senior,2,"I would prefer the traditional classroom since I am a very visual learner. However, with the opportunity for weekly zoom meetings with my Chair and colleagues, the classroom has become workable for me."
Recent Alumnus,2,I would not choose this school again for my doctorate if I had to do it over because the doctorate course is designed to milk money from the students in the end. The true goal only becomes apparent once the clinicals and all of the courses have been completed. IRB intentionally request and or reveal requirements in a fashion that drags the course out for as long as possible.
College Senior,2,MGMT 6170 Was a course that I hope to never see again. I don't have a background in math or in excel. I struggle to get answers from the teacher and or other students.
College Student,2,"There are politics in academia. Students are not taken into consideration even if they have documentation and backup. The faculty forget that at the doctoral level, we are also their peers."
College Student,2,The workload is a bit heavy but the faculty is overloaded and cannot give enough help to each student. We feel lost.
College Sophomore,2,I have gotten no post grad assistance.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Overall, I would not attend this school again. It is simply not worth the money."
Recent Alumnus,2,I have answered this question repeatedly so far: I would never again attend this school and would not recommend it to anyone.
College Junior,2,"Was told about CLEP and life experience, never offered and never received. As a former nurse this was infuriating, I could be done with my degree by now and with less debt!"
College Junior,2,"Student center, as in online forum is all monitored now and you will be censored. If you have a complaint, do not dare talk about it! The library is also censored, cannot get access to half the materials I wanted; I suppose it did not fir their ""agenda""."
Recent Alumnus,2,I wanted to transfer but no one will take my credits from Walden.
Recent Alumnus,2,I don't think the school is respected academically !!!
Recent Alumnus,2,A few of the teachers would not bend even with the death of my husband
College Senior,2,"This is the most frustrating part for me, as I am currently 7 classes shy of my Bachelor's Degree and am completely out of financial aid.  Had somebody told me at some point that this could happen or was likely to happen, steps could have been taken to prevent it.  However, I had to find out on my own when I went to register for my last core class that I am 10,000.00 away from achieving my goal.  Each class is about 1300.00, making it easy to reach your lifetime maximum financial aid limit before you finish.  I have heard of this from other students in class discussions as well so I am not an isolated case of this happening. When I call for help as to how I can finish they say I can make a payment plan, or take out a personal loan.  I am hoping to find some form of scholarship to help offset some of this since my husband is out of work."
Recent Alumnus,2,The Fin Aid process is horrible and when looking for help getting things like grant and alternative aid there is no assistance what so ever that I've found thus far
College Junior,2,I feel for the price I am paying the education I have received thus far has been average and anything I have learned I have basically learned on my own.
College Junior,2,I have not felt that I have received any encouragement or assistance from my professors thus far. I feel as though I am self teaching and the instructors facilitate the syllabus and grade on a scale which is very vague and hard to interpret.
College Sophomore,2,"If you have a problem, the office of financial aid make you jump through hoops to get it resolved.  You supply everything they requested, then they still tell you its not sufficient enough. I literally had to have some extremely unpleasant interactions with financial aid office to get results.  They are very unprofessional."
College Senior,2,"The financial aid office did great in notifying me that I would be reaching my aggregate limit a few months ago. However, what they lack was access to resources to help me pay for my final class so that I can get one of the most expensive pieces of papers ever in the mail. I feel like they were like ""oh well"". I do not know what to expect and I feel like I was just left out there to fend for myself. Especially considering I only need assistance to pay for one class. Sure I was told apply for scholarships and apply for an aggregate loan. But...that's all you have to tell me? So now...I have finished my program and cannot get my diploma or transcripts until I pay $330."
College Senior,2,The quality of post-grad services leaves a lot to be desired. I am actually done with my program but do not have enough financial aid to pay for my very last class. I received a couple of notices and emails during my last class stating I would be suspended from getting any more financial aid because of my outstanding balance. I could not believe they did not realize I was actually done with the program and would no longer be needing anymore financial aid. No one has called to check in with me during my last class to see if I had any questions or concerns or to even notify me about my options to graduate or anything.
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid process since I have started college has been probably the worst thing out of the whole college experience. I had to wait till I was 24 to be declared independent from my parents in the state of Florida, even though I moved out when I was 16. Still, even now  the financial aid offices at any school seem as if they have no time to help you or guide you in any direction. This school has a page for FAQ, still very confusing. Financial Aid has to be my biggest enemy!"
Recent Alumnus,2,Too expensive. Few school based opportunities for money.
College Senior,2,"I chose Walden to avoid a long commute into Baltimore City. If I had known I would have to write papers 50 hours a week on-line, I would gladly have made the commute. "
College Junior,2,Tuition is high and financial aid only offer loans
College Student,2,Do not use many resources through the school.
College Senior,2,A few of the profs play typical games with grades
College Senior,2,The workload is appropriate and curriculum timely
College Senior,2,A doctoral program is expensive - no question
College Senior,2,It is entirely hit or miss
College Senior,2,Online availability and tech support are good
College Sophomore,2,"I need to understand clearly the financial aid process, I am in the final step and on the limit o my student loans, I write so many times to fin aid and thee is no reasonable response. I need money to finish my courses."
College Freshman,2,"I have had a lot of issues with the financial aid department. That has been my only frustration. My advisor is great, and so are my teachers."
College Freshman,2,Since I have started there have been a lot of problems with the online classroom. It is a little frustrating since it is an online school.
College Junior,2,There is no assistance with helping you get monies other than loans! Which sucks because grad school is very costly.
College Sophomore,2,I am in need of funds due to fact I am in graduate school. The tuition was a little high then expected.
College Senior,2,"I do not feel that the amount I pay is worth the education I am receiving. Especially from the lower core courses. Also, each year tuition creeps up, while the economy has not recovered, and this is a school who has much less overhead than a traditional school. I think that this school, along with most universities in the United States, are gouging students. Do we need to pay 1400 to 1500 for one six week course that is online?"
College Senior,2,The tuition is very expensive.  I just found out that my FAFSA requires me to verify my taxes.  The university never contacted me and let me know they needed additional information.  My financial aid has just been sitting there for two months with nothing being done on it.  Would it have been so hard for Walden to send me an email letting me know they needed more information?  I came across the information by accident when I was looking at my tuition.  This two month delay probably made me lose out on some financial aid.
College Student,2,"Online Students – Classmates are understanding of life situations as we all telecommute our education experience.  We come from all walks of life but are mostly working and family students.  Our responsibilities are to provide our families with the necessary means, therefore, classroom settings are difficult to work into busy schedules.  Online group work is extremely difficult and I disagree with forcing this on the online student body.  Group interaction is hard to coordinate due to time zone, employment, and schedule constraints across the board."
College Sophomore,2,"It is worth the money, but their promotional informational implies that they will take more transfer credits than they really do. This caused a major financial set back for me."
College Sophomore,2,"I have had my financial aid information selected for review both times I have submitted my FAFSA to Walden, afraid to submit this year, as their IRS link will not retrieve my tax information, when you enter it yourself off of your own tax documents, I have had to send the tax return and all documents that I filed with my taxes to the school, it is so time consuming, if a student is selected once and information is found to be correct, they should not have to go through that review process each year."
College Junior,2,Financial aid department is slow.  I have no idea why it takes so long for funds to disburse.  The term is almost over and then funds disburse.  They have no problem taking money away without notice.
College Junior,2,"They tend to come back to you with an answer very quickly, however, some of the things that they provide you with are not accurate.  I would give them a C."
College Junior,2,I lost my job and went to the career center for help but no help was available.
College Junior,2,Regestration is very easy. Actual class content is subpar. I find that I spend more time writing discussions and essays than I do actually learning course material.
College Junior,2,I believe that I should have gotten more pell grant than what my school awarded me.. According to the FAFSA website it said I qualified for 4200 but my school only awarded me 3500.
College Student,2,The school does not offer alot of help with finanical aid
College Junior,2,"Too much time is delegated to class discussions. If I did not have to write the discussions, I could actually take the time to study the material. I am attending school to learn, not to socialize. Also, some of the course content is weak."
College Sophomore,2,There is not really a campus because it is a strictly online school. They do have a location and business office and things. Most students aren't able to really use facilities at campus because majority are distance learners and the drive would take too long. I have heard good things though.
College Senior,2,"Not Happy – Treated like a number. 
Courses geared towards working nurse"
College Junior,2,"The financial aid department is helpful once you are qualified, but initiating the financial aid process is difficult and you are basically left on your own. The financial aid office is not helpful with providing scholarship and grant information."
College Junior,2,Does Not Manage Funds Appropriately – I feel that the financial aide department has given me too much money at times and should have spread it out more appropriately.
College Senior,2,"I'm a counseling major and for this program to be so important and have a huge impact on my becoming licensed in Texas, I do not feel prepared. It's seems that after completing half of the program, there is still something lacking."
Graduate Student,1,University offers two levels of online courses. Either highly tedious and involved or you're completely on your own. The prospective course loads  were overwhelming.
Alum,1,I completed my PMHNP though Walden.  They are a complete hinderance when it comes to licensing.  Walden give students no guidance on licensing.  It takes them 3-5 months to deliver necessary documents to the board of nursing.  I passed boards prior to graduation.  Walden cost me 5 months of employment because they cannot mail documents in a timely manner.  I would highly advise against choosing this university.
Niche User,1,"I thought I would like Walden University, but I didn’t. I struggled actually and it was hard to get assistance with anything. I dealt with losing my parents close together and requested a leave of absence. Not only wouldn’t do it, but now on the hook for the term because I failed. Trying to fight it, but they have screwed up my credit. I wish nothing but ill will towards them."
Junior,1,"Have had many issues with professors not responding to online communication. Also, I can't remember a time of having a friendly encounter with their financial aid and veteran's admissions department. Very much regret the money I've spent at this University."
Graduate Student,1,Judging from my experience with Walden University I feel that they don't really care about their students.  I fell that they are only concerned with the profits from attendance.
Graduate Student,1,"Potential DNP Student Beware!!!!
Obtaining approval for a capstone project is a painful, costly joke.  It takes at least 6mos  for committee to approve a project, committee members do not communicate, one makes revisions on your paper, the third comes back and denies even the revisions made by colleagues. It feels like a circus with you  in the middle of it. School policy gives each committee member 14 days to review your paper, by the end of a $2500  semester, you are stuck in the same spot where you started and have to sign up for another bogus 3 credit  $2500 dollar class where you do nothing but wait for approval. Although you are done with the DNP program, you have to keep re-enrolling until project completion. Complaining to the program director is a waste.  For a school whose mission is promoting social change, there is no accountability."
Niche User,1,"For being an online school, this University does not have a very good website. Everything you need is hidden and hard to reach while everything you do not need is in plain view. What also does not help is the amount of poor explanations you get from the staff about this system and the gross levels of undue superiority. Not recommended in the slightest."
Graduate Student,1,"I was an excellent student until Hurricane Matthew hit our City and destroyed our lives, and even now some of us have not gotten our homes repaired and many people are still homeless. When my grades fell from a 4.0 to a 2.57, I was dismissed from that school. Then they overcharged me, and now my loans are due."
Graduate Student,1,"I have been a student in the grad school for computers for 3 sections now. You HAVE to be prepare to do your own research COMPLETELY. They provide required resources that are outdated or just plain unavailable. Each term I have confronted the program director and each term gotten ""it's your problem"" when a resource is no longer available. At one point the Program director told me to use youtube.com for my educational resource. If you expect a top notch education in computers DON'T go to Walden. 
I tried to contact Laureate the oversight body, and their phone just rings and rings, no answer.. no service.."
Graduate Student,1,"So far the assistance is excellant, the work and assignments are easy to understand, they have very good resources that are necessary for a students growth overall a good choice I made to complete my education"
Recent Alumnus,1,"A webcast is all they offer unless there is a grad assistant opening, but you have to be nearly finished with a PhD to qualify."
College Sophomore,1,"Although the school provides you a list with places that other students have interned, the school does not assist you in finding a field placement site. Hence, if you live in a smaller area you are SOL."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Prior to graduation, I really liked Walden. Post-graduation, I wish I had gone elsewhere. A degree from them has not helped with my attempts to get into grad school. The alumni network is more interested with numbers than with actual alumni. It wasn't worth the money."
Recent Alumnus,1,I've not had any luck getting help with post-grad info. They kind of act like I don't exist. They are too busy building the number of alumni in the network to actually help anyone.
College Sophomore,1,They dropped the ball and I may have to drop out without additional funding.
College Senior,1,I am an international student so I am not eligible but received new student scholarship at the beginning but none there after
Recent Alumnus,1,My instructor /chair quit in the middle of the class and I still do not have an official instructor.
Recent Alumnus,1,Very expensive and there are no scholarships for current students !!
Recent Alumnus,1,I have had 3 chair persons within the last year. My last chair quit mid semester and they have not moved me to another class and I am the only one listed in that class. They will also not hear my case until the class is over. But isn't the class over if there is no teacher??? They are also not clear on the doctoral process and I feed as though they are not helping me advance academically. There is also no financial assistance for current or returning students only incentives for new students so they don't care about you once they get your money !!!
Recent Alumnus,1,"The cost of tuition goes up every quarter.  The financial aid department misleads you by saying that the school offers scholarships and grants, but they do not.  Some of the people working in that department do not know what they are talking about and they do not follow up with the student."

Junior,5,"The online experience was ok but thats cause we had no choice due to Covid, but over all the teachers have adapted very well and still made it easy to learn amidst the technical barrier that other students and some faculty were having."
Freshman,5,"I am a online student in AA Guitar, the best part is all the teacher who teach in school teach online to , this is my second semester and I feel like I am learning in physical school ."
Niche User,5,"Trying to get more funding for the independent artist. I love the school and the curriculum is fitting for my interests. I would like to attend the part-time independent artist program which equips the student with the skills needed to write, perform record and produce their own original songs in a personalized program that's tailor made to fit varied music interests and career goals within a 30-credit "" music boot camp"" to perfect your songwriting, arranging, production and promotion skills. This is my bucket list goal at 65 years of age."
Graduate Student,5,"This school improved me.
I was faithful to what the school offered, and it taught me a lot.
I learned so much many things there."
Freshman,5,Awesome music school ever in Los Angeles! The faculty are just amazing! They help in so many ways to achieve your goals.
Freshman,5,my experience at Music Institute is great so far is great I'm meeting great musicians. I love the atmosphere it's so welcoming i love how everyone is so open. the music that's played at the school inspires me to write more. i love how the school challenges me to be better. its' awesome every musician should attend this school.
College Junior,5,Being able to attend MI gave me the chance to learn what I've always wanted to learn and do what I've always wanted to do. The students and the staff are the most welcoming people in the world. It is my first quarter and everyone at the school quickly became my family. Truly the most accepting and judgement-free environment that you could possibly be in. The knowledge and opportunities that you get from this school if you work hard are so incredibly worth it.
College Junior,5,"The resources are honestly the best part of the school. USE THEM, USE THEM, USE THEM. State of the art equipment. Beautiful library. Incredible career center staff."
College Junior,5,"The workload is amazing. It's large, but it's amazing. If you truly love music, you will love your studies here."
College Junior,5,"I am in the Vocal AA program. It is especially good if you have no knowledge of how to read music - that was my personal gap/weak point. They'll start you at the beginning if you have to, but you can test into a higher class if you have a lot of knowledge on something already. No matter what your gap is (we all have one) the teachers will be there to help you find it and help you fill it."
College Junior,5,"The career services are AMAZING. The career counselors especially are top notch. They're always available to help you. Almost any question you might have, they'll find someone in the career office that'll be able to give you an answer."
College Junior,5,"This school is giving me access to knowledge that I have yearned for, for a very long time."
College Junior,5,"At MI, our student body is incredibly diverse. With students coming from all over the world, we've got an incredible melting pot that I am very blessed to be a part of. Every student is very unique. Everyone is welcome here. Bullying is unacceptable and there is no room for it at MI. A student or staff member will step in if it starts. We are all musicians from different backgrounds in every sense. We support each other and help each other along. I could not think of a better student body or a better school to be a part of."
College Student,5,"Michael Coleman has been great!!!!  I will start school Oct 6, 2014"
College Student,5,"I haven't started yet but registration is Sept 30, 2014 and I am so excited. My advisors has taken me through each step clearly and understandably. Financial aid was fast and easy although I am still looking for any scholarships available. I have toured the school and its amazing. My are there at my finger tips, I am a surviving cancer patient and MI has given me my new future back into life. Thank you Michael Coleman and MI"
College Student,5,Everyone comes from some place different. There are a lot of international students and students with varying beliefs and backgrounds. Everyone is accepted.
College Student,5,The students and instructors you meet here are your future colleagues. Everyone is encouraging and wants the best competition from you. The great friends you make here are ones you could end up working with.
College Student,5,"Because the bass program is small, there are not a lot of flexible hours for classes. But the general courses have a lot of options to choose from. There are many electives to choose from and some alternate each quarter."
College Student,5,The library is open for most of the day. The practice rooms are open 24/7 so we can practice no matter what our schedule is.
College Student,5,The bass program is fantastic. The instructors are always willing to help out with any problems. Everyone is always looking for a bassist to play with so there are new playing experiences. The bass program is the smallest at the school resulting in everyone getting to know each other very well.
Junior,4,Its been very beneficial for me. The teachers have been very helpful in my journey of growth and have tailored everything to my needs and helped me out in my weak areas.
Graduate Student,4,Musicians Institute is a great school for people who are passionate and/or have the drive to succeed in their field. It doesn't matter if you have experience or not they will teach you the necessary skills you need to succeed.
Freshman,4,"Musicians Institute has by far one the best facilities I've ever seen! 24 hour access to the school gives me the ability to record, and rehearse at anytime of the day."
Senior,4,"This is a great school .  There is a goood community  of musicians willing to work and are serious about music. You will meet a lot of smart , vivacious , ambitious, people at this school. This school is costy but provides many connections that are priceless."
Alum,4,Really great school just be aware of all of your options and what you are trying to achieve while you attend so you don't waste your time!
College Junior,4,"The school helps you find work after you graduate, also give good internships"
College Junior,4,"Teachers are amazing, private lessons are a plus"
College Junior,4,You learn everything you need to about music
College Junior,4,"Lots of fun stuff, great teachers, great opportunities at this school."
College Senior,4,I love how everyone is willing to work around your schedule to help make sure you have a great experience at the university. They're friendly and will not rush their time with you if you do not understand something.
College Junior,4,The school is expensive but worth it for the knowledge that you receive. You just have to be there to work. It's not a school where the degree gets you a job - the knowledge does. Put your all into it and it'll be worth every single penny.
College Junior,4,"It is MIs first year using a system that is completely electronic. I am lucky to have started school here at such an exciting time with a brand new system. The online courses were hard for me to use at first because I am a pencil and paper type, but with that being said - the courses are great. They make it easy to understand the material and have video demonstrations that help a lot."
College Student,4,I had good success with financial aid but expected to get more scholarships from cancer organizations. There is a lot of competitors out there. Being sick with cancer 11th and 12th grade I lost a lot of time. I am still looking to get the funding I need.
College Student,4,Tuition is expensive and the staff works hard to make it worth your money. There are many services offered to help save the students money and even free pizza sometimes.
College Student,4,It is in the middle of Hollywood. The surrounding businesses offer discounts for students and faculty.
College Senior,4,If it weren't for the amazing people I've met there I wouldn't think it was a worthwhile experience. It's been great soaking in all kinds of different information on music through the student alone. I've learned as much from them as I have the teachers and they're plenty of fun!
College Senior,4,I love how much this school has challenged me how much it's helped me become a better player. Being able to perform in front of people everyday and learn from amazing teachers/students has been incredible. 
College Senior,4,The library has plenty of computers and there has always been plenty available when I needed one. Printing and network reliability is great as well. Most of the computers do need a few minor updates for some of the applications though.
College Senior,4,"The student affairs office is always a good place for me to go if I have questions for them-always helpful. There are a decent amount of events at the school, but I definitely wish there were more. The library is a brilliant place for me to get things done and get some equipment that I need to use here and there. I do think the campus could use a good makeover as well."
College Senior,4,I haven't had to worry about transferring credits. The classes are great but some of the curriculums could use some work/revision. I do think that there is a lot of information that is crammed into a small period of time as well which can be frustrating.
College Senior,4,"I have improved tremendously since I started attending the Musicians Institute. The facilities are great and so is the location, but the real kicker is the fact that we have an immense amount of spectacular teachers, learning opportunities and stellar students/peers. "
College Junior,4,"There are so many unique things about the Musicians Institute. Its honestly, what you make of it. You get what you put in. All the resources are there at your grasp. Everything's up to date, and you'll always want to learn more. The knowledge and networking never ends!"
College Junior,4,"I love all the resources available. In this school everything is at your reach. The library is full of information, and technology to get you through your day. They have recording studios, practice rooms, dance studios. Everything and anything you'll need or want. They definitely have. I absolutely love this school."
College Junior,4,"I chose this school because it's a school that revolves around contemporary music. Music is constantly changing and this school recognizes that. They help you succeed in the real world from the first day you start. They're not only training you in your musicianship, but also your ability to succeed in the competitive world of music."
College Junior,4,"Great Network System – The career center helps you a lot to get what you want, and the alumni system helps connect musicians all over. It really helps you get out there in the real world of music."
College Senior,4,"Everything You Need Is There. Musicians Institute is very technologically adept.  It has to be in order to be a relevant music school in Hollywood.  The school's library has iMacs at every desk where you can hook in and play along with songs that you're learning while looking up online.  The internet speed is always good, plus wi-fi is readily available in all school buildings that you can log in to with a lap top or smart phone with ease and it's always reliable.  Printing is available in the library, but it does cost 10 cents a page to print or copy.  However, this is ok because there no longer is a printing/copying fee added to your tuition."
College Senior,4,"Assistance Is Everywhere. The faculty is very involved in hearing the student body out.  Our class sizes are small, plus they have open counseling times where you can meet with them personally.  I feel I really know each and every one of my instructors, which really enhances what I learn from them.  As far as the curriculum goes, I know I've grown greatly as a musician during my two years at Musicians Institute.  I've been exposed to many new styles that I couldn't previously play, plus there has been enough repetition and connectivity between the classes that concepts have been reinforced and absorbed.  The class registration process was good when you met individually with someone, but now the school has shifted toward an online model.  It's still very new, and there are a number of hiccups in the system because of the transition.  In the end I've been able to get all the classes I want."
College Senior,4,"Open Minds and Open Ears. Overall, the school is wonderful.  The teachers are incredibly knowledgeable and approachable, and the school provides open counseling sessions with them so that they're at your disposal.  Occasionally there's a teacher that doesn't seem so prepared, but I get through that by studying harder.  The curriculum is flexible in the fact that you can take most of the classes in any order you like.  It's also great that the dean of the bachelor program holds meetings each quarter to gain feedback from the students on the curriculum.  Many improvement have been made to certain classes in light of these meetings.  I think that's invaluable.  

Transferring credits was easy, although the school initially transferred a certain amount, then later called me in saying that three of the courses did not count.  This occurred when the current dean took over for the now retired one.  

One criticism I have of the financial aid department is that I wish they would alert you as to when your loan reimbursement check arrives."
College Senior,4,"I'm a current student, but I've already obtained work thanks to the artists and career services department at Musicians Institute.  They constantly bring in the top musicians business people in the music industry to speak to us, put on clinics and even meet with us one and one.  This is both open to students and alumni.  Networking is fostered here like nowhere else."
College Senior,4,"There Is Always Equipment and Facilities on Had at Any Time – No matter what instrument you play, you are always welcome to use the equipment of practice rooms at the school."
College Senior,4,This school has nice facilities. Everything is in top shape. Really nice.
College Senior,4,"Just What I Imagined – I'm a vocal/vocal performance major. Classes are just what i expected. You get to do everything they list in the brochures, pamphlets, etc. There's nothing there that doesn't have to do with music or my program. Very interesting and i love it. The work is not too too overwhelming; just do your absolute best and you'll get what you came for."
Recent Alumnus,4,Mad Friendly – everyone there is generally extremely nice and close its a really small school
Recent Alumnus,4,"I Dig It – i like it but its a generally small school in a very big city not much for that, it has a lot of great school functions and an amazing amount of talent between the teachers and the students, being in hollywood they get a lot of great artists to come do Q and A's, also they get a lot of great performers. It's a great school just be ready for the big city and a big learning curve."
College Senior,4,Great Resources and Very Reliable Computers. Everything gets done in a quick manner and it is very efficient.
College Senior,4,"Many Resources Available – The library never ceases to amaze me. I have instructional books, dvds, cds, and articles that are available to me anytime. The school is open 24/7 so I can practice drumming whenever I want. It's great."
College Senior,4,"Mad Connections! The school is dope. there is really none like it. All the teacher are musicians and you can tell. they are all industry professionals and they know what they are talking about. Its very relaxed, but competitive and fast paced. Also i am making really good connections here. We are pretty much in the centre of the entertainment universe so you will always meet someone that knows someone, This to me is the real reason why i choose this school. Not only as A placed to learn, hone my skills and mature as an artist, but because it provides an environment where collaberation is encoureged and almost fored. Thats how things are in the industry.So I feel MI is More like a bridge into the industry for these reasons. Well if your dope it is."
College Senior,4,I Like the School – Profesional environment with many learning cabalities.
College Senior,4,They Help Out a Lot! Love how they email you the gigs avaliable for you to audition for. If you need anything they will help you get eveything together and for the auditions they tell you what you need to do. Great help!
College Senior,4,"No Big Issues – The computer network is good. Internet is pretty fast and never had a big issue with the computers. Love that they have basic computers in the front and at the back they have computers in which you can plug in your guitar, bass, or mic. Good stuff!"
Sophomore,2,"I am a Bachelor Vocal Student here, I can't speak other people's opinion, I do think the certificate, independent artist program..the shorter programs are better choices. But I have been here almost 2 years I think I can speak my own experiences. First of all, for the vocal students, there are so many difference styles you have to do, mostly Jazz, latin...They don't focus or try to develop your own style as an artist, which can be boring . Second of all, they are trying to make the program so academic, but they don't have many teachers to teach the more academic classes such a theory, history... Lastly, I just feel like most teachers here don't really care about students,  Most of them they are unprofessionals, sometimes rude, ....They don't encourage students, it's just a bad environments to study music, oh, and a lot of stuff they teach are so out of date. I am here only because there aren't many music college out there."
College Junior,2,i love my classes but they do not make is easy for students in access to equipment needed to complete there studies
College Senior,2,Though our the tuition has been raised and the school is accepting thousands more students I have yet to see any improvement to the facilities. The low number of available scholarships is lame.
Alum,1,"My experience with M.I. was pretty much the exact opposite of most reviews from students/alumni. I struggled heavily when it came to my studies, and found that most teachers and students wanted nothing to do with you if you weren't already at a certain level on your instrument. The people there really know how to make someone feel stupid when someone is inexperienced or trying to learn something new. I felt very discouraged being there, and found it to be a very cliquish and cold environment. Impossible to make friends or any type of connections. I'm currently stuck in non-music related day job and have struggled to get gigs due to the lack of help and guidance I needed. It seems like administrators only want to hear positive stories about graduates who succeed after MI, and have no concern with those who are struggling. Forget about any type of career assistance or job placement; anyone who receives assistance is someone who can make the school look good and attract new students."

Sophomore,1,This is not a college . This is a scam . We were told the tuition was 11k a year because we qualified for some grants.   Few years later we got a bill for over 100k   . Yes 100k    penalties and interest.  I will b sending a formal complaint to the department of education.    Go to any other school

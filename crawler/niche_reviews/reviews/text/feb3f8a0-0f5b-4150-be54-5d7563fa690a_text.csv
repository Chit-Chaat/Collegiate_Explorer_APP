Freshman,5,I wouldn't change anything. My instructors and professors were always readily available at a moment's notice.
Freshman,5,"Even though I took all of my courses online, my instructors and professors were always readily available if I had any questions or I became stuck on a certain assignment."
Freshman,5,I am super excited to start my online classes online with Medaille college. I am a freshman but I feel that my online learning experience will be great.
Freshman,5,I heard back within 2 business days after applying  saying I have been accepted.Admission Team is very kind and helpful.
Senior,5,My professors were there to help and posted lectures letting us know what is going to be on test. It was difficult at first but my grades are As and Bs.  By working hard and the help of my professors I got a 3.28 GPA. I don’t think any other college would have gave me the same support like Medaille.
Senior,5,I like the professors they actually care about you and wants you to do good. You meet amazing people that will become long lasting friendships
Niche User,5,I was in the Accelerated Batchelor's Degree Program years back and the experience was incredible! Student to teacher ratio was 2nd to none.
Freshman,5,"Extremely fast for admissions, helpful staff that answered my every concern and questions, and valuable resources."
Niche User,5,I really appreciate people working with me for my finacial issues. I also like that they have on campus and online classes
Niche User,5,"I started at Medaille in the being of 2019 ( Spring 18-19). From the start, they were so nice and very helpful. I am now 4 classes in and I absolutely love it. I am currently taking an online course and all my Professors are super helpful and awesome. I cant wait to see what the rest of the year may bring."
Freshman,5,"I have experienced very nice, professional, and helpful people at Medaille. Everyone as a whole has been very kind to me, answering any questions I may have had. The school itself is very beautiful from the inside and out. I like the location of the school and the majors they have to offer. It also has many different clubs to join. Each being run by students. The is very organized and simple to navigate. They have very nice dorms that seem to be very clean and managed.  It has very well arranged parking lot. Easy to navigate through and simple to travel around. I was able to get my schedule months prior to school beginning. All students I have encountered have been nice and well mannered people. All teachers I've come into contact with have also been very professional with me answering any questions I may have about the school, how things may be run, where to get certain things from, and where to meet certain people. Being at Medaille has been an overall amazing experience."
Freshman,5,"I love the energy Medaille has to offer when you first step foot in the campus. I was just a curious non decided guy looking for the perfect college for me. When I first visited Medaille I immediately was drawn to the classes I was interested in. I now am attending Medaille for the majors Veterinary Technology/Biology. The only thing I would change about Medaille is how far it is from home but other than that, I love it!"
Senior,5,Medaille is a very small campus of only 3 buildings. The class sizes can range from 7-30 kids in a class depending on the class type. The professors are always willing to help you and there is always something going on to do at Medaille.
Graduate Student,5,Class are small. Professor are very caring and take time to listened to you and help with any problem.
Niche User,5,This campus and the staff are very warm and welcoming. Being in North Buffalo you're super close to the best hangout spots in the city. The smaller campus allows for a real personal connection to all of your staff and there's never a day where you just go into a lecture and find yourself surrounded by strangers. The staff truly care about you and help to push you to be the best you can be.
Alum,5,"I was in the Veterinary Technology program at Medaille College. I found that the professors in the department were amazing and they helped me become involved some really interesting experiences such as interning at the County Fair, volunteering at a rescue farm, a wildlife rehabilitation hospital, and several necropsies outside of school. The classes really helped prepare me for the VTNE and all of the professors were so dedicated and helpful."
Niche User,5,"I have not started school there yet but visiting the campus was very nice. It was very beautiful, and the people were very friendly"
Senior,5,"It was an over all a great experience. I graduate in December.  I am looking forward to get my next degree attending Medaille College, and furthering my education."
Niche User,5,Medaille is a great college. It is very small and personal. Everyone is very helpful and I can't wait to be a part of this college
Freshman,5,I have almost completed my freshman year and I love everything about Medaille. The class sizes are small and the environment makes me feel very safe and at home.

Sophomore,5,"I love the teachers in my Vet Tech program, they make it all worth while. It's a great college all around!"
Junior,5,I absolutely love this school. Class sizes are small and the professors really want you to succeed.  As a transfer student they took a great amount of credits from my previous school which helped me better on track to graduate sooner.
Freshman,5,What I like about Medaille College is the atmosphere. The faculty work with everyone as much as they need to. Medaille is in a good place of Buffalo. Medaille offers a wide variety of jobs on campus and education opportunities.
Sophomore,5,Medaille is a great and quite campus. You are able to be focus in your work and have a great college experience. They have the best programs to get you where you need to be in life and have amazing professor that will help you with anything. I love this school and so glad that I am attending Medaille a second year. 
College Junior,5,The vet tech program and is ran and taught by professionals in the field currently. I love how much I learn and get to experience.
College Junior,5,I have never been offered drugs on campus or from anyone I know from campus.
College Junior,5,It's the only school anywhere by me that could open doors to be accepted to a good veterinary school.
College Freshman,5,I never see any discrimination against anyone. Everyone is very accepting.
College Freshman,5,Everyone I know that has went to Medaille has always had great job internships that took them into their field very quickly after graduating.

College Freshman,5,Like the smaller class size
College Freshman,5,I love going to school at Medaille!

College Sophomore,5,"Being a transfer student, I had an entrance interview and that gave me a chance to be seen as a person, not just a piece of paper."
College Freshman,5,"My school is very small, which is comforting and more intimate. All school policies are reasonable and followed."
College Junior,5,I love it . So broad
College Senior,5,"security guard always on duty, very attentive"
College Senior,5,"Rochester campus, classes tailored to adult working students"
College Senior,5,perfect for working adults or adults with children.
College Senior,5,It's perfect for what I need as an older student looking to get my degree
College Senior,5,Buffalo has the best restaurants and something for everyone
College Senior,5,There's always abundant parking as I get to school at least 1 hour early and have never had a problem
College Junior,5,Public safety is always around.
College Sophomore,5,i would if i had the money
College Sophomore,5,i can't wait to join something

College Sophomore,5,the best i have ever seen
College Freshman,5,"Absolutely love Buffalo! There a lots of college kids around, perfect college town. Awesome night life and extremely friendly people! Glad I chose to go to school here."
College Freshman,5,I am challenged on a daily basis. 
College Freshman,5,"Buffalo is a dying city, so jobs are hard to come by. "
College Freshman,5,I got an increase in aid just for dorming. 
College Senior,5,"I really can't tell you, because I donot dorm"
College Senior,5, I love it there.
College Senior,5,  There is never a problem finding a parking space.
College Senior,5,"   I use public transportation to and from school and have no problems, there is also school transportation to transport the students back and forth between the campuses."
College Senior,5,      The approximately to different areas to eat is excellent.
College Senior,5,"     The registration process is smooth, as I said previously, it is a challenging program it helps you think and their are classes that help you learn the best way to study, the most popular area to study is the library."
College Senior,5,"    The workload is intense and quit a challenge, but there is help everywhere,  everyone at the school would like you to succeed."
Freshman,4,My experience so far at Medaille has been great. All of my classes are online which has been very heplful for me. My teachers have been great.
Sophomore,4,I'm glad I go here. The only thing I don't like are the algebra prof's I've had but otherwise a great school.
Junior,4,they made the transition from high school to college very easy through the summer scholars program that they have. I actually felt prepared
Junior,4,"I am an online student, I enjoy the curriculum so far. I am majoring in Veterinary Technology and I like the program so far. I am only aware of the online experience, I wish I lived closer to be able to attend on campus."
Freshman,4,"Great school, good environment, small and very diverse. Good vibes and very friendly administrators."
Freshman,4,Going to Medaille College was my best decision because I go to meet new friends and the absolute college experience. I love meeting everyone from college and making memorable memories that I know I will cherish forever. Something that I would like to see is the amount of money to go down..
Senior,4,"I like that’s it’s a small school, just what I was looking for but over time you see the flaws...the academic advisors screwing kids causing them to have to stay 9 semesters and the professors they find off the street that have no business teaching. This was what I experienced in the bio program the vet tech program was pretty put together and I was quite satisfied with my education in the program."
Sophomore,4,"Medaille is a very small school , which is not a bad thing because it allows for small class sizes and more help from your professors. The teachers and staff are dedicated to making the campus feel safe and it is a great institution to learn at."
Freshman,4,"Very good school, Literally everything you need is here at the school, professors care for students, students are friendly"
Sophomore,4,"I chose Medaille for the small class sizes. This school is a great option if you want the smaller class sizes. Since the ratio of students to faculty is similar to a high school setting you get more time with the professor, and even outside of class time you tend to have a good opportunity of communicating with them in their office."
Sophomore,4,"I have recently just finished my first year at Medaille and it was better than I ever could have expected. Before entering my freshman year I had began to second guess my choice of school and academic field. But upon arriving on campus I was reassured everything was going to be okay. The teachers are beyond helpful both in the classroom and outside of it. They made the transition from high school to college so easy! The small campus gives a sense of a community atmosphere. Everyone is so friendly it seems like you have a friend every where you go. The athletics of the school is probably my least favorite part. The school is division 3 and offers a decent amount of sports teams, but I wish they had more. There are a bunch of clubs at Medaille and the good news is, if they don't have one you like, you can start your own! There is always a lot of things to do on campus but I feel like there is not enough notice."
Graduate Student,4,I’ve recently graduated from Medaille College my experience overall went went well I had small classes felt as if the students really got to get the professor very well my other experience was getting to school was ugh at times but overall enjoy the school
Senior,4,"I loved the fact that the class sizes were small. In my 4 years there, I never was in a class that had more than 20 students. I believe that having a smaller learning environment helped me stay focus and I was able to connect with my professors better. It was also nice that there were only two buildings where classes were held so I never had to worry about getting lost when I was a freshman."
Sophomore,4,"the College classes are smaller to tailor to your needs.  There are always professors eager to help students with their subjects. The dining area is clean and always available for students. I play Sports for the College,  and my experience with the coaching staff has been excellent. I will always remember the great years at Medaille. I haven't lived on Campus for every Semester, but during my sports season, I was able to Dorm at Medaille .  That was a great  experience, we felt safe walking the Campus at night, and the availability of Study areas was good.  Our rooms were roomy enough and well kept.  I have had great experiences here,  and would highly recommend to high School students looking for a School that is smaller, more personal,  and has caring professors."
Freshman,4,"Very nice teachers and staff. The Admissions office was very kind and helpful through the whole process. Campus is small and very friendly, easy to find your way around."
Freshman,4,Medaille College is a really good school. Especially if you are a Vet-Tech which is the most the most popular major there. The school is very small so if you like a small environment then this is the school. The professors is really nice and very caring not all of them are maybe a small percentage. Other then that Medaille is a good school to attend.
College Junior,4,"Just a reminder , I do not live on campus, but the times I have been on campus, I've not seen drug abuse, or the use of any drug open in public on the campus premises.  There are disciplinary actions taken for the use of illegal substances."
College Junior,4,"I love the class sizes, instructors are decent, and well versed in their fields of study.  Remember I started my classes in January 2016, and there was one instructor I had problems with dealing with my assignments and classroom presentations , and overall classroom experience.  I really thought it was because I was the only female in class, which was led by a male instructor."
College Junior,4,The school is ok good school to go to if you are employed full time and have a family.
College Junior,4,It's great for my programs which are biology and vet tech.
College Junior,4,Everytime I have ever been on campus I have seen a security guard or atleast van
College Freshman,4,"The workload is a lot, comparing high school to college, and is hard to handle with a job. I couldn't imagine like some people with children and a job coming to school. It's hard enough for me as it is."
College Freshman,4,A lot of adjunct professors are hard to get a hold of and it is hard for my school work.
College Freshman,4,"I do not live on campus, but I do enjoy the food we have there. I think we have a good variety from a cafe to all different options in Freshens. I think more variety would be a good option though."
College Freshman,4,"I love how convenient the location is to home and how some people who can't commute everyday, like I do, can dorm on campus. The campus is very small and has a lot of clubs and sports to offer for those who want to join. The professors are accessible most of the time, it's just the adjunct professors are hard to get a hold of to meet up with you. Other than that, I love Medaille College and it would still be my number one choice if I had to do it all over again."
College Junior,4,i like attending sports events here
College Freshman,4,Get a lot of internship opportunities
College Sophomore,4,I dont feel as though there were too many questions or too high of expectations for this application.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are pretty small but come with furniture which is a good thing. Everyone is nice to each other on campus and the cost is reasonable. its close to the café and classrooms and they provide cleaning products to help keep our rooms clean.
College Freshman,4,"WE have a few different sports at medaille college. I don't know much about it because I'm not into sports, but from the looks of it, our team members know how to work together and never give up."
College Freshman,4,Vet tech very diverse and is most popular major on campus. Most popular because almost anyone is let in.
College Freshman,4,"Very similar to my high school, small and close. Many people know each other. Classes are pretty easy."
College Sophomore,4,The vet tech program requires students to do 2 preceptorships to make sure it's what they really wanna do.
College Freshman,4,Love that we have our own bathrooms
College Senior,4,The online professors have been very knowledgeable and helpful.
College Senior,4,I will be starting an internship next fall which is required in New York State for psychology. I think it will go well and be a good networking opportunity.
College Senior,4,"I have been very satisfied with the online experience thus far. However, I do wish there was an online/video lecture."
College Senior,4,Medaille's online Health Information Program is geared towards working adults like myself. I enjoy the small class size and the convenience of having access to my coursework  24/7.
College Freshman,4,"Although the school does seem small for the price, I do believe they would be higher with more to do on campus.  They need more extra curricular sports with more focus on having sports fields closer than what they are making it easier for freshman to be able to compete.  Academics seem challenging, especially for someone who has never taken them that serious.  They have forced me to be better prepared for each class and assignment done early just to stay on track and for that I'm grateful."
College Freshman,4,"So far I love it. The size of classes is perfect and I have so many professors who want to see me succeed. Great vet tech program I have already learned so much, definitely perfect choice for me."
College Senior,4,Professors want you to succeed.  They have real world experience in their subject.
College Junior,4,"I am a veterinary technology major. My school makes you do 9 essential tasks on top of a final. Even though it's stressful, the point of the tasks is to make me the technician that knows what I am doing upon entering the workforce. There is a community college a little far but it's not a horrible drive. It doesn't appear to make you more prepared for the job."
College Freshman,4,Its not too bad. Elmwood is close and has a lot of options.
College Freshman,4,The party scene is great. There are parties at a lot of places near campus and downtown.
College Sophomore,4,Living on campus was fun you got to hang out with your friends all day and the dorms are so close to the main hall that no matter how late you slept in you still made it to class on time.
College Freshman,4,"I don't typically eat at or around my school. The most I usually grab is a smoothie on campus, but there are plenty of decent options off of campus."
College Freshman,4,School spirit is high. The school sees health and fitness as important. There is also a gym on campus where students can work out.
College Freshman,4,"There's plenty to do in Buffalo. I've lived in Buffalo since I was little. I can't remember a time I was bored. Public transportation is pretty good around here, making it easier to get from place to place."
College Freshman,4,I never feel threatened on campus. It is a very safe environment and security stays on top of things.
College Sophomore,4,It was a good exsperience
College Senior,4,"There is a large amount of student diversity although students tend to intermingle instead of being split into typical cliques. Overall, the attitude of the college tends to be more open-minded and accepting of all beliefs and lifestyles."
College Senior,4,"One thing that makes this college unique is how personal the professors are with their students. Many of the professors (in my department) are on a first-name basis with students and they genuinely seem to care about what is going on in their students' lives. At my previous college, professors didn't seem to care if students were struggling in courses due to personal or family problems; at Medaille, a majority of the professors show genuine concern if a student is struggling or misses a significant number of class days and many are available after class for help with subject matter or to offer advice."
College Senior,4,"There is a variety in terms of the ages of students; for example, it's not uncommon to have a student freshly graduated from highschool in the same class as someone in their 40's who is going back to school to start a new career. In terms of relationships there is also a variety, with as many students who are single as those who are married or in serious relationships."
College Senior,4,"This program requires two internships, one for 60 hours of observation the first years of the program and one for 90 hours hands-on the second year. My advisor gave me a list of clinics, hospitals, and animal shelters in the area that would meet all the qualifications of the internship and was helpful in helping me choose one that would work best for me. I was allowed to complete it over the summer before starting my first semester at college which helped in terms of not worrying about having to plan an internship around a class schedule."
College Senior,4,"As a Vet Tech major, the courses are very challenging and it's common for students to change their majors during the first year. If you are willing to work hard though and put in the effort studying, it is definitely worth it. The information is very interesting and being able to work hands-on with the animals instead of using models is very helpful. Many of the faculty and staff are on a first name basis with students and are compassionate and supportive of students with academic or at-home issues."
College Senior,4,"Medaille College in Buffalo is located within a short commute to the Buffalo Zoo, as well as to Delaware Park. It's not too far of a drive from downtown Buffalo which offers a wide selection of restaurants, entertainment, and shopping areas."
College Senior,4,"all students appear to want to be there. Rochester campus is non traditional so all students are driven and passionate and there for one reason, to achieve their degree"
College Senior,4,"Rochester campus, first class in the veterinary degree, professors great with listening to us and improving the program as we go."
College Senior,4,"Rochester campus, first class in my degree so evolving as we go through. Have heard great things about the other programs"
College Senior,4,"Rochester campus, clean and up to date"
College Sophomore,2,It's pretty laid back its a small college so its pretty hard for there to be any trouble.
College Senior,2,Not much diversity. over priced and not many healthy options
College Junior,2,There are no food places in walking distance
College Sophomore,2,it got on my nerves and im still waiting on it.
College Freshman,2,Buffalo has horrible winters so if you're not used to upstate weather beware! Definitely need a great winter coat and durable boots! And wear layers.
College Freshman,2,"There's literally nothing right off campus, because the campus is right off the highway... you have to travel a little more into the heart of the city where there a plenty of cute coffee shops, for reasonable to cheap prices. There are greek fast food places, and restaurants, tacos, pizza, italian, Chinese food. Also there are bars that offer burgers and things in the day time accessible by anyone."
College Freshman,2,I do not live on campus. I have an apartment off campus with roommates. So it's very hard to navigate to college without a car and a semi decent bus route. The bus drops me at least a mile away from campus.
College Senior,2,"New York Winters, what else can I say?"
College Senior,2,"Some of the teachers show great commitment and professionalism, while others are slackers.
Heavy work load."
College Senior,2,"Some of the professors were excellent, but my education was interrupted when a teacher moved into another program after starting the class.  It was not a smooth transition, not to mention the professor did not prepare us for classes that build on each other."
College Sophomore,2,"When I was at Medaille, only one dining hall was available.  they had a good assortment, but it was all very generic food.  great salad bar though!!"
College Freshman,2,"Same food all the time , need to change it up sometimes."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking isn't very good on campus due to the small size of the campus, however Medaille provides excellent alternatives like free public transportation and parking at the zoo that is nearby."
College Sophomore,2,Wireless Access – It is almost impossible for me to wirelessly connect my laptop at school. I have gone to tech support and I have followed all directions. Once in a while it works but most of the time it does not.
College Freshman,2,Off-Campus Cafes – There are not many options for dining off campus.  Two Cafes and one little snack shop.  Everything is pretty expensive too!  You can actually use your meal plan at these places but only during the normal meal times! But just a mile down the road there are many sub restaurants!
College Freshman,2,"Cheap but Hard to Find. Cheap and nice looking apartments, but hard to find and move into one."
College Sophomore,2,"Winter Makes for a Problem – Summer is fine because when its warm and the weather is fair you don't mind walking.  However there is not a lot of on campus parking so you sometimes have to park by the zoo and cross a busy intersection, when its winter, cold and the snow is knee deep it can make for a miserable and dangerous walk to class."
Alum,1,This is by far the worst school!! Please don't listen to the lies they post about this school. I experienced sexual harassment at this school from a professor as well as other students and they did nothing..by the way he still works there. They will not allow any of your credits to transfer so that your forced to finish there. Oh yeah you can also forget about parking. The was a epidemic of STDs in the dormitory so bad testing had to extended throughout the year. We were on locked down because a dangerous man entered the campus. There is no security what so ever anyone can enter the campus whenever they please. I went to this school for 4 years. Anyone can do better than Medaille.

Niche User,1,"It was too small. I applied for the ""pre-med"" program. It turned out NOT to be a pre-med program, but a waste of time and money."
College Freshman,1,Isn't any as far as I know.
College Sophomore,1,I haven't heard much about it.
College Freshman,1,I received a scholarship but am still in need of financial aid that will not be given to me.
College Junior,1,We have no greek life
College Junior,1,We have shuttles but the only places those take us is to the parking lot and back.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life. 
College Sophomore,1,The parking is not good there isn't that many spots
College Junior,1,"The Financial Aid office at Medaille College is extremely difficult. They do not try to work with you and they have many tendencies to use the ""My word over yours"" method,  if you will."
College Sophomore,1,I find that people at this school are not serious in their studies and are disrespectful to the people who are serious about their studies. Most of the student body are more concern with partying till the late hour of the night then they are with studying. I don't how the physical attractiveness of student body has the do with overall quality of the College. I'm here to learn and to better myself not to party and drool over hot guys.
College Sophomore,1,Student use to receive free metro bus passes which normally cost around 50 dollars but since the school decided to waste money on construction to expand on the athletic depart budget cuts had to be made. These budget costs put student at a disadvantage.
College Sophomore,1,it is so hard for financial aide this school is really expensive and annoying i was never told that i didnt have tap until a semester too late
College Junior,1,They normally have the same options everyday. There's not much variety. They don't cater to dietary restrictions. There are limited healthy otions.
College Junior,1,The food is always cold and although the food looks good on the tours it gets old when eating everyday. If your a picky eater good luck. They tend to repeat meals that are supposed to change frequently but they repeat the same meals. Although there is also a lot of food at lunch dinner is dramatically smaller choice. Weekends is the worst they barely have any options and they aren't very interested in the meals they're preparing or the people. They're a couple of good workers that are really nice but a majority don't seem to care about anything. All the food is also Extremly overpriced. The healthy salads are also more expensive than two burgers and a soft drink and desert.
College Senior,1,"A** Crack of Dawn! You can never find a parking spot on campus unless you are there by 7am for your 8, 9 or even 10:30 class. Invented parking is frowned upon also. They were excited to inform us of the new 16 spots they just put in. Be prepared to fight for a spot since dormers cars rarely move and take up a good % of the parking. The over flow lot is the Zoo lot isn't too bad unless they unblock the main lot after getting back on to campus."
College Freshman,1,"Need More Room – There is not a lot of parking, most of the time if your class starts after 8 am you will NOT find parking. unless you park across the street."
College Sophomore,1,"There is virtually no on campus parking, you have to park by the zoo most of the time and cross a busy intersection.  You are subject to fines in the city of Buffalo."
College Sophomore,1,"It's an Okay School – I wouldn't choose it again because there's not many things to do around campus. The curriculum for my major isn't great at all, and it gets boring as the school year passes."

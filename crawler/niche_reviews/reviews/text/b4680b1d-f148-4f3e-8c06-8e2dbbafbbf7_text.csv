Niche User,5,"so I am currently not enrolled in Touro college because I am only 16 years old and in 11th grad so yeah. however, I heard many wonderful things about Touro college. also, Touro college is right near me so it is just easier to go there and back every day. I also heard that Touro college has a lower track for weaker students like me so I hope they accept me or I am doomed.  another interesting thing that Touro college does is that provides a religious class for Jewish girls which I am kinda looking forward to when I apply for college in a few years."
Senior,5,online classes are available as well as attending in person classes via zoom. They are often harder than regular classes but that is the case in many colleges.

Freshman,5,"What I love about Touro is how it offers a great education while keeping the values of the Torah. Now that I know that I'll be going there this Fall, I don't have to worry about go to school on Shabbat or high holidays, kosher eating, etc. And I also appreciate that I will be dorming with girls that share more or less the same values of me."
Sophomore,5,"Small class sizes, friendly peers, dedicated professors, dorm is homey, perfect location in manhattan, great educational experience overall. They offer majors in a variety of fields but not a very large selection ."

Graduate Student,5,As a new student at Touro College's Doctorate of Physical Therapy program I couldn't be happier! The openness of all the professors is astounding. They are all there to help us learn and succeed. Additionally the small class size provides an intimate learning experience and helps create a warm comradery among all the students.
Freshman,5,"The school has great medical/health science programs, the professors will answers any questions you have at any given time. The school overall has a great learning environment."
Alum,5,"This is for Touro Medical School in NYC. I'm glad I went here. I got the residency I wanted. Nice staffs, nice supportive professors. Administrators are very involved. Great location. Competitive to get in. As long as you put in hard work, you will graduate and become a doctor.
Tuition is expensive but worth it.  
Needless to say, lots of orthodox Jewish students. They are very hard working. Positive influence on rest of the student body."
Sophomore,5,It is a warm and welcoming environment. The classes are small so students can get more individualised attention. People who work there are efficient and willing to help in any way.
Freshman,5,"Some professors have to change their attitude.Some of them are so negative, and it affects the student's performance"
College Sophomore,5,"My school is great because the professors, Academic Advisors, and Financial aid advisors  are very helpful with their approach to teaching, helping me choose my classes and sharing important information with me regarding grants, and scholarships."

College Freshman,5,The class sizes are small so the professors will actually know your name. They try to push you as well as make it easy to understand the topics. They want to help you.
College Freshman,5,I love the small class sizes and how much the professors care about your success.

We are all adults and we like to go out for a drink when our studies allow for it! But if you don't drink, that's totally fine! We are such a great and friendly group of people that it wouldn't matter."
College Freshman,5,There are endless lists of places to go party. We're in NEW YORK CITY!!!
College Sophomore,5,Conservative school base with high percentage of religious Jewish students.

It allows me to still work while taking courses which is important to me because I cannot stop working to support my self financially.

I feel with all the time and experience I put in that one day I can get a career in this field.
College Sophomore,5,The campus is nice and small and secure at all times around campus

College Junior,5,The food is AWESOME! Really very fresh and good quality. Restaurant chefs are in the cafeteria. They make the stuff in front of you!
College Junior,5,"Touro college is on West 60th street and Amsterdam avenue in Manhattan. If you're not familiar with the area, it's about two blocks south of Columbus Circle. That's where you'll find the beautiful and massive globe in front of the entrance to Central Park. I think the true testimony to how popular the area is, is the fact that there are 4 Starbucks coffee shops in a 4 block radius. You know they only do that in the really amazing areas! 
I love how everyone is always in a rush and how the whole world seems to be spinning faster in New York. 
I love that everyone dresses so beautifully- men in dark fitted suits and women in stunning black dresses and heels. I love how because I'm from New York City, I look and dress just like all these high powered professionals.
I love that we're near the Mandarin Oriental, an extravagant hotel where I've met Obama, Sigourney Weaver, Naya Rivera, and Taylor Swift.
I love that I can take a stroll and end up in Times Square 20 minutes later. 
I love how I can never get lost. 
I love how I can pick out a tourist from a mile away by his white pants and his palpable excitement. 
I love that I can look at him and tell him that I live here, that this is my home. "
Recent Alumnus,5,there is a variety of food options off campus for all diets! food is decently priced and tasty!

College Junior,5,The campus is located in a populated and friendly neighborhood so there is always things to do and see.
Alum,4,"I didn't take any classes online but from what I could tell, Touro has a very good online means for class taking both for undergraduate and graduate students."
Alum,4,"There were individual teachers that I enjoyed taking classes with, particularly in the English Literature, history and psychology departments. They were insightful, helpful and helped broaden my knowledge in the individual fields that I was being taught in. There were occasional bureaucratic issues I would run into where it would seemingly take a long time for a professor or staff member to get back to me regarding a question but overall I felt like I received an education that suited my needs and provided a launching pad for further professional study."
Freshman,4,"professors had a hard time at the start with the online platform, many of them struggled and did not keep up with the classes well. but as they learned things turned out to be pretty good."
Freshman,4,the best part about touro college is the evening program. the schedule is tailored to me and its great. there evening program is designed for people that are busy during the day either because you work or cant commit to a full college schedule. there is class only 2 nights a week and ecah class runs an hr long so its  easy to fit it in with  busy schedule.
Senior,4,"It is a very good school locally for me with little commute that has branches all over the city, Brooklyn, and upstate."
Graduate Student,4,"I currently attend Touro College, this will be my second semester. I think the education program is great, the most professors grade and give feedback in a timely manor, others not so much. It is a little pricey."
Freshman,4,"Has great potential, could use more ambitious professors. The majors aren't very broad, and I wish they'd offer a pre-med program in addition to the biology major. I want to initiate a biochemistry major. The deans have a lot of energy and know how, but the professors are mostly burnt out and tired. If they grow and become a better school, they would attract more talented, enthusiastic teachers. They could also offer more extra credit clubs, and groups. I would be very interested in a french course, and a piano course."
Sophomore,4,"I have not yet gone to Tour College yet, but I plan on going to this school very soon. I have called a admissions counselor and they know what their talking about"
Junior,4,"Touro College is an amazing college for several reasons. Because it has numerous campuses in New York, I was able to take classes that were closest to me. Additionally, because class sizes are smaller, it enables a stronger focus on the students and professors pay more attention to their students as well. My main concern, however, is the cost of this school. I would recommend Touro College to offer more scholarships for their students."
Niche User,4,"Touro is an overall good college however I would like to see more organization in there partnerships and mergers. They’ve recently partnered with my current school, Harlem hospital school of radiology and the lack of communication can be pretty frustrating for the students at times. Other than that, I have no other gripes or suggestions."
Sophomore,4,"I love the academics in Touro, and the diverse array of classes offered. I am interested in pursuing a major in psychology and I love learning about psychology. Touro offers many classes in the field of psychology. I love how helpful Touro is with non-class related topics such as jobs and internships! Career Services is always available to inquire about any possible internships and jobs. Touro College has many different branches and offers opportunities to study abroad. Touro college offers many student clubs. Students have the opportunity to both partake in and lead a club. It is for all these reasons and more that I love and appreciate Touro College."
Freshman,4,I've been here for about a year and its starting to really grow on me. The party scene is almost non existent but it leaves you with more time to study. I've made some great friends here and hope to continue with my education
Graduate Student,4,"Touro College has many positive aspects to it. For starters, it has multiple campuses across New York City and Long Island. In my experience, the academics are distinguished in that the professors are invested in the students and try their best to be challenging yet engaging in the learning experience. Their are aspects  of the school I would like to be different. I would like to see some of the campuses in better areas. Overall, my experience at Touro has been and continues to be a positive one."
Freshman,4,"Touro College Landers Division is a small private college with Jewish affiliations. The staff is very helpful, and due to the size of the college, it's very easy to contact faculty members with any questions / concerns. The extracurricular programs offered are very limited, however."
Graduate Student,4,"I find Touro College to be fairly affordable compared to other schools. Classes are very accommodating to my schedule as a teacher, I am able to work full time and attend school at night. In the classes I've taken so far, I have learned a lot from my professors and colleagues."
Junior,4,Its a very nice campus and all the professors truly care about there students and there are many interesting people there.
Senior,4,Touro college is an amazing place.  The teachers are knowledgeable and understanding and all the students are really friendly! I learned a lot
Alum,4,"It is an average school, good only for school work, not a party school. There are a few good health sciences programs as well."
Junior,4,Teachers very knowledgeable. Very helpful. Very easy to get in. On the expensive side. Lots of career opportunities. Many students just go to take classes and leave. No party life. Many people work while in school. Many evening and sunday classes.
Sophomore,4,they care about their students and want to offer classes the students want to take.  it has a pretty good schedule and best of all there are a lot of campuses to choose from.
Sophomore,4,"I would like to see better Proffesor’s
Teaching in the college.
Cheaper tuition.All the CUNY are giving out free tuition if you make less than a 100,000 $a year 
.Touro doesn’t give out that many scholarships .
They don’t have many degrees to go on to .
 I like that that the classes are not filled with so many people so you can actually learn a thing or two .
Otherwise I give it a 3.5 out of 5 for my return on investment!"
Sophomore,4,I think the professors at touro are fantastic. They do not force you to buy material for class most of the time. Pro is that undergrad is in two buildings so it isn't too much travel. Con is that you will unfortunately see a lot of the same faces constantly.
Senior,4,"I'm a transfer student at Touro college and I'm very happy that I took that step. The professors are extremely understanding and always there for their student(s). The classrooms are not too big which helps students to get to knows their peers as well as their professor on a personal level and vice versa. Since Touro is a Jewish college it allows all their students to observe the Jewish holidays. I would like for Touro to look like an actual school with a campus instead of some commercial building with a bunch of students going in and out. Overall, the education is great and the staff is welcoming. I would recommend this school to friends and family."
Senior,4,The best part of Touro College is the small class sizes. The largest class I have ever had contained twenty five people. The smallest class contained 5 individuals. The teachers spend time helping their students as their can be one on one instruction in some cases.
Sophomore,4,Touro college really wants to see their students becoming successful in all aspects of life. they will go out of their way to help you achieve academic success so that you can get the education you need in order to get the dream job of yours you've always wanted.
Sophomore,4,Touro College and its affiliates are  truly dedicated to helping students succeed in their chosen filed of study.   A rigorous schedule is combined with ample time for studying and learning in a friendly environment.
Graduate Student,4,"What I really liked is the professors willingness to help with all that was needed. One did not have to feel embarrassed when a problem comes up-just go speak about it with the staff. Additionally, the academics really prepared me for my future work as a clinician. One thing to work on is better sites for clinical experiences."
Freshman,4,I likes the other girls. i think they should replace some professors as they are unfair markers. i liked the jewish atmosphere and how they help you with advising.
Sophomore,4,"Decent school, classes of average difficulty.  No real sports program.  The grounds and buildings are actually very nice.  The financial aid office is very helpful."
College Sophomore,4,I attend this school for graduate school. So far everyone has been very helpful however at times its hard to reach staff .
College Sophomore,4,"My experience attending Touro has been very positive. The staff has been very helpful in guiding me in the right direction and helping me reach my goal in achieving my Masters. Considering there has been a lot of changes and new regulations for my field of study, Touro has been very well informed and great at getting all the information out to all of their students."
College Sophomore,4,The class size is around 25-30 which allows the professor to be able to help everyone. The courses have a lot of work but the professors are usually accommodating with timing of tests. Many courses are offered which allows the students to have many options.
College Sophomore,4,The school organized a meeting to review all the safety rules and how we should report an issue. They take safety extremely seriously and have harsh punishments for violators of safety. We all feel very safe on campus.
College Freshman,4,They really keep track of their students and take care of them. They want to advise the best route for them to succeed.

College Freshman,4,"If you like a learning experience out side the classroom, this is the school for you."
College Freshman,4,"I have and have had wonderful experiences with all my professors so far, the classroom sizes could be bigger, but there's great comrade between students and professors to help with transitioning into classroom routines."
Recent Alumnus,4,Very safe environment. Never have to be worried about being assaulted.
College Sophomore,4,"The dean really looks at your overall trajectory of your college plan and assigns you courses that will help you get there faster. All the professors are really nice, and experienced in their fields. I love that there are small classes, because you can really get some extra attention if something doesn't make sense."
College Sophomore,4,Touro has a wide alumni network and access to many graduate schools. Being a graduate of touro can help in the future with job placements or getting into higher education.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the small classes, and the fact that its at night. The teachers are really able to give the students extra ttention and focus on certain areas they might not be able to in a bigger school."
College Freshman,4,There are always postings about job opportunities to help students find jobs in their fields.
College Sophomore,4,my experiences in touro college is a good experiences the professors are great they rely care for the student the college has a work study program which is amazing one thing that not so great about touro if you dont qualify for financial aid the tuition is a lot and there inst that many scholarships you can apply for

College Sophomore,4,"Like any other school, there are great professors and there are horrible ones."

College Sophomore,4,Some of the facilities are nice but at the same time some are old.
College Sophomore,4,"Since Touro is in Manhattan, the food options are endless and awesome."
College Freshman,4,"There are many historic places and attractions to visit (the Apollo Theater is right across the street! ) and the nightlife and dining is excellent since we are in one of the most diverse places on Earth: New York City! The shopping is amazing too, with plenty of stores and options for everyone."
College Freshman,4,He do have a good diversity in the population of the school.
College Freshman,4,"They are great! There are many places and variety of foods to choose from. The optio lns for organic/vegetarian are more average, but overall the food options are plentiful."

College Sophomore,4,Just fill out the required forms and speak with the faculty of the financial aid office if you need assistance.
Niche User,2,"There is a horrible choice of classes being that each class is three hours long. On top of that, there is little to no support from the faculty when advising students on their college goals."
College Freshman,2,It's not a big part about campus life and there is not much focus on it by the students or school so it's mutual.
College Freshman,2,There could be more school spirit where athletics is concerned.

College Sophomore,2,"The school isn't that focused on athletics, they aim to be more academically oriented."
College Freshman,2,Being that it's NYC pricing is horrendous. Extremely high for very low square footage.
College Freshman,2,"I only give it a 2 star rating because we are in Manhattan. I think that's enough to understand. Prices are extremely high and the square footage for those prices is very unimpressive. But again, it's Manhattan. Public transportation is excellent. It's no use having a car whatsoever."
College Sophomore,2,"I don't drive but it's Manhattan, parking in the Flatiron District is horrendous. It's so accessible to trains and buses though so why add extra pollution anyway?"
College Sophomore,2,"Touro only offers an honors program for those who want to enter the science/medical field. They also do not tell you which professor you are getting when you sign up for a class so you cannot choose your professor. The most unprofessional part is that you cannot sign up for a class online, it must be done personally. Because you must wait online to sign up for a class, you are often locked out of classes and left with an inconvenient schedule."
College Sophomore,2,"You must go down and speak to the people in person! If you just talk over the phone all you'll hear is no,"
College Sophomore,2,there are door guards and that's about it.

Also, it's better to use your own laptop for better speed."

College Junior,2,"Poor! Like stated earlier, passing bar exam rate has gone down every year for the pack six."
Graduate Student,1,"The Touro College community is not well actualized. I graduated in 2006. The officials tried to extort me for additional funds. The racism will make your degree useless regarding getting job. Avoid the aggression, avoid Touro College"
Junior,1,"Well attending tours college is ok! I honestly think they can work on being more informative with students and helps them more! At times it feels like you have to beg the councilors and other staffs to help you and inform you on your education, there was a councilor who also advices me to stop attending tours and find something cheapest to do than attend college!"

College Senior,1,Not much of a friendly college. We go for the classes and move on.
College Senior,1,There is crappy sports system that id not very intuitive.
College Freshman,1,"There are no varsity sports or teams. There are small groups of students who come together to play sports, but it is moreof a personal matter than a college event."
College Freshman,1,"There is barely any Greek life at all. It is extremely low key and it makes no difference, as a student, wether you join or not."

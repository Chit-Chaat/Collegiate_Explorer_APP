Junior,5,"Overall, my experience at Mount St. Joseph has been a good one. The professors are great. They really care about each and every student who goes there. The classes are rigorous and teach you a lot. While it is a Catholic institution, it never pushes this on its students. The school has great values that it lives by. The campus is not large but it is growing, with a new sport complex being slated for completion in 2021. Overall, a great school that I would recommend to anyone!!"
Sophomore,5,"The Mount, while it wasn't my first choice, felt like the best choice and two years later.. I couldn't be happier. It's a community on campus like I've never seen anywhere else. Many of the teachers are regionally renown, a good portion are nationally renown, and even a few are globally renown, especially in the science departments. It's big campus education on a small campus. Individualized attention balanced with enough students to not have all the pressure on any given student."
Freshman,5,Very welcoming community and the professors are very helpful and nice. This is the best community I have been in and athletics are very good also. This college felt like home from the second I walked onto the campus and there was no way I could deny coming here.
Freshman,5,"As a first-year freshman, the Mount has provided a home away from home atmosphere that has made me feel welcomed and accepted as I am. Though it is a Catholic University, the school accepts everyone no matter what. I love how small the campus is because it makes it easy to get to classes without having to feel like you have to rush everywhere. The athletics are amazing, and as a member of the Women's Volleyball team, I can say that every sport is fun to watch and we love that the community loves to come support us. Because it is a small campus, the class sizes are smaller, which allows the teachers to really get to know you. The teachers at the Mount really do care about each of their students, and they want to get to know each of them individually. Mount St. Joseph University is truly a campus full of love and support for every individual that steps foot on campus."
Freshman,5,"So far, I like the people here at MSJ. Both the friends I meet on campus and the staff are some of the best people I have meet in my life and I like the package the school is offering. The only problem I have is the pricing as it is was too expensive for me to live on campus this semester and hopefully not next semester."
Freshman,5,I will be starting at the Mount next semester and I already love it. The staff  and the students are very friendly and want to help in any way possible to get you to graduate earlier as possible with less classes.
Sophomore,5,This is a very friendly college and everyone there is very welcoming. I would not like to see anything change.
Freshman,5,"The Mount may not have been my original first choice but when I stepped onto campus, I already felt like I was home. The professors are all so sweet and encouraging and helpful, it made me really feel important really quick. While it does cost a decent amount, the education and the experiences you'll have while you're here are priceless. I could not be more pleased with my first college!"
Freshman,5,I enjoy MSJ very much. This is my favorite school ever. I went to MSJ for 1 year so far and it was the best decision ive ever made. I love the community and atmosphere. I love this school so much. I will never go anywhere else. This school has given me a hope for the future and a hope to continue what i love. This school is very important to me. Thank you MSJ! Youre the best.
Senior,5,I really like the school and just sucks that I can't get an loan for school so that I can finish up.
Sophomore,5,My experience at Mount St. Joseph has been nothing but welcoming and respect. The professors there are always pushing students to do their best. Everyone on campus helps one another. Overall the school is a very friendly confine.
Senior,5,The thing that I like most about Mount St. Joseph University is that if you are having trouble in a class their is always help that for you. They make you feel like you are at home to.
Freshman,5,"I'm not the type to be around a lot of people, but the university that I attend is small enough to be private, but diverse and big enough to make you feel like you're not in a ghost town."
Works Here,5,"The Mount is a close-knit, caring community where you are welcomed and appreciated for your individual skills and talents."
Freshman,5,I love it here! My orientation was what really sealed the deal! We had a candle lighting we said a prayer and everything. We signed a book with all our names on in it. All the people that I met there were already friends! They just really make you feel like a family. I loved that.
Freshman,5,"Opportunity to play college football, small class size, professors are involved and caring.  Student life is good, food is good.  Cincinnati is a great town, sports management degree will give me a lot of opportunities to be successful.
Buildings are a little older and could use some refurbishing, especially the dorm rooms.  Overall a great college experience."
Niche User,5,"When I visited Mount St. Joseph University I loved it there. The university is huge and the people I meet are very nice and friendly. The dorm rooms are very nice and everyone is welcome there. I had a feeling of happiness when I went there. The campus is really beautiful and the class size is small, which is great for me because smaller class sizes help me focus more. Being on the campus was just an amazing experience because I meet some of the students attending there and it really is the college I want to go to.  "
College Sophomore,5,The student career center is great. They help you prepare for interviews in a lot of different ways. They give you real advice that can help you in all of your interviews and they care about you.
College Sophomore,5,"Overall, the professors are great and they are very helpful and passionate about teaching. They care about the students and they are great for giving advice about any thing."
College Sophomore,5,I feel safe on campus and that is one of reasons why I enjoy being on campus. We can contact our campus police at any time and they are very helpful.
College Sophomore,5,I am having a wonderful time at Mount St. Joseph University. It feels like home and I can talk to the professors and staff members any time. I made the best decision attending the Mount and I can't imagine myself at another University.
College Sophomore,5,I've never worried about feeling insecure on campus.
College Sophomore,5,Professors at the Mount have individual care for each student.
College Sophomore,5,Great opportunities and experiences for all students at the Mount.
College Freshman,5,"My professors are awesome, I feel like I'm learning something, my workload isn't crushing, and I can study in peace (My favorite place is the area outside the hallway to the teachers' offices. It's so nice and quiet.)"
College Freshman,5,Don't have problems on campus
College Senior,5,"The police here take their job seriously. They are very nice, and are happy to help when ever someone needs something. If there is a threat you can count on them to act fast and efficiently. They always make the students feel welcome and when ever we are even just scared to walk alone to our car at night one of the officers are more than happy to walk us there. I have gone jogging a couple times at past when the gym has closed and a couple of the officers have stopped me to see what I was up to and to check to see if I was okay. I appreciate the safety concern that they have here at this campus for their students."
College Senior,5,"Honestly there is a huge diversity here for such a small campus. You the typical stereo-type groups of people, but here they all talk and interact with each other. It doesn't matter what you dress like or what group you were in with high school. Everyone here dresses differently, but I think what connects us again is that we all have in common that we are Hard working on diverse things. One person could be hard working on their athletics, another with school but they will still interact because we share the common bond here of working hard toward our goals no matter what it is. Most people dress casually for class but we have a bit of everything on campus."
College Senior,5,"I am a Biology major, and am in love with the program we have here. I started out a nursing major but if I could start all over I would start in Biology. Every teacher you meet here are extremely passionate about what subject they teach, and that gets everyone excited to learn about the topic. I have yet to meet a teacher who was not passionate about he course that they were teaching here. The Biology teachers I have grown very close with and am blesses every day that they are and have been apart of my college career. They each push me, challenge me, and look out for me when it comes to my future goals and my education. I am hope to go to Graduate school for either medical research or field research and all of my professors have taken their time to discuss with me about my options. Dr. Kritsky has personally taken his time to help me figure out what I want to do and where I want to apply."
College Senior,5,"The Biology program is amazing! Every single class is taught by a professor who is passionate about he subject. It has been a lot of work but the things you will learn will amaze you. I have learned so much from only being in the program 2  years and wish even with the work load that I would of started in it. Every Science class you have you will have a lab that goes along with it, that will give you hands on experience. In Entomology class we had a lab where we had to collect bugs and ID them. Now when I go out on a walk I still find myself ID the bugs that I see, or applying knowledge that I have learned in my other classes. Every professor in this program will be more than happy to take you on if you want to do a research project to work with them, or have your own idea. It has been a lot of work and studying but it is all worth it."
College Senior,5,"Everyone on this campus like I have said before is there doing their own things, seeking their own future. We all are taught in our classes even that we are all human, I think that's why we are all so open with each other. I have been to parties before but I am the DD for all of my friends. No one looks at you weird, you may be offered drugs/alcohol but no one cares if you do or do not do them. If you say no, they won't treat you any differently. As for the usage, this is a college campus there will be people who are going to use drugs. It's hardly notable on campus, and 99.9% of parties and usage are off campus. This is a wet campus so people who are 21 may have drinks in their rooms, but someone under 21 cannot be in their room if they do have alcohol."
College Senior,5,"Getting aid at this school is a smooth process. Even if you get lost there are people who are more than willing to talk to you and go throw the process with you. On top of things if you need more aid than you receive they have special forms you can fill out, and will even point you in the direction of scholarships that you can apply for that are based off of you."
College Senior,5,"College of Mount St. Joseph has changed me for the better. As cheesy as it sounds I would pick this school all over again. It is the school you want to go to if you want to know everyone on campus, become familiar with you teachers, and even become involved. The teachers here go out of their way to help you understand concepts, or to even reach your future goal. They believe in every single one of their students. I have had issues in the past with my health and my teachers have done everything in their power to keep me caught up while giving me the time I need to heal. All of my teachers are interested in what is going on with my life, and help me with my future goals of grad school. Not only are the teachers wonderful the students are too. The small class size may seem a little high-schoolish to some people but I you will get to know almost everyone in this school. It is not a school where you drown in the 100's of other students. You become a Mount Family. When something happens to one of our students we all feel it, and are there to support each other. Yes, the school may lack a bit in location but it makes up with it for the personal experience you receive there."

College Senior,5,Classes are hard but they pay off and the faculty is amazing

College Senior,5,"very affiliated with my school, amazing support"
College Senior,5,"private religous school, mostly off campus students"
College Junior,5,I learn so much better with small classrooms. MSJ gives me the experience I need in the field I'm going in and the time to meet people. 
College Junior,5,"MSJ tries it's best with computers. Computers do not work 100% of the time, so I give credit to ISS who try to fix the problems when they do happen."
College Junior,5,I love the sports that are here!
College Junior,5,Mount Saint Joseph is a small campus but I believe that they do the very best that they can with what space we have.
College Junior,5,I have not had an internship through the Mount. I love the Majors though. Each teacher I promise you is passionate about their subject.
College Junior,5,You have to keep up the grades. The departments here make you work for it but you learn so many things that you will use.
College Junior,5,MSJ has some of the best safety.
Recent Alumnus,5,Overall I always feel safe at my school.
College Junior,5,School spirit is important at our college. Everyone is involved.
College Junior,5,Everyone is really nice and easy to get along with and easy to make friends.
College Freshman,5,"The security overall is very good; nothing has happened on campus since I have been here all year.  The security doesn't need to do much because of the small campus, but it is very helpful by little things, such as, sending an email telling the students that there was a rape 6 miles away from the campus and if we go out to be careful just incase."
College Freshman,5,"It doesn't snow a lot here, the buildings are close and for the most part connected so if the weather is bad, you can get around more easily considering how spaced out the buildings are."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Completing my undergraduate at The Mount was the best decision I ever made. The staff are wonderful, teachers are more than willing to assist students with any questions they have. Class sizes are small and it is easy to get to know the other students so that you can ask questions or get ideas. There is a team approach, students, teachers, and administrators work very well together. They also have the excel program which is great for folks with learning disabilities, they will also help with setting up tutoring. Feel free to ask, they have lots of options to help!"
College Freshman,5,The campus police are experienced police officers. They go out of the way to keep us safe. They instruct us how to protect ourself and our property. If anything does come up missing they fully investigate and try to recover what was taken from us.
College Freshman,5,Most of the student body is athletes for the school and have to kee their grades up to play.  Everyone here is smart.
College Sophomore,5,I have been here for a year and a half not and I have only once seen someone with alcohol. They were of age and were just carrying it to their room. There are never any on campus parties and smoking is prohibited on campus. I have never felt pressured to participate in any of these activities.
Junior,4,"I have taken one online course at Mount St. Joseph University which was Dinosaur Biology. This was an 8-week course that was worth 4 credit hours because it included labs. It was really well put together. It was all done through Blackboard, with videos, assignments, and activities all being different links within the program. It was very intuitive. The professor was also easy to contact and communicate with if I had a problem."
Senior,4,"I like the small classrooms; this helps to create an excellent learning environment in which the teachers and students can establish a personal relationship, and the student can better learn the material in a closer-knit setting. I also enjoy the sense of community on the campus, through on-campus activities and clubs."
Senior,4,"It is a small campus, but friendly people. I love the small class sizes and ratio for students to professors."
Niche User,4,"I have not gone here yet, but my mom, cousin, and friend all did and loved it. It is a beautiful campus and since it is a small area the teachers are able to really help their students personally."
Freshman,4,"My class size in grade school was 90 and because of this I new everyone pretty well. My class size in high school was 340 and I didn't like it. I graduated without knowing most people. I was afraid that going to a big college would mean I would have classes in huge auditoriums and I didn't want this. I wanted to be more than just a number; I wanted to be able to build close relationships with my professors. As a result, I chose to look for small schools. I toured Mount St. Joseph University and immediately fell in love. I liked the close knit community feel. Everyone was so welcoming I still feel this way even now. This was the only school I applied to because there was no where else that I could see myself. I would recommend this school because despite being small, there are many opportunities given to you to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"The Mount is a very small school so it is very easy to get to know the university and all the people.  The administration and teachers are encouraging and willing to help in any way they can.  The buildings and rooms are up to date and maintained well.  I feel like it is a safe campus and people look out for each other.  
The one thing I would change is the number of locations to eat and how long the cafeterias are open.  The cafeteria has limited hours that don’t always meet my needs or the needs of the various student body."
Sophomore,4,"The Mount is more than just a university, it’s a community where you are surrounded by people who truly care about your success and wellbeing."
Freshman,4,The Mount is the perfect sized school with the small class sizes being beneficial to students’ learning. Professors know their students and truly care about their education and wellbeing.
Freshman,4,"I like the atmosphere and how friendly everyone is, as well as how approachable and helpful the professors are. I would enjoy the university much better if there was a larger variety of food choices on campus!"
Freshman,4,This campus is small but very much alive. living on campus is amazing giving me the quick access to participate in activities around campus. never a bad day at the mount
Sophomore,4,"I am a sophomore at the Mount as well as a commuter. Get ready to have small classes and a very short walking distance between them. Being a commuter does distance me a little but the great thing is the Mount is almost always open everywhere, meaning late night study sessions are an option even for commuters on campus. Making connections is almost too easy, it's a natural thing there but it is because they want you to succeed. They also have an AMAZING art education program... something to keep in mind."
Freshman,4,"This university is really good at making people feeling comfortable, while being stern about keeping grades up. even though they were stern they had many great resources to help the students."
Senior,4,"I personally love Mount St. Joseph University and I love most of the professors within the school. I am personally a special education major and I am in my senior year. Most of the education professors are wonderful and care about you and your success. There are a select few who are too harsh or do not feel qualified to be a professor. There are many opportunities to get involved on campus. There are endless activities if you live on campus and there is even a Starbucks. If you enjoy being at a small school, you would love the Mount. It is easy to meet new people and to make friends. I love it here, and I am sure most people would too."
Sophomore,4,"Mount St Joseph University is an exceptional institution overall and is worthy of praise in many regards. First and foremost the university prides itself on the achievement of academic excellence for its entire student body. The curriculum is varied, interesting and is engineered to maximize the character and well roundedness of its students. This quality of academic achievement is made possible only by an attentive and caring faculty of professors, many of which are expert in their respective fields. Student life at the university is also exceptional. All incoming students are welcomed warmly. The helpfulness of the staff is remarkable considering the fact that each professor is ready and willing to sit one on one with students for discussion. One shortcoming of the university, however, is that, even with its veritable course selection, it offers but one foreign language, that being Spanish. Personally I would have enjoyed a more wide ranging selection of languages."
Freshman,4,"I love Mount St Joseph University because I love the small university atmosphere. The students and faculty make you feel at home here and this is a place where you get one on one attention. At the Mount, students are here to learn, make friends, and join student organizations. The beautiful campus is centered on a hill in a small town, Delhi, which is considered fairly safe. I never feel like I have to fear for my safety at the Mount and I have no complaints about the college. "
Sophomore,4,"The best thing about the Mount is the professors. In my experience, almost all of my professors have taken a personal interest in my success. I have actually formed some great friendships among my teachers, and if you take the time to get to know them, they are more than happy to help you when you're stuck. "
Sophomore,4,I am a current student at the Mount. I love the way the professors are willing to work with you in most cases. The party scene isn't bad as long as you open yourself up to new people. We just got our first fraternity which is pretty cool too.
College Sophomore,4,"I love the campus overall feeling. It feels like home soon as I get there and it is very clean. However, I do think that the dorms need to be updated."
College Sophomore,4,The Mount is great for local jobs--which is what I aspire to go into.
College Freshman,4,"The biggest criminal act that I'm aware of is that someone (accidentally) blew up a washing machine and set off the fire alarm in the middle of the night. Crime is barely an issue here. The police officers do their job thoroughly and well, and I've never felt concerned for my personal safety."
College Freshman,4,"Academics are the big perk of this school. The professors are amazing, the courses are interesting, I just wish there was a greater variety of them. We just need more people!"
College Freshman,4,"I'm part of the Talent Opportunity Program (TOP) which is a service by the career center that pretty much guarantees job placement after graduation. If I do not have a job by a certain period of time after graduation, they will help me get a job free of charge. The career center is a mammoth resource, they have a lot of other programs that students can use for internships, jobs and other opportunities."
College Freshman,4,"The academics at the Mount are the best part about the school. I LOVE my professors, I can just pop down to their offices for a quick chat or a bit of homework help, and they are very good at what they teach. Perks of a small school! My only academic complaint is that the school may be a bit too small, the English department is so tiny that I have trouble finding anything to challenge myself (but that might just be me).

There are pros and cons to any small school, and the Mount is no exception."
College Sophomore,4,The professors and staff are amazing and really care about you as a person and the students are excellent as well. Very friendly environment and close knit community
College Freshman,4,It's your own place and no one can tell you what to do
College Freshman,4,"I was blessed to recive 10,000 from the school itself."
College Freshman,4,"I'm from Cincinnati, so i know a lot about the city."
College Senior,4,Weather does not really affect campus experience. Class and everything else goes on besides if it snows. Since we have a lot of commuters if it snows generally classes are canceled for student and faculty/staff safety.
College Senior,4,"The have renovated almost all of the dorms. What I have seen of them they look fantastic! The dorms are one of the best places to meet people. The dorms floors to alternate between girls and boys besides the center dorms which are co-ed and 2SE, which is also co-ed. The prices of the dorms are a bit expensive, but you only have to wake up 5 minutes before class and I guarantee you will still make it there on time. The social atmosphere can be found in the lounges of the dorms where people play games and watch movies, but again during weekends almost everyone goes home. The housing process is super easy, you fill out a form and they will get back to you where you live."
College Senior,4,"This college has an extreme diversity in economic status, political/religious beliefs. I was afraid first going to this school that is would be nothing but people with the Catholic belief. I am Christian, but am not labeled under a certain belief and was afraid that I would be shunned for it. Also I am from a poorer family, so my fear of not being accepted by the people attending the private Catholic school with me was great. Being at the college for 3 years now I realize I had nothing to fear. Become come from all different type of walks of life, in fact that is a big thing they teach at this college; that we most except everyone, look at the world from their eyes, they are human and so are we. The teacher and the students are very open to who ever joins the campus. I will say their is slightly more girls than guys on campus but in classes it's hardly noticeable."
College Senior,4,"The are apartments that can be found all over 7-15 minutes away from the campus. The pricing depends on what you are looking for, but there is a great range or qualities in each. I lived off campus for about a year in Delshire and the landlord was always pleasant to me; if anything went wrong with appliances you could call the office and they would take care of it for you. There are always enough parking spots, and even if you have to park on the road its only a short distance to the apartments. There is a small grocery store that is within walking distance."
College Junior,4,I can use any computer on campus without a problem. It is nice.
College Junior,4,"There is a great deal to do in Cincinnati. Besides, we have fun just hanging out around campus."
College Junior,4,I never see drugs nor hear about what is going on in that scene.
College Sophomore,4,"The nursing program is one of the best, however it is very hard and stressful the whole year"
College Freshman,4,I am only a freshmen and Freshmen and Sophomores have to stay on campus
College Freshman,4,they have a varity of places to choose from
College Freshman,4,It doesnt rain or snow much if so they are on the spot to clean it up
College Freshman,4,There is towns real close to the college like florence Ky they have 2 malls  The Cincinnati Reds and Bengals play near by.
College Freshman,4,The Teachers are very good they answer your questions and pride in each student
Recent Alumnus,4,The local atmosphere in the city of Cincinnati is great. I currently live in Cincinnati even though I came to the College of Mount St. Joseph from Louisville.
Recent Alumnus,4,I felt very safe on campus. The college has its very own police force there which made the campus an extremely safe environment.
Recent Alumnus,4,My overall experience at school was great. My favorite experience was playing football for my college. The uniqueness of the College of Mount St. Joseph is the small class size and individual attention that is given to students by professors.
Recent Alumnus,4,There is a great deal of majors to choose from here at the College of Mount St. Joseph. The admission process was extremely easy and the administrative staff was extremely helpful.
Recent Alumnus,4,The College of Mount St. Joseph has a number of internship options available to students. One of the great options available to students is the option of interning with Proctor and Gamble.  
Recent Alumnus,4,Something that I can say is great about Mount St. Joseph is the small class size and relationships that I was able to build with professors.
College Senior,4,On campus is over priced but worth the price 
College Senior,4,We are building for sports
College Senior,4,There are local bars and the ones downtown are only 15 min away
College Senior,4,You gotta have a car but they are organizing shuttles and there are two major bus stops.
College Senior,4,Its a family and everyone gets along pretty well.
College Senior,4,Follow the rules and there are no issues dont follow them but your coopperative you get off easy.
College Senior,4,The school is expensive but there is alot of aid. the women in the financial aid office are supper helpful.
College Senior,4,Cant beat the faculty and prep for grad school
College Senior,4,"i am in an amaxing grad program, very full time internship but it is unpaid. the staff does all of the contact work and has great connections within the community"
College Junior,4,I love most things about MSJ but I just wish sometimes they would allow us to experience college. A lot of the times I do not get my homework down till 12 at night and after want to see my friends and hangout. With the visitation police I can't do that. 
College Junior,4,Ohio has crazy weather sometimes.
College Junior,4,MSJ is a small school that most people from the area come to.
College Junior,4,Over all Facilities are great.
College Junior,4,"There are usually always spots open to use computers if needed to. I have used the printing option multiple times for power points for class and each student receives $25 per semester to spend on printing, which is nice."
Sophomore,2,"The class sizes were small and the student to Professor ratio was great. However, the professors I had there didn’t like to be wrong and wouldn’t put the best interest of the student first. They would stick to what they thought was right, even if you did have evidence against there system, they wouldn’t put the best interest of the student first."
College Freshman,2,We are about to start up greek life next year on campus. We currently don't have greek life.
College Freshman,2,"We as a school are pretty good at sports, but the fan support is terrible. There isn't much school spirit and in all honesty my high school had ten times more school spirit than this place."
College Freshman,2,"Most teachers are passionate, but they're awful at teaching."
College Freshman,2,It's diverse but hypocritical across campus.
College Freshman,2,Completely unpredictable. Welcome to Cincinnati.
College Freshman,2,No one really pays attention to you. Get to class and you get an A.
College Junior,2,"There is really not much going on at night, on the weekends most people go home."
College Sophomore,2,"Its so strict, not allowed to have opposite sex in your room past midnight... hello i'm in college not grade school"
College Sophomore,2,My friends have said they feel like they are visiting me in jail
Recent Alumnus,2,The campus strictness was at some times out of control. I have visited other campuses and evenings seemed to go well with out campus police feeling like it was necessary to be present.
College Senior,2,"not much around campus, out of city limits"
College Junior,2,I am not familiar with off campus housing but I do know a few students who just live up the street from campus. The bus runs right through the main street and it is about a 5 minute drive to school.
College Junior,2,There's not a lot of different sexually oriented individuals.
College Sophomore,2,"My school has a lot of good programs...such as co-op, work at school, etc...But there are a lot of things lacking.  The campus is very outdated.  Some rooms are being updated, but most need it.  Laundry is a hassle...not enough machines.  Campus police are horrible.  We have 20 full time officers...for 5 buildings.  Crime is not a problem on our campus, but the police act like we are the worst citizens ever, always accusing us of things that aren't true."
College Freshman,2,"There has been an upgrade in the amount of drunk people in the past semester and the amount of music playing until 3am.  The RA has gotten a little bit lazy and allowed more to go on than should be. Meanwhile, some people have tests for bio and chem and now can't get to sleep because of the drunk people running down the halls."
College Junior,2,"Its really hit or miss with food on campus. There are 2 place to eat, and they have the same foods at both. Not always a great selection either."
College Junior,2,"There are few options available for transportation, but with designated driver there are various options for those under and over 21."
College Freshman,2,I don't know or care if there are a bunch of bars or clubs around. If that's what you're looking for why are you looking at a catholic college? Not always much to do but Newport is close and the people here are absolutely amazing.
College Senior,2,"MSJ's campus really doesn't have a night life. However, if you are willing to get a few people together and drive 15 to 20 minutes to get to downtown Cinci then it can be a good time. There aren't really a lot of under 21 clubs though unfortunately but a lot of places will have a college night and allow people under 21 in. There are some house parties in the neighborhood but they are crowded and not usually all that fun."
Freshman,1,"The food is absolutely terrible, it feels like eating cardboard everyday of the week. There is no party scene at all, and you have to drive everywhere you go. Some of the professors have no idea what they are talking about and have a tough time teaching their subject."
College Sophomore,1,"We can have sun shine, rain, and snow all in one week.. welcome to ohio"
College Junior,1,It takes about 15 minutes to get anywhere exciting. No places I'm able to walk to. The food on campus closes by 6:30 on the weekends and 8 through the week. Safety however is not something I worry about.
College Sophomore,1,"The only greek life very small. There aren't frats everywhere. Its all about grades, very similar to a honors society."
College Senior,1,"Software wouldn't work. Printers were either jammed, out of toner, out of paper, always something."
College Senior,1,"They accepted my transfer credit, then 3 months later changed and policy and half of my transfer denied.  Their curriculum requirement changed after I was accepted and I'm stuck taking additional math courses that originally I didn't need."
College Freshman,1,If its for a class or extracurricular activity then they provide transportation but if you need to get to and from school you better have a car.
College Sophomore,1,"Haha, there might be a total of 2 bars/clubs within 15 minutes of MSJ. All of the parties happen either at the ""houses"" (houses off-campus that are usually lived in by athletes of a particular sport; for example, there is a football house and a lacrosse house) or in the Center dorms. However, these could hardly be called ""parties"" in any sense, they're more just a small-ish group of friends getting drunk together. Really, the closest anything on or near campus gets to being an actual ""party"" is the school dance, but even that's being generous."
College Freshman,1,There is no transportation other than your own vehicle.
College Freshman,1,"There really isn't much of a nightlife unless you are 21+. Also if you live in the dorms, expect to be the only one left on campus because everyone goes home one the weekends."
College Freshman,1,"The police on campus aren't very friendly and they are also extremely strict.  Being a Catholic college, we have many rules that are unfair and hated by students  that also affect our freedom.  The campus takes eveything too seriously and it bothers students."
College Sophomore,1,"the partys are at places such as the ""football"", ""soccer"", ""basketball"" houses."
College Junior,1,The psychology program at the Mount is fairly new so some kinks are still being worked out and it is noticable in the work and teaching styles. It is not up to par with other colleges and universities but has every potential to be some day.

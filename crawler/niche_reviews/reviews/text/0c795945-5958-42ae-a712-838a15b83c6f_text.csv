Freshman,5,Manhattan School of Music is definitely one of the most unique conservatories in the world. Excellent music program. I'm specifically enrolled in Voice Opera Theatre.  The school is extremely welcoming and has a diverse community I am proud to be a part of. This school truly prepares you for your professional career in the future. Another benefit of attending Manhattan School of Music is its location. The urban atmosphere is truly sensational. Its almost as if the entire city is your classroom. I get inspired by seeing new faces. The skyscrapers surpassing the clouds is a reminder that even the sky isn't the limit. I am truly excited for this upcoming school year.
Freshman,5,"I'm currently enjoying my experience with Manhattan School of Music! The more-or-less vertical campus took a while to get used to, but otherwise the environment is very positive and welcoming!"

No better city to study and live when your life revolves around music and the arts.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I live in 10mins away from my school now. I have an excellent location with inexpensive rent. Subway is 3mins away from my place and all the market is so close. It is very hard to find good place with inexpensive place in Mahattan. But I was very lucky that I found this place. I subletted for 2years which I found in my school bulletin board. After subletting, I got to know of building manager. So I rent one of the room and I am very happy."
College Freshman,5,"Manhattan School of Music is located near Colombia University. The area is very safe, especially as you walk downtown."
College Senior,5,Tier 1 Conservatory – MSM offers a rigorous and world-class education that is comprehensive and innovative. The curriculum is relevant and up-to-date with today's professional industry standards.
College Freshman,5,Everyone has to enter with a declared Major because you have to audition to be accepted into your Major.
College Freshman,5,"Its NEW YORK CITY – Everything is available its New York. Between the trains, the buses and the taxis you should never be at a complete loss in NYC. If all else fails you can always walk."
College Sophomore,5,"You Walk Everywhere! The school is so tiny, you can walk from the dorm to the main building in minutes. No need to worry about transportation at the school. New York is a whole other story."
College Freshman,5,"The Big Apple – My school is located in New York so there is always something to do! When my friends and I are not studying, we're taking the subway to find a new clothing store or a cheap restaurant. There are also many shows at the met we can go to which is wonderful and we get student discount tickets! We even get to see free performances of shows at our school and in the area. I couldn't imagine going to a college not located in New York. It is a wonderful place."
College Junior,5,Upper West Side Dining – Amazing restaurants near Columbia University and Manhattan School of Music. Havana Central is the best Cuban food around. Rosa Mexicano near Lincoln Center is the BEST mexican food in the city. Pisticci is the best cheap Italian restaurant. You have to check out Toast for the best hamburgers around.
Junior,4,"I overall love being a student at Manhattan school of music! The courses available to us are very valuable and the professors are irreplaceable. Academically speaking I am highly impressed with the school. However the reason it did not receive 5 stars was due to the fact that their non music related department is lacking organization and support. It is a very ""you're on your own"" feel environment when it comes to the non academic portion of the school. That being said, I go to this school for the people (my professors, mentors and  colleagues ) and not for their lack of support when it comes to the school offices and officials"
Freshman,4,"Stefon Harris is an incredible leader and educator here! In his first year as the Associate Dean of the jazz program, he has given master classes on his harmonic system almost weekly, while inspiring creativity, ambition, and artistry from students here. 

On the flip side, I was unhappy with my trombone teacher for the first semester. He didn’t always come to lessons, owed time, and was not communicative during these cycles of disconnect. I didn’t feel encouraged by his style of teaching and had to draw from other classes, as well as my own passion, in order to improve."
Freshman,4,"I truly love my program, but feel the school itself lacks a proper punishment and justice system for students, and is unorganized. I would tell anyone applying or considering attending to 100% do so, but do know the school has a few things it needs to work out."
Freshman,4,"The opportunity provided to students at Manhattan School of Music is incomparable. Because of its location, students are never bored and always have something to do. The administration cares about each student, and they always make decisions based on what is best for the students and not what is best for the school. Some aspects of the school are not completely up-to-date, such as certain technological features, but the school is working on improving them. The faculty are well-known and successful, and are an incredible resource to the students."
College Sophomore,4,"The security is very spot on especially since our campus is so small, it's becomes very tight which makes things run very smoothly. If there is a crime on campus, the student life directors always make sure that we're aware of the situation so that we should take our safety more into consideration in the given time."
College Sophomore,4,The atmosphere MSM carries is encouraging & calm.
College Freshman,4,I would choose my school over again and again! It is great because it is a music conservatory for talented students. The faculty are amazing and geniuses. The classes are intriguing and provoking. This school pushes you to be your best.
College Freshman,4,"It is easy to get ANYWHERE you want in New York City. With so many tourists, students and even residents, there is nothing impossible to get anywhere. For the cost, subway and trains are the most affordable transportation in New York. If you want a faster ride, take a taxi although it will cost much more/"
College Freshman,4,"I am currently pursing bachelor's degree as piano major. The school is great actually. Only problem is elevators that keep breaking down. Although there is no campus, there is plenty to do to keep yourself busy especially practicing. Building up a good repertoire to play with orchestras, ensembles, or even solo is the main priority of becoming a successful musician. I do find the academics challenging but I look forward to learn new things everyday. I would recommend this school to any serious musicians because the professors are very knowledgeable about their subjects and the time you spend here is very precious, including meeting other musicians there just like you. Also, it's in New York City, where classical and jazz music attracts tourists all over the world. There is so much to do whether it's school or exploring in the city!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"I graduated Manhattan School of Music. This school has high quality of professors. Most professors are very passionate to students and lots to learn from them not only the knowlege but also the musicianship. Also, I like most about is playing in many orchestras. Every semester, I auditioned and I played in 2or 3 concerts. Every concert needs 30hours of rehearsing times but it is very fun and very productive. Although tuition is extremely expensive, I am proud of myself that I graduated this school."
College Sophomore,4,"Pretty Carefree Yet There Are Limits – The conservatory already expects its students to be serious about their major. Therefore, there are more unspoken rules than anything. Kids only get in trouble for being too loud, having alcohol or drugs in the dorms, or causing a disruption or danger in the school."
College Senior,4,"Indoors Campus – The campus at MSM is almost exclusively indoors, which is very much so climate controlled. As such, be it rain or snow storm or heat wave, the weather in MSM is consistently mild."
College Senior,4,New York City...Speaks for Itself – living in new york city means all sorts of housing opportunities. For cheaper apartments one can choose to search in the Queens borough and for more convenient albeit more expensive choices there's Manhattan itself.
College Senior,4,"Pretty Good – I liked the overall experience from the Manhattan School of Music. Only thing that I am wishing is that school facility can be renovated, but it is good enough to go to school."
College Junior,4,PATRICK RYANS – Patrick Ryans is the bar for Manhattan School of Music students. They have bands from MSM playing every weekend. Always fun crowd.
College Junior,2,"The dorms at Manhattan School Of Music are expensive but very convenient in a way that the dorms are connected to the school so you can roll out of bed and make it to class within minutes. They are pricey, not too spacious but I hear are better than other music schools which is definitely a plus. We also have plenty of practice rooms which is great. Second floor is designated just for practicing and is open 24 hours. The dorms are not too clean but thats because of some of our residents. I would say staying at the dorms is just a convenience."
College Junior,2,"Too many cars, usually very hard to find parking and when you do its for the upcoming day fo street cleaning. Better to opt out for taxis or public transportation."
College Junior,2,"This is a music school, music kids do not have very much of a nighltife. Sometimes people gather to a local bar such as El Porton for a couple of drinks but thats about it. We don't have frat parties, just simple gatherings. Unfortunately"
College Junior,2,The food is overpriced and is not good at all. Best to order in or go grocery shopping to have something at the dorms.
College Freshman,2,The main building is very old and has outdated facilities.
College Senior,2,"Very Little Support – Given that MSM is a private institution and regarding its comparatively small campus size (around 1,200 students in total) as well as how much the school depends on grants and donations, the administration/financial aid finds it difficult to support all the students that are in need of financial aid. Tips for getting financial aid include working very hard at your instrument/career choice at an early age so that one might be eligible for merit scholarship."
Niche User,1,"THIS SCHOOL PROTECTS RAPISTS. If you expect your voice to be heard, this is not the school for you. If you expect the school to care about you aside from your musical concentration and your money, do not go here."
College Freshman,1,Manhattan School of Music does not have enough scholarships to give around. Few students get good scholarships and many get no scholarship.
College Freshman,1,"Lack of Power – MSM is a small music school when it comes to computers its lacking. The only place with public computer is the library. The MSM library is open Monday through Sunday and they have about 10 computers. The MSM wireless system is terrible I would probably bring my own hotspot or an ethernet cord for high speed internet. However, MSM is a great school that makes you feel like you belong."

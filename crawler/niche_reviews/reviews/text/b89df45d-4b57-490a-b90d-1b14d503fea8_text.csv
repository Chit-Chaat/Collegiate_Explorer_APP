Junior,5,ECSU is an hbcu and for the next 5 years about of the NC Promise grant which makes tuition $500. Elizabeth City is a great school to go to because the class sizes remind me of high school the professors are personable . The campus of Elizabeth City State University is a medium size campus filled with love and entertainment. During my 2 years at Elizabeth City I have absolutely loved it. As of now the college life at all schools are changing due to COVID 19 but Elizabeth City has worked hard to normalize campus life as much as possible.
Junior,5,"I have taken a couple classes online while being on the campus. The online experience is rather calming and not overwhelming as some think! ECSU provides students with a rental option when it comes to textbooks so that means you are able to get the textbook(s) you need for your online class. The instructors for the courses I took were always available to speak, whether that be an email conversation or a phone call. Each course had a reasonable outline that allowed the students a perfect timeframe to complete assignments. These courses never interfered with any of my in-person classes. Overall, the my online learning experience at Elizabeth City State University has been nothing but successful!"
Sophomore,5,Elizabeth City University believes in opportunity. I love how envolved you can be as a student. What you say matters and they never make you feel less than. When it comes to interaction between the student and staff the word to describe it is immaculate. Instant responses and tutorial services are provided. Office hours are reasonable and they really take advantage of being a small school. We are able to connect more and actually learn more. Things I would like to see change is more activities and things going on outside the campus. Examples are community service and positive events. This was the school for me.
Sophomore,5,"8, Under unfortuante circumstances my learning shifted from face-to-face learning to online classes. They did very well with communication. The professors office hours or contact hours expanded. They were here for any questions that I mayhave regarding to how work was suppose to be turned in, grading, and other resources. I felt more secures than ever. It was a big transition and they did it very well. Classes took place on zoom and they still delivered their lesson plans as if we were in the classrom. The professors at ECSU are very devoted and want all students to have all the tools that they need. No matter if it is online or physical. Your experience does not change or any better than the next person."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at the illustrious Elizabeth City State University has been wonderful so far. The professors work along with you diligently to make sure you are doing well within your courses, and that you may go go on to the next level. I also admire the campus life, it is really chill."
Sophomore,5,Great school. Most of the professors that I had the opportunity to study with have opened my mind completely. I really love it here.
Senior,5,I love Elizabeth city because its a small community and it is a quiet and calm place. It feels like home and it easy to get around and understand what is going on there. I feel facilities should be updated and quality of food should be enhanced dramatically. Also safety needs to ne enhanced as well due to mold being an issue at our school.
Niche User,5,"When I toured Elizabeth City State University this past Friday, I loved how the campus is not too big and it is easy to get around on campus. Also, I loved the classroom sizes. They were normal size classrooms and it would benefit the students that don't learn very well in large classes."
Junior,5,For the most part I like how most of my teachers teach. I like the atmosphere. Being that I originally started in 2007 and left in 2010 I decided to come back in 2019 to finish what I hard started. It's a lot different with me being a lot older and not too enthused of the campus life. I like now that I am in my major the classes are a lot smaller so that makes it easier to have more one on one level which I am very enthused about.  Viking Pride!! E-C Ahhhhh S-U I love it!
Freshman,5,It's a very lovely school. The campus is very big and people on campus made me feel at home. The school made not have the major that I want but I'm glad I'm able to go to college and go earn my Bachelors degree.
Niche User,5,My experience at Orientation was awesome! We took a tour of the campus and met with financial aid officers. Everyone was very nice and helpful.  The campus is clean and neat. I really like the small class size at the university. It makes me feel more comfortable.
Sophomore,5,"I enjoy the small classes and dedication of all my professors at ECSU. I feel like I will be prepared when I go on to graduate school. However, I wish they had a master's program for social work and were more involved with the community."
Junior,5,A small university that is starting to become what it use to be in the past. Numbers are growing when it comes to the population which is increasing student life
Senior,5,I've had very few negative encounters with that institution. I can say that the only thing I would say as a bad thing about this institution is that their response time for financial aid could be faster. Everything else about the school is really wonderful.
Junior,5,"Hello, My name is Latrice Brothers and I am currently a student at Elizabeth City State University. I'm a junior majoring in Aviation Science and I can honestly say that I am truly proud to be a mighty Viking. Since my freshman year I have met amazing individuals that want to see me grow and move beyond the university. College is a great and fun experience but its not just about the parties. Being in the Aviation program my advisors are hardworking people who don't mind going the extra mile to make sure that each student in that department are getting the help they need to graduate within their 4 years."
College Sophomore,5,Campus security makes you feel safe and taken care of.
College Junior,5,Our greek life keeps the campus live.
Recent Alumnus,5,"For a small school, this school has truly impressed me. I have regained my passion and strive for my interest and talents in Mathematics. I received my Bachelors Degree here and I am pursuing my Masters now. My teachers have a strong interest in fueling my passion and raising me higher and higher in my studies and intellect in this field. They believe in me and in turn it makes me believe in myself more and more."
College Sophomore,5,"This school was not my initial choice when it came to choosing a college, but I am glad I chose it because it gives me the opportunity to major in pharmaceutical science unlike many of my other choices. Just about all of the professors I have had are there because they love their job and they would like to see the students succeed. The class sizes are perfect, because it is enough people present to be noticed and easily have discussions."
College Sophomore,5,"They offer much financial aid based on your financial need. What also plays a major role is when they suggest that you start putting in your paperwork, that you actually start doing it. The sooner everything is completed the faster. My experience has been great because every question I have asked has been answered, or when I needed additional help they have worked with me on that also."
College Sophomore,5,"The Greek Life is a major thing on campus. They are always involved in different activities. There are a variety of sororities and fraternities. There are no houses that are made specifically for them, but I have realized in some of the dorms that many of them just try to room together. Many of the non-Greeks, admire the Greeks. This is shown by the many students that cross over into the Greek life, or just the general interaction with one another. Everyone interacts with one another, whether you're Greek or not."
College Senior,5,"I love my housing, and the other housing available is great too."
College Sophomore,5,"Printing on campus is free. There are two places where wireless access is at its best on this campus. There really isn't a need to purchase your own printer, but a personal computer is crucial. "
College Junior,5,Being that I am apart of an organization I feel that greek life is what drives this campus and keeps it pretty entertaining. 
College Senior,5,"There are many restaurants to choose from near the school, ranging from cheap fast food places to nice restaurants. The price varies so something can usually be found to fit any budget. There are also local places that are very good"
College Senior,5,"I'm in the pharmaceutical science program at my school and the curriculum is more intense than other programs at the school. I enjoy the program and the time I have to dedicate to study and keeping up with meeting with the professors. It's no walk in the park but it is all worth, all the late nights of studying and load of assignments to be completed will pay off in the end.  There are a lot of internship and job opportunities, the facility is great and very comfortable where you can study and desk or tables, meet up with peers and enjoy the views."
College Senior,5,As a pharmaceutical science major it is important that I do a internship. I have not yet had the opportunity to do one but it is in my future plans to get a internship. A internship is important and also it is helpful at the same time. Having a internship can help give you experience in your field of choice it gives you a idea on what you will be encountering on a daily basis and you gain experience. Internships held you meet new people and create worldwide connections that could help you for future purposes.
College Senior,5,I am happy with my program of study if I could do it all over again I would. I plan to graduate with my bachelor degree in pharmaceutical science and a minor in biology. After I receive my degree I plan to apply to a pharmacy school to obtain my masters and then my Phd. I will like to work in a retail pharmacy or do research in a lab. My field of study have a broad area of jobs which I can work I am excited about my career or choice and look forward to starting it.
College Sophomore,5,Our town is the heart of many activities that goes on. Our downtown area is famous for the potato festivals. Also many people come here for the 4 of July to enjoy family and friends. A lot of people also have there family reunions here as well. Elizabeth City is a small and quite town were older people come here to retire.
College Sophomore,5,The restaurants here has a lot to offer. The area of  a lot of the building are pretty big. And this provides consumers with a lot of space were nobody is touching anybody. I like McDonalds and Apple bees because they are known for the spacious building and good food. They have also done so lateness updates to there building to satisfy there consumers.
Recent Alumnus,5,The school has great rooming facilities and the food is great in the cafeteria. Since they have remodeled the school is beautified and the atmosphere is great.  Advisors are prepared and listen to you and your needs.
College Junior,5,"After Academics we take our Athletes very seriously. We are in D2 CIAA division and I would honestly say the most competitive as well. School spirit Is high as far as supporting the athletes an there are plenty of sports to choose from for both women and men. Basketball, football, women's bowling, cheer leading, baseball, softball, golf, tennis and so much more"
College Junior,5,"For a lot of people to downgrade and talk bad about ECSU, our graduate levels are very high and the students are about their education. There may be a party goin on, but most students would rather cram for their final vs going out and partying."
College Freshman,5,Challenging assignments and definite attention from tutors and professors when needed.
College Freshman,5,Our academics at ECSU is excellent in my opinion. You always have the help of your professors when necessary and the work is definitely challenging.
College Sophomore,5,"The Academics here at ECSU are outstanding. Fortunately for us students, there is help in each department and tutoring for anyone needing help in any subject. With all the labs, study halls, instructors, students, and resources, its difficult to fall behind in my work. So far, most of my professors have showed much interest in my school work and even my future. I have yet to come across any one having a bad day."
College Senior,5,The course work revolves around writing and interacting with others. The classes are small so everyone receives individual attention. The professors are always available to help you and they work with you.
College Junior,5,"My major, as well as quite a few other majors, are very small so the attention that each student is given is more than most students probably get at larger colleges."
College Junior,5,"All of the computers on campus were just recently bought and all upgraded to the updated network for the school. They also just added a few new labs to allow students more access, as well as extending the time that those labs are open."
College Sophomore,5,"I Love My ECSU – My school is a one of the manay HBCU that expands and gives there students oppurtunites to explore the college expereince . The teach us to strive and succede in everything we do , so that when we graduate we will be able to ecxele in the real world. I really take pride in my school as they take pride in each and everyone of their students!"
Junior,4,"I have experienced the ups and downs of college. I enjoy the closeness of the professors and the ratios of classes at ECSU! I love the bonds I have formed not only with the professors but with the facility and student body. The overall relationships are promising and the school wants nothing but success from its Viking Family! We, the students, are always informed when it comes to the decisions our chancellor makes in regards to improving the campus and increasing academic excellence. There are more things to boast about when it comes to ECSU. I believe the adjustments you have to make as an individual is the size of the campus and student body. If you are looking for a small scope when it comes to those necessities, then ECSU is for you! Another factor is the location of the school; it’s in a rural community but once you dive deep into the area, you’ll find more than what you think! It’s also an hour from two beautiful beaches, the Outer Banks and Virginia Beach."
Sophomore,4,"Although it is a small school with not much to do in the area, my freshman year there was very fun. I do feel that at certain times the school could do much better with their communication to the students in times of emergency. As far as education, classes were pretty small and most teachers are willing to help the students with everything we need and have questions with. The campus is pretty small so it's easy to get to classes and events without a car. The food in the grille is pretty good and the cafe os good most of the time. There is a great amount of networking throughout the school and a sense of family in times when it's needed. Plus you can't beat the $500 tuition so I'll definitely be returning this year."
Sophomore,4,"This is my first semester here at Elizabeth City State University in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. I am originally from Charlotte, North Carolina, so moving five hours a way was a big deal to my family and I. ECSU has been nothing but welcoming to me since I have been here. The reason I came all the way to the outer banks for college is because ECSU is the only four year Aviation Science program in North Carolina. I aspire to be a professional pilot, and I was looking for a school where I could get an education at and start my flight training. Not only has the school itself have been great, but the aviation department themselves are very community orientated and tight knit, which has proved to be beneficial for my educational growth."
Sophomore,4,It is a small college so your teachers and professors get to know you and you have the ability to know them and the classes are small and you can ask questions.
Freshman,4,I love Elizabeth city State. I love the professors.  They interact with me and care about my future as much as I do. I love the diversity and the location of the school. Small town but just enough for me .  I wish that the security was more involve in the small crimes that go around on campus
Junior,4,ECSU is a small university but has a certain charm that none can compare to. The student teacher ratio is great and you really get to connect with the professors.
Freshman,4,"Elizabeth City State has been a wonderful experience so for each and every one of the professors are helpful and motivational. That push students to excel in what they do. In my opinion it is a very good school, the environment is quiet, students are eager to learn and everyone is very friendly. Not to mention the programs are extremely intellectual and better prepare students to be future doctors, educators, engineers, entrepreneurs and more. If I could change anything about Elizabeth City State University, it would have to be the classrooms.  I personally taught the classes were over capacity and students were able to move around where they were more comfortable and engage efficiently."
Junior,4,My experience here is that the school is very boring it's always raining so if you plan on going out make sure you have some rain boots. The walk to class isn't that far but yet you still have to walk a distance. The food in the cafe is horrible tbh. The teachers and professors that you receive within your major teaches multiple classes so you will see them again make good friends with them.
Senior,4,Elizabeth City State University is a college experience that will influence anyone to be successful in there career goals. Student life and academics of the school are a breed of superb professionalism along with a neutral atmosphere to fit any one person's personality. It is a fun adventure for someone to who has a diverse mind set and is willing adhere to social guidelines.
College Sophomore,4,I live in Viking Village and it is next to the best I share a room with 5 other girls but I have my own room and  my own bathroom. We also have a full kitchen and a nice living room with washers and dryers always available. Overall I can not complain at all.
College Sophomore,4,Once again I am a student athlete on the Women's Basketball team and we work very hard to keep this program going.
College Senior,4,Safety is very important to me. I feel safe on campus.
College Senior,4,"Overall, the university is great. Will do their best to help."
College Senior,4,Students are very involved in their Greek life (if you are a member) whether its through community service or promoting their club.
College Senior,4,Good coaches  some great athletes have come out this college
College Senior,4,Nontraditional student. Not into a lot in college activities or school events.
College Senior,4,"The university has several pros as well as cons. Small class size and a cozy environment are a few of the pros. As with any university experience, it is entirely what you make it to be."
College Sophomore,4,Our Career Services center always has brochures and options for students seeking jobs and careers after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,We have a variety of Greek's to choose from which makes our campus socially diverse
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy attending Elizabeth City State University and I would highly recommend my school to graduating seniors.
College Senior,4,They take time to coach you along
College Senior,4,Great job done with the athletic department
College Senior,4,I feel very safe and I think the school operates on very healthy conditions.
College Senior,4,"The courses are challenging but easy to follow, and the professors are easy to talk to and willing to work around commuters such as myself."
College Freshman,4,Campus police try their hardest to keep us safe and every body looks out for one another
College Junior,4,"I Love My HBCU , Ive meet plenty of Cool friends an networking will be great in my future."
College Junior,4,I love that our classes are small.
College Freshman,4,its awesome but it can take a toll on sleep and then waking up on time the next day
College Freshman,4,the parties are great but they cant charge for every party
College Freshman,4,its great people get along from all walks of life
Recent Alumnus,4,Good housing on campus and for cheap. I have heard great things.
Recent Alumnus,4,Good. A lot of Greek clubs. And many for different interests in the campus.
Recent Alumnus,4,It is a good Athletics program and we have every sport. The gyms are well equipped and nice.
College Senior,4,"I greatly enjoy being on a smaller campus with small class sizes. This has given be a better transition after coming from a small High School. My professors have all been friendly, helpful, and dedicated to helping me in my current and future college goals."
College Sophomore,4,My college is unique because it is small and the quality of education you receive is great. The college is also affordable. The professors are very caring and helpful. I would choose this school again because it has a lot to offer.
College Senior,4,The administration is very strict on attendance. If you are not attending classes they will send out notifications and allow you to meet with your advisor. Your advisor helps you get back on track so you do not receive an FA.
College Senior,4,The parties at the school are always full. The best parties are in Viking Village. They have plenty of space. People can come and have a good time.
College Senior,4,The people that work in financial aid are very helpful. It seems tough at times but they are always there to help.
College Freshman,4,"It's a small town and there a lot of local restaurants hiding between the fast food chains. There are even vegan places. There's an excellent coffehouse downtown that I find way better than Starbucks. It's a good place to study too. Amazing sushi place downtown and then there's McDonalds, Cookout, Sonic, DQ, and Panera."
College Freshman,4,ESCU is a super affordable school. You get what you're paying for though. I came to this school because my parents seemed worried about paying for college for me. I actually got a lot of financial aid and it;s my first year.
College Sophomore,4,The alumni are always trying to do something for the students and the school. Many of the students that have graduated have moved on to bigger and better things. The school is always notifying the students of career opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,I am pharmaceutical science major. I have am currently getting my prerequisites out of the way. I have spoken to some of the professors in this program on different occasions and I am very excited about taking some of their classes. I have been informed that there are many internship opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,The school is very strict when it comes to illegal activity on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"The police are always on patrol and whenever something looks out of order, they see about the situation. The campus is well lit at night. The administrators and professors are constantly educating the students on sexual related crimes. The school also receives patrol from off campus officials. They usually respond to situations quickly."
College Sophomore,4,"It is basically a work in progress. I really enjoy it because everything is right there when you need it. There is currently a dorm that is being renovated. There are some dorms, that are currently closed and could be renovated also. Whenever new buildings have been built they have looked very good. As a freshman, whether you're female or male, you don't really get a choice where you will be staying, but I was satisfied where I lived. I would say the cost is pretty reasonable. The campus is not that big so everything is pretty much in a convenient location. As long as you handle your paperwork as far as housing in the appropriate time that is asked, the process is pretty simple."
College Senior,4,I like it. Different places to travel to and eat.
College Sophomore,4,"When I think of program, I believe you are referring to my major. It was pretty simple for me. I believe the main thing that admission looked at was my gpa, high school transcript, and test scores. I believe they were satisfied with those and it showed that it was good enough to be accepted."
College Sophomore,4,"Actually I was very surprised at how much school spirit there is. It seems that clubs such as Pep Squad and the band are the talk of the campus.  I have realized that when it comes to colleges and universities in the south, the band is more important than the sports. This past year was not the best for our Football team but hopefully it'll be better this year. The basketball team did good overall. Although there is much school spirit, they are working on even more student involvement. There are always opportunities when they are trying to encourage students to be involved. The facilities in my opinion could use a lot of help, such as the fields and football arena. There is usually many people at the games especially football. Although there are problems, the school is working to fix them, like any other school. I have realized many of the students that are saying bad things about it, are those that are currently not involved in any activities."
College Sophomore,4,"Basically, it is all what you make it. Most of the parties that occur on campus are in Viking Village. Everyone wants to have fun and enjoy themselves. There are little parties here and there around the campus. It's better when it's hotter outside because that's when everyone is just having a big party outside. The parties aren't expected to have thousands of people because the school is a smaller university. Whenever I decide to go out, I enjoy myself especially because I'm out with my friends."
College Senior,4,"Not too much, not too little. Most teachers do a good job with teaching and helping us to learn the material."
College Senior,4,We have a nice library whose times are very flexible. We also have student centers and places where extracurricular activities can be held. It's plenty to do here and people tend to have a lot of fun.
College Senior,4,"We don't have to pay for our textbooks here, which saves everyone a lot of money. It's also a ""home-like"" type school. We are very small but that is apart of what makes it better honestly. We get to know each other and our professors a lot better and vice versa. It makes for a better learning environment."
College Senior,4,People are very accepting of others here. There isn't much discrimination concerning any topic honestly.
College Junior,4,"You can meet all types of guys and girls. Most of the time, all it takes is walking up to a group of students and introducing yourself. Most guys and girls are very friendly with the exception of a few."
College Sophomore,4,The athletics at this school is great. Everyone is involved with at least one sport
College Sophomore,4,My school has many oppurtunities for its students to further their education and earn extra money. 
College Sophomore,4,"First semester of my freshman year was a little hectic trying to get financial aid process done. Now, it's fairly simple. "
College Junior,4,"Overall, this was not my first choice but the cost of attendance is really great. I've met some amazing people here and received many great opportunities for internships and so much more. Since I participate in activities on campus I honestly enjoy myself. Every day here isn't a party but when it is a party, ITS A PARTY! I love it."
College Junior,4,There are many updated computers and Mac labs around campus and printing is always free.
College Junior,4,Student life is always hosting some kind of event so u have to get out of your room and enjoy them to not be bored.
College Freshman,2,they only think about themselves and the fact that they have a job they act like we don't have fulltime classes
College Senior,2,The prices are too high. It is better to stay on campus.
College Freshman,2,We have sports. Cool. Division III. The football field looks abandoned.
College Freshman,2,I remember coming here during orientation and I was asked by a staff member what my major was. I said political science and they didn't even know if the school offered it. ECSU has lost a lot of funding and has taken out some things. I'm leaving at the end of this semester to pursue my goals at my dream school.
College Freshman,2,"I'm not going to sit here and lie. It sucks. Everyone likes the Ville and Viking Towers, but honestly they get trashed all the time too. Wi-Fi in the dorms are terrible and it makes it frustrating to do homework online which is all the time you have assignments. University Towers is the worst. Community bathrooms suck, but then again they suck at every college. I know the suites are terrible too."
College Senior,2,"I am distant learning and will have to drive 2 hour one way to take a 1 hour class 3 times per week. I work full time and I am unable to do this, y advisor who is also the instructor will not help me find a way to do this without coming to campus. this has been going on for several semester I have 5 classes left to graduate and this class is holding ,me up"
College Sophomore,2,"I knew going to this school, that there probably wouldn't be much of a scenery. The school is located in a small town. It is perfect for those who want to get away from home and go to small school. They have small downtown area with little shops and restaurants. There is a waterfront nearby, which is actually a very nice scenery in my opinion. When it comes to shopping there's not really much to offer. Everyone goes to Virginia or to their hometown to do some shopping. When it comes to the sports, the University teams are what people go watch or the local grade schools. The locals are very, I believe it's the ""southern hospitality"". It looks as if the police are around often, but events still occur but that's everywhere. I believe if they continue to construct new businesses then it will continue to get better, but it's a small town, so I don't see much of that happening."
College Sophomore,2,They lost almost everything in every sport your not know there.
College Sophomore,2,"They give you scholarships, but you still have to get loans and have a payment plan. It not worth the cost. I transferred to a different school. It has the lowest cost and great rooms.  At chowan the first year your paying two years worth of loans already. For what?"
College Freshman,2,In a lot of things campus strictness is very lenient. To my knowledge a lot of people get away with things because it is not really enforced. Many people get away with smoking and drinking in many areas of the campus.
College Freshman,2,"The local atmosphere in Elizabeth City is poor. Most people say it is a retirement area because of the lack of things to do. In order to have some quality fun most students go to Virginia which is only about 30 minutes away. There is not really a whole lot of transportation either. You either have a car or you are walking. There is only one place, that I know of, that provides transportation to locals. The water front which is downtown is a nice place to go with nice scenery of the water there is one museum located there. As far as places to shop you are better off going to Chesapeake, VA. There is one mall in EC that people nicknamed, ""The Hallway"" because that is literally all it is, with a limited amount of stores. There is an okay amount of places to eat however, they are mostly fast food places."
College Freshman,2,"I hardly ever see campus police. Occasionally they roam the streets and parking lots but that's about it. When there are big events on campus, campus police is very slack. People are free to drink and smoke practically wherever."
College Freshman,2,I mean this is an HBCU. There are some other ethnicity here as well. But of course this is a mostly black school.
College Junior,2,There is not much to do here at all but the nice cities in Virginia are only 30-45 minutes away so thats where we go for fun.
College Junior,2,There is not much variety but the pricing is very good.
College Junior,2,The financial aid process at this school is very difficult and slow.
College Freshman,2,"There are very few options of night life here. Often being a freshman you have very few places to go, and you really don't have a way to get there."
College Junior,2,It's not really a lot of party scene off campus but there are a few hosted by students and frats.
College Junior,2,Parking can be a pain in the butt if you don't come in at a descent time because parks usually fill up quickly on and off campus
College Junior,2,The food has its off and on days when it's something I would and wouldn't eat.
College Junior,2,It was a process with financial aid and I ended up not receiving an refund because of they weren't fully organized took some of the money back from me after I waited a month to receive it and paid out of pocket 
College Junior,2,Sine it is a small community it's not fun for a young person to do as well as not much things appealing to the students. There are a lot good attitudes to the students but with the good it's also people who feel the students are the reason for the unsafe things in the community. 
College Senior,2,"I have had a lot of trouble receiving scholarships. The financial aid staff is friendly and helpful, but they can't always do much. I have been helped to receive loans, but scholarship searches must be done on my own"
College Senior,2,"The locals are not very friendly, we have a few instances where off campus locals come on to campus and start altercations and even gun violence and robbery. The city and campus police are helping to crack down on the rising crime rate, but most students do feel a sense of saftey."
College Sophomore,2,The parking  here at Elizabeth city state can be a little more friendly for visitors. They do not offer nothing but 3 spaces for visitors and I think that this is sad. They have a lot more reserve spaces and I do not believe they have enough employees' to fill them. And when you park in a reserve your vehicle is tow away. I just don't like it and I feel that they should so something about that.
College Senior,2,"I was pretty much jerked around campus I went to financial aid they would send me to student accounts, student accounts would send me to financial aid etc."
College Junior,2,"Must have a permit if driving a vehicle. In the area where the school is located, you need reliable transportation."
College Freshman,2,It's Majority Black. A Few Here And There Hispanics And Whites.
College Sophomore,2,"I feel like my school is a good school, but it is alot that needs to be improved. we need more activities for the students to reduce fighting, drinking, and smoking. Also I think they should update some of the dorms ."
College Sophomore,2,"I attend a Historically Black College. I am not suprised that close to 90% of our campus is African American. This year I have seen much more diversity, but it's still predominantly black."
College Senior,2,"The food is definitely not from your mothers kitchen. It has gotten better but some things still lack. The menu does offer a great variety of options weekly but the quality of the food is not particularly my taste. There is only one campus fast food restaurant, Checkers (Rally's). Your mean plan will often fluctuate through out your years because there are times when you just won't be able to make it to your cafeteria."
College Senior,2,The weather is a hassle. If it rains then that means the city streets will be flooded due to the proximity of the Elizabeth River. Campus often floods because of the relatively lowness of its land. Classes may be cancelled but rarely ever the whole day.
College Sophomore,2,Financial aid process can be very difficult getting cleared when scholarship funds are not available.
College Sophomore,2,"It is sometimes hard finding a good parking spot. It is hell during the afternoon and Thursday/ Friday nights. Professors and staff are the only ones with the reserved parking. The worst part is most of the professors do not even use them or just there for only 30 minutes, but students are still not allowed to park there at certain times. Football games are really packed. There are not really enough parking spots for students to get to their dorms, classes, and even to the football games."
College Sophomore,2,"Ecsu' S Outstanding Housing – I love the housing at Elizabeth City State University, i am a sophmore and my freshman housing was outstanding, i was able to have my own privavcy and still be able to bind with the other girtls. The housing staff makes it comfortable for you to live."
College Freshman,2,Not Many Choices – We have some choices but not many since its a small town and all. But you do get hungry cafe close at 6:30 and at 10 if you hungry you can go to The cookout or something for a qucik bite.
College Sophomore,2,ECSU is an outstanding school in every area except finances being that they only give scholarships to north Carolina residents. That makes it extremely hard for out of state students to find a way to pay their tuition.
College Junior,2,Alright but Could Greatly Improve – Most professor here at Elizabeth City State University have the same mentality that teachers do in high school. They pass out work never really explaning it to the students. Even with the class capacity being great for one on one campus learning the teacher have a very diffrent way of teaching. some teacher here take there job seriously while other just are there to recieve a pay check.
College Junior,2,"Computer Labs Are Often Empty During Most of the School Year. The computer lab at here at the university are great as far as being up to date and not that old. As far as for people using those facility that really does not happen, with there being multiple labs across the campus there is plenty room to manoever around with no one really on top of your back. Most of the student here at the university use there own labtops for academic achievement but with the slow wifi there it is hard to get real fast connections but in general having your own or going to the computer lab doesnt really matter."
College Freshman,2,Campus Housing is alright the only nice places to stay on campus is Viking Village and University Suites. The worst are Doles and Hugh Cale. Butler has no rules so anyone can walk in/out. Bias is known the the gay girl. Wamack and University Towers are he freshmen dorms Wamack is full of raoches and UniversityTowers is full of mold.
Freshman,1,"There’s no campus life, the teachers do not care about your academic success and the admissions don’t either. I hated my time at ECSU and transferred after one semester. Many other students did the same as well."
College Freshman,1,We don't have all of our greeks active but the ones active try their best to get students involved and do things for the community.
College Sophomore,1,"I lived in a dorm were the RA didn't care. First all at chowan the RA's are student not adults so they don't care. The whole residence hall authority are students. People  do what ever they want. Girls run around all times of the day loud and screaming. Guys always in the hall pass hours. Which made it uncomfortable to take showers or use the bathrooms. The bathroom are nasty, toilets don't flush good and smell. Not clean at all hair in th sink and showers. The shower smell like old mold and full of dirt. Showers curtains dirty  and the same ones all year. Also u get fined for the bathroom if not clean. This  school is none thing but a party school underage drinking happens. They don't  care I had a girl in my hall that smoked and drinked in her room and the RA know. Also people smoke weed in front of the dorms and don't get in trouble at all. They make it look like a Christian school but it's not."
College Sophomore,1,"The food is nasty. The best thing they have is pizza, which can be bad sometimes. They dining hall is very small and lines are long.  You get tired of eating the same things.  They don't know how to cook at all."
College Sophomore,1,There not enough majors to pick from. When picking classes there not enough to pick from so you take stuff you don't need.
College Sophomore,1,Did  not enjoy none of it! The majors are terrible the school is too. All you do is write papers and take class like critical thinking which is pointless.
College Sophomore,1,"Diversity is the wrost. Mainly a black school, but on the website it's  looks totally different. The only way you get accepted at ths school if you are a party person. I found little people that took religion serious."
College Sophomore,1,They don't have real  a nurse. It's a nursing assistant. You have to go to the nearest hospital which is an hour away. The campus police are never around and are very old men. They always send you emails about brake ends. When a girl gets raped it  is not know and the right measures are not taken. A girl got raped and went through real bad emotional problems. She never returned to school.
College Sophomore,1,i never seen the shuttle bus but i guess there is one
College Sophomore,1,some days are better than others. mostly i eat at home since i do not stay on campus
College Senior,1,The school has some great subjects but the academics are weak. Teacher their don't hold themselves up to any decent standard. Everything is so scatter brained out there that nothing is ever in its place. The school has more problems with the degree paths than you can count on your hands.
College Senior,1,"The shuttle ins nonexistent, we had it for a few years and then it just stopped running altogether. The taxis are ok but most people don't have the money to pay the taxi every time they have to go somewhere. There .is really no public transportation at all"
College Freshman,1,The All Girls and All Boys Dorms for Freshman are the worse. Need Better RA's and Staff. The Best Place you can stay at is University Towers which they just built and or University Suites. The Complex is fine and Butler is the worse  place to stay.
College Junior,1,"Our nightlife sucks around campus because there really is anywhere to go in the city throughout the week. However we do have parties in our gym every now and then and when they happen, there is always a great turn out. Right on campus and accessible for students"
College Sophomore,1,The police force can be strict about smoking and drinking
College Sophomore,1,Elizabeth City is a very small town with few options to do anything.
College Sophomore,1,Transportation is horrible. The town should invest in a city bus company.
College Senior,1,"There really isn't a nightlife off campus. On campus parties always get shut down especially if it is not an approved party. There is a Viking Shuttle service that picks up students to take them to the surrounding stores in the city and different places on campus. Many of the students on campus attend more parties that are on different campuses like ODU, NSU, and ECU."
College Senior,1,it doesn't exist for the most part. Students just hang out around campus unless it is the weekend. Then there are parties in the gym
College Senior,1,"The permit cost for a parking decal is fairly reasonable. Ticketing and fine prices are often reasonable as well as long as they are for things that you had control over. Some times people have to park on curbs or on top of islands in the dorm areas due to limited parking spots. Cars aren't necessary, but the weather tends to make that decision. Flooding occurs constantly on campus and is inconvenient when walking on campus."

Sophomore,5,"The school is great, especially since they have a wide variety of programs and small classes. With Covid going on, the school has done what it can to make sure each and every student has what they need to be safe and successful. UAH plans on offering a doctoral program for psychology, which is helpful as well when the professors there help the students get jobs."
Sophomore,5,Great campus the dorms are very nice and i feel safe while attend the college. The food was good they had alot of options and easy ways to pay for food at the cafe. Not all classes were full so good place to ask questions and get help from the teacher.
Sophomore,5,The classes were easy to access and I had a great time learning from home a very fun and had a great experience doing it.
Sophomore,5,"UAH is the extended family one never expected to have. They appear randomly, but stay with you forever. I only have gone here for a year, but the student life is excellent, with numerous events to go to. Cafeteria food is subpar to average, diversity could be improved, and athletics are okay (what do you expect from an engineering school?), but what they lack is made up in people. It's like the extended family gathering; everyone's nice, and you are sure to befriend/enjoy hanging out with at least one person. For the price, this is one college to keep on your short list; what they lack in money is made up in personal connection both in and out of the classroom."
Sophomore,5,I’m a transfer student here and I love UAH. For the price we pay I would say that we need more food choices.
Sophomore,5,I haven’t taken an online class yet. I will be taking one in the fall but from what I’ve heard from my friends they are enjoying it.
Junior,5,"I love this university!! It is in an amazing city with a lot to do both recreationally and careerwise. The professors are all caring and want you to succeed in what you do. The staff is also very personable. You don't have to meet a stranger, as southern hospitality radiates off the campus. Additionally, all dorms on the campus are suite-style (AKA NO COMMUNAL BATHROOMS!!)."
Graduate Student,5,They have been very helpful so far. I have enjoyed my experience at this university.  The building are easy to find and staff is extremely helpful. You must consider this university if you want a great return on your college investment on tuition.
Sophomore,5,"Great school for those serious about learning.  Beautiful campus  safer than the area surrounding the campus. Homeless people are everywhere off campus, but the university police do a super job keeping them away despite the department being too small for the high crime rate of Huntsville."
Niche User,5,"I haven't yet had much experience with UAH since I'm an admitted student. However, everyone has been super nice with helping get ready to attend."
Senior,5,"Overall wonderful school, beautiful campus, kind & knowledgeable academic advisors, and professional professors"
Junior,5,The campus is beautiful with a lot of student involved organizations. The classes are top tier with great professors and the selection of food is actually pretty good. There are a few things I would like the school to change which is parking and on campus living. Now that the school is growing in size every year there is not enough parking nor on campus living for students. In order for there to be a student life students need to be able to have access to on campus living. As far as parking I think it is very inconvenient especially for the people who live on campus there is not at as many parking spots as there are for commuters.
Freshman,5,Great classrooms and professors. The opportunities to succeed are tremendous and there is always someone to help you accomplish your goals.
Sophomore,5,"UAH is a great school for science, math, history, computer science, art, and engineering. The teachers are passionate about the subjects they teach and are mostly fair when grading. I have learned so much from the foundation courses and I think that the required courses are fair."
Freshman,5,The resources that this university has to offer are extremely helpful. Everyone at this school is dedicated to making sure students are on the right track.
Freshman,5,The University of Alabama in Huntsville's campus is beautiful and everyone on campus is so nice and friendly. The professors are always available for students to come and get help.
Senior,5,The psychology and sociology professors are amazing. Student Life as a whole is really great and it's easy to get involved in campus.
Senior,5,"The Nursing department staff were friendly, efficient and professional. The people in the admissions office were very friendly and helpful."
Freshman,5,I have loved it so far. They have so many resources to help you with anything you need help with. They also have many activities every week to get students involved.
Sophomore,5,I’m just starting out but everything has been great. The people are nice and the professors are very knowledgeable and know what they are talking about.
Freshman,5,The University of Alabama in Huntsville is known for its high ranking STEM colleges and beautiful campus. The University of Alabama in Huntsville is located in the heart of Cummings Research Park. Cummings research park is the second largest research park in the Nation of the fourth largest in the world making hundreds of internships and job opportunities accessible to UAH students.
Freshman,5,"Lots of extracurricular, very nice people, very friendly, and great environment to learn and have fun."
Niche User,5,"I loved the charger union area because it allows for other students to meet each other as well as have a nice place to study and resources all around them including food, coffee, library, and the bookshops."
Graduate Student,5,"The University of Alabama in Huntsville is an excellent school.  The University has an excellent Engineering and Nursing Program.  It also has a good liberal arts program.  I am getting a Masters Degree in Professional Communication with a Human Resource emphasis and I love the program. 

We have a beautiful campus and there is a great student life program."
Freshman,5,Cant wait to start school here ! Ever since I was little I have wanted to go to this school. I love the location I love the people and everything.
Niche User,5,The professors truly care about the students well-being. It feels more like a family rather than a traditional student/teacher relationship.
Junior,5,"UAH is a beautiful clean campus, friendly helpful staff, and loaded with student aminities. UAH's tuition of average for a four year degree. What I love the most is the people treat you with a ""southern hospitaliy"" and it feels like home."
Senior,5,"Honors represent! Between amazing professors, scholarships, housing, and opportunities, this was 100% the right choice for me. I've had tons of research and leadership opportunities, and I've had some great times -- Bob Ross Crew, Pinecone Club, multiple weekly ACE events!"
Graduate Student,5,"The University of Alabama in Huntsville offers an incredibly affordable, fully online Doctorate of Nursing Practice Degree. This program is about half the price of other competitive programs and is also fully accredited. The instructors are passionate about the field of nursing and interested in the personal, professional, and academic growth of their students."
Alum,5,"I am about to complete my third program at UAH - 1 undergraduate and 2 graduate degrees. I feel that UAH is a great place for both traditional college students who want the whole ‘college experience’, as well as non-traditional students like myself who never live on campus or participate in campus activities. UAH classroom sizes are very conducive to learning and I never felt that I was overpaying in tuition, just to be 1 in 500 students sitting in a lecture hall. 
I believe that I received a quality education at an affordable price."
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the safe, educated environment I can learn in. It is mostly dedicated to engineering-pursuing students, and provides plenty of scholarship oppourtunities."
Junior,5,"UAH offers great opportunities to all students. The school provides great resources and programs to not only help tutoring students with classes, but also find career experience and potential jobs. This school is for those who are serious about college and is academically challenging, but rewarding. UAH has met my expectations and more."
Graduate Student,5,"Great teachers and there is always help if you need it. Events and opportunities are always created for  students to participate, i.e  career fair, tutoring services, career services, etc"
Niche User,5,"I fell in love with UAH the first time I went there because of all of the various things it had to offer for its students, and now it has even more to offer in different areas, such as academics, campus living, dining options, sports, and clubs. I live in the Huntsville area, so to have a major college right down the road is very convenient. As well, all of the times I've visited, everyone there, professors and students alike, are very friendly to visitors and passionate about their studies at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. In addition to this, the campus and buildings are well-maintained and modern. The food on-campus is good, and the Charger Union, a place where students can meet up, is fitted to meet student interest in relaxing and studying."
Niche User,5,"I love the campus. The way it looks, its layout, its facilities, and simply the campus and student life there are great"
Freshman,5,very nice campus! everyone is helpful and friendly. lots of options for scholarships and financial aid.
Niche User,5,The University of Alabama in Huntsville is a great school to prepare you for any Science Technology Engineering or Math fields.
Niche User,5,I love UAH's location down the street from the US Space and Rocket Center. Everyone on campus is super nice and very welcoming.
Freshman,5,"I'm glad I decided to go to UAH. I was worried about starting college, because high school counselors made it seem like I was going to flunk out by just setting foot on campus, but UAH proved them wrong. They give the students here so many opportunities, and have events going on every week as a break.  The housing on campus is great as well. We have suite style dorms where there are four rooms, and four roommates. If you're thinking about UAH definitely go on a tour, you can see the campus and view a dorm room. Class size depended on the subject, but my largest class this semester was probably about forty people. The professors are very friendly, and there will always be people in your class that are willing to help work on problems with you. Study wise, there are tutors for almost every subject if you need them."
Junior,5,The university of alabama has a fantastic nursing program that has benefited me greatly in my journey to become a nurse and my future as a nurse practitioner.
Freshman,5,"I like University of Alabama in Huntsville because it is a community of people who want you to be successful. From the professors, to the 
Student Success Center, to the career center, the campus is continually giving students opportunities to be the best they can be."
Junior,5,It is smaller than the average university and everyone is super helpful. The staff is wonderful about connecting with you and helping in any way that you need.
Niche User,5,My experience with The University of Alabama was PERFECT. It was in my local area and I was still able to engage with the family with friends. The admissions and the professors love to connect with you and build long-term relationships with peers of the same age. I love how they have so many avenues for so many people to invest into if they would like.
Freshman,5,I really love the UAH campus because you get the big college feel without the flashy college lifestyle. There’s is such a diversity of students because this school isn’t known for a variety of outstanding programs. They make you feel right at home and want to make sure you find the major and organizations that are right for you.
Graduate Student,5,Great experience so far as a member of a psychology lab team as I am preparing for graduate studies in the fall!
Graduate Student,5,"UAH has been worth the hard work. I feel supported by my professors and fellow students. Course work is very challenging but again, there is a lot of support to help you succeed.
If I could change one thing it would be the number of textbooks needed due to their cost."
Senior,5,"I love this school. There are so many opportunities to get involved on campus with clubs and organizations, as well as off campus with internships and co-ops."
Alum,5,"I LOVE THE CHARGERS! Seriously, the best experience of my life was during my years at UAH. I even worked in the admissions office after I graduated from there. It's an amazing school. The size is perfect and the faculty really do care about you. It's filled with unique people and celebrates diversity with kindness. I also love the athletic programs there. The academic programs are some of the best in the country. I'll end with a quote, ""If loving the chargers is wrong, I don't wanna be right!""- Les Stuedeman, Head UAH Softball Coach"
Freshman,5,All of the professors are very helpful.  Buildings and classrooms are easily accessible.  Student advisors are readily available.  The campus is well kept and has lots of areas for students to congregate.  It is always expanding to offer even more things for students to be involved in.
Sophomore,5,I love the environment at UAH and all the people but there needs to be more parking for the students.
Sophomore,5,"There's little that I do not love about The University of Alabama in Huntsville. As soon as you step past the ponds, grass, and beautiful buildings, you will find the students are just as wonderful. out of the people that I have met there have been academic-minded people who share in my love of learning. Even moving from almost 2,000 miles away (I live in Los Angeles), I instantly felt at home at The University of Alabama in Huntsville."
Niche User,5,I really like how friendly and helpful the admissions staff is at UAH. The food is great and I love that they have many options. There are also various shopping centers around the campus. I love the various courses offered. So far I have received great advice and information on beginning my freshman year at UAH and I really recommend this college.
Freshman,5,"The University of Alabama in Huntsville is a great school! It has tons of opportunities for student involvement and free tutoring! It is a very academically challenging school with great professors, I strongly recommend this school! I am personally glad I chose to attend this university."
Freshman,5,An excellent campus with plenty of support to ensure that all students succeed.  The professors are friendly and you always feel safe and at home on campus.
Sophomore,5,"My experience here has been amazing. I've had so many opportunities; they've been offering me research positions since freshman year! And student life is amazing - so many clubs, and the residence halls are all private bedrooms."
Junior,5,"UAH is an awesome university, the teachers I have had have been great and really helpful. I love the student atmosphere too, we are all here to learn, not party, so I've made some really great friends and study partners. There are also a lot of opportunities to get involved with employers between the school hosted events and being right near Research Park, NASA, and Redstone Arsenal."
Senior,5,"This school sets you up for success, all you have to do is utilize the school's resources that they provide for you. The only thing I would change is the student culture is not very interested in the athletics compared to other schools. I would hope the athletic program will soon gain interest by the student body!"
Niche User,5,They have a strong academic program that will hit home for all students getting into their career fields. The school also prep students for their career field by getting hands on practice with what they are trying to profess in.
Freshman,5,Adding more parking for commuters. I like that I can go anywhere to study and hang out with classmates. Having the opportunity to have a tutor in any subject that you need help with. That the professors have an open door policy with office hours. I recommend that the school make the Ladies Self-Defence class madantory for women to take it there Freshmen year so that they can be safe on campus especially if they live on campus.
Sophomore,5,"Being a student at UAH is like putting yourself in challenge. This university is top 1 on investment in AL. The teachers have what it takes to build up students mind. Being in a engineer school doing Math major is hard to do, but uah welcomes all students that willing to work hard toward success. No need to be changed."
Sophomore,4,"The professors offer hybrid classes as well as try to make things cheaper for the students, considering many are having a hard time affording anything right now."
Sophomore,4,I love the way The University of Alabama in Huntsville feels like it is its own small town. This school is like a home away from home to me.
Junior,4,"The classes are challenging, the campus is enjoyable, and they've responded fairly well to the COVID pandemic."
Senior,4,"UAH is typically viewed as a STEM school, but they have notable nursing and education programs. It is a fast-growing school, beware there is ALWAYS construction happening. There seems to be a diverse mix of professors and students alike. I have quite enjoyed my two and a half years here."
Sophomore,4,"Most of my professors used Panopto recordings for class, Zoom for live meetings, and Canvas for assignments and communication. Professors were available (given the sudden transition to online) most of the time, but there is something missing about learning online. It lacks the zest of in class discussions, face-to-face communication, but that's more of a critique of online courses. UAH did a pretty good job at the transition, most professors included, and aiding students in these times with a pass/fail option, too."
Sophomore,4,"It's a great commuter school. Dorm life is the dumps, though.

Go to the cheapest school closest to you, kids. Moving out isn't worth it, in my experience."
Senior,4,"This public school is very challenging, academically. The center of educational funding seems to go towards the engineering programs, and while efforts have been made to disperse funding to other majors, I strongly believe that more measures must be taken to improve the quality of academia among majors that are not engineering-based."
Alum,4,It was close to where I lived and it was convenient to drive to and from campus which saved money on housing.
Sophomore,4,The largest source of umbrage I have with UAH is the forced meal plan that is frankly too large and expensive.
Freshman,4,"Its a very good university, very diverse and live with culture. the professors are not bad and can be very understanding of the things that go on in your life. The food is very diverse and can satisfy anyone's taste."
Freshman,4,UAH is pretty good. The bedrooms are small but it's one person to a room which is really nice. The airport is really close so if you live out of state that's nice. The first week after everyone has moved in the university has a whole bunch of events to help you get connected and find your crowd.
Senior,4,"I started at UAH my junior year, and the transition was no issue at all. My out of state classes transferred easily. In my opinion, the fees are a little pricey for what you get. But overall it’s a good school."
Freshman,4,"UAH is a great school for anyone interested in a STEM career or Nursing. They also offer Business and other smaller fields but those aren't as supported by the school. If you can get a tuition scholarship, the return on investment here is excellent, and most of the staff here will do everything to help you succeed. The party scene is harder to find, but it still exists. If you're into sports there are multiple teams here (just not football), and there are also clubs for just about every big hobby. The dorms on campus are ok, Frank Franz Hall showers are tiny though and there are frequent pest issues in some other dorms on campus. Overall, the school is quite nice but be ready for empty weekends if you stay on campus as well as challenging coursework (especially in the larger fields)."
Freshman,4,"The campus is really open and pretty, and everyone here is different, but accepted. Feels like a judgement-free school."
Senior,4,"The school, to me, is mainly focused on the sciences. Just like every other college there are some easy classes and some very hard classes. If you are willing to do the work ie, study, do the homework, and show up and pay attention in class then a degree is easily obtainable. I am not your average student as I am an older student. I like the fact that you can just take one or two classes a semester or more if you like. It just fits my schedule better."
Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman here, but I love it so far! The teachers and students are great. It's a welcoming environment. I have met so many new people so far. I kinda wish sports were bigger, but that's only a personal preference!"
Sophomore,4,"The University of Alabama in Huntsville is an amazing school for engineering and nursing majors! Academics and programs are top notch and faculty are committed to finding graduates jobs after graduating. People are nice, food is excellent, and housing is phenomenal. Very nice school."
Junior,4,"UAH overall is a fairly small school, and as a current Computer Science major feels very welcoming and personal compared to other schools. Cost wise out of state it's a bit high, but roughly comparable to other schools. Location wise it has one massive advantage for a STEM major- the Redstone Arsenal. One of the biggest hotspots in the country for engineering research and other security-related jobs, and the defense industry is growing rapidly. Internships and Co-ops are often local, and most larger companies have a building or three in Huntsville(or on the Arsenal). Many professors know someone or are themselves former employees of said companies, helping students get their foot in the door for internships and jobs."
Sophomore,4,Everyone is extremely nice and helpful. I believe once construction is done it will be a better looking campus.
Junior,4,"The school is great and the people are very nice. The classes are pretty decent, but making friends within your classes definitely helps.  The food isn't the best and they could use more options, but it isn't horrible."
Sophomore,4,"Professors and advisors are super helpful and easy to work with.  Most professors are fair grade wise, and will scale if the entire class struggled. Having to get a meal plan is annoying but you can choose how much goes toward what. The parking situation is bad, so be prepared to walk or bike around campus. It is a small campus though."
Sophomore,4,"While the university is still growing, the professors take their job to teach the students seriously. Many are devoted to teaching the objectives of the class and students are serious to accel in the material taught."
Junior,4,"Overall I’ve enjoyed my experience at The University of Alabama in Huntsville. Already familiar with Huntsville it seems to be safe, academically rewarding, and fun!! It is not a big party school which is good for overall focus and it also allows me to feel comfortable on a day to day basis. The professors are overall good, decent food, and an enjoyable setting."
Freshman,4,I recently toured the university this summer and intend on attending this fall semester for a degree in engineering. The campus was very impressive and I am excited to start this oppurtunity.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Alabama has been the experience of a lifetime. With many of the professors involved in a multitude of research, there are many opportunities for capstone projects and partnerships with faculty. Furthermore, Huntsville contains one of the largest research parks in the country which allows for many possible internships and co-ops. Overall, student life is full of many fun solutions to stress management thanks to an amazing Association for Campus Entertainment."
Senior,4,I have been very impressed with UAH thus far. The professors genuinely want to help you learn and they are easily accessible. I am a returning student and since my time at UAH I have had many career and educational opportunities in line with my interests.
Junior,4,Overall I am happy here. I have made friends and have gotten some amazing opportunities. There are a few downsides such as insufficient parking and it seems that there is always construction happening somewhere on campus.
Senior,4,"It is hard. The further you go, the harder it gets. But the more confident you get because you know by the time you get out of there, you are ready for any flow and any blow. You Will be a critical and creative thinker,  And a problem solver no matter the major you started with at UAH. You Will discover  the team player and the leader in you even if you started as the most introvert individual. You will learn to seek more than just the solution to a current problem, but reach further into futuristic solution.   You Will be a better person for passing through UAH, someone reliable and efficient."
Junior,4,Great ROI so far. Been there less than a year and have already landed 2 internships and internships lead to jobs. Career services are well involved with the colleges on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I am now going into my second year at the university. So far my experience has been very good. For many of the classes that I have taken, I can say that the professors really care about the subjects that they teach and that they want their students to succeed. This can not be said for all professors, but that is what is generally to be expected from most other universities. Something else that I like about UAH is the open and cleanliness of the campus. One thing that I would like to change is where classes are located. sometimes it can be difficult to get from class to class if you only have 15-20 breaks and your classes are in different sections of campus."
Niche User,4,I love the atmosphere and everyone is very helpful! The campus is very conveniently located for engineers because there are a lot of aerospace companies around. This allows for many co-ops and internship opportunities.
Sophomore,4,"The campus air is very welcoming and enjoyable. It's easy to find things, and the employees and students are willing to help with any questions that might be had."
Graduate Student,4,The university of Alabama in Huntsville is a well rounded university. It offers different programs to cater for different student needs. Housing in campus and out of campus is affordable. Food options in and around the city of Huntsville are excellent.  Parking around campus is somewhat lacking.
Junior,4,Great Experience! Professors and staff are supportive of completing academic goals and gaining the real world experience and knowledge.
Junior,4,"The University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) is a very good school for students that are interested in one of the STEM fields. UAH provides a lot of assistance and support for their students, no matter the situation. I have greatly enjoyed my experience at UAH, however, I would like to see a lot more diversity in some of my classes- in terms of race and gender. I feel this critique will change within the upcoming years because of the growing influx of students each year."
Sophomore,4,"My first year at UAH was a wonderful experience that truly helped me learn and grow. The teachers at UAH will definitely try to help you with any assignment as long as you show effort in their classes. I did encounter a bit of trouble with financial aid and my scholarship following my Spring Semester, but this should not deter anyone from attending. I would definitely recommend UAH to anyone who is interested in a school that focuses heavily on engineering, science, or nursing."
Freshman,4,"The University of Alabama in Huntsville is primarily and engineering and science school, but offers a huge range of degrees in many different colleges. One thing that draws many students to UAH is their financial assistance programs. The financial offices offer merit-based scholarships based on GPA and ACT scores - covering up to the entire cost of tuition and room and board - and will work with you to set up subsidized then unsubsidized loans if still needed. Overall, living on campus is a great experience as it allows you the freedom to do what you want, when you want to, and enables you to be involved in one or more of the many clubs and organizations."
Freshman,4,The UAH campus is very friendly and beautiful. There are lots of places to hangout or hang up a hammock whether inside or outside. Most of the teachers here are very friendly and will help you in any way they can.
Freshman,4,"The University of Alabama in Huntsville is very accommodating, when it comes to communication. There is a plethora of staff members that will answer any question that you may have, in a timely fashion. Not only this, but the students are also very helpful and friendly. I came to UAH to register in March, and a student heard that I was a theatre student, so she told me all about the program and student life. It was very very helpful. The only thing that I have not liked at the university is the fact that the campus is very spread out."
Freshman,4,"I moved to Huntsville, Alabama from Vermont to attend UAH. I love the area, and the campus fits right in."
Junior,4,"The university has great qualities and opportunities for students fresh out of high school. From professors to advisors to students themselves, everyone is out here to see you succeed and will support however they can. It's more like a family than a university."
Freshman,4,"It's a great school academically, and as far as opportunities it has to offer to it's students. The school is just not as diverse as one would hope. Diversity is just a main aspect of a college to me, and UAH just doesn't have a substantial amount of it."
Senior,4,"The University of Alabama in Huntsville is an excellent school, especially for subjects such as engineering, computer science, and nursing."
Junior,4,"The University is a great place of study and in a great location. The professors know the material very well, and the college has great hookups with future employers."
Niche User,4,"I would like to see a bit smaller of a university, because it is super spread out. It feels like you need a car to travel around campus."
Freshman,4,The University of Alabama is a very diverse and open minded school and the facilities on the campus is just wonderful. Being a upcoming freshman and visiting the school has mad me look at UAH from another aspect. From student life to the food and even to the professors which is 4:1 to students. Love University of Alabama in Huntsville.
Freshman,4,The School is great and almost everyone is very friendly. I wish there were more activities going on around campus. It seems as though many students choose to stay at their dorms during the weekend. The classes are tough but so far all of my professors have been great and cared about me passing.
Sophomore,4,"Great Engineering school, rigorous course work, lots of internship and co-op opportunities in the surrounding area. Athletics are sub par, Hockey team is fun to watch. Social scene is small but present."
Niche User,4,The college looked very nice and had welcoming and informative staff that answered any question that anyone had with a smile and was an outsatnding tour!
Niche User,4,"The University of Alabama-Huntsville is a wonderful option to every student, especially ones interested in STEM related fields. It is located in Huntsville, Al, so connections with NASA and many defense contractors are quite prevalent. The only thing that needs to be improved is that the older buildings on campus need rejuvenating."
Freshman,4,"The University of Alabama in Huntsville provides a lot of great opportunities for all students regardless of race or ethnicity. They offer trips and movie nights which is all free for admitted students.

Every year they have ""week of welcome"" which consists of a lot of events. This year we had casino night,rock the rec, capture the flag and a glow in the dark paint party. Casino night was where we played black jack and poker. They also had a ""bar"" which consisted of virgin drinks. Rock the rec consisted of key logging, silent disco, glow in the dark dodgeball and rock climbing. We played capture the flag until 2am and last but not least, we had a huge rave paint party with an awesome DJ until close to midnight. 

Class wise, the classes aren't huge unlike UA or Auburn which is great for one on one time. My biggest class has 100 people in it and my smallest had around 20. It varies but still great class sizes. 

The university of Alabama in Huntsville also offers FREE TUTORS!"
Sophomore,4,The students are nice and the professors actually care about their students. The only thing I don't like is the extremely strict attendance policy. So you could have an A in a class after doing all your work and passing all the test but if you don't attend said class very often your attendance grade could ultimately bring your total grade to a F
Junior,4,UAH is a great school that really tries to make their students feel at home. The advisers help the students set up the best schedule that will help them achieve their goals.
Senior,4,"University of Alabama in Huntsville is a fantastic school. The university is catered heavily to STEM fields, so if you're interested in studying engineering, computer science, or the biomedical fields then you will not be disappointed. UAH also has an outstanding nursing program. As a liberal arts and business student, however, I wish the university would put more money towards those two departments. There are not as many internship opportunities for students outside of the STEM field in the Huntsville area."
Sophomore,4,The University of Alabama-Huntsville is a surprisingly nice university. I am not from the south but I absolutely love attending UAH. It has the southern atmosphere which is very welcoming. Everyone is so nice on campus and there are always fun activities and events to go to. I like that it is a very academic driven school and it is not too large in population. Overall I love the campus and I plan on staying here for my entire college career! Go Chargers!
Sophomore,4,"Overall, it's a decent university. UAH wasn't my first choice of undergraduate school or even my second. It was my fifth. Despite this fact, I believe the campus has grown on me. UAH is now my home. It isn't a large campus, however, the computer science building (Tech Hall) lies across a busy stretch of road. Several of us comp sci majors swap stories of the times we almost got run over. That little tiff is about the one petty little complaint I have with the campus, besides the whole parking fiasco we have here. However, since I don't have a car, it doesn't affect me too much."
Junior,4,"UAH is a great school for those seeking a school that is focused on academics, but that offers all aspects of social life as well. I love the University's involvement with the Huntsville and the north- Alabama business community. Finding internships and volunteer activities nearby is attainable for students by the professors recommendations."
Sophomore,4,"I started attending the University of Alabama in Huntsville in the fall semester of 2016. My experience in my first year was amazing. At first I was scared about this new stage of my life because I am a timid guy. However, this school provides every service that you can think of that can help you better yourself as a person. The tutoring here is really great. they really help you out and make sure that you  understand the problems you are having trouble with. The professors here are also good. they are devoted to their students and will do anything they can to help you out. As for other services like counseling, this provides aid to any altercations you may have like personal or professional issues. The student life here is always fun here. There are multiple clubs you can join and all of them i'm sure are super enjoyable. There is a great mix of educational and student life here at UAH."
Sophomore,4,UAH is a very vibrant and welcoming campus. There are numerous activities and resources. Academic advisers are very thorough and helpful.
Senior,4,"University of Alabama at Huntsville has been the most helpful school I have ever been to. If you have a question, ask it and you will most likely leave with an answer that tells you what you need to know. The financial aid process is super painless. The professors are wonderful and very knowledgeable. You can tell how much passion they have for their subjects."
Sophomore,2,"The online classes were okay, but many of the professors do not know how to use Zoom so getting the full benefit out of online classes can be difficult."
Senior,2,"The university will charge you full-time tuition even when you take online classes. Don't bother trying to fight it. The online classes themselves are mediocre. Most professors are trained to be really good in the classroom, and few have been taught how to really teach online, and that isn't their fault. A lot of them are very passionate and really know what they're doing."
Senior,2,This school is okay. They are not as advanced or well diverse. It is still growing it seems and could use a lot of improvement.
Alum,2,"It is a good school if you want to be a nurse or a mechanical/aerospace engineer, but nothing else! As a former student in a smaller engineering, my course load forced me to take courses in all of the other engineerings. This probably would have been okay, if my mindset and my major weren't practically based rather than theory based."
College Freshman,2,honestly this school sucks. i am an athlete here and i still dont like it. the people suck. there arent many opportunities for anything besides engineering. no campus life. the bars suck. the teachers for the most part are terrible. i wouldnt recommend this school.
College Student,2,"There are generally mixed opinions of campus safety. We have had to deal with sexual assault issues before, but generally no major action is taken on the survivor's behalf. We also have Blue Boxes, which students would be able to use if they felt unsafe on campus, but since it was brought to their attention in the previous semester that several of them did not work, these have since been sealed off entirely. The size of the campus police is certainly appreciable."
College Student,2,No one really cares. We don't have football.
College Freshman,2,There are not many parties at this place. This is the place you go to after you failed at another school.
College Freshman,2,I did not get much help when I went to the financial aid office.
College Freshman,2,"I went into the scholarship process knowing that I had a full tuition scholarship, but it was not a pleasant experience. Applying for financial aid is done on a per semester basis, and always has the same requirements."
College Sophomore,2,There are several chain restaurants located close to campus but they are all very similar. There is no variety unless you are willing to drive thirty minutes or more.
College Sophomore,2,Money is hard to find and hard to get.
College Freshman,2,"The only option is bicycles that the university provides. It's free, but often, the bikes are in bad condition and falling apart."
College Freshman,2,"We don't have much transportation. However, I understand why we don't. Its a commuter college and most people don't actually live on campus. Even then the campus is spacious so cars or atleast bikes seem very necessary at all times. Plus with Alabama's moody weather you never know when you should be prepared for rain."
College Sophomore,2,"If you live off campus you really need a car, however it IS a commuter college"
College Sophomore,2,You will never know what the weather is going to be like. And uah will never let you miss a day of school.
College Student,2,The food is pretty bland. They serve the same thing all the time. I do not enjoy eating at the caf.
College Student,2,There is not much focus on funding toward the liberal arts at this school.
College Student,2,"The school attempted to provide bicycles for students to get around on campus, but after a few weeks, the bicyles had been carried off campus and it's almost impossible to find one now."
College Junior,2,There is nothing to do off campus except go hang out at the mall.
College Junior,2,There is no transportation services at school which makes it difficult to get around campus seeing as there is VERY limited parking.
College Junior,2,"Printing is expensive and slow. Also, your wireless will only work half of the time, so prepare. "
College Junior,2,"I hate walking on campus alone, it is not safe to be out at night especially. I always try to be in a group."
College Junior,2,"There is hardly ever anything going on on campus outside of school.  The only time there are planned activities is the first week of school, after that it's boring. "
College Junior,2,It was better to find something to do on campus than off.
College Sophomore,2,When its raining you can tell that some people skip class. That is just a mental thing though.
College Sophomore,2,"UAH is not a sports school. We have a soccer team, but I'm really not sure what else. I do know there are stadiums and sports areas, but it's just not my thing.

Except for the Alabama Crimson Tide, that is. :)
"
College Senior,2,I don't really participate in campus life very much. I enjoy tasty Tuesday which is when they give our free snacks on Tuesdays. The library is alright it is just a library. I don't really go outside when I do I usually don't pay attention to how the grounds look.
College Senior,2,Well I don't drive but I notice that there is a lot of issues with parking. You also get tickets for basically anything. The parking lots are small and should probably be expanded.
College Senior,2,Morton Hall needs to be rebuilt and not just patched up.
College Sophomore,2,"The parking on campus can be a hassle when the semester starts but once you figure out the times that most students leave or come, then it gets easier. However, the need for a car on campus can vary depending on where classes are, but most people walk and ride bikes. For those who do drive to school, it is a good idea to be on campus at least 20-30 minutes before your class starts to ensure a parking stop by or near your classroom building."
College Senior,2,"You have to look for things to do, and the same places get old after awhile, but it isn't too bad!"
College Junior,2,"The parking is very limited, and parking permits exceed the reasonable cost."
College Freshman,2,I feel that scholarships should be in larger amounts for excellent academics.
College Freshman,2,"Haven't had an internship yet, but would like to eventually. I'm worried about finding one in my area (marine biology) since we are so far from the coast."
College Junior,2,It's alright. More healthy options would be nice.
College Senior,2,Parking is extremely hard to get at the buildings.
College Senior,2,they are nice facilities but its a little expensive the fact that every freshman has to do it is rediculius
College Junior,2,"The guy-to-girl ratio is about 3-to-1, but majority of the guys are very nerdy, mainly focused on schoolwork and video games. About a third are worth looking at, simply because the gym here is awesome. As far as girls go, they're pretty varied. There's some deep southern belles, some kind of nerdier, some stereotypical sorority girls, but most are pretty down to earth."
College Junior,2,"The athletics here are ok, I don't really attend any of the athletic games because they aren't too big on this campus being that this is a technology/ academic based school. Maybe if I attended more of the games I would give it a better grade, right now it will remain a C."
Graduate Student,1,"I attended the ENG101 class taught by the associate dean of Undergraduate Engineering and that was all I needed to know. The class was supposed to teach ""prog fundamentals"" for Python, Matlab, and Excel online. The prof was 3 weeks late for the 1st day, frequently complained about the amount of papers and programs she needed to grade, consistently missed her own modified deadlines, didn't give the 'mid-term' exam until 2/3 of the semester was already over without grading our homework first. She never covered anything about Excel. We never compiled a program, only created scripts. The TAs didn’t pay attention while grading homework and I speculate that they don't know the material. Since there was no class eval, I attempted to bring my concerns to the teacher after the semester was over but she would not give me a specific time to talk. The level of superiority in this university education is magnitudes lower than that of community colleges. I xferred to GA Tech and am much happier."
College Sophomore,1,"It's mandatory to live in the dorms, but there aren't enough rooms for everyone required to live there."
College Student,1,Teachers could care less about you and there is nothing to do here. They want us to shut up and pay our tuition and leave them alone. Looking to transfer if I can.
College Freshman,1,"We have hockey, but not many people care."
College Junior,1,This school has the worst financial aid that i have seen. The staff is not all informed on the scholarships and are not very helpful
College Sophomore,1,There is absolutely no where to park which is very unfortunate for commuter students. They had a relatively large parking lot in front of the library but they decided to make a walk way which no one uses. Then the University decided to add another building but not add any parking except for a tiny little parking lot with two rows. It is ridiculous.
College Junior,1,"There is no money for new scholarships, yet they keep raising tuition prices.  All they use our money for is building new unnecessary buildings.  It's very frustrating. "
College Sophomore,1,"There is no nightlife, I dont think."
College Junior,1,"Besides smoking I see little to no drug use.  The fraternities and sororities will have alcohol (cough cough) and some other students secretly, but it is not a huge thing.  People smoke weed, drink alcohol, and do crazy things but discretely.  You either have to know that person/group or be at a party where it is."
College Senior,1,there isnt really a lot of places like that around the school so if you not at a frat party it's a little dead
College Junior,1,"Parking is a nightmare!! If you want to get parking, you have to get there just as the previous class is ending and people are leaving. Then, traffic is every bit of insane. I've been hit twice on campus in the three years I've been here. The parking permits, currently, are $120 and tickets are $50 for each offense, and the police on campus LOVE to hand out tickets."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking spots are very scarce and rare to find, unless you don't mind walking a half a mile from the parking deck. It is also difficult to maneuver in and out of the spot because they are so small. I have seen many fender benders due to this and have also been in a few myself. The parking permit decal is also 120 dollars which seems a bit much in my opinion."
College Junior,1,"I have not had a internship at the school, however a friend who is a graduate of UAH with and excellent GPA found it difficult to find a business internship or help from the school in finding one"
College Senior,1,"I have been given all loans. I make next to nothing, and actually I made more money on unemployment last year and was given a pell grant. This year I have a job and make almost nothing but I was not eligible for a pell grant and yet no one would explain why to me."
College Senior,1,"There isn't much of a nightlife other than the one you make for yourself; there's a Greek event once a month, but other than that it's basically just find for yourself; the campus entertainment committee ACE does put on some kind of presentation almost every week, but they aren't usually terribly interesting."
College Senior,1,"No Opposite Sex Guest After Dark – Opposite sex guests have to be checked out by 9pm. This rule is pretty childish if you ask me and others around campus. There are ways of sneaking, but we shouldn't have to (we're adults). Its ridiculous."
College Senior,1,"Guest Can Sleep for 3 Nights in a Week – If you invite someone to visit you, you will have to limit him to 3 nights sleeping at your place."
College Student,1,Walk or Drive. The only transportation that I know of at UAH is either you walk to where you need to go or you simply drive there (in which case you still may do some walking).
College Student,1,"A Hit or Miss. For one, I think the parking at UAH is overpriced. I think the school in general is pretty expensive but thats another topic. I believe I paid 135 on my decal sticker. Anyone caught without a decal or parked in non permitted space will be fined with a ticket. I don't know how much they charge because I never been fined but I hear its alot. Simply, I feel that at uah you are either lucky one day to get a parking space and on another day your walking a mile to get to class. (Or atleast it feels like a mile) I think it would be easier on students if UAH had buses to take students to different buildings like A&M."

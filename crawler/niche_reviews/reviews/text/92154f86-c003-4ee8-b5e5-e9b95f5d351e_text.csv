Freshman,5,"Franciscan is one of the best Colleges I have been to. It is very strong academically and has small classes so you get a lot of personal help from the professors. For someone looking for a faith-filled experience then this is the perfect place! there are so many different personailes you are guaranteed to find people that you get along with very well, but you are a small enough group that you do get to know almost everyone!"
Sophomore,5,"I took an Ethics class online for Franciscan, and  I learned just as much as I would have in person. The intentionality of the teachers in unmatched."
Sophomore,5,"Franciscan  University is a unique place with excellent Faith filled community. There are many opportunities to grow in every area of your life, and I would recommend that every high school consider Franciscan. There is no place like here; it really does feel like home."
Senior,5,I love how Franciscan is both academically excellent and passionately Catholic. They make sure that you excel academically by providing abundant resources for your success and they make sure you excel spiritually as well by providing abundant experiences of the sacraments and small group communities on campus to grow in your faith
Sophomore,5,"Some professors use online tools, others do not. All had to use it during covid and they did fine. Overall pretty good."
Sophomore,5,"I had high expectations for this place and I was not disappointed. This is one of the few colleges left in the country that students come to grow in their faith, and it really shows."
Sophomore,5,Franciscan offers a great Catholic education and environment. The University offers classes such as Theology and Philosophy that are unparalleled.
Niche User,5,"My sister attends Franciscan University and has loved every minute of her time here! AMAZING study abroad program in Gaming, Austria, friends and support system for life, and life-changing service programs."
Niche User,5,I went here for a seminar and got to take a tour and act like a college student for 2 days and I loved every moment of it
Sophomore,5,"Franciscan is more than a school; it's a home. A lot of the facilities, services are objectively speaking, average, but the community and caliber of people you will find here are like nowhere else."
Niche User,5,"I had a great experience when visiting Benedictine College. Students and staff were absolutely amazing and super welcoming. I had a chance to attend their yearly conference, which gave me a look at how connected and caring the student body is with each other. The Catholic experience is very important to me when considering a college and Stuebenville checked off all the boxes in that category."
Freshman,5,"Franciscan is a great place to really live out your Catholic faith while receiving an education centered around that. Everyone is very kind, other students and even professors care about you personally and going to them with questions about your spiritual life is pretty special. It is truly an amazing experience that a professor could teach us biology, for example, and outside of class also give us pointers on how to go deeper in prayer in grow in a relationship with God."
Junior,5,"Steubenville is a great place to grow as a whole person and find great community. If you're looking for a place to grow in your faith both in and outside the classroom, then Franciscan is right for you. I transferred in and I am very glad I did."
Junior,5,I would like to see more diversity and acceptance on the campus. I love the faith life and the opportunities it provides as well as the academics.
Niche User,5,"Franciscan University offers not only a great education, but an uplifting, Catholic community. I have experienced how welcoming and kind everyone is and how every single person radiates the joy of the Catholic faith. It is a place where you meet lifelong friends and experience the faith in a whole new way."
Junior,5,"I have wanted to come here and study at Franciscan since I was fourteen years old. The college's identity, its academics and community is amazing! I could not have asked for a better place to study and grow into all that I am made to be."
Sophomore,5,"Franciscan is a very welcoming atmosphere and has allowed me to meet many amazing people. It is diverse and allows you to feel at home, it is like its own little world. I found myself here and grew. It showed me that I am capable of achieving greatness and has challenged me to show my full potential. It has allowed me to feel comfortable about the future and I am assured that I am receiving the best education."
Freshman,5,"Franciscan University has a unique and diverse culture, but even with its diversity it is very united as Christ is central in most peoples' lives and in aspects of the school."
Freshman,5,This is a really cool college and it’s fun to attend. The academics are excellent. The athletics are quite good. The food is well prepared and tasty.
Alum,5,Franciscan University of Steubenville is where I envision myself being as I further my education. It is a small Catholic environment with excellent services and academics. I did not see anything on my visit that I thought needed to be improved. I can not wait to study there!
Niche User,5,"I loved the atmosphere of the campus, everyone is so nice. I felt connected with eveyone there. It felt like a close community. I like how it is out of a city and up tucked away on a hill. I would like to Change the dorms. Some of the dorms do not have air conditioning and are small."
Junior,5,It’s a great school rooted in the Catholic faith. I’ve met some very great people here and have had great professors. Very glad I chose this university.
Alum,5,"I was greatly impacted by the friends I made and the professors who encouraged me at Franciscan. The atmosphere was friendly, welcoming, and supportive. Yes, some people are holier than thou. But the environment focused greatly on encouraging each person to be the best version of themselves."
Graduate Student,5,"I believe that as a university, that Franciscan University stands out as one of the best. The classes were challenging and interesting instructed by professors who were leaders in their fields. However, the most inviting aspect of this university is the atmosphere. At Franciscan University the students success comes first, when I first visited the campus, I was amazed at how the professors and staff were so student oriented. It is the sincere wish of the staff at Franciscan to help the students achieve in their chosen fields and to become the men and women that God calls them to be. It is a truly remarkable experience that I must recommend to anyone who is looking for a place to guide them toward success."
Freshman,5,"This an absolute great school. The staff and teachers are helpful and caring. One troubling thing is that even as helpful as they are they do not offer much help in finding scholarships. 

Nevertheless, the staff is always there for you and willing to help in most situations. The classes are fun and very interactive and the wide range of topics are taught by great teachers."
Freshman,5,"So far Franciscan has been great! As a freshman I was not sure if it would fit me, but I can now say that I love it here and I would not trade it for the world. It gives me a good balance of Faith, Academics, and other aspects that I believe will help me become a better person. I would definitely consider looking at Franciscan if you are looking for a well rounded education and for something that will push you to become a better person."
Freshman,5,"Franciscan University of Steubenville is an outstanding college.  The majority of attendees are loud and proud Catholics, who are living out their faith in awesome ways!  The Professors also all take an oath of Fidelity to the Holy Father, something not all professors do at Catholic colleges"
Freshman,5,"Great place to study they have wonderful professors, housing is superb, if I had one thing I learned about is my faith and that I believe in as a Catholic since it is a Catholic university not to many parties but a great school otherwise."
Niche User,5,"Students and faculty were very welcoming and the atmosphere was positive everywhere I went. You could definitely see a change in priorities among the students many were concerned with their service project, School, family and prayer life therefore pointing toward the fact that Franciscan University promotes a counter cultural lifestyle that focuses on faith, family, and service."
Senior,5,"The community and the central focus on becoming a saint and partaking in the sacramental life while being a real, alive, and joyful person who can be a part of our world and witness Christ to others is invaluable. You will not regret putting your personal formation and your soul first."
Freshman,5,"The environment is so nice and the people are so friendly, everyone is looking not only to grow in their studies but also in their faith. This campus is certainly way different than all the other colleges I visited back home, but it is different in a good way. If you are looking to study Theology or Nursing, this is the place to go."
Alum,5,"As an undergrad, I often complained about everything from the food to the workload to the hypocrisy of the student leadership. Later, when I actually had to live in the real world, I realized what a wonderful gift the school was and had been to me. I am a better person, and exponentially better at my profession as an educator because of the philosophical, Catholic background I received from Franciscan. I am ecstatic that the school not only accepted my child as a student, but gave a very generous financial aid package for him as well."
Freshman,5,"Franciscan offers a one of a kind experience. it may not be the best location or have the greatest food but it is unique is the way that it draws Catholic students. Franciscan students are happy, fulfilled, and well educated"
Sophomore,5,Franciscan University of Steubenville is an incredible institution for young men and women who want to advance their learning while living out an authentic Catholic lifestyle. It's an environment where everything is very clearly centered around Jesus Christ and the professors are not shy in connecting their lecture material with their faith.
Freshman,5,"I love Franciscan. You can almost taste the Catholicism in the air. It is really helping me grow in my faith, and it combines faith and reason in a way that it is preparing me for the real world while at the same time giving me the Catholic arsenal to live in it but not be consumed."
Junior,5,"I've loved every moment I've spent here so far and have grown in so many ways as a person. Being able to attend a university that challenges me both academically and spiritually has led me to make new friends, take challenging courses in subjects I've never taken before, attending Church more than once a week, and so much more has helped me to become a better person."
Alum,5,"As a nursing Alumni I absolutely loved how I was not just another student because the professors knew each of us personally! We, as nursing students, were taught to care for each of our patients on not only a physical level of an illness, but also caring for people on a spiritual and emotional level which really sets this program above and beyond the rest in my opinion! 
On another note, it wasn't until Franciscan that I learned what a true friendship is - one that is centered with Christ as the ""glue"". 
One of the reasons I personally choose this school was because the years of 18-24
are some of the most influential and forming years of one's life besides young childhood and thus I wanted to surround myself in an environment that would be positive, uplifting, academically challenging and where I could grow & flourish within my Catholicism with my fellow peers and that is exactly what I did. I don't regret it one bit and I now can't imagine my life with Franciscan."
Niche User,5,Wow! people are very sweet and welcoming and their faith is so firm. It's great to see so many young adults passionate about their faith
Sophomore,5,"A fantastic education combined with a fantastic atmosphere make for a wonderful experience! Best programs are Theology, Catechetics, Education, and Nursing, but all of the programs are wonderful. Campus is very safe, with the city being less safe but not horribly dangerous. The only downside is that there is not much to do nearby, but Pittsburgh is 45 minutes away!"
College Sophomore,5,"I have loved the academics because class sizes are small and the professors are there to help you become a more aware , educated, and independent human being. Being involved with a mission trip, prayer team ministry, BOS retreat team, and household life just goes to show how easy it is to get involved and meet amazing people as you seek and find great community."
College Senior,5,this is almost a non existent issue on campus
College Freshman,5,It is a amazing school. They help me grow in my school work and in my faith at the same tme.
College Senior,5,"If you want to go into parish or missionary work, you'll be presented with plenty of opportunities.  The alumni connections help with other work opportunities after graduation, but students mostly have to look into that on their own."
College Senior,5,"We have 24 hour security.  They are privately employed through Jefferson County, but they do a great job keeping rounds and maintaining a safe environment."
College Sophomore,5,It's a solid place for Academics
College Sophomore,5,It's a catholic school and that's that
College Sophomore,5,I don't really see drug use on campus
College Sophomore,5,I always feel safe on campus
College Sophomore,5,We don't exactly have greek life but we have what are called households and I think from a non member perspective they are very welcoming and invite people who are not involved to be a part of there activities. You can't let your heart get set on one household though it's important to look at multiple. But if you feel that one is right don't be afraid to wait to intent. It will be worth it
College Sophomore,5,I'd never change where I go. Even if I need to change my major I'll stay
College Freshman,5,"I have made so many great friends here, and the professors are amazing! It is also great to be in a loving, Catholic environment -- everyone is so joyful! It's very easy to be yourself and be happy."
College Freshman,5,I never worry about my safety on campus.
College Freshman,5,I love my classes and my professors.
College Freshman,5,"At Franciscan we don't technically have a Greek life, but we do have Households, which are similar to fraternities and sororities. I absolutely love my household and the opportunities that household life offers students here. It's a wonderful way for students to get involved and dive deeper into their relationship with God."
College Freshman,5,"It is so safe on campus, I have often left my laptop in the library to go to the bathroom and it is still there when I get back."
College Freshman,5,I like the class sizes at my school and I my professor is always available to speak with after class.
College Freshman,5,"I've been told that the school doesn't matter: experience does. And my school is very good at providing students with experience in their fields. For example, a Communications major such as myself can get experience working either of the school paper or for its radio station. 

Additionally, a number of our students have gone on to jobs immediately after graduation."
College Freshman,5,"We don't have ""Greek life"" but we have something similar called households. Everyone is encouraged to join one because it is not just a club, it is a mentoring group."
College Freshman,5,My school is very good at providing me with an environment where I can test the waters of my field and adulthood without having to jump in all at once. It lets me go my speed.
College Freshman,5,I love FUS! Profs are great!!!
Freshman,4,The It departement have done an exellent job of creating a very powerful online learning platform. you use state of the art technology and software to provide the best and most comprehensive online learning experience possible
Freshman,4,"I am continually humbled by this school. As a new student, I tried to be critical but the overwhelming kindness makes that impossible. Each person that walks through the campus understands that they are serving students; whether that be as a teacher, administrator, or fellow student. As a student with high financial need, I was humbled by their empathy and cooperation. When no other school would take a student with an uncertain situation,  FUS made an effort to make sure I could attend the fall of 2020. Many schools advertise a great education, but FUS delivers both education and life-long community."
Freshman,4,"I had just finished the beginning of spring break when the classes had been moved online. Due to the small size of the school, communication was easy but the infrastructure and logistics were a mess because the school was so unprepared. Professors who were older had given up and the IT teams could not manage their new huge workload. In the future though, I'm confident that this highly dedicated school can move their involved, attentive, community-based education online in a much more efficient and seamless way."
Freshman,4,"As much as I love Franciscan, it’s VERY boring. I’m a TheoCat but sometimes I wish I could have the college experience with real parties and Greek Life. It was hard to find fun people on campus because I’m not the “let’s watch a movie” as a party person. My first roommate snitched on me and I thankfully got a new one who is much more fun. I spent a lot of weekends at WVU just so I could have fun. The people here are nice though, I just haven’t found my group yet."
Freshman,4,"I've attended Franciscan University of Steubenville for one semester thusfar, and it has been a very positive experience. The community is amazing, so overwhelmingly positive and friendly, and authentically Catholic. 
I've had access to all the resources I need to succeed, and am looking forward to  the rest of my time there."
Niche User,4,"I may not have been to the school yet, but the administration team is spot on. They are always willing to answer any questions that I have and they follow up on my application process. The fact that they are so devoted to the Catholic faith while also fulfilling different majors gives me the satisfaction of an education that I desire."
Sophomore,4,Franciscan University is a great college to attend if you are looking for a very catholic school where you can surround yourself with people who will help you to be a good person.
Freshman,4,"I really love Franciscan.  It is a passionately Catholic University.  There are people that don't like the rules of the University, or the strict nature, but it does turn people away from a lot of these behaviors.  There are definitely a lot of people that still party.  The academics are great, as is the financial aid."
Senior,4,"The school is a great place to receive an well-rounded liberal arts education that is extremely faith/reason-based. The professors are very available for students and small class sizes help students from going under the radar and not actually learning. Personally I didn’t find the academics to be very rigorous, though I have learned very,  very much and my love for school and academia would not have been possible without Franciscan. I also had the opportunity to do NCAA sports at the university. Many people support the student-athletes though there really isn’t any support at all from students outside of those who are already involved in a sport. It has its flaws like any school, but it’s professors are unmatched."
Junior,4,"The academics at FUS are of top caliber and class. The diversity on campus, on the other hand, is lackluster but not inexistent. There is a very strong acceptance of all ethnicities on campus granted they follow Catholic social teaching. The campus itself is a gem. The cleanliness is remarkable and with trees and green space being everywhere is a very beautiful campus. the athletics are competitive but not exceptional. The professors are top quality and come from all walks of life. Where diversity may lack in student population the administration and Professors do not. The local area of Steubenville is without question, abysmal and unsafe. However, the school is located atop a high hill with ample security and privacy. The dorms are rather nice for a university and the food is of high quality."
Junior,4,It would be helpful if professors were easier to contact and ask questions. It would also be nice if there were more opportunities on campus for traditional Catholics.
Senior,4,"As someone who transferred in, it had an adjustment period (like transferring anywhere does), but it is a good community. There are many different options of ministries and different communities, but you need to be willing to put yourself out there and be part of the community. There isn't much to do in Stubenville."
Sophomore,4,"I think that Franciscan is an amazing school with an excellent mission.  I really appreciate the authentic Catholicism of the school and the faculty is very good. However, I do not like the raising tuition rates, as I feel that the school sometimes spends a lot of money on things that are not important."
Sophomore,4,"I like the community at Franciscan University. Almost everyone you meet is friendly, welcoming, and willing to help. I also really enjoy the classes and think, so far, they are wonderful for the most part. The professors are amazing. I enjoy the campus layout, the dorms, and the location of Franciscan University as well. The one thing I dislike is the strong tendency for cliques to form; this is something I did not like to see at my college."
Freshman,4,"I have really enjoyed my time at Franciscan so far. I am in pre nursing and although it is challenging, the professors are terrific. The small class sizes make knowing the professor a lot easier. In particular, my Freshman 103 English class was great, because due to the small class size I was able to form a friendship with my professor that would not have been possible in a larger university. Their science programs are hard core and thoroughly prepare you for any type of science/medical fields you are hoping to pursue."
Sophomore,4,"I live in the area and went to Akron University for my first year of college. However, I decided to transfer to Franciscan knowing that their academics would be impeccable. The atmosphere is inviting and everyone is very welcoming."
Junior,4,Franciscan University is a truly unique experience.  There is not another college that fully immerses their students in the Catholic faith and ties it to their course of study.  You wont get an education like this anywhere ellse.
Alum,4,"Franciscan University is a place rich in Christ. There are very few places like Franciscan and it was truly a blessing to go to college where my faith was put first. The University encourages students to strive to be their best, but through our faith in Christ and the sacraments. In addition to the beautiful presence of Catholicism on campus, the Education Department staff symbolized a small family unit to me. The professors genuinely cared and make strong efforts to get to know each of their students. I highly recommend Franciscan University to those who wish to dive deeper with Christ all while growing and becoming prepared academically."
Freshman,4,"The student life here is very excellent, with Households (Christian ""fraternities"" and ""sororities"") at the centre. Franciscan has exceptional academics with professors who are dedicated to their students. I am also a participant in the Great Books Honors program here which I think is an excellent example of what our liberal arts are like. We are very strong in Theology, which I think is wonderful, although sometimes I think the administration needs to remember to not sacrifice other programs just because Theology is what we are well known for. Overall, I think FUS does a superb job forming lay disciples to go forth and sanctify the temporal order."
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the atmosphere at Franciscan! Everyone is so friendly and it's completely faith-filled. Academics are great, they just need to get everyone on the same core and it'll be perfect!"
Sophomore,4,I love Franciscan University of Steubenville.  The academics are quite difficult but it definitely pays off.  The faith life is quite alive at Franciscan and sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming but it is very supportive.
Freshman,4,"This school has an amazing environment where the majority of students are very friendly and encouraging. The academics are challenging enough where you don't feel like you're drowning in work, but you are still learning the material and discussing it effectively. "
College Sophomore,4,"Lots of wonderful and caring teachers, as well as challenging and valuable academics."
College Sophomore,4,Very few students do drugs.
College Sophomore,4,The dorms are a great way to obtain the full college experience. Franciscan dorms build a very strong senses of community and social atmosphere ranging from consistent games of table tennis to study groups. Dorm life is a great way to meet a range of different aged and involved people you might not have normally met.
College Sophomore,4,"We do not have Greek life, but we have households which is the Catholic form of Greek life more or less. Households is tremendous to find a strong community of guys or girls to grow in faith and as a person for your time here. Household focuses on growing in brotherhood or sisterhood through bonding and diving deeper into more virtuous lives."
College Senior,4,"Faith life here is wonderful. I would recommend this school to anyone and everyone, however Franciscan can be an adjustment.  Many students tend to overspiritualize and see things in black and white."
College Sophomore,4,"Campus living isn't too bad. Most places are good for building community, especially with the help of households being on specific wings of dorms. The process to get yourself a room is usually a disaster though."
College Sophomore,4,"We don't technically have ""Greek life"" but campus households put a Catholic twist on the Greek life. It's very popular and a good way to build faith and community in positive ways."
College Sophomore,4,Crime isn't much of a problem here.
College Sophomore,4,Drugs and alcohol aren't much of a problem here.
College Senior,4,"Overall, the school offers various opportunities to grow as a student and develop opportunities for a career after graduation."
College Senior,4,"I have lived in a dorm all 4 years at FUS because the campus life is very exciting.  Household life is based out of the dorms, which helps a lot."
College Senior,4,"Obviously, there are some things about the school which aren't perfect. But overall, it's a fantastic experience."
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy it quite a bit
College Sophomore,4,Very welcoming.  Wonderful community.  Supportive.  Authentic.
College Sophomore,4,"I really love the academics at my school. With the exception of just a few classes, I have enjoyed all my courses thoroughly. I enjoy a challenge, and the classes are challenging but not impossible. The professors are all very nice and they are very helpful. Whether it's responding to an email or meeting you in their office, they do whatever they can to help you succeed in their class, short of giving you the answers. I love studying in the library (as long as it's not finals week, when everyone else remembers that you have a library), or in the common rooms in the dorms. The JC is also a popular study spot, but the noise is pretty distracting for me."
College Sophomore,4,"Although I know that students do drugs at my school, it's not something that people advertise and for the most part, it's not something that controls the student body. Alcohol is a little more visible, and there are even several school-sponsored events with alcohol available, as long as you are over 21. I have never been pressured to drink or do drugs, and it's not something that my friends do, so we always manage to find other ways to have fun."
College Sophomore,4,It's an amazing school and most of the professors are intresting. There are a few I have run into that are dull but I like them for the most part. The class sizes are good and if the room is too small for a class the professor will find a new room
College Sophomore,4,I'm a student athlete and even though my team isn't the best it's a true family. The gym was just redone and is a wonderful place to work out
College Sophomore,4,"There is a great community life on campus, but some dorms still lack AC which is a big hassle."
College Sophomore,4,Most households are strong with the exception of a handful who seem to just party.
College Freshman,4,"The surrounding town (and even sometimes lower campus) is kind of sketchy, and there have been incidences in the past. But if you're on the hill then you're very safe."
College Freshman,4,"Some classes are kind of boring, but some are really great (like Dr. Gage's philosophy classes)! Overall, the quality of the classes here are pretty high."
College Freshman,4,"I lived in Tommy this past year, and even though I didn't get drawers with my desk (unlike everyone else), I still loved my room, and I met one of my best friends on my wing. The atmosphere is great, even if you don't personally know anyone, but it's very easy to make friends, especially at the beginning of the year."
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus with my household sisters. However, the dorm buildings are out-dated and need to be fixed up."
College Freshman,4,"I'm only a freshman, so I haven't started my job search. But based on statistics, I'm pretty likely to get a good job soon after graduation."
College Freshman,4,The dorms are very good at being a place where you can go to relax and focus on homework.
College Freshman,4,"I am not an athlete, but I enjoy going to the gym. It is clean, and it is easy to get access to the equipment."
College Freshman,4,Wellness center has good hours
College Freshman,4,The gym is very nice and has a variety of classes!
College Freshman,4,"It's D3 which is good in how they have a focus on the sports being played, but more on growing in your faith through your sport."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy the school, it is small but in a perfectly good way. You can really connect with many other students and workers on campus, feels so much like home."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics department at this school is great because of how much it contributes to a growth in virtue for the athletes and the other students.  Although sports are important here, they aren't the most significant part of campus life,  Franciscan doesn't make a huge deal out of it other than that the sports are good for the students to participate in.  The school really focuses on student growth through fellowsh and that is beautiful in the sense that we learn to play together as a team for something greater. There are competitions, but the school makes sure to remember that we are student who are just learning to live together first.  The sports here are great because they teach us that before we can go out into the world as leaders, we must first have faith in each other."
College Freshman,4,"The courses are challenging and the professors don't baby you,however, they don't leave to fend for yourself, as they are always willing to work with you."
College Freshman,4,"The people are great, but there are a lot of rules."
College Freshman,4,"Franciscan practices what it preaches. It is difficult, but not insanely challenging. It is passionately Catholic that is truly part of everything from the professors to the students. The students are friendly. The subjects they claim to be excellent at, they truly are. However, where they aren't, it isn't quite the same level of skill."
College Senior,4,A LOT OF UPPERCLASSMEN CHOSE TO LIVE ONCAMPUS TO GIVE BACK TO CAMPUS COMMUNITY
College Senior,4,"I PLAY TWO NCAA SPORTS. AFTER ALL THE TRAVELING I HAVE DONE, WE HAVE THE BIGGEST AND MOST ENTHUSIASTIC FAN BASE IN OUR CONFERENCE."
College Freshman,4,Households are a great thing to get involved in- the brotherhood/sisterhood they offer is more authentic than what you would find in most Greek Life!
Alum,2,I did not take my classes online.  They were done in person at the university.  This does not pertain to my experience at the university.
College Sophomore,2,There really isn't much diversity. Everyone is pretty much white and Catholic. But if you aren't white you're accepted just fine. If you aren't Catholic I'm sure you would feel very out of place.
College Sophomore,2,"It seems like students and professors don't really pay much attention to the Athletics here. And as an athlete I only receive minor recognition, although I do feel like the athletic department does a decent job. The student body just doesn't put much interest into university sports."
College Sophomore,2,"I feel like a lot of people who major in catechetics or theology don't always end up with the job they expect, but I respect them for pursuing what they desire. However the job outlook seems really hopeful for most others!"
College Sophomore,2,We dont have greek life
College Freshman,2,"We don't have a great deal of diversity here, but that's mostly because of religious backgrounds. Not many black people are catholic thus, we have very few here."
College Junior,2,"Some professors are wonderful and some, horrible. There is absolutely no diversity in the types of people at this college. The students are rude, judgmental, and freakishly catholic. Exploration of topics and discussion is extremely limited because everyone has the same strict view, which I found has limited my learning and research."
College Sophomore,2,This isn't a party school. No one really parties.
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of options.
College Junior,2,Franks in the country has the best breakfast and best prices- is a great bar joint in the evening
College Junior,2,There are many overly-strict rules about men/women relationships and hanging out in the dorms. Dating is frowned upon.
College Junior,2,There aren't very many options for financial aid since its a private school. Any scholarships or grants basically have to be found by you.
College Sophomore,2,Parties on campus usually are not the best.  I have not been to an off-campus party yet.
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car you probably won't dine off campus much. There's good Chinese place nearby, a Bob Evans, some fast food, and Damon's Grill, which is right off campus and has a bar and good grill type food (like Red Robin). But other than that Steubenville doesn't have much to offer. People come here for the Catholic culture, not the location."
College Sophomore,2,The parties are just lame.
College Freshman,2,Parties are hard to come by atleast. And not to mention at this campus if you even drink underage you can be considered the spawn of satan.
College Freshman,2,We don't have even one place I could consider above average quality. I'm not saying we need gourmet food but we lack anything 3 star. It's like all 2 star if I had to put a rating on it.
College Sophomore,2,The restaurants aren't too expensive but there are only a few and the food isn't super great. Most of them are within walking distance and a lot of people order pizza from further away.
College Sophomore,2,"Downtown Steubenville is very dirty, small, and unsafe. There is a beautiful church and several picturesque bridges that adventurous students with cars go to, as well as a good grocery store, TJ Maxx, Walgreens, and some okay restaurants, but other than that there aren't any things to do less than 25 minutes away. The town itself is very creepy and run-down and there is a lot of criminal activity. Campus is very safe, but if you leave ""the hill"" there's a good chance of getting mugged or worse. Also it smells bad- there is pollution from the river."
College Junior,2,There are not many safe off-campus options.
College Junior,2,"There are not many off-campus dining options near Steubenville, and they're not easily accessible by walking."
College Senior,2,The steak is like rubber.
College Freshman,2,"In my opinion, Franciscan itself does not give out nearly as many scholarships as they should."
College Freshman,2,THERE IS NOTHING TO DO AT FRANCISCAN!
College Freshman,2,There are very few options for off-campus dining.
College Sophomore,2,The strictness of the campus is very strict. But people who come here know that before they choose to go here.
College Sophomore,2,"There's one lab that is up-to-date, and it's the Mac lab, but that lab doesn't have a colored printer."
College Sophomore,2,"The campus dining is run by Sodexo, and for the money that we pay, it is alright, but overall, it is pretty bad. 

The food doesn't taste good, the options are okay, and there is really not that much variety."
College Freshman,2,"-Franciscan is a catholic college, so nearly everyone attending the school is a catholic Caucasian.  I am actually protestant, and I have found that people at the school are fairly accepting of others' differences.  It is hard not to feel like a complete misfit sometimes though."
College Freshman,2,There really isn’t that much to do off campus. Steubenville is pretty sketchy. 
College Freshman,2,It's more of a steel town. I haven't been off campus that much so I can't say for certain but it doesn't seem like there is a lot of things to do. There are some theaters and little restaurants nearby. Pittsburgh is about an hour away so some people make the drive there.
College Sophomore,2,"If there are drugs they are hard to come by.  In my two years here I have yet to see anyone using or on drugs.  Drinking, yes, smoking cigars, cigarettes, pipes, etc. very common but not drugs. I'm sure it is around but I haven't seen it or been exposed too it, at least not on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Not too bad, but there is a lot of rain and snow and mugginess. Also, the smell..."
College Sophomore,2,Most people skip Steubenville and just drive into Pittsburgh.
College Junior,2,"The parking isn't really a problem because everything is in walking distance. Watch out for the jeffies or local security, they aren't very nice..."
College Junior,2,There isn't really an off campus option. In reality the off campus is pricy and can be as expensive as living in the apartments on campus. Plus the apartments on campus are definitely way safer.
College Junior,2,"Wifi is limited to only a select few dorms and is extremely slow due to high server requests and low server capabilities. During Midterms and Finals, the school internet is so slow it is not even worth using it. Unfortunately, the computer labs are no saving grace. They are extremely crowded during study hours and lack proper speed and software, such as Adobe flash player and sound capabilities, to perform necessary functions. Printing is ok, if you don't mind waiting in line for the only student printer on campus. PC are a necessity,as the lab is only one till 11 every night. However, when combined with the campus internet, it is virtually useless."
College Freshman,2,The dorms are nice but very small space and there is no AC in some of the dorms.
College Freshman,2,There really isn't much to do off-campus. You would have to go to Robinson or Pittsburgh to find anything that isn't fast food.
College Freshman,2,Most computers on campus are slow and outdated but there is a Mac lab in Egan that has updated equipment.
College Freshman,2,"Not the best food around unless you like fast food or settling for ""food""..."
College Freshman,2,"I actually enjoy the gloomy weather but when the sun shines through, its great."
College Junior,2,This is not a lenient place to go to school. FUS has high moral standards and expects all student to abide by those standards on campus as well as off campus. Dorm rules are extensive.
College Junior,2,"I don't think this university is the most diverse college you could choose. Most every one is Catholic; most everyone is white. There is a hispanic presence on campus and I have seen a few African American students, I am one of them. I am not sure of the ethnic or racial demographics of the professors, but I do know they higher great educators with a great wisdom in their field of study."
College Freshman,2,"There isn't really much to do in the city. It's nice to get out and go to the local Walmart, but other than that there is not much. The mall is pretty small and I have not been to the movie theater yet, but I do not think it is that great."
College Freshman,2,"There are not really a lot of good places to eat off campus. There are a few fast food places and an Applebees, which is pretty much all Steubenville has to offer. One place I liked was an Italian restaurant in downtown Steubenville, it had pretty good food for low prices."
College Junior,2,"The availability and the cost of off campus housing is great. There is a ton of selection. The downfall, though, is that Steubenville is not the greatest place to live. There are many areas of town that students should try to avoid. A lot of the houses are run down. There are some nice areas of town, but they are further from campus and cost much more. The closest houses to campus are not the nicest."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Franciscan University's nightlife leaves much to be desired.  A good amount of students head to bed by around 11, and you'll see the JC student center vacant until it closes at 1.  This shows another problem, the lack of places to hang out at 1 cripples this place's night life.  You can hang outside when its not freezing cold, but often you'll be told from security that you are camping, and they'll make you leave.  Many students focus on their academics, which is good, but it isn't everything.  The city's high crime rate makes you shudder at the thought of walking somewhere late at night, though the reckless still sometimes use the main road to walk to Kroger.  That being said, there are places to hang out at for those who wish to do something.  The local bars have ""college nights"" because they know the money it can bring in.  Froelich's is a popular place on thursdays.  Wednesdays you will see wing night at Zalenskis, and Frank's bar is getting to be a popular hang out spot.  However, many will often make the 40 or so minute drive to Pittsburgh to the South side wehre they enjoy the night life offered there especially at Hofbrauhaus, a local German brewery."
College Senior,2,"The nice restaurants are in Pittsburgh, which is 30 minutes away, but that's quite the commute. Most people eat fast food because it is close. There are a few good restaurants within ten minutes of the university. There is Puerto Vallarta (mexican food), Sesame Grill (chinese), and Scaffidi's which is this great italian place run by a family who makes their pasta from scratch. The food is cheap and the portions are large so you can take home leftovers and get two meals out of one on a college budget."
College Senior,2,"There are people of different races here, but they comprise a small percentage of the student population. However, we have a high percentage of international students and professors which allows us to be cultured. The majority of the students are white, but it is a small school."
College Freshman,2,There are not that many places to go that are close to campus.
College Junior,2,"Recently, Franciscan University became an NCAA Division III school, and each of the sports programs are given great support by the staff, though the school is very much lacking in school spirit.  The school is consistently giving money to the program, and it is to the detriment of its pastoral Catholic identity."
College Senior,2,Humidity or Snow – During the beginning of the Fall semester the weather is very hot and humid. It makes it hard to walk from your dorm to the classrooms. Especially if you live on lower campus at the bottom of the hill. During winter time it is very cold and snows a lot. Over all throughout the year the weather is very bipolar. You never know how long the sun will be out or when it's going to rain.
College Senior,2,"The Nightlife is mainly centered around student thrown college parties. There are a handful of local bars. However there is not much in the way of nightlife at Franciscan; and considering that the school does not promote the partying, bar-hopping, or clubbing scene, this is not the University to come to for such things"
College Sophomore,2,"Stingy With Scholarship Money – Even having earned one of the top scholarships offered by the university, I still  have to take out a considerable amount of student loans. Most students leave Franciscan with notable debt. While Franciscan is a private institution, it sure doesn't have a lot of money running in and out of it - especially in the financial aid department."
College Junior,2,"Their is only one sorority on campus, but they are overshadowed by the Households."
College Senior,2,"Academics are great, faith focused with a great professonism."
College Freshman,2,"Could Be Worse – The limited food options on campus are rather unappealing to say the least. While the cafeteria occasionally hits a home run with pizza or special events menus, its usual fare consists of food that you can tell has been preserved, packaged, frozen, heated, refrozen and reheated. Vegan, Vegetarian and healthy options are hard to come by if you go through the standard buffet line. Your best bet is the salad/hummus bar or the grill- but you have to ask for veggie burgers or other healthy options. The flatbread shop at the bottom of the hill does all right, but your calorie count will suffer if you're not careful. The Coffee shop in the student center is also marginally okay. Your best bet is to eat off campus and buy groceries and cook if possible. Unfortunately, meal plans are mandatory for most of the students so be prepared to make the best of it."
College Junior,2,"What Do You Expect? I go to a private Catholic university, so I do not expect a lot of the students to be of different ethnicities.  Although it is nice to have a diverse student body, I do not think it is necessary.  I do like meeting people of different backgrounds though and learn about different peoples/cultures in my general education classes."
College Freshman,2,"I left this place, but didn't completely regret it. Most students have this annoying superficial happiness. They like to show that they're super happy individuals, but really on the inside, they are extremely boring and stale. The student population is dull and very un-creative. The majority of kids are complete air-heads too. People are constantly engaging in conversations in horribly inconvenient places. Kids will be entirely oblivious to the fact that they're standing right in the middle of the doorway in Egan hall and other people are trying to get to class. That said, the kids don't contribute to much theft or crime, and that's cool. But, the student population is a majority of super awkward home school kids that I, as a public schoolers, can not connect to in the slightest. They have a remarkably low social IQ. "
Alum,1,"I seen where it was suppose to be a good place for veterans to get a degree.   I attended this school sometime ago and had several issues.  I  got so disgusted i wasn't going back for my final 3 classes, I'm a disabled veteran, but was told by the VA I needed to to insure others would get a chance to go to school thru this VA Program.  I  was a non-Catholic-Christian and this cost me problems with some, not all staff.  I didn't even return for my diploma but had it mailed to me.  sorry."
Junior,1,"This school reminds me of John Winthrop's speech, ""City on a Hill."" It is definitely Catholic, understated probably, but they look down on the problems of Steubenville which is ridden with crime and drug addiction. Everyone is all merry until they get a reality check driving less than a mile out of campus. Really does look like a third world compared to other parts of the U.S. Hopefully the steel mill and trade jobs come back along this area which would absolutely make the area safe and more appealing. The school is so strict, that they write you an infraction for swearing or other things that cradle Catholics abhor. It is very Conservative as well, not that that is bad, but if you even are a moderate Democrat, Republican, or Independent, you seem that you are on the side of things. There is an aura about the area that doesn't feel safe just like the $1 crack homes in Detroit which comes with more than comfortable gang violence. If you want to grow with Christ, this is the place."

Junior,1,"If you are from Steubenville and attend Franciscan, you will be shunned. Everyone is mentally ill from being so absorbed in religion."
College Senior,1,"The last remaining sorority on campus Theta Phi Alpha was shut down in 2015 and the last fraternity  Alpha Phi Delta is not affiliated with campus.  The administration is very discriminatory and bias against Greek life due to an anomaly they call ""House Holds"".  House Holds  are basically wannabe  Fraternities and Sororities, with a catholic twist, although many are beautiful examples of sisterhood and brotherhood they tend to be unaccepting or judgmental towards Greek life."
College Junior,1,Student to faculty ratio is excellent. Some professors are great with it and some don't take advantage of the opportunity to help individuals.
College Junior,1,Extremely strict rules! opposite sex is only allowed in the dorm for three select hours a week with the door open. Talking above a whisper during certain hours (even in the lobby) can get you fined. Any PDA gets you death stares.
College Junior,1,"Known as ""households"" on campus where groups worship together."
College Sophomore,1,Awful. The administration punishes anyone involved with any sort of an actually good party
College Sophomore,1,Being a catholic school they enforce their rules (particularly involving the opposite sex) very strictly.
College Junior,1,"Its hard to find a safe place to live with students. Don't live in the neighborhood at the base of the hill. Especially not on Oregon, Wilkins, Ridge, etc. Live in the neighborhood on the other side of Brady"
College Sophomore,1,we don't have greek life
College Sophomore,1,it ruins my intestines and it makes me sick to my stomach.
College Freshman,1,"If you don't have a car, or don't have a friend with a car, you're pretty much stuck on campus."
College Freshman,1,"IT RAINS ALL THE TIME IN STEUBENVILLE! But, when the weather is nice, it brings everyone outside!"
College Freshman,1,"It's cheap, sure, but you're likely to get shot or mugged in Steubenville's crack town. It's quite awful and you can't even move off campus until you are a senior. You can't have a car until you are a sophomore, so it's really quite impossible to move around and you can often feel like you're trapped in a  tiny bubble. It can be QUITE suffocating, especially if you're dealt a crazy roommate."
College Freshman,1,"If you care AT ALL about your independence, this is not the place for you. It's so strict, it's crippling. They do it to protect the souls of sinful students, but I believe that we are all adults with choices. If they believe so strongly that God gave us a free will, why won't they let us use it?"
College Sophomore,1,There's I think one sorority and that's it. So maybe I should change that D to an A.
College Junior,1,"The surrounding area is terribly dangerous. The Chicago, New York, and Pennsylvania gangs gather in the surrounding area to make deals."
College Junior,1,"The dining isn't the best and the food seems to be on a two week rotation.  The quality itself isn't anything worth raving either, but that isn't the reason you are going there."
College Sophomore,1,"I very proudly give Franciscan an F in the Nightlife department. Of course, if you really want it, you can find it, but here you really have to try. Heh, heh, heh."
College Junior,1,"There is a sorority, however it has deteriorated like the fraternity before it. There are virtually no functions held by them."
College Sophomore,1,I have yet to see anyone do drugs on campus but I know there are people who do do them
College Freshman,1,Franciscan University might be one of the strictest universities in the country.
College Freshman,1,Close to Pittsburgh but no nightlife in Steubenville worth your time.
College Freshman,1,Franciscan's transportation system is nearly nonexistent; sometimes the university will have shuttles to the airports (near break times).
College Freshman,1,"Its not that the school doesn't want you to live off campus because they want your money, its because it isn't safe. Walking to school is like asking to be raped"
College Junior,1,Franciscan needs to let people move off campus sooner. This causes them having major trouble finding enough space on campus.
College Junior,1,The person of the opposite sex can't be in the dorm after a certain time. This doesn't help if people need to do a group project. It's a little ridiculous.
Recent Alumnus,1,"This campus is very strict about matters you may not even see as ""Catholic"" issues.  You will find rules (that are not just rumors) taht you cannot talk through windows, you cannot be int he same car as the opposite sex after hours, and you cannot even be in a girl's room with the door open except for a small window on friday night and sunday afternoon.  In my mind, I can understand that they are trying to prevent people from having sex before marriage (which is against Catholicism) I do not understand the means they do this.  They do not take our computers away even though it is possible one look at pornography on it.  There is very little dialogue between the student body and the administration.  It is very easy to get fines here between parking violations, quiet hour violations, and God help you if they find you in a girl's room if you're a boy or intoxicated under age.  It can be quite stifling at times, but it is not all bad.  the administration does put on fun events (irish fest, italian fest, resurrection party).  I understand what they are trying to do, but we disagree vehemently with each other about how to attain that.  Also it is overshadowed byt he awesomeness of the people here, the richness of the academics, and growing closer to Christ."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Okay, I've seen reviews saying that all that is here is white rich Catholic kids.  Although I find it a little hard to believe the University's stat that 25 percent of students are not caucasion, it is predominately the race here.  I think you know what you get when you sign up here.  However, that does not mean as these reviews say that that means that everyone you see here is going to rag on you if you're not white, catholic, etc.  Catholics do not rag on Protestants here, and many coming from their home know what its like to live in a pluralistic society .  We've had protestants go here before, and they were beloved.  However, I do see what some reviewers say when they say its kind of hard for Franciscan students to accept someone who does not see eye-to-eye with them on issues.  This is mostly a result of immaturity, and if you do not agree on the Catholic principle of waiting for sex until you're married, it will be hard for you to operate on campus.  However, it may cause you to relook your views and understand the basis of the teaching, so there still may be benefits if you go here"
Recent Alumnus,1,"The school is situated on top of a hill in the middle of a dying steel-town city named Steubenville.  The hill and the school are almost completely safe.  I only heard of a couple incidents on campus.  You probably will not even be stolen from by many students (though on rare circumstances it does happen.)  People freely leave their laptops sitting in the library without supervision.  The city itself, however, is ridden in crime.  There are a number of gangs that go through Steubenville, though often they leave Franciscan Students alone.  The cops do a good job protecting us.  I live off campus, and I've had no real big incidents, but there have been a couple shaky situations that I've gotten into.  Its almost worth the ridiculously cheap prices to live off campus however.  One can live for under 300 dollars a month (including utilities!) Just remember to always keep your valuables close at hand and your street smarts on high.  Many students go off-campus to have fun at local bars, which is something that you don't want to miss out on."
College Junior,1,"The school has little to no tolerance of underage drinking, fighting, drug use, and general rule breaking.  Simply being different may be enough to attract the attention of the RAs and the staff.  The dorm rules are ridiculously intricate and unnecessary, never mind being nearly impossible to understand.  Everything you do, do with caution: many rules are invoked simply to smite disagreeable persons."
College Junior,1,"Though the school is known for its Catholic identity, it is also seemingly not supportive of persons of any background aside from the typical Republican, White Catholic.  Protestants and homosexuals are few in number, as are people of various races."
College Senior,1,"There are extremely limited options for food on campus. All of which are run by Sodehxo, the same company that runs the cafe, runs pretty much everything else."
College Sophomore,1,"Here at Franciscan, there is not much Greek life. We are a Catholic Community and so thats how we are labeled. I wouldn't be able to tell you who is Greek and who is not."
College Freshman,1,"Almost Non-Existent – We technically only have two Greeks at my school. The rest pseudo-greeks are called faith households. These are designed to help you grow in your faith surrounded by people with fellow interests as yourself. People join the household they feel called to and therefore do not ""rush."" There is one Fraternity and one Sorority on campus but are very small and are hardly seen."
College Freshman,1,"I left this place, but didn't completely regret spending a semester (for the classes only) – I loved my classes, the teachers were awesome.

That said, the school is terrible in every other way.

The school's ""facilities"" are run by idiots and they have nothing to offer. For example, the ""fitness center"" is composed of some treadmills and one properly functioning stationary bike.

The library printer constantly is out of paper or ink for days on end, and nobody is in a slight hurry to fix it.

The school provides no extracurricular activities besides trite dances and undistinguished speakers.

Basically, this school is good in the Liberal Arts, but where kids' 30K tuition goes, is a wonder to me. Surely not in its ""facilities""

I will miss absolutely nothing about this school and I was very delighted to leave and never return."
College Freshman,1,"Library Facilities – The library computers do work, but they're pretty slow. It is frustrating because the idiots who run it can't do anything correctly. The printer frequently is ""out of commission"" not only is this terribly inconvenient, it could all be fixed if they changed the printer's ink cartridge, or filled it with paper. The library opens at 8:30 (who decides on that random time?) which is a stupid time to open because classes start at 8:00. Shouldn't it open earlier? So you can print papers and do what you need to do before 8:00 classes? 

The libraries are just an example of how the people who run this school are complete idiots. I can't believe I paid a semester's tuition for this. I often wondered where kid's 30K tuition went. Surely not to the facilities in this school."
College Freshman,1,"Limited at Best – The ""Fitness Center"" is horrible. There is nothing to offer. There is only one stationary bike that functions properly. You can either run outside, run if a treadmill is open, or possibly use the stationary bike in the rare moment that it is open. There is a diving and swim team at the school, but we don't have a pool. Our ""Fitness Center"" is pathetic and useless. It offers nothing."

Senior,5,Every semester I have taken an online course and it was has been easy to navigate and very educational. The professors are easy to get ahold of and very thorough in their teachings.
Senior,5,"My first three years at Saint Leo University have been one of the best ones. For years I kept going back and forth trying to find a school that would make me happy, and I am glad I picked Saint Leo. Saint Leo makes it feel like a home as well as an institution, it is a community. The students are friendly and accepting as well as the faculty."
Alum,5,Small Classroom sizes made it feel like you could really connect with the professor and the material making it easier to learn. Sports on campus are what make the school.
Junior,5,"I take all courses online because I am a single mother. Otherwise I would be attending school on campus. I like the online experience because it is simple to navigate. The work is not easy to complete, it is a good education but navigating the site is very user friendly. I appreciate this so much because school plus life is hard enough. I do not need to be stressed out about not being able to access my class properly."
Niche User,5,Saint Leo University is a very welcoming environment. Everyone is helpful and kind to one another. I feel safe and welcomed while I am staying on campus.
Niche User,5,While being online the professors are very helpful and understanding. You are not left behind while learning online.
Senior,5,Saint Leo University has one of the best education programs I have seen. It challenges you to be the best you can and help you become better along the way. Some teachers become like family and make you feel valuable.
Freshman,5,"The school has been giving me great guidance. When I don't know how to view certain things through the student portal, my student advisor is always there to help me find what I am looking for. I am taking classes online, the courses I am taking is going very well right now. I can honestly say I am learning a lot of new things that before I had no clue about. I am enjoying the school and I am not regretting my decision to choose this school to earn my Bachelors Degree in Business!"
Freshman,5,"My online experience with Saint Leo is going extremely great right now. My courses are very interesting and I learn a lot from the courses. With the courses I have activities that makes learning online more interesting. Right now I have to have 120 credits. This is my first year in college, I will be taking all of my classes online to get my Bachelors Degree in Business. The professors that I have right now are great, they interact with the students in the class with class activities and discussions. They respond to as many students as possible when we have our class discussions. Everything with Saint Leo is just going great."
Alum,5,"Overall I had an excellent experience attending Saint Leo University. I especially like the diverse class schedules and helpful faculty. I often struggled through my business classes, but my professors were often willing to dedicate more time before and after class to me."
Alum,5,I can be a very needy student and the professors were always there to help. They respond to emails/messages frequently. They also keep consistent office hours and available via telephone when needed for clarifications.
Sophomore,5,"Friendly and helpful staff, beautiful campus. Lots of opportunities and extra curricular activities."
Sophomore,5,Because of covid I ended up taking online classes. Very impressed with the transition that had to take place in a short amount of time.
Sophomore,5,Online classes are on par and resources are vast. The professors are engaging and offer feedback when you need it. The 8 week term may sound intimidating but you have the chance to be completely submerged in the subject!
Sophomore,5,"Absolutely best experience! Online classes are on par and resources are vast. The best part is I feel my classmates are diverse and open to discussing anything in a respectful, informative manner during each class. The professors are engaging and offer feedback when you need it. The 8 week term may sound intimidating but you have the chance to be completely submerged in the subject! There's also excellent career services for all.

It's vital to your mental health to continue learning through out life. Saint Leo encourages people of all ages to apply. I find that I learn a lot from my older classmates and find it endearing classmates encourage the atypical student. It's never too late to get your degree or to return for another degree. You will find the resources to become a student again. 

Truthfully, I wish I had signed up sooner and realized that a leading four year institution has a lot to offer the atypical student. I wish everyone would realize their life goals are within reach!"
Junior,5,"I really enjoy being a student at Saint Leo University. The professors are great, they are extremely friendly and care about their students. I like the small class sizes since it provides a more individualized learning experience. The campus is also very beautiful and makes a good ""home away from home."""
Junior,5,Our classes went online due to COVID-19 and I had a good experience with online learning. The professors were very understanding and easy to reach. They were able to communicate well with the students and make sure we understood all the material and what was expected of us. They were very flexible and provided office hours that students could attend if they wanted additional instruction or guidance.
Freshman,5,I’m a freshman in Saint Leo university and so far I’m loving it.People here are so polite and nice every department around campus are always here to help you with everything you need you have all services available to you it is amazing
Senior,5,Saint Leo has an amazing community.  Their athletics are additionally a huge part of campus.  We have some extremely impressive athletes and the support at home games is great.
Senior,5,Zoom was utilized very efficiently in our transition to online learning.  A lot of professors hosted live sessions to keep a consistent schedule.
Freshman,5,"I loved everything about it and how things went there and i loved the way that life was, i met a lot of people that are going there with me"
Freshman,5,"I loved every experience, the experiences that i hear about education cleaniness and even the parties are great"

Freshman,5,"This school is amazing and they are very welcoming. From the moment I walked on campus, I knew this is where I was supposed to be. The faculty and staff answered all my questions with no problems and made the transition from high school to college very easy."
Junior,5,My experience was amazing. They walk with you through this college experience   with you whether it is your first time or not and make sure you are okay and doing well in your courses. They're goal is to make sure that you succeed in everything you do. And that's what I like about them. The only change that is needed is offering their non-citizen students some other form of payment offers to pay for school.
Alum,5,"Saint Leo was a great transition school for me after completing my Bachelors at Norfolk State University. My mom, dad, aunts, and uncles went through Saint Leo since we are a big military family. There was always tutoring available. My professors and I was on a first name basis and I was able to contact them daily if need be. I ended up earning my MBA within a one year time with straight A's. It was fast paced but my teachers made sure I had everything I needed to pass. Saint Leo can benefit you if you put in your own effort it is a since of accountability with St. Leo students and it prepares you for the future. I went to one of their external campuses since I'm in Virginia but I've only heard great things about the main campus too."
Freshman,5,It is a nice small private institution the school is just like the pictures beautiful. the professors are really nice and helpful they push the students to strive.
Senior,5,Saint Leo University staff is amazing at the Ocala Center. What I liked the most was the smaller classes and the instructors that took the time out to teach and answer questions. It really took higher learning to another level for this Mom that went back to school
Freshman,5,"I like this school one because of individual reasons and i also that this school has opportunities, activities, and lots of other things that a larger campus could not incorporate."
Freshman,5,I find Saint Leo to be a beautiful school with flowers and plants all around. The grounds are clean and there are different activities on campus to keep the students happy and entertained while there. They not only want to help students follow their career goal but to also become a better version of themselves.
Sophomore,5,"I'm a sophomore at this University majoring in Criminal Justice and Homeland security and I love everything about this University, the campus is great, and the professors are   awesome!"
Sophomore,5,"The experience at Saint Leo is something that is indescribable. The professors, the staff, the students, and the all-around atmosphere is incredible. It is a close-knit community that thrives on family values, finding your purpose, and evolving into the best version of yourself. In the past 2 years i've been at Saint Leo, I have been my happiest and am proud to say that I made the right choice with choosing Saint Leo University as my home away from home until 2022!"
Junior,5,Saint Leo University is an AMAZING school. The classes are small so the students have a chance to talk with the professor and get the help they need with school work. Saint Leo also has a lot of extra activities that are completely free! You can also score tickets to expensive trips like Halloween Horror Nights and Mickey's Very Merry Christmas for only $10! It is such a great school and I have no regrets coming here!
Freshman,5,The campus really does make it feel like home. It is really beautiful and there is many opportunities available to the students.
Niche User,5,"My experience with Saint Leo originates out of a stressful transition from ITT Technical Institute. I graduated from this particular school in 2012 with a Bachelors Degree in Business Administration with a 3.6 gpa, only to find out that the degree was no regionally accredited. With finding this out I was met with many obstacles in my career due to me wanting to teach, I couldn't utilize it anywhere neither would any career switcher allow me to transfer my degree.

       My wife made initial contact with the school and from the beginning they assured me they were regionally accredited, not only that they requested me to send official transcripts from ITT Tech but they made sure to let me know nothing would be guaranteed. Fortunately, upon review from the registrar, they were able to transfer 82 of my credits and now I only have one calendar year of school to receive a fully accredited Bachelors Degree. 

       Thus far, the staff has been outstanding to me."
Junior,5,"This University has been helpful, from the time I started, with the check-ins from my academic advisor, to help with my finances from my financial advisor. I have been helped with the classes that I enroll in as well as how long my degree would take. Saint Leo is an awesome school, and I do all online classes."
Freshman,5,"It's a very nice and safe University. It's campus is super nice, clean with excellent view make you feel secure. The personel are very nice. The students very friendly makes you feel like you're home. Class ratio perfect. Definitely you have to check."

Freshman,5,"Saint Leo has a great atmosphere, when you are there you can tell that the people really care. This is a great place to do your four years of college at. They also have a little bit of everything from clubs, to greek life, to sports. This college is quite diverse as well."
Alum,5,The online business degree program was both challenging and rewarding.  The staff were supportive throughout the education process.  The network earned through in class discussion was both helpful and supportive of our educational growth.
Junior,5,i like its bible studies dorm rooms teachers and staff is very helpful and has taught me thing about religion that i never knew thanks for being a great school. glad to be here in cyber class to protect our information.
Sophomore,5,"Great school. Small, friendly community that values it’s students and their opinions. Lots of activities considering the size of school."

Niche User,5,Saint Leo is a very beautiful campus to witness for yourself. The students and faculty are very warm and welcoming towards everyone.
Junior,5,I love Saint Leo University. They motivate and really care. They offer the hours for working class Americans and the work load is durable. The price for classes are also under most Universities. They are always fully staffed and offer break areas for students. The campus is always kept clean and tidy. Teacher relate to your current situations a time frames. Everyone works together like a well oiled machine.
Freshman,5,My experience at Saint Leo was absolutely amazing. I liked the fact that everyone was so helpful and I liked how I was able to talk to the professors before making my final decision on the school and the program i wanted to apply for
Junior,5,"I believe I would be an excellent candidate for this scholarship because in the 2 years that I have attended Saint Leo I have had nothing but the exceptional experience in the online department of Sociology as well as my liberal arts degree that i received in Spring of 2017. With this scholarship I would be able to use the money to save it up for my son, a new born that has just come into this world, I would use it towards school and budget the best way possible. I believe that i want to be considered for this scholarship because also, it would allow me to push myself even more. I am going to be hopefully graduating in Fall of 2019, and it is something  I never believed possible, I am a hard worker above all. I am someone that wants to use my degree and the skills I develop to inspire the world in every way possible I can only go up from here and do something so much bigger than myself."
Senior,5,This school is very concerned with assisting students obtain an education. I especially liked the hours of my classes.  I was able to continue  full time employment. The instructors are great.
Junior,5,"Saint Leo University is an awesome college, I am so happy I have had the opportunity to experience everything it has to offer.

There is always activities going on during the day to make going to Saint Leo even better."
Freshman,5,Saint Leo University has been nothing but an absolute joy being apart of. Not only are the faculty welcoming they are extremely helpful and knowledgeable in there fields of study.
Freshman,5,Everyone I have dealt with so far has been incredibly helpful and friendly! I plan on getting my masters with this university.
Freshman,5,It has been an amazing experience one I'm glad I'm taking at this time in my life. Wouldn't change anything about my experience so far.
Freshman,5,Great experience at Saint Leo Education center at Fort Eustis. The staff were very thorough and helpful.  Online classes were easy to follow and help was available if needed.
Graduate Student,5,Working with the financial system is awesome and also the enrollment is very easy Administration and staff are friendly it is a great campus I'm also online is very great
Senior,5,Testing results should be given back to students so they can see what questions they got wrong. Do not like the fact that you have no idea what the correct answer was. it is very very frustrating.  Also during the Hurricanes in the past 2 years there were some professors who didn't give you some leeway to finish up things.
Junior,5,"I love the small class size and friendliness around campus. I have had some amazing professors, all of which have extensive experience in their fields. The school really takes into account our student reviews of classes and professors. There are a few teachers that I knew to be less than substantial, however they do not last very long at the school."
Senior,4,"Overall, Saint Leo University is a great school, but could definitely work on a few things. The cost of room and board is extremely high considering what is being offered. They also force all students who live on campus to purchase a meal plan, even if the student has a kitchen in their on-campus apartment which is very unresonable. Other than that, the staff and students make the Saint Leo experiece great and I am glad to be a student here."
Senior,4,Saint Leo is widely known for its online program and they do a wonderful job of offering well structured and organized online classes.
Alum,4,Online classes were SUPER easy. If they are well organized professors then they should have everything lined up and easy to follow throughout the semester.
Junior,4,I like Saint Leo's platform compared to other schools. I have been to few different institutions and their sites are not as simple. I am getting a good education with less hassle. Sometimes the professors can be difficult but other than that I enjoy the school.
Senior,4,"Times are tricky and with the pandemic it was hard to transition from on-ground to online. Some professors took way longer to adapt then others, but it was a whole different experience than what we were used to."
Sophomore,4,"After Spring break everything had to be online due to COVID-19. It was pretty hard to get used to it at first but teachers did understand and made classes flexible and deadlines too. Classes were shorter and they felt really organized. However, nothing can replace in-person learning experience especially for those who are visual learners and like to ask a lot of questions since the classes were a little more fast-paced since zoom would only allow for a one hour class."
Sophomore,4,Saint Leo University is a small university with a lot of diversity. The classes are small and nice which allows for a better connection with faculty. It also has well-built buildings and if you like being surrounded by lakes or trees this is your place. The university's faculty is really attentive and will help you tailor your career to what you want it to be so that you have the most successful career and one you will enjoy.
Freshman,4,"Due to COVID-19, our university could transferred into online classes quickly. There were several problems, but they did their best. I appreciate it."
Freshman,4,"Saint Leo University campus is calm and huge. I like it. Also, I love library. They serve free coffee and tea. Staffs are friendly. Generally, I love this university."
Freshman,4,Since the pandemic they are handling very well with the online course the professor are been very helpful it made my life so much easier
Sophomore,4,"I never took an online class at Saint Leo, but I did take notice that they have a large variety of courses online to allow students to create some flexibility in their schedule."
Sophomore,4,"It is a great school with great professors. I enjoyed my time at Saint Leo University. Their introductory courses were important and helpful with the transition from high school to college. They emphasize the importance of time management, financial responsibility and making healthy life decisions, which i feel is very important to college freshmen."
Senior,4,"There's an ongoing list about the things I love about Saint Leo University. Saint Leo's advisors are the absolute best, they make sure the course is right for you and work with you to accomplish the schedule that best fits you. One thing Saint Leo University can improve on is the financial aid department."
Senior,4,"The majority of the classes I've taken here at this wonderful University has been online. Most of the teachers here truly care about their students and really want to see them accomplish all of the goals the student(s) have set for themselves. Although not all of the teachers work with you to ensure you're having the best learning experience, the majority of the professors make up for every ill-minded teacher you may have had. I truly enjoy the online learning experience at Saint Leo University."
Junior,4,Saint Leo University is a good school. Great campus life with a friendly atmosphere. Beautiful campus and scenary. Athletic teams are good.
Junior,4,Online classes are quite straightforward. Teachers are leniant and nice. They usually run about 8 weeks and are a condensed version of the on-ground class.
Senior,4,I have been taking classes online. I am seeking scholarships to assist with completing the last 4 classes.
Freshman,4,"Saint Leo University is such a good school for people who don't want big lecture halls and more interaction with students. They have a 15:1 Ratio for students to teachers. Amazing teachers who actually want to help you learn, great activities/clubs to help get you involved with other students and the school itself. Amazing view of the lake and sky. The only real downfall is that the WiFi is not that great but it can be over looked. Overall such a good school and its Roman Catholic!"
Freshman,4,My experience so far at Saint Leo University was good. All the professors I had were amazing. they really made the classes enjoyable and as stress free as possible. The partners of Saint Leo are also very nice and friendly people. It is a great college it's very small but very open and diverse it is honestly everything I look forward in a college .
Niche User,4,I’m looking to transfer to that school. Great academic programs. I’m just worried about the cost of tuition for me. But overall I’ve heard nothing but good things about this school.
Junior,4,The teachers respond to questions in a timely manner and my adviser is very helpful in choosing classes.
Sophomore,4,"My experience so far has been great. However, I hope to see an increase in the amount of scholarships available for international students. And also, it would be nice for the campus food options to improve."
Freshman,4,"When you are a freshman and are new to Saint Leo, everyone is welcoming and want you to be part of the Saint Leo community. I would like to have better dorms but other than that I don’t have any problems with this university."
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful. Faculty and professors are extremely nice and welcome; they are open to any questions you have and will work with you. There is always something unique going on on campus every day. Saint leo is a secluded area so there isnt any major stores or entertainment near by. There are many classes to choose from. The school has many organizations and clubs to choose from so there is definitely something for everyone to choose from.
Senior,4,"Saint Leo University is a small school but is wide within the online classes and students. Military and adult learners are encouraged and welcomed within the school. These non-traditional students shocked me at first because I did not understand there could be a range of students attending college. These past few years have changed my life and has allowed me to meet so many new individuals that will be part of my life after college. I am grateful to have attended SLU and say that it was worth the experience. The school is expanding and that is the only downside, I won't be in school while it occurs but will see the changes in the future."
Freshman,4,How much help the University offers to help students succeed. I would like to see the course load lessen in many classes and more time devoted to having the student actually learn something.
Works Here,4,The 6 core values is engrained into everything we do! Campus is beautiful and undergraduate sport business program is a top program. Accredited by COSMAand was thw first to be accredited in the U.S.!
Sophomore,4,Saint Leo makes you feel like your part of a family. They are there night and day. I couldn't ask for a better school to go to.
Freshman,4,"this school is very small, I do think that they need to make more activities where students can get to know each other better. although the professors here make an effort to know you individually and want you to succeed in their classes. they had good opportunities in this school for students that can help jump start their future and finish college."
Senior,4,"Saint Leo is a beautiful school with a gorgeous campus and wonderful professors who really do care about your future. Professors that actually take the time to remember your name, offer help before you even ask, and try their best to make sure you’re understanding and succeeding. The only complaints I have is the area it is in, as it’s very boring with hardly anything around. You have to drive a bit away to get to anything and if you don’t have a way of transportation, it will be difficult for you."
Senior,4,Saint Leo was awesome! I enjoyed my time on campus. I got my 4 year degree in 3.5 years! All the professors were easy to work with and would give me any one on one training I needed. They also were very reliable and taught the subjects well. I have told all my friends to transfer because there is no better school for a degree!
Graduate Student,4,Saint Leo University's MBA program was very good because the curriculum provided real world case studies.  The real world case studies made it possible to apply the principles and concepts taught in the classroom.  Thereby affording graduate students an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of business practices.
Junior,4,"Saint Leo University is an amazing University. A small campus, however you meet many great people from all over the country and different parts of the world. Saint Leo University lies on six pillars. Excellence, Respect, Community, Personal Development, Responsible Stewardship, and Integrity. All six pillars sound silly when you take your first step at being a lion on campus, but through time and experience,  you truly understand and use these six pillars in your education, on campus, and in your day to day life. At Saint Leo University, there is something said here ""You will love the person you become here."" I think at first, through all the school work, activates and living life for four years, you would not understand. Yet, once you hit that stage, and you move your tassel and you have flashbacks of fun times, good times, bad times, and so much more. You truly do recognize, ""You do Love the Person You Became Here"" at Saint Leo University."
Junior,4,I would like to see more courses available throughout the terms instead of waiting for specific times.
Freshman,4,"I'm am only  freshman at Saint Leo University, but so far it has been fun. I have made great friends and it is just a great time. I would recommend this University to anyone who isn't a fan of the city or big universities because this one is great."
Junior,4,"Great school if you're interested in a very small private school. Good education, not so great social scene."
Freshman,4,"I'm a freshman that just started attending this university for the Spring 2019 semester. I think the school is really amazing, the professors are friendly and there are loads of opportunities for students on and off campus."
Freshman,4,"The professors are amazing, and the small class sizes really enable students and teachers to build strong bonds."
Freshman,4,"With my short experience in dealing with Saint Leo, I've found it to be an extremely accommodating University. The enrollment process was pleasant, with counselors guiding you throughout the entire time. I chose Saint Leo because it offered courses that I was interested in taking, as well as online courses for ease of access."
Senior,4,"Online student finishing bachelors degree. I've had great instructors, some more challenging than others but I welcome that. It has been a dream to finish my degree for a long time and Saint Leo is helping me achieve this. The school really makes an effort to provide services and resources to online and center students!"
Senior,4,It's a great school I've had the best four years so far learned more than expected professors are great for the most part and you feel safe.. Good is ok but always plenty to choose.
Senior,4,So far I have enjoyed all of my classes and the professors are so helpful! At first I was a little skeptical about the school because I had never heard of it before but then I decided to give it a chance and I do not regret it. The courses can be a little challenging but the professors are always willing to help with any questions that you may have or anything at all that might be troubling you as a student.
Junior,4,Saint Leo had great instructors and a wonderful class setting. I learned a lot and would love to finish my degree there.
Junior,4,"This is my 2nd year at Saint Leo, as I transferred from Saint Thomas University in Miami. Im very glad that I transferred, and can honestly say that I feel more comfortable and more at home here. This school is very clean, every professor is very knowledgable and great professors, and they all encourage us to go to them for anything."
Sophomore,4,"I like that it is in a small community and the professors are very helpful.The students are friendly and there is a diverse mixture of cultures. The classes are small in size to receive personal care from professors if need be. The campus is far from any high end mall. But there are ways around that, it would be a plus if you are driving. The university has various activities and sometimes offer discounts on professional games e.g NBA games."
Junior,4,"I am completing my degree online, which is convenient. However, every other year the university seems to change the format as to how the classes are administered and it’s not always for the better. Just when you get used o something, it changes and help is not always forthcoming."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is amazing, not much to do around unless you have personal transportation. Best option is to be involved with activities and clubs at the university. Lots of cheap opportunities for students to go to concerts parks and events outside campus through ""Saint Leo Tickets"""
Junior,4,"I am an online student and I love the convenience of going to school when I am free.  The classes are scheduled at a perfect time and the professors offer virtual office hours. I would recommend that if you work full time, go online."
Sophomore,4,"Wish some of the instructors were more understanding of online students 
However the open and availability of classes and degrees are amazing"
Junior,4,This is my first semester at Saint Leo but so far I have teachers who care and I'm surrounded by many students who work hard
Senior,4,"The professors are pleasant , the advisors are always helpful in showing what you need to do to succeed. If you study hard do your assignments and show effort you glide through with no problems. Dedication and honesty is everything at this school."
Freshman,4,"Extremely friendly staff. Always looking for a way to make you and your family feel comfortable and safe. From the time you first step foot on campus, everyone goes out of their way to put you at ease. There are many activities to bring people together like ice cream socials, free coffee drinks and smoothies
on your way to class, free tee shirts, movies and festivals."
Junior,4,I highly recommend this school for the small ratio to teacher and the attention to the student population
Sophomore,4,"Coming from a quiet town with little diversity, this school has taught me so much. Not only have I met a lot of international students, but this has become my home away from home. The classes are amazing, and the professors can be incredibly helpful."
Niche User,4,"I love how small this University is! The smaller class size allows you to get more help from a teacher and be more involved. It helps you become more than just face in the crowd. My friend goes there, and I can't wait to hopefully join her!"
Junior,4,"I am an online student and I am very pleased with my educational experience with St. Leo.  The instructors provide me with the necessary tools to learn.  The courses are well laid out. I am able to converse with my instructor when needed and their responses are timely.  The cost to attend online has just decreased (that's a plus).  This will allow me to continue to earn a BS degree. They provide you with advisors to help you along the way.  They keep in touch with you to ensure you are taking the correct classes and that you are not having problems maintain your grades.  They will direct you to all of the online assistance that is available to you.  St. Leo makes online learning easy, affordable and manageable."
Freshman,4,"As a student of the St. Leo Family, here in Tallahassee, FL. They have been the most helpful, determined and dedicated staff, that I have met while on this journey. When ever I'm in need of study material, I can email my professor up, tell him what I need and in a day I'm able to continue on with my studies. When I need and encouraging word sometime just the office staff, gives us the students a listening ear. I understand that we all are mature adults but sometimes we need that extra push, to help us make it thru the day.
As a mother of four kids, its very hard for me. But I learn to press my way.  So whenever I fall behind my Professor always send me an email to find out what's going on or how he/she can help. That means a lot to a student.  I have enjoyed being apart of this family. The smiling faces that greets you when you walk in the office. They even help you with the resources that you need to pass your class.  St. Leo  may be small but its large at heart."
Sophomore,4,"Classes are easy to navigate. If you need to call the school for anything, whether it's enrollment issues to financial aid, you're guaranteed to get some help with your issue. The ability to register for classes you need (almost) all year long makes completing a degree pretty painless!"
Sophomore,4,The teachers and staff are very understanding and helpful. The classes only last for about 8 weeks which makes it very fast paced. I love this school.
Graduate Student,4,I love the small teacher to student ratio . The interaction within the classroom is great. The professors express how important it is that we utilize the resources available to us as students. They are willing to go above and beyond to ensure we have what we need to succeed.
Alum,2,I can really say anything towards that online classes depends on the professors mainly and I had some good and some very horrible.
Alum,2,It’s very small school and education isn’t that great it’s an easy school but I found some people failing which mind blown me but I think you can get admitted without doing your SAT or GMAT. It’s middle of nowhere at least you need an hour drive to go to Tampa to have some entertainment. I graduated from here so I experienced this school for some time.
Sophomore,2,"Nothing too exciting, the dorms are always full of bugs and sometimes have mold, it's in the middle of nowhere so you never have anything to do, every thing is at least 20 minutes away, not really a lot of food options, JUST opened a ""starbucks"""
Alum,2,"Bad school fo education, not challenging at all, most of students come here because they didn’t get accepted to any other school. It’s in the middle of nowhere, you have to go to Tampa which is like 30 miles to do anything at all."
Freshman,2,The student portal is confusing and since it's all done online thru the portal it makes everything else difficult.
Sophomore,2,"I dislike the program I am in, I feel the psychology department has repetitive lectures in the different courses and overall I fell this school is just not for me."
Niche User,2,"Not really any medical degree programs, which is disappointing because there are a lot of people that would like to join the medical field like me, others then that the school is pretty okay, very diverse and lots of activities to do. It just needs to work on their degree programs"
Sophomore,2,"The academics ate this school sucks, basically you have to teach yourself. The school is somewhat diversity, but mostly white rich kids come ear. Athletics sucks and there is no football team. The professors need to work on their human resources skills, because they talk down to the students. There are very limited numbers of professors, that teach out this college. It is your best interest, to live off campus, because the dorms sucks. The safety ate this college sucks, it takes 15 to 20 minutes for security to show up. Not very good on return to Investment, had to transfer to another college. The campus is out in the multiple of now where. There is nothing to do at this college, but to party. I hope that you have a car, because there nothing in the local area. The campus food is ok, but, some friendly advice, bring your own food. I going to troffer to another college."
Sophomore,2,"Athletic program is very unprofessional and not what you would expect at all, coaches are very unprofessional and may have very little experience in running their own program. And even don't know how they should run a program or have little knowledge of the game at all. Saint Leo is in Dade City in the middle of no where and the professors are not good at all. Some do not even post grades on any of the assignments given and will not even asnwer your emails about it either."
Sophomore,2,"I did not want to do online classes because I have a disability. I thought that being in class would be a better way to get my education. Saint Leo University was the closest school and the representative for the school stated that they had classes on campus for the degree that I wanted. So I applied and enrolled just to find out they didn't offer any on campus classes for me degree. That left me with an issue. They did not work with my disability. Then when I had a health issue that I needed time off for they gave me a wrong date to take leave and would not help fix it. What do I like about the school, the campus is beautiful even that I never attended a class there, just online."
Freshman,2,"I went to Saint Leo my freshman year, the school itself is very nice, very clean but besides that everything else is not really up to the standard. It's a private school so tuition is very expensive, there is only one Cafe and the food taste like they're all microwave, after 9 pm it is close. The gym is very small with old equipments."
College Freshman,2,Living in Snyder and Marmion was the worst. Its a very old building from the 1800's and its very far from campus. The walk from Snyder and Marmion to campus was about 10 minutes. The dorms who have pest problems and the community bathrooms would be cleaned about 2 or 3 times a week. Other than that the social atmosphere was not bad. The other housing on campus was way better.
College Freshman,2,"I lived in Henderson for my freshman year, which is basically like a jail cell. The rooms are old and somewhat gross. It smells weird in the building and the bathrooms are gross. Maintenance staff is there cleaning daily, which is nice, but that doesn't make up for the fact that the facilities are just old and run down. The apartments on the other hand, are newer and much nicer, which is to be expected. I'm looking forward to living in an apartment next semester."
College Freshman,2,The freshman dorms could be a bit bigger .
College Junior,2,"a heavy workload, especially for online classes."
College Sophomore,2,Itsvwas very difficult to understand
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus is my only option according to Residence Life since my family lives in New Jersey. I hate that they force me to live on campus when I cannot afford it because I could be living with my friend off campus where we would split the rent, but apparently only students with ninety credits may do that."
College Senior,2,"The best part about this school are the professors. They're friendly, love their job, and are helpful when you need assistance with an assignment. Everything else could use some improvement. Student housing isn't so great; there's mold in just about every dorm. The food isn't great either. Both the food and housing are overpriced. The atmosphere is kind of cliquey. Financial aid is the worst part of the school and the main reason why I won't recommend this school to anyone. They are rude, and they'll find any way to take whatever aid you have away."
College Senior,2,The financial aid office sent me a link with different outside scholarship options.
College Freshman,2,Lots of fast food nearby but few actual good restaurants that I have found to this point.
Recent Alumnus,2,"When I first started school, I had trouble with receiving financial aid. And now, three semesters in, I learn that I have used all my undergraduate student loans and I don't know how I'm going to continue school. I needed that money for transportation, food, computer repairs, and daily expenses. And my school isn't really helping me find additional funding."
College Junior,2,"Saint Leo is located 30 to 45 minutes away from Tampa. Thus, if you want to have a night life it is difficult to have one due to the location of Saint Leo."
College Senior,2,"We do not have a recreation center on campus, the gym for working out is very, very small. And you must find a specific time to go in between the 18 athletic teams throughout the day. There are only two new dormitory's on campus, which fill up the fastest. There are plenty of athletic events, but poor marketing and barely any student involvement at any athletic event. Mostly, which is sad, after classes are done, and by 3-4pm every day, the campus is dead as everyone goes back to their apartments."
College Senior,2,"Campus is very strict with everything, myself above 21, cannot have a drink on campus. Rules are strictly enforced in the dormitory's, usually there are no warnings (the RA says the meeting in the beginning of the semester this is your warning). If you are looking for the genuine college experience of going out and having fun, Saint Leo is not the place."
College Junior,2,There isn't really any night life around st leo. There is one bar and a few people that may throw house parties. For the most part you will be driving to Tampa to go out.
College Sophomore,2,It's too out-of-the-way campus is good but it's better to live off of it
College Freshman,2,There is literally nothing around campus so to get anywhere you need a car. But sometimes school has free shuttles to target and walmart and the shopping center thats every 2 weeks.
College Freshman,2,The people act like it is a problem to help.
College Freshman,2,There is nothing here to do and very little is known about the campus activities.
College Freshman,2,Everyone is so racist and homophobic its disgusting.
College Freshman,2,"There are only 3 sororities and the ""top"" one is found at only like 20 other schools. If you think you're a typical sorority girl, don't join, they only give bids to the ""weird"" girls who don't drink or go to parties. The frats are just good for parties but most of the time they don't even have any."
College Sophomore,2,your have to drive 20 miles to the nearest town / city
College Sophomore,2,a student can not tall if it is raining or not or cold or hot
College Sophomore,2,the majors at saint leo is a joke
College Freshman,2,"You have to go to tampa for the best places to party, but there are some in Dade City that we dont really talk about."
College Freshman,2,"It gets so boring... the towns nearby are tiny, and really dont have much in them. You have to drive 15 mins to go anywhere that would be remotely fun."
College Freshman,2,"There's a shuttle every now and then, but it's in the middle of the day when classes are going on. It's very inconvenient. A car is necessary."
College Freshman,2,"The college is very secluded. If you don't have a car, there's nothing to do. If you have a car, be ready to drive at least 30-45 minutes to get somewhere worth going."
College Junior,2,There are never any parking spots. They are always taken and you have to park across the street.
College Junior,2,The sports are never mentioned unless it's at a different campus.
College Junior,2,No internet service anywhere. There's no real help if your computer is breaks or becomes broken.
College Junior,2,it's very difficult to get the finical aid at the school. Sometimes the papers get lost or something is missing and it's a hassel to get taken care of to pay for classes.
Recent Alumnus,2,no buses use friends to go somewhere or own car
College Freshman,2,There is nothing to do that is close by. Not even movie theaters. You kind of have to drive at least 20-30 minutes and up to about an hour or so out of the way to find anything to do.
College Sophomore,2,"As a freshman I thought it was kind of crazy, but now I notice it a lot more a year later."
College Sophomore,2,If I had the money I would go to another college 
College Senior,2,"Financial aid is done entirely online through the school's proprietary student account system. Availability and allocation of funds are seemingly random and subject to various loopholes and exceptions to what few rules exist. However, funding is available for those with the patience of saints."
College Senior,2,"Online only, admission was time a consuming process, but easy once in contact with a student adviser."
College Senior,2,I am enter in the online program.
College Freshman,2,"Although the campus is remote and there is no public transportation, the school has regular-sponsored trips to wal-mart."
Recent Alumnus,2,Our school is away from all the nightlife scenes. There are small bars maybe near by but not any place to really hang out. The closest town is Tampa and its far. You will have to have your car to travel to Tampa because the buses doesn't travel that far.
College Senior,2,"It rains a lot here so sometimes events have to get cancelled or rescheduled. We have a relatively small campus so it is not that hard to get places without getting wet, but the rain still puts a damper on the day when you walk out of the apartment to black skies."
College Junior,2,"If you can park close to your building, you must be a wizard, or never drive ANYWHERE!!!"
College Junior,2,"Again, I live in Virginia so I have not visited my school which is located in Florida."
College Junior,2,"I would defiantly be interested in doing any internship available, but again my school is located in Florida so I'm not sure how I would qualify when I live in Virginia."
College Junior,2,I would not know much how about the athletics offered at my school because I live in Virginia and my school is located in Florida.
College Sophomore,2,"Didn't join, did not like what they asked me to do to be a member, was not going to go buy condoms."
College Sophomore,2,"If you're unlucky enough to not have a car, they do offer the option to drive you once in a blue moon to walmart or a local store in one of their vans."
College Senior,2,Some students can get away with using illegal drugs in their dorm rooms and I'm not sure it's as enforced as it could be but it might be better if local students were more concerned with it to report usage to administration.
College Senior,2,"I just have the basic financial aid. I submit my FAFSA and receive that aid from that process. Dealing with financial aid can be a hassle. I try my best to make sure everything is turned in and done the right way with FAFSA to avoid having to deal with the office. Eventually things work out, but it can be a long and draw out process."
Freshman,1,The online program where you access your courses and view grades and assignments is the worst. I once had to look for an hour to find an assignment and then it turned out only the assignment details were there and I had to find a different page to submit the assignment. Even the teachers struggled to use it. The RA's were annoying and it's honestly way overpriced. Located in one of the most boring towns ever. Worst college experience I have ever had.
Sophomore,1,"The school has become crowded because they want money but things like parking, housing, dining hall, etc have become so full that it's miserable. The dining hall food is hit or miss and you usually can't find anywhere to sit and even if you do you have to deal with the staff being unprofessional. Res life is another joke because they don't hear about issues until it's too late and they do nothing to help students. Campus safety is useless my car got broken into and I was told ""there's nothing we can do"" theres no cameras in the parking garage. Success coaches think they're helping students but are making issues like enrolling us in classes we didn't ask or agree to be in and then claiming ""everything else is full"" when asked to be switched. Financial aid lies to students about financials and what their options are I was told I HAD to pay 8k to register for spring & that was my ""only option"" I thankfully found another option & when I asked about it was told ""oh yeah, you could do that"""
Freshman,1,"DO NOT COME HERE!!! The staff is very rude. When you ask financial aid questions they give you 10 different answers along with mislead information. The professors are extremely picky, a lot of them would change their syllabus at the last minute and make their test hard on purpose. The professors mostly care about getting a paycheck and failing students. Do not make a mistake like I did by not doing extra research about this school. ""You wont like the person you'll become here"""
College Sophomore,1,There isn't any Greek Life at my school.
College Sophomore,1,There are no athletics at my school. Or if it is none mentions them.
College Sophomore,1,I don't like the sororities here. They are very mean and treat you like you're beneath them.
College Freshman,1,"You have two very small, bootleg cities on either side of Saint Leo. Not much to do and almost nothing in walking distance."
College Freshman,1,Greek life here is pretty bad there are frats and sororities but they seem cliquey and have to live on campus.
College Freshman,1,"It's pretty dead, you have to go into Tampa to really do anything."
College Freshman,1,"Struggling to find the rest of my money to attend school with no credit worthy individuals in my family. Getting a loan is very challenging and I have been rejected to every private loan lender that associates with Saint Leo. I may possibly be kicked out due to inability to pay $3,000 in 4 months on my own"
College Freshman,1,It sucks! And all the healthy options are gross
College Freshman,1,The school sucks with transportation.
College Freshman,1,The off campus are terrible.
College Freshman,1,Parking sucks. Parking sucks. Parking sucks. Parking sucks.
College Freshman,1,"""there is know unique things about Saint Leo"" said someone previously. It should say there is NO unique things about Saint Leo. Just goes to show about the people who go here."
College Sophomore,1,Staff and faculty tries to be your mom and dad
College Sophomore,1,the facilities at saint Leo sucks

College Sophomore,1,there is no Greek life at Saint loe
College Sophomore,1,the parking at saint Leo is bad.
College Freshman,1,"Nothing is near the school, you can't even walk."
College Sophomore,1,it best to bring a computer 
College Sophomore,1,You are stock on campus if you don't have a car 
College Senior,1,"Test questions are misspelled, there are not clearly defined expectations, teachers do not go by the syllabus, class attendance is often worth as much of your grade as the final, percentages of total grade for each assignment are ridiculous (10 page paper = 10 points, 1 page paper = 10 points, Class participation = 10 points, Midterm = 6 points, all the same class) Most questions are entirely open ended with no real answer, lectures are very poor and unplanned, but compulsory (worth as much as the final) and everything is extremely dumbed down (Most of my assignments seem to be at a 5th grade level).

Do not attend Saint Leo University's Tallahassee branch for Psychology. Just do yourself a favor and don't."
College Freshman,1,"My experience at Saint Leo is terrible right now. The first day I arrived, my roommate moved back home. I'm ready to leave. The Greek Life here is beyond rude and obnoxious, especially when you don't fit into the Greek scene. The sanitation is not maintained in a orderly fashion. I'm looking for more within my college experience. Although the staff is really nice, the teachers are rude and show favoritism.  I've been altercations with people I don't even know here because of crazy rumors. Overall, I would not do it all over again. "
College Sophomore,1,"Basically, if you don’t have a car, truck, or motorcycle you are stack at school. If a student doesn’t have transportation they have to rely on someone that have transportation."
College Sophomore,1,"MY TITLE REVIEW – Basically, if you don’t have a car, truck, or motorcycle you are stack at school. If a student doesn’t have transportation they have to rely on someone that have transportation."
College Sophomore,1,"Apparently my Mom makes just over the minimum requried for financial aid, my dad does not help with college expenses at all.  I did get some assistance from Saint Leo for which I am grateful, but don't understand how some students, get everything paid for and a check each semester, while my Mom pinches every penny to pay the bill, I work during school and over Christmas and my Spring Break and gave back to SLU my time in Student Govt., and various clubs, while the ones that got everything paid for and money back didn't do anything to give back. The system is broken!  If they get assistance then they should have to give back to the school."
College Sophomore,1,"Although they have a few good programs, most of the programs are a joke. They also like to switch up the requirements on which courses need to be taken halfway through which is a HUGE pain. Also, good luck trying to transfer these classes.. ""Concepts of Wellness"" yeah, unnecessary."
College Sophomore,1,"This school is in the middle of no where, if you don't have a car.. you're screwed."
College Freshman,1,"if I had to it over again, I would do it again. I just which Saint Leo had different teachers. my career goal is to work for a big company."
College Freshman,1,"If I had the money, I would transfer to a different college"
College Freshman,1,the health & safety at Saint Leo is not vary good.
College Freshman,1,there is know night life at Saint Leo because the school is out in the modal of now were
College Freshman,1,I moved off campus because the housing sucks at Saint Leo
College Freshman,1,"the food is not very good, it is best to eat off campus"
College Freshman,1,The academics is not that good at Saint Leo. If I had the money I would transfer to another college
College Freshman,1,you have to drive around for an hour to find a parking spont
College Freshman,1,If I had the money I would transfer to another college
College Junior,1,The parking is pretty bad in the Savannah location but they just moved to this location that we currently have.
College Sophomore,1,"I did not receive enough financial aid and my school doesn't provide a lot of scholarships that people will be eligible for. It took a lot of time for my financial aid to be processed. I thought that I wouldn't  be able to return back to school because my tuition was not paid off, but in the end it was."
College Freshman,1,"The campus is pretty, but the gym is lacking a little. It looks like a prison. The lounges in the dorms are old and beat up, and the library is outdated."
Recent Alumnus,1,"This is a private Catholic schools that discourages the party atmosphere, especially underage drinking. The students here are not into that scene anyways."
College Senior,1,the only place is some barbecue place and never been there because it looks scary.
College Senior,1,it is in the freaking boondocks. There is a winery somewhere close to the church. The school is a catholic school i am just there to get my degree and get the hell out of florida. i live in spring hill florida and have to drive an hour to get to saint leo.
College Freshman,1,"The transportation around Saint Leo sucks. If you do not have a car or know somebody with one you are pretty much screwed. The only good thing is that a couple of times a month, the school provides vans to Target and Walmart."
College Junior,1,"This school's financial aid department needs to straighten up. Many of my classmates don't receive their aid until the deadline is almost up. It is almost impossible to reach the financial aid department. They never respond to emails, and if you call them they will put you on hold forever. They also have a tendency to blame matters on everyone but themselves. It is never their fault, and nobody knows how to fix the problems you need fixed. You really need to stay on them if you want anything to get done."
College Junior,1,"Unless you drive to Gainesville to attend popular clubs such as :08, there is no nightlife for college students at the Lake City Campus. If you are looking for a college that offers extra activities, or a town that caters to the college population, Saint Leo: Lake City Center is not the place to go."
College Freshman,1,"There's barely anyway to get around. There's a bus that runs around, but it only runs every two weeks and you have to pay to use it."
College Senior,1,Process Could Have Been a Little More Smoothe – it takes forever for someone to return your call.  they tell you to sign up for classes and everything will be fine and then you get a message saying unable to register.
College Freshman,1,"Packed Beyond Reasoning – The Worst Parking Ever! You have to get here before the break of dawn to get any parking spaces, or you'll have to settle for the groves down the hill or near the sports fields where there is  nothing but construction. The only positive is that they're finaly building a parking garage."
College Freshman,1,"The nightlife around SLU is very weak especially if you do not have a car. Most students go to Tampa for nightlife, specifically Ybor City."
College Freshman,1,"There is no public transportation at Saint Leo because the school is in the rural area. However, vans are provided for students who want to go to the mall or Wal-Mart."

Freshman,5,Keuka college is a great place to be since you are by a lake and that all the teachers on campus are very helpful when you are struggling on work in the class. I enjoy going to Keuka College and can't wait to suggest this college to other people that are looking for a college as well.
Senior,5,The remote teachers are amazing and always make time to help a student. The IT department was also very patient when I had trouble logging into the online learning forums.
Sophomore,5,I love being at Keuka and it is definitely all that I could have hoped for in my choice of college. Definitely a warm and friendly environment
Junior,5,Keuka is a great school with many flexible learning options. I am in the AEO program which allows me to attend school one night a week in the evening. This allows me to still work while getting my education.
Junior,5,With the coronavirus we have gone to online learning. The professors have been very helpful and understanding with this transition.
Freshman,5,"I really like this school. The classes are small and interesting, the rooms aren't bad, and the campus is small. There's usually something to do."
Freshman,5,I love the small and friendly atmosphere. Everyone is here to help and you're bound to get a smile from at least one person while walking through campus.
Freshman,5,"Keuka College is very welcoming to the new students! The professors, staff, and upperclassmen make you feel at home and help you adjust into being a wolf!"
Niche User,5,"On December 9th I visited Keuka College. The overall scenery was gorgeous and the best part of the view was the Lake in the ""backyard"" of Keuka College. The kids on campus are really nice and even if your just visiting the college students will greet you and talk to you. Keuka really works hard to keep everybody happy and getting everybody involved with different activites throughout each semester."
Niche User,5,Loved the campus. The view was beautiful and the teachers were amazing and so friendly! Highly recommend visiting this college.
Junior,5,"I am currently attending Keuka College as a biochemistry major, and I have loved the time I have spent there. I have wonderful professors. They are knowledgeable and are always willing to help out when it is needed. I am currently involved in a research project with one of my professors, which has allowed me to learn new things and use new equipment, that I do not think I would have had the opportunity to use if I attended a larger school. The campus is well maintained, and the location on the lake allows for a pretty view and water recreation. The food and dorms are fine, I do think there could be renovations with newer furniture. My only critique is that there could be some updating on some of the buildings, but it has not negatively affected my experience there."
Sophomore,5,"I am going to be a sophmore at Keuka College. I am transferring in as an adult student due to a career change. When visiting the college, meeting with administration, teachers, and viewing the campus it has been an amazing expereinece. I have gotten a glimpse into what I will be doing as I am going into a specialized field. I am very excited to start this new journey!!"
Sophomore,5,"Keuka College is an absolutely gorgeous campus with its location right on Keuka Lake. The college opens up water activities at Point Neamo for students to use free of charge. The people at this college are very nice, and it overall is a lower population college, which personally I really enjoy. Class sizes are rarely more that fifteen to twenty kids, other than science lectures which range between thirty and forty. This makes it very easy to see professors, and most of them are very kind and always willing to help. The only issue that I have with Keuka College is the limited parking close to the dorm and academic buildings, all other parking is a fifteen minute walk away which tends to be very inconvenient. The food is good, and it is not a huge party school either like most colleges are. I overall love Keuka College and am very happy that I decided to go there to pursue my dream of becoming a veterinarian!"
Freshman,5,Keuka College is a beautiful campus with a great number of adventurous activities for all students. Everyone is held to and treated with the same kindness and respect considering the large amount of diversity at Keuka. I love Keuka because the small campus allows everyone to really connect and feel more like a home.
Graduate Student,5,The instructors are knowledgeable and down to earth. The program accomodates our work and personal life while attending to our educationsl needs
Freshman,5,"Keuka College is the perfect school for anybody who is looking for a small school environment. The small environment creates close relationships with faculty and allows students to greatly succeed in their academics. Keuka college is unique for its field period program, which greatly shapes students into professionals."
Freshman,5,I absolutely love the lake and the Field Period. Everyone is so nice and friendly. I can't wait to go in the fall.
Alum,5,"Best time of my life. Made lifelong friends, worked hard, and played hard. Have been employed out of state ever since graduation in 2005. I needed the small college atmosphere as a young man. Professors held me accountable and provided support. A large chunk of student body were student-athletes, which was nice. Had the opportunity to play baseball 4 years at a beautiful college and earn a degree. Priceless."
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful, and the professors are very friendly. I love how they have a Field Period every year, which is basically an internship. They're really big on networking, which I think is important. They really make sure you know that this is what you want to do after you graduate."
Senior,5,"I love that Keuka is on the Lake, it has a gorgeous campus. Small class sizes make it easy to connect with professors and get one on one help."
College Sophomore,5,Very diverse learn a lot of new things
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely LOVE my school honestly!! Everyone is like family even the professors!
College Sophomore,5,Field Period is a very good program. It allows me to get experience in the field that I'm studying to help me figh=ure out what I want to do when I graduate.
College Sophomore,5,They provide everything that I could possibly think of.
College Sophomore,5,I got into one of the most difficult dorm on campus which is very un common for a sophomore.
College Sophomore,5,I really Love Keuka College.
College Junior,5,"We have a great Field Period program that every student has to complete each year, which gives students options for jobs and careers and time to explore your major or outside of it."
College Freshman,5,If i had to do this all over again i would still pick Keuka college. Keuka college sits right next to the beautiful keuka lake and it's view is breathtaking but afar from that the way everyone is so friendly and nice and the professors are really caring about you as a student and will do everything in their power to make sure you are getting the right education and the help you need if you're struggling is phenomenal.
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are extremely helpful and understanding. Each professor represents Keuka is a good way. They are always willing to help, and will comment on your success."
College Freshman,5,Campo is really good about patroling the area. sometimes off campus police. We only had one incident last semester after bar night where FLCC kids came and their was a fight. however no one under the age of 21 can attend MVPs for thirsty thursday
College Freshman,5,FIELD PERIODS!!!! the best thing. We have over a 90 % job placement after college
College Freshman,5,I love the professors and the curriculum. The heavy workload is to be expected in college but there are plenty of places to study and there are also tutors for many different classes.
College Freshman,5,The classes are weirdly one of my favorite things about attending this school. The teachers are great. They genuinely care about their students. They want them to learn everything they can and get good grades. They are really helpful and are usually always there if you need them for anything. The small class sizes are really nice because you get the individual attention needed to be successful in the classroom.
College Freshman,5,The Experiential Learning office is extremely helpful finding Field Periods and helping with the process.
College Freshman,5,It seems like sports is one of the only things anyone cares here.
College Freshman,5,Love the buildings and the staff!
College Junior,5,"I love being in the education department. We get a lot of experiences and the professors are all really helpful. They take the time to help you with problems that may occur, my workload can get heavy sometimes because I'm a duel major, but its worth it. The facilities are good and we get to work with different types of technology."
College Junior,5,"Internships are different for everyone. I have had some good Field Periods (its like an internship). Requirements for Field Periods vary from major to major, you usually have to have four to graduate and have 140 hours for each one. Along with that their is a lot of planning to do, with a paper, daily journals, and a presentations with your adviser. I have had great experiences with my Field Periods, and they were really helpful for my career. I plan on student teaching next spring."
College Freshman,5,I think I can really get somewhere when I get this degree
College Freshman,5,We support each other best way we can and we support those who we know are going to be great
Freshman,4,I did take a class online but it was hard to do since many of the questions that needed a response are things that I have never seen in public or had any experience at all. The teacher held office hours for any questions that the student needed help on in the class.
Senior,4,Love this school. I go remotely and there is always someone willing to help by email or phone anytime I have had a problem.
Sophomore,4,Classes online were a struggle at first but that's probably because I didn't want to take online classes. Otherwise the teachers and staff worked hard to make it work and we got through just fine
Sophomore,4,"I love Keuka College, but the food could be improved. It is a very small school, but they oversell parking and it is always hard to find parking, so they always give out tickets. The professors are amazing, and they have great resources."
Senior,4,"I loved the small campus as well as small class sizes. Going to the lake was a great way to unwind. All of my professors wanted to help me as much as they could. If they did not know the answer to something, they would refer me to someone else. I loved the field periods because it was a way for students to gain more experience for their majors."
Junior,4,Keuka College has really great programs for each major with caring staff. A smaller community allows for more one on one time with the professors and opens up more time to asking questions in class as well as more engagement in the classroom.
Freshman,4,"Keuka is an amazing college, small classes will make sure you understand everything and there’s so many other assistance offered if you’re struggling. The yearly internship program that each student is required to do each year really helps you to get a feel of your career field and make sure it’s right for you!"
Junior,4,"I like that the professors at Keuka are generally easy going and eager to help students learn and engage. I like that the view of campus life feels like a little community. However, being a commuter and transfer student, I seemingly have a harder time trying to connect with others."
Freshman,4,"Keuka College is a fantastic college that really prepares you for your future career choices. Throughout the course of your schooling, you are required to complete field periods, or on site career related observation and working. You must complete 1 field period every year unless you are a masters student for Occupational Therapy. Then, you must complete 2 Field Periods every year. The faculty and staff all really want you to succeed. They are always in your corner and there to help no matter what. It is an amazing school that I would recommend to anyone."
Sophomore,4,"My overall educational experience has been very good. I love my Social Work Adviser and the classes for my major. My Adviser has helped me plan out the next 4 years of my college career. She is with me every step of the way for any questions or concerns I might have.  I like that they require you to have hands on field periods to learn about your major and if it is a good fit for you. The campus is in a beautiful location with amazing views.  My ""dorm life"" experience was pure hell the first 6 weeks of college and I truly think they need some upgrades on their dorms and the way the RA's handle things."
Junior,4,If you are looking for a small school then this is the place for you! The beautiful campus offers fun and a bright future. The staff is incredible. They offer guidance and support through a difficult transition. The food is not so great. Few options are offered and it gets very repetitive.
Alum,4,"Keuka still has potential for growth and change. The college strives for inclusion and diversity, and have put in more effort in recent years than ever before to make students feel included."
Junior,4,"I felt prepared as a transfer student from a 2 yr college. Someone was always around when I had questions. Beautiful town, plenty to do. Food was good and not too much of a party scene."
Alum,4,"I enjoyed my time at Keuka College. I met a lot of wonderful people. It is very diverse and you meet people from all over the world, such as Africa, China, Vietnam, etc. And the view just cant be beat."
Senior,4,"My experience at Keuka College has been great! I have learned so much and made so many friends that I will keep in touch with for a lifetime. One of my favorite things about Keuka College is that it is a small campus and everyone you see is a familiar face. You are likely to develop a personal bond with most/all of your professors, and your professors know you by name, you're not just a number. If you are struggling in one of your classes, you can go to your professors office hours and get all of the help you need. Your professors set you up for success, not for failure. The campus is small and everything is within walking distance, which is really nice, especially when you're in a hurry. The college tries their best to offer activities for you to keep you busy, and of course, the lake being right in your backyard is a huge benefit!"
Sophomore,4,"I liked that all of the teachers took time out to meet with students and help them achieve their goals. I like that both students and teachers were involved in several activities on campus. The school provides students with lots of on campus space to study with a group of friends or just work in piece in quiet. It is very hard to get an on campus job, wish there were more spots available. The parking situations at Keuka is inconvenient ecspecially in the winter. I also think there should be more food options at the geiser."
College Sophomore,4,i actually played basketball on the team. it was a great experience
College Junior,4,My school is wonderful. We have dedicated teachers who want to see their students succeeded
College Sophomore,4,On campus parties are tons of fun
College Sophomore,4,I feel like they could be approved in a way but are very good. (some classes are just too easy)
College Sophomore,4,Idk how to review this
College Sophomore,4,Awesome up to date equipment.
College Junior,4,"This school has its downs, yes, but it also has its ups. I do love the location, most of the professors, and the greatest friends I have made here. There are areas that need improving in this school involving parking, sports, etc., but we have a diverse campus filled with people who want to be a part of the college community."
College Junior,4,"We have a good security system on our campus, but could be improved in areas. The counseling services are great, they make sure students know to come to them for any thing they may need, even just for stress in classes, etc."
College Junior,4,"I love this school, but recently they have disappointed me and a lot of other students, but making decisions, too many, too fast, and wanting to make this school bigger when a lot of the students came here for the small community. Yet, I still do like this school and most of their professors, the location is also great!"
College Freshman,4,"Everything about the school from academics to the social life is pretty great. When in need of help, it is easy to speak directly to the professor due to the fact that there is such a small amount of students in one classroom."
College Freshman,4,The fan support at keuka college is extraordinary you see a lot of students attending events all the time and the school spirit is breathtaking to see how proud everyone is to be wearing their college appeal or even the school colors.
Recent Alumnus,4,I already have a job but will pursue graduate courses
Recent Alumnus,4,Keuka College is unique in its ability to obtain a reputable college degree primarily online with once a week gatherings for class. The professors are experts in their field and WANT you to succeed. They have such great positive attitudes which makes it inevitable that you will make it through the courses and thrive in your clinical experiences.
College Senior,4,"Career prospects are very good. Many students have job offers before they graduate, especially in certain programs. Internships are fairly easy to set up and there is an enormous alumni network."
College Senior,4,"Classes are generally well run and objectives are generally well expressed. Policy for written work is clearly expressed in the syllabi and are fair. Most classes are on campus, very little online classes are present."
College Senior,4,"Small class sizes, good teacher to student ratios, helpful feedback on assignments is present."
College Sophomore,4,Keuka provides many different opportunities for programs outside of college which is something I really enjoy. It is extremely important to have a degree so you can experience the career you love. The advisors do an an amazing job helping new students feel welcome and help them with the application process as best as they can.
College Sophomore,4,Keuka is known for having such successful sports teams. I really enjoy all the different options that Keuka offers. I have many friends that play on sports teams. They really enjoy the coaches because they push them to grow into becoming a better athlete.
College Senior,4,I like the athletics at Keuka. but it could be better
College Freshman,4,Library and lake are beautiful for studying their is always a great view. Registration is HELL! professors and curriculum is average never enough classes offered
College Freshman,4,Everyone is accepting. Great for LGBT and racial diversity
College Freshman,4,I mean a lot of people drink and do recreational activities but there is no peer pressure
College Freshman,4,"The freshmen live about a half mile away from campus up quite a big hill- it is horrible in the winter, if you want to pay extra once you are an upper classmen it is worth it."
College Freshman,4,"At Keuka College, they give you to do yearly Field Period Experiences which give you real life opportunities to see your profession in the real world."
College Freshman,4,"I have never had a problem with being assaulted, and I've only heard of one person being sexually assaulted on campus."
College Freshman,4,"There have been a few issues on campus so far this year, and according to other people, Campus Safety has not been very helpful during those situations. I have not had to deal with Campus Safety but I'm sure they do what they can to make sure everyone is safe on campus."
College Freshman,4,"The bathrooms aren't the best, and sometimes the heat and other things doesn't work in the rooms, but overall, they are nice."
College Freshman,4,I chose the school because it was the only school with my major close to home but then I changed my major. I would have decided to attend this college even if it was not the only school with the major.
College Junior,4,"The academics are the biggest part of keuka. Your school work comes first in alsmot instance, no matter is you okay sports or in a club"
College Junior,4,Every professor I have had has been helpful and full of knowledge. I've never had a bad experience with a professor
College Junior,4,"The school offers great experiences for experiential learning and internships and offers a great guide to get those positions. The professors are friendly, accessible and are concerned about thier students. There is a small town feel to the school, everyone knows everyone."
College Junior,4,The professors in the social work program are the best.  They are very passionate about the field and are alway available to help when needed.
College Junior,4,I have been to main campus a couple of times for class and have found it a great experience
College Junior,4,Keuka college is a credited school for the social work program.  They find your internship placement for you and are very supportive
College Junior,4,Everything is close together in a small area.
College Junior,4,The classes held at another college for convience is great
College Junior,4,The ASAP programs provide opportunities for adults to complete BA without traveling long distances. Great communication!
College Freshman,4,"Overall, I am happy with my decision to go to Keuka College. The college is private, small, and holds everything that I want to learn. They have not only a fantastic criminal justice program, but they also produce well respected American Sign Language interpreters.

The teachers are also very willing to help the students learn and the school also has paid positions for student tutors. I am glad that I chose Keuka College and would not pick another school if I had to go through the college acceptance process again."
College Freshman,4,I thoroughly enjoy attending Keuka College. Both teachers and students are kind and outgoing.
College Freshman,4,"The strictness is perfect, I feel that I can have fun but am still in a safe environment and can get help if I need it."
College Freshman,4,It went very smoothly and they were always available to answer questions.
College Freshman,4,We have good sportsmanship and I am glad to be apart of a team.
College Freshman,4,The process is easy and effective
College Freshman,4,"The resident buildings are kept very clean, and under control."
Junior,2,"As an adult student studying at a satellite campus, I do not feel very connected to Keuka College. In addition, our student advisor has changed three times in the year and a half I have been here, though I will say the most recent has been much more accessible than the first."
College Senior,2,"Certain buildings lack amenities like air conditioning and temperature control, making living conditions sometimes intolerable. Conditions of the rooms are poor with peeling and chipping paint. Noise in some dorm rooms can become unbearable."
College Sophomore,2,They're is not any Greek Life at Keuka due to the school being private. I believe they should have Greek Life to give students the experience of being a member of a fraternity/sorority.
College Senior,2,Everything is very poor especially the staff.
College Freshman,2,"Never any transportation, No greek life so harder to find parties. If there is a party it is usually invite only."
College Junior,2,"Drugs are used, but there isn't a major drug scene on campus"
College Freshman,2,Very few and so overcrowded.
College Freshman,2,The food needs to be better prepared.
College Junior,2,"Its not really a party school, most people that come here come for their education."
College Freshman,2,"Keuka College does not have a Greek life, there are no fraternities or sororities for this college."
College Freshman,2,"If you want food off campus you either drive 5 miles or have them deliver.  Penn Yan is a small city, so there is your typical pizza places, Chinese, etc."
College Junior,2,The school policies are very strict. It was difficult to get away with what most find is harmless.
College Junior,2,"In my opinion, the town is too small for me. The town has many amish communities and you can feel the ""amish vibe"" throughout the town. There is a lot of country, which is beautiful to look at, but I prefer a bigger city. "
College Junior,2,"When I attended Keuka College from 2007-2009, I remember the parking being terrible. There were color coded permits and you were only allowed to park in your designated spot. I hated it."
College Sophomore,2,"Our school is in the middle of nowhere. If you want to do something, it has to be on campus."
College Junior,2,In the fall semester the weather is awful with the wind and snow. But in the Spring it is nice to go outside and hang out on the lake.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is wokring to be accredited in several areas including education, criminal justice and business.   I was in business.   Unfortulatly, the classes DID NOT prepare me for the work place, many of the professors did not care about me, and the school tried to forget me and the alumi office was no help.   

I hate to leave a bad review, but 4 years and nearly $100,000 (25 grand per year) later, they have ignored me and rejected my phone calls and emails for assistance in using the alumni network after I lost my job and was looking for a new one."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I have been able to go on and get a fairly decent job.  However, due to the economy I was laid off and Keuka College REFUSED to help me at all get a job, or access the ""amazing"" alumi network.   I wasn't even offered an interview for a job on campus after I graduated and was an alumi.   TERRIBLE SCHOOL.  DO NOT ATTEND KEUKA COLLEGE"
College Junior,2,"Don't get too sick or else you'll have to see a real local doctor, off-campus."
College Junior,2,The parking situation is average. I don't like how there is limited parking on campus. most of the parking is located all the way up in the davis lot. parking is limited ont he actual campus grounds.
Niche User,1,"I was interested in their social work program, but before I was even registered or in seat Keuka was already drawing out student loans in my name. They were required to refund that money to me, but now I have student loan debt for a college I never even attended. Intuition cost are outrageous and extremely high."
Sophomore,1,"The food gives us food poisoning, there’s no actual parking, they almost never let anyone live off campus and force us to therefore live in overcrowded dorms (tripled in davis) with bug problems and force us to get an overpriced meal plan for food we can’t eat without risking getting sick. Also check your blue lights (emergency lights) they’re broken for months at a time and the doors to davis we’re unlocked 24/7 for months before campus safety noticed. Also stop covering up sexual assaults and all the other stuff you cover up, own up to it and stop trying to have a perfect image. -A Fellow Student"
Graduate Student,1,I highly recommend never considering Keuka for a grad school. The employees and advisors are so unhelpful. They rushed me into a program last minute which I was grateful for but forgot to mention really important details and extra requirements. Halfway through my first semester they told me I would need to take a bunch of additional classes that were never mentioned prior to me signing my enrollment contract. I was extremely upset and the additional requirements did not work with my schedule or my financial ability. Had I known ahead of time I would have never even started the program.
College Senior,1,Keuka needs alot of improvement. Very racist school.
College Senior,1,We don't have greek life
College Senior,1,Keuka College could be a better college is there was more diversity
College Freshman,1,Parties at the sports house and off campus are the way to go
College Freshman,1,"We have no type of Greek life, which is a bummer because its a major part of college"
College Junior,1,"When I made a ethical decision to report numerous violations of the NASW Code of Ethics at an internship the internship was terminated. I was applauded for my courage. Then I was just thrown into another internship without say. The internship was a poor fit. I expressed my concern numorous times. Instead of having meetings with college faculty, the internship site supervisor and myself there were backdoor meeting and decisions without my knowledge. Ultimately I has to be moved to stop progress status. I was never defended by the college faculty or ask to explain my experience and thoughts. This demonstrates that while the college is quick to use the NASW Code of Ethics and its competencies to judge students it fails to practice them themselves."
College Freshman,1,It is the worst because we don't have one
College Junior,1,There is no Greek life on campus
College Freshman,1,THERE IS NOTHING OUT HERE
College Freshman,1,"There's nothing around here. The nearest place to get an apartment would be Geneva, thirty minutes away."
College Freshman,1,Not any night life at all.
College Junior,1,"I only remember a P&C (now Tops), a McDonalds, Dunkin Donuts, Pizza Hut, and a pizza place. There was also a couple diners. I would have loved to see a higher-star restaurant, but the town is too small. You have to drive to Geneva to eat somewhere decent, especially for a modern restaurant and something that is not a chain."
College Senior,1,"The department of campus housing is terrible. The people are terrible, and theydont care much about the students needs."
College Junior,1,"Everything is so far, only thing that is open after 10pm is dunkin"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Although to a certain extent, the academics where ok, the professors were so overworked they had no time for individual care of students or for one on one meetings.  

After graduating, I got a good job, but due to the economy I lost it.  I went back to the alumni association for help finding a job with their large ""network""  I received no help.  In fact was told they didn't have time for me and to go away.  Very say after I gave them four years and nearly $100,000"
Recent Alumnus,1,"The F is necessary.
The security is actually really nice, so not much of a threat, and most are over 60 years old.   

Health is REDICULOUS.  If you have a cold or a bad cut, campus health is NEVER open.  I had to go to to the local hospital for any health issues."
Recent Alumnus,1,Transportation is virtually non existant.  Having a car is only for upper classmen and then the parking pass costs a FORTUNE each semester.  Parking and transportation is TERRIBLE
Recent Alumnus,1,"The college is very strict on letting in alcohol, which I think is a good thing.  However, if you are of age, they make you out to be a criminal for bringing a 6 pack to your joke of a dorm room.  

School polices are very tight. Even hanigng up a poster for a club event is such a rediculous hassle"
Recent Alumnus,1,Terrible outdated computers when I graduated.  Not a MAC to be seen anywhere.  Old.  Slow.  Outdated.   They get an F in my book
Recent Alumnus,1,"Very few options off campus.  There is a pizza hut and a chinese place.  Thats it unless its bar food and you have to be 21 to get that.  Beautiful setting, but not much in the way of dinning out unless you travel over 30 minutes to Geneva or Canandiauga."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Penn Yann is an adorable little town on the lake.  Unfortuanltely, the locals hate the college students and hold a grudge against them.   There is little to do, and there is no night life close to the school that you can walk, take a taxi and there are not busses.  

There are no major grocery stores.  No malls less than an hour away."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Very little diversity.  if you want to learn about other counties and cultures, do not go to Keuka College.  Although they have strong ties with China, don't let that fool you.   Pretty much all stuck up white chicks.  As a white female, its sad to say that, but its very true.  With a predominatly female population on campus, the cattyness is incredible and very frustraiting."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Many of the staff in the dinning room and in housing are really very nice.  However, the dinning room closes at 8.  There are liminted choices.  Not only that, but the library is  JOKE.   Old, smells like mold, and the newest books are from 1970."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I have been both a student and an employee of Keuka College, and so was my mother.  I had an extreme amount of loyalty and was very proud to call Keuka College my alma matter.  However, during my time there I was reputedly ignored by advisors and nearly didn't graduate due to a simple clerical error the faculty refused to review.  I was also in the work study program for four years.   After graduation I was denied employment for an unknown reason even though I was very qualified and no one would talk with me regarding the position or my application.   

Housing and parking at campus is a joke.  The dorms are terrible, outdated and the desks are barley big enough to hold a computer and printer.  Just overerall terrrible.  I thought it was worth it to receive the individualized attendion from professors, but the don't care either.  Some do, but there is little they can do because they are overworked and underpaid they have no time to give you the individual attention the school says it provides.  

I am very saddened to say this institution has lost its morals over the years.  I would not recommend to work here nor would I recommend attending Keuka College for higher education.   Im say to say, but TERRIBLE SCHOOL.  DO NOT GO HERE"
Recent Alumnus,1,In many cases you can't receive finanacial aid if you live off campus.  Rediculous
College Junior,1,Bring your own car or expect to be stuck in town for like 6-8 hours.
College Sophomore,1,"Really difficult to get off-campus housing. Especially if you have a scholarship. It's annoying, and doesn't even seem worth while."
College Junior,1,"The purchase, possession, use, sale, or distribution of narcotics or illegal drugs is prohibited. It is the 
College’s firm belief that the illegal use of drugs is inconsistent with the educational process. 
Any person using or dealing in illegal drugs is considered to be conducting an activity which endangers

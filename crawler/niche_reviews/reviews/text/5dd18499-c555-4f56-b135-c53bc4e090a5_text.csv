Junior,5,This is a great school that prepares students for full time ministry in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. It has great professors who care about each student and trains them very well to accomplish their tasks in the synod. The campus has a great environment and opportunities for extra-curriculars and social events.
Junior,5,The overall experience was amazing! This is a college that truly cares about the students and their futures.
Junior,5,The professors worked with us so well during these uncertain times and transferring online. The online experience was smooth and communication was excellent.
Sophomore,5,One of the best school atmospheres I have ever been a part of. It is a great and beautiful campus with very nice people and historic buildings.
Sophomore,5,"With the switch to online learning in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, the professors adjusted well and for the most part, it was business as usual."
Freshman,5,"I like the homeliness that MLC has to offer. As a first-year student, I felt welcomed by my peers, professors, and other grades within the student body. Being able to surround myself with people that share the same faith as me in these times is comforting, even if it's done virtually."
Freshman,5,"Most people here are genuinely nice, students and professors alike. I really enjoy being surrounded by God's Word every day.  Updated facilities would be one nice change."
Sophomore,5,"Martin Luther College is truly a home away from home. While there are flaws, as at all schools, I was immediately impressed by the friendly atmosphere, the dedication to education and ministry, and the amazing opportunities offered there. An extensive team of educators and staff work side by side with the students to offer the best possible experience while at school and ensure a bright, steadfast future as pastors, teachers, and staff ministers."
Junior,5,"I am entering my third year at MLC. The approach at MLC provides students with many opportunities and experiences to observe and practice in classroom settings. After my first 2 years at MLC, I have already grown greatly in my confidence and excitement for my future ministry."
Sophomore,5,It is a family atmosphere. everyone cares about everyone. The professors actually care about you and your grades because they want to see you succeed. You are always close to most of the people at the college. They have great programs for those who want to go into public ministry or education.
Freshman,5,The camaraderie that comes with a college entirely devoted to the service of God is not a blessing that is taken for granted here!
Freshman,5,"I love the environment and how kind the professors are. I love my school and look forward to the next three years. I am able to excel in my academics and have attained high honors. This is a special school for education, which is my major. They have the resources I need for my course of study. The campus life is eventful and very exciting. It is a small campus so everyone knows everyone and that is a great atmosphere."
Sophomore,5,"I love how everyone feels like a family. We all relatively worship under the same faith, which is a big unifying factor to this family feeling. Yes, every school has it's typical drama, but with our Christian mentality we can conquer it together rather than ignoring it.
The one thing I would change (if I could) would be to move MLC off the hill. Even better would be to move it to a warmer place!"
Junior,5,"The best part about Martin Luther College is all the personable professors. Professors at MLC genuinely care about your education. They take the time to get to know you and your strengths and weaknesses. Advisors also take the time to go over how you fit so far into your major. Professors will reach out to you via email, phone, or in person to see how you are doing if you miss class. If you need to take the time to get extra help, professors are more than ready to help you out with whatever you need. They will meet in their office or in the library, and most will even go beyond their office hours to help you. All professors are knowledgeable of the Bible and God's Word. This is important since we are getting educated to be Christian leaders and teachers. The campus is small and the student population is low, so you really get that one on one attention from a professor that every student desires.  I recommend this college to anyone seeking a career in Christian Education and Ministry."
Alum,5,"I attended Martin Luther College for five years and worked for them during that entire time including the summers. The faculty and staff are truly lovely and hard working. The courses were difficult, as college classes should be."
Sophomore,5,"I have completed my freshman year at Martin Luther College, and it exceeded my expectations. Being on a relatively small campus allows students to get to know each other easily and create strong friendships. I have enjoyed getting to know my classmates and see them shine in their extracurricular activities. The professors genuinely make time for each student and do what they can to make sure that students fully understand the coursework. The classes are challenging and have fed my desire to become a teacher. The best part of MLC is the bond you create with everyone there through your shared faith. The love for Christ is evident the second you walk on campus and engage in conversation with someone. From the professors, the students, and the other staff everyone is there to build you up and help you become the best pastor or teacher you can be."
Freshman,5,"I love MLC because not only am I receiving a great education from wonderful coring professors, but I am also living my life surrounded by people you believe the same things as me."
Freshman,5,I love Martin Luther College. It is a great place to meet friends that you will have for a life time. It also helps me learn everything I will need to know for my future as a teacher.
Alum,5,It is the best school in the world for preparing students to serve in public ministry in the WELS. The faculty is well-trained and caring.
Sophomore,5,"I love the friendly Christian atmosphere. If you are considering becoming a teacher or pastor in the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod, MLC will welcome you with open arms and guide you along the way to success."
Junior,4,Teachers did a great job of adapting to online learning during COVID-19 given the short time of preparation they had.
Junior,4,"I love this school. The professors are phenomenal, and the student life is thriving! My professors and faculty have always done their utmost to help me through anything I have struggled with, both academically and financially. The one thing I would like to see changed is the dorms. They are a little small and they are quite outdated... Other than that, this is the place to be!!!"
Freshman,4,"I love the small town culture. I love that the school is on top of the hill overlooking the city. I really enjoy being able to not have such big class sizes. We are a smaller college geared toward teachers, pastors, and staff ministers so you get lots of focus on you to help prepare you for your future."
Sophomore,4,It is a wonderful place to be surrounded by those of the same faith and learn to share the word of God with others.
Junior,4,"My experience has been very good with Martin Luther College since the time I was accepted. I have had some difficulties along my career path due to health problems, but MLC has always been working with me and providing support when needed."
Junior,4,"I'm a junior at Martin Luther College this year. If you're looking to find a Christian spouse, this is the place to be. There's the constant joke that MLC actually means 'Making Lutheran Couples'. We are a Lutheran college with three majors- education, staff ministry, or pastoral track. The professors here are terrific, and I believe the student-teacher ratio is quite low. Campus life is very personal- since we only have about 750 students, everyone knows everyone, and most have a relative that goes here, since its the WELS college. I really love my time here, and have made lifelong relationships. MLC is very Christ-centered and worth a look at. New Ulm, MN, where we are, is a town of about 14,000 people. But, if you need bigger cities, there is Mankato, a bigger town, just a half hour drive away, and the twin cities are only an hour and a half away."
Junior,4,"Martin Luther College is a school of close-knit individuals with a campus environment that just feels like home no matter where you go. With a small student body (generally around 700), Professors take a special interest in each of their students, and class sizes range from 8 to 30, which allows for in-depth discussions and almost personalized instruction. They are more than willing to help out their students financially in way they can, and provide a safe environment for students to grow in experience, knowledge, and their faith through fantastic classes and field opportunities."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year in college, I had the experience of playing football at the college level.  However, I did receive two injuries I would not change the experience for anything.  The team and coaches were both great.  This school makes you feel welcome from the time you step on campus.  This is a close campus and everyone is family.  I am have the best year of school.  My grades are better then they have ever been and I owe that to the professors.  Thank you for a great experience."
Sophomore,4,"Martin Luther College is a great place to grow in your faith and get to meet friends for the rest of your life. The professor's are very approachable and willing to help. I think that the school should advertise more the other majors available not just education or pastor. We also have Chemistry, English, Physical Education, Social Studies, and more! The price of the school is very affordable when looking at other colleges."
College Freshman,4,I love the fact that we are a big family on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I feel extremely safe on this campus. There is very rarely an incident on this campus, basically never."
College Freshman,4,The professor's are very personable and willing to help students with anything they need help with.
College Freshman,4,A very high majority of people that graduate from MLC get jobs in their field of study right after graduation.
College Freshman,4,The dorms are very comfortable.
College Freshman,4,"I really appreciate how athletics is run, the equipment isn't always to the highest standards, but it the greatest that the school can do. It is just a lot of fun."
College Freshman,4,"MLC is a smaller school, but that is what makes is so great. Everyone basically knows everyone and the teachers really care about the students and how successful they are at school."
College Freshman,4,You will get a job coming out of college.  MLC has a great percentage of people who get jobs coming out of college.
College Freshman,4,The Professors at MLC truly care about your future.  The course variety is not so great but you can take the courses you need to get your degree. The style of class is perfect.  The sizes of classes are small which is helpful.
College Freshman,4,Housing costs are very low.  You get a great value for your money.
College Freshman,4,"Martin Luther College is a great fit for me.  Coming from a public school I never knew what it was like to have a Christian education.  I am very thankful for that.  If you are looking for a school where you will get God's Word every day, then MLC is perfect for you."
College Junior,4,"You will most likely get a call for a teacher or a seminary acceptance if you attend this school. However, you still have learning to do on your own that they don't teach you. And if you don't get a call, you can find a position in the public setting fairly easily."
College Freshman,4,"Everyone here is very friendly, a great christian environment."
College Junior,4,"House off-camps is pretty convenience. since it s small town, there isn't many violence, so it's been very safe."
College Junior,4,"There are restaurants near campus, but i don't really go out for fancy restaurants. Usually i just went out for MacDonald."
College Junior,4,"I don't usually go out for part so i really not sure. But party scene dose seems fine, and its very positive."
College Junior,4,"As a Lutheran member, i received 1000 free scholarship."
College Junior,4,"Usually, i went out to buy my own meal. But the meals in campus seem delicious."
College Sophomore,4,"Our dorms are pretty nice, We only have 4 buildings and a growing campus. No female students are able to live alone without medical consent because we just don't have room to not have roommates. The housing lottery is pretty fun and nerve-wracking. Even though you don't always end up near friends roaming wise, the campus is still small enough that you can see them all the time if you want to."
College Student,4,"The rules are strict, but at a Bible-based college they are appropriate."
College Student,4,Scholarships are easy to find and the financial aid office is very easy to talk to and helpful.
College Freshman,4,"The cafeteria on campus is pretty clean all the time. There are lots of different options to choose- from the main entrees to the salad, pizza, and pasta bars. The meal plan is included in our tuition so I can go as many times as I want. The cafeteria is open from 7 a.m. until midnight so if I need a snack I can just go over and grab a piece of fruit or a scoop of ice cream."
College Sophomore,4,"For a small school, the facilities are reasonable but there's room for much improvement."
College Sophomore,4,"There's the usual Perkins, Applebee's, McDonald's, and Burger King, and there is also some locally owned restaurants and coffee shops that are cute, reasonable, and yummy."
College Sophomore,4,"The policies established are necessary and are at a good level of strictness. Some things are handled more leniently which could be changed, but otherwise what is strict isn't so strict to the point of being annoying or a hassle though."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are a decent size for two beds and a futon. The bathrooms are large, but the showers are not consistently warm. They are either ""burning-your-skin"" hot or cold, but sometimes you can get lucky. There are tons of places to study and do homework alone or in groups all across campus. The campus is a great size; you can easily walk to all buildings on the campus from your dorm room, and there are enough people enrolled that you don't feel like you know everybody. The social atmosphere is always friendly from both students and professors. Martin Luther College's chapel is beyond amazing and includes morning and evening services/devotions every week day which is a huge benefit. Love the place!"
College Sophomore,4,Pretty up to date. Small classes. Easy professor access.
College Freshman,4,"It's hard, but definitely worth the hard workload. I admit that I don't always take advantage of the study hours, but I do work hard when it counts. I love it."
College Freshman,4,"Lot's of German diners (New Ulm is known for being German) and German shops, but there is a nice variety of other types of cuisine, from olive garden to applebees to chineese restaurants. It's great"
College Freshman,4,"If you are preparing to be a pastor, this is the place to do it. That's my major. But if you want to become a math teacher or any kind of teacher, this is not the best place to do it. You will get a good education here however."
College Freshman,4,"Workload is hard, but it prepares you greatly for your calling and helps mature you. Faculty is great, unlike my high school."
College Sophomore,4,"The purpose of Martin Luther College is to train future pastors and teachers for the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod (WELS), so it follows that the most important building on campus is the chapel. MLC's current chapel was built about ten years ago. It is a beautiful, box-shaped building with marvelous acoustics and a spectacular organ, rich with Christian symbolism. Aside from the chapel, the rest of the buildings on campus are alright - not bad, but not nearly as good as those at public universities."
College Sophomore,4,"The people at Martin Luther College are awesome. Everyone is of the same religious faith, which connects everyone at a deeper level. However, the small campus sometimes causes cliqueiness."
College Freshman,4,All of the professors here are knowledgeable in their field of teaching. Registration process is simple. There are many different fields of study within the Education major.
College Freshman,4,"I personally think that it is great, but many would disagree. The only thing we have available on campus is our cafeteria. What makes our cafeteria unique is that it is open from 7am to 12am on Monday through Friday and just during meal hours on Saturday and Sunday. We have unlimited ""swipes"", which means we can go into the cafeteria as many times as we want to."
College Freshman,4,"It is fairly easy to get into MLC. For spanish you have to be a dedicated student. There is a lot of work that goes into it, so you really have to be willing to work. There is nothing abnormal about the process."
College Freshman,4,"The academic part of MLC is wonderful. For spanish, the workload is very intense and it takes a lot of time. But you learn a lot while doing your homework. I really enjoy the professor and my class."
College Freshman,4,I am very happy with my elementary and secondary spanish  education major. I would do the same thing again if I could do it over. I would like to one day teach spanish in a high school classroom.
College Freshman,4,"The cafeteria is open all day, till 12am. It is very convenient for a busy class schedule. The food is generally good. There is always a variety of choices as well."
College Freshman,4,The good thing about the weather here is that the seasons actually change. The fall is beautiful. In Winter it gets fairly chilly though.
College Freshman,4,Parking is $80 for the year which is not too bad. There is plenty of parking. Upperclassmen usually get the best spots.
College Freshman,4,The campus is very dafe. There has never been a time where I felt unsafe. There is security that walk around campus too at night.
College Freshman,4,The college is strict on following the rules around here. It's a good thing to keep students in check.
College Senior,4,"The college is small yet beautiful, the landscape is gorgeous and the lake with two gazebos by it adds a little serenity to the place. There is more than adequate parking and plenty to do on campus to keep you busy. Fining a job in the community is easy and the nearest mall is 30 min away. Everyone knows everyone. People can be either laid back or stuck up its about a 50/50 mix. The teachers either really care or are stuck up too. Room size is slightly larger than average and the music program here is exceptional. The chapel is the centerpiece hosting 1200 people + and fridge cold are in summer and heat in winter. The cafeteria is open for an amazing 17+ hours on weekdays and has two glass atriums to the outside were you may enjoy your food. Its athletic field is a little small and there is not a lot of fun activities to do off campus. It is a dry campus."
College Sophomore,4,"God is first, academic are second.  All of my professor are extremely accomplished and intelligent.  Many have done mission work through out the world.  I will be an extremely well rounded student when i graduate."
College Freshman,4,Martin Luther college is a great place to be. It has many opportunities for each student and is safe. I love it here.
College Sophomore,4,"It's Good for the Most Part! MLC is truly a very unique college. There are few kids (around 800) and students are preparing solely for a career in the public ministry. Overall, the education is of high-quality and the relationship between students and professors is very strong. I decided to study Spanish in college and the Spanish program here is very good!"
College Sophomore,4,"$ for Pastors and Teachers – MLC is an institution for future teachers and pastors. Many grants and scholarships are awarded to students who are pursuing a career in the public ministry, or teaching and preaching the gospel. For example, I received a ""ministry scholarship"", which is awarded to students who show strong candidacy for the ministry, but do not have the best grades, however. Overall, I guess you could say paying for college here at MLC is somewhat of a ""team effort"" but the smarter students are definitely favored, as you will find just about anywhere. That leaves little money for students who are ""average""."
College Sophomore,4,"The Right Hand of the Law – The Martin Luther College guide book is full of many strict rules and policies to keep students safe. Seeing as it is a private college, the problems that exist at other colleges are not as prevalent at MLC. They use the bible as the ultimate ruling hand, and it shows in the way students and faculty handle themselves."
College Sophomore,4,"Jump! Jump! Jump! Martin Luther College is not at all known for their ability to play sports. However, we as students don't seem to mind. We view sports as a way to bond with fellow classmates and cheer on our friends on the court. Instead of cheerleaders, a group of seniors write hilarious skits to put on in front of the crowds during time-outs that really encourage crowd involvement. Martin Luther College also has a fantastic work out center that is open from 7 AM to midnight every day. The staff  really emphasizes the importance of exercise as a part of daily life as well."
College Freshman,4,"There is a wide variety of students at MLC. We have all races including students from Korea and China.  Students come from all over the States.  There is normally more girls here than guys, because it is Education/Ministry school."
College Sophomore,2,There is like no partying that's worth going to. COS or DEX stink and are just people drinking off campus
College Freshman,2,I hate the winter and snow!
Niche User,1,"Only care about money. if you have aomeone in the WELS you will have a good time, if not then they don't care about you. Tutors and RAs are not around, do not help you, RAs get free room+board even thought they are always late for a job where they do nothing. Charge you full tuition for student teaching when they do nothing. If your host family sends your money back to MLC to give back to you they will keep it. Let students drink and do drugs underage with no punishment but a small fine. Spend tons of sports and campus aesthetics rather than ehat students actually need. They look good on the outside to get you in the door and once they have your money they don't care."
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek life at Martin Luther College, unless you consider Greek class Greek life."
College Junior,1,"We don't have Greek life unless you count the teacher track and pastor track groups that throw parties a few times a year. So, if you want to join a fraternity, don't look here."
College Sophomore,1,"All Germans for the Most Part. A huge portion of the student body is German because it is a Lutheran institution. Therefore, many of the students come from ""area Lutheran"" high schools that are typically small and not diverse at all."

Freshman,5,"Professors try their best to make the online classes memorable. Because Penn State Greater Allegheny is a small campus, most of the classes are in-person and there are only few Zoom classes online. If a student wishes online classes, the professors have the necessities to make it possible."
Freshman,5,"This is a great school with a small and efficient campus. The professors and instructors are involved with students, and they all want to everyone to succeed. Besides the instructors, all of the housing and student service are super nice."
Sophomore,5,"I love going to Greater Allegheny! If you’re looking for a cute, small campus life, it’s definitely the place for you. The student community center is great for studying with friends or just hanging out. Walking around campus is quick but you also get scenery in your walks. There are so many resources if you need anything at all and faculty and staff are always around to ask questions to. Take advantage of office hours and having excellent professors. The only complaint I have is about scheduling classes and be prepared that some classes that you need could be cancelled which means you’ll have to make up for them sometime in another semester. Always check your suggested academic plan and be prepared when talking to your advisor is another thing my peers have had issues with. Overall, can’t wait to continue my degree here!"
Senior,5,"Faculty really cares about their students and wants to help them succeed. The small class sizes allow for students to feel like more than just a number in a class, they are seen, heard and cared for."

Niche User,5,"Penn State Greater Allegheny (PSUGA or GA) is a small melting pot of diversity on the west side of the state. My two years here were great. There were about 11 clubs, but we could always create one, and there was plenty of opportunities to get involved in activities, committees or community service"

College Sophomore,5,The computer lab is readily available and very up to date with modern equipment.

College Freshman,5,"I usually don't even consider race an issue, but in the dorms, I believe that African-American students outnumber students of other races. There's a small group of Asian students as well. As far as students that commute, there's more white students. As far as politics or religion go, I don't discuss much of either, and don't care for either. Sexual orientation is always an issue for me and I wouldn't feel comfortable being open about my sexuality off campus, atleast not yet."
College Freshman,5,there is always computers around if you need them with mulitple computer labs and laptops out for rent. computers varying from MAC to HP.
College Freshman,5,"An Awesome Experience – Pennsylvania is a state full of life and pride. The same is said for Penn State Greater Allegheny, the faculty and students are very close and have a genuine interest for each other. Every true ""Pittsburgher"" love the Steelers. It s definitely the place to visit."
College Sophomore,5,The Police Are Just Like Friends – at our campus there are REAL police officers that protect us.  They are soooo friendly they will stop to talk to you at anytime. students are provided with their number so we can have access to them 24/7. the officers will drive you to your dorm if it's late and you're afraid to walk up the hill. One time I got stuck Downtown Pittsburgh and one of the officers even offered to come and pick me up!
College Freshman,5,Number 1 Pick of Corporate Recruiters – Wall Street Journal ranked Penn State students as number one for graduates best prepared and most able to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, classes ran pretty much how they did in person and I still got the same learning. Online is different than in person so it just takes some time to adjust. Some professors don’t acknowledge this though. Keep doing your work and asking for help and you will maximize what you get out of online learning."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my experience with Penn State GA. It was a great, Goldilocks type campus that wasn't too small, or too big; but just right. It really made my college experience memorable to have such amazing professors that treated you like an individual. Even though it was memorable, it wasn't always in a good way. My Penn State GA advisor for my major gave me the wrong plan and I ended up having to go back an extra semester for one French III course that I didn't know I had to take. Penn State paid for me to go back, but because I was no longer considered a full-time student, my loans came due as soon as I received my degree. Not always the best choice, but definitely a good choice if you are staying near the Pittsburgh area and want a medium sized campus."
Senior,4,"I liked the small campus feel and the opportunities for one on one with professors. As a commuter, I did not have all of the opportunities to be involved in on campus activities that I would have if I were a resident instead. Overall it is a nice campus and a great community."
Freshman,4,I liked Penn State Greater Allegheny because the campus was small enough to where you knew many people and its easy to get around to classes.
Recent Alumnus,4,Most of the classes are challenging in a good way. They course work is manageable as long as you stay on top everything.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Police services were always available when I ever contacted them. They also were very eager to be a part of the campus community, even participating in different programs/events."

Recent Alumnus,4,The class sizes made it easier to get more one on one attention.
College Sophomore,4,Penn State is a great family college.
College Freshman,4,"i have enjoyed Penn State GA .  i have met a lot  of great people, the professors are helpful and understanding.   I play on the Mens Soccer team and this has helped me reach out and meet other students not only from soccer but other sports.  Overall experience has been good."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Penn State Greater Allegheny is a great way to experience college, especially if you're looking for more one-on-one learning experiences."
College Sophomore,4,"The school offers a variety of courses. The student activities bring everyone together. The teachers there are strict but understanding. If I had to, I would choose to attend this school again for the many opportunities it offers its students."
College Freshman,4,The scholarship. They give them out to whom has the best grades or gpa
College Freshman,4,The Wrestling team could use some help.
College Freshman,4,Everything is great so far.

Recent Alumnus,4,Penn State is the number one recruiter in the country!
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors who teach at Greater Allegheny are fabulous!
Recent Alumnus,4,"I live at home and commute to campus, which is about a ten minute drive. I like the convenience of the closeness to campus while saving money by living at home."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't know everything because I am still learning myself but for the most part the academics are top notch. Since I go to a branch campus of Penn State their is no limit or restriction when it comes to pursuing a career. All the Penn States require the same prerequisites and whatever courses any student is trying to take they offer them at every Penn State campus. Every student that has a ""elion"", a website for Penn State students are notified about everything that is going on with registration, financial aid and anything else possible that students have questions about. According to the work study programs they help tremendously for students that are away from home and need money. It also is a learning process so students are prepared to enter the real life."
College Sophomore,4,"I could explain this to you in so many ways but one way would be very caring. I say caring because students are notified when jobs are hiring, the criteria for the job, and the steps you need to take to help land that job."
College Sophomore,4,"The college I attend is Penn State Greater Allegheny, the campus is unexpectedly great and their are so many activities and opportunities' that some students don't seem to recognize or really pay attention to. We have a shuttle that runs often but the times students want to be out they aren't available. The campus is about 15 minutes away from a shopping center, and everything else isn't to far. Students have the opportunity to join the different clubs and activities that are available to us. The sports teams are more that decent and they also get pretty intense during the semesters. Overall the campus and the surroundings benefit the students in everyway possible."
College Senior,4,"The diversity on campus is pretty great. I wish there was greater sexual orientation diversity. If there already is then it's not easy to tell. The celebration of diversity could be better, but overall diversity is pretty nice on campus."
College Senior,4,I think everything as far as strictness is where it should be for a college campus.
College Senior,4,I think there is decent security on campus and assistance for students who want or need it when it comes to health and safety.
College Senior,4,"For the most parts my experience has been pretty good. I've had some professors that I'm not too fond of, but it is obvious that generally the professors care about their students."
College Senior,4,The worst part about campus dinning is the lack of late night food options. Especially for students in night classes and who live in the residence hall.
College Sophomore,4,Have not had to do an internship. will be doing in my last semester
College Freshman,4,"Parking is completely free! Being that there is an excessively big hill between the academic buildings and the residence hall, it becomes quite a necessity to own a car when the pavement becomes icy and hazardous."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is strict in enforcing necessary policies to ensure the safety of the students and their wellbeing. It is not overly strict in allowing the students their freedom. The campus is very supportive in the endeavors of the students and does everything in its power to support the students. So if you find you have a passion for something and there isn't a club for it, you can create your own! And if you feel like the campus is too boring and would like to host an event, you can!"
College Freshman,4,"We have THON! THON is the largest student run philanthropy in the world and this year I am happy to say that I was a part of it. There is no place you will ever see such school spirit, love, and devotion all combined into a 46 hour dance marathon for kids with cancer and the Four Diamonds Fund. This year Penn State raised $13,343,517.33 for the kids!"
College Freshman,4,"The entire staff of police are wonderful in their efforts to maintain campus safety and security. However, on late nights it would be nice for an escort up the hill. Most of the time they do not oblige to that which saddens me. For someone who works nights, it would be nice to know that the campus security is willing to see a student arrive to the dorms safely. Walking up the hill all alone is quite scary, and I am no fan of the dark which makes it worse. I usually rely on the comfort of a friend or family member's voice on the line of my phone to keep me from breaking into a run back to the dorms."
College Freshman,4,There is a gym and fitness center. There are computer labs and libraries. 
College Freshman,4,The professors here are very helpful. The register process is easy. There are tutors here that help with homework and studying skills. 
College Freshman,4,I believe that my school is excellent for freshman 
College Freshman,4,Athletics are a big part of campus life but not the only thing. Clubs and academics are important as well.
College Freshman,4,Campus is very diverse. There are students from many different states and countries. 
College Freshman,4,The student community center is very modern and a great place to hang out.
Recent Alumnus,2,No a big party campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,Aside from programming provided by the campus there isn't always much to do unless you have a car.
College Sophomore,2,The teachers never respond to emails. The courses are all the same.
College Freshman,2,"Im not sure, but i know there were a few avaliable off housing apartments"
College Freshman,2,Parties suck there lol. If just want to sit in the dark for a couple hours be my guess
College Freshman,2,I never really eat on campus because the food isn't all that great. I have special diet needs that the campus does not meet.
College Student,2,Too small for the money.
College Student,2,"It's next to a high school, not much variety."
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have a greek life at our school, because I guess no one really came with the idea even though it's a small campus."
College Senior,2,"The Greater Allegheny campus is close to Pittsburgh but the transportation to city is nonexistent during the week. This is very bad for students living on campus. And, the direct area of the campus, Mckeesport is not very lively or enjoyable at all for students."
College Senior,2,"Every year has been a struggle with financial aid. It's probably one of the most stressful parts about college. I'm not fond of everyone in the financial aid office, and have been put in some very bad positions financially because of individuals in the financial aid office. There are not enough scholarships given out by the university, and not enough assistance given to students by the government."
College Senior,2,Most of the nightlife scenes are too far from the campus so they aren't really experienced. I believe this leads to more underage drinking on the campus.
College Student,2,It would be nice if no students used drugs but that's not the case.
College Freshman,2,There are not alot of majors available here. You will most likely have to switch campuses.
College Freshman,2,"I don't think that most of my ""professors"" have teaching degrees. It's pretty obvious in their teaching ability. In my opinion, most aren't qualified for college acedemics. The faculty isn't very efficient when it comes to what is best for me. They aren't concerned with working with my schedule to make appointments or meetings so I just don't try to schedule anymore. It's a hassel and a complete waste of time to try to schedule meetings with them. The best anyone can do there is give me the name and number or email address of someone else to talk to. Speaking of scheduling, finding classes I needed at reasonable times was an absolute nightmare this semester! I cannot wait to transfer to the main campus... Or really any other campus at this point."
College Sophomore,2,I was given a fair amount of aid. To receive more I'd say that I need to talk with the people who work in financial aid and keep my GPA as high as possible.
College Senior,2,"Not Awesome – I never had to live in the dorms, but I've seen them.  They are not very nice.  Very small, and the showers are just as bad.  There is only one food court and the food is alright depending on what they are making that day."
College Freshman,2,"Life on Campus – It is pretty boring to live on campus, everybody usually tries to get off campus or find something fun to do. The most fun thing that I do on campus is play pool in between classes in the community center, or play video games in my dorm. The gym right outside the dorms is very nice, and I use it almost daily. I do like that the cost to attend the campus is cheaper than most, especially Penn State main. Most of the kids who go here are friendly, but sometimes people act too wild at night, on WEEKDAYS. People will be running the halls screaming, and nothing is usually done. I wouldn't care if this was on a weekend, as I'd be joining them."
College Freshman,2,Cold Winters – the winters in Pittsburgh are always very cold but the simple fact that the dorms are located on top of a very big steep hill make it hard to get to and from class when the weather is harsh.
College Freshman,2,Drinking for Fun – on campus alcohol is not tolerated although you will find many doing it out of being bored
Alum,1,The campus is an absolute travesty. The Penn State name should be ashamed to be associated with this place. Community college level facilities and faculty. I regret graduating from there and parting with any money at all that went towards the education. The only reasons at all to attend are cost and convenience.
Senior,1,"This school is just terrible! I mean with a capital T only because this small school refuses to listen to other students about the school itself. All it cares about is the amount of money it brings in and the more students it attracts. There are careless teachers that only about their checks and money. The atmosphere is terrible and there is not anything around the campus for students to do. If I would have ever known this beforehand, I would have never picked this school. Last but not least, DO NOT LIVE IN THE DORMS!"
College Sophomore,1,We do not have a greek life at my school.
College Sophomore,1,The teachers are terrible and the students are worse.  My advisor does not help me at all.
College Senior,1,"I live off campus and pay for an entire 1 bedroom apartment to myself for the prices they ask for a single room with PSU's ""off campus housing"". In addition I am engaged and my fiancé wouldn't be able to live with me if I went through their program since he doesn't go to Penn State. 0_0"
College Freshman,1,The students and staff are nice to you...on a good day.
College Sophomore,1,"The area that the school is in is pretty racist. It's right in the middle of McKeesport, PA and White Oak, PA."
College Sophomore,1,"Though not all student participate, it is very easy to get drugs into the school."
College Freshman,1,"Athletics at the GA campus is very poor due to the fact it is almost impossible to make it to the main campus to see any of the real games. there isnt a football team at this branch campus and the basketball team isnt very good, the only team that actually wins stuff is the baseball team"
College Freshman,1,"Noise Violations – The RA's are pretty big on noise violations, especially after quiet hours. Too many written ups can lead to losing housing. The flaw in this is that, we're college students, while it is understandable that people around us need the respect if they are sleeping, studying, etc, but the constant expectations for us to be quiet is a bit bizarre."
College Freshman,1,is a boring place to live. The city dont offer lots of fun for kids and the city is like a ghost town.

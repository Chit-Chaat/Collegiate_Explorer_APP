Junior,5,The professors have made this transition to online super easy and have been extremely helpful. A great experience overall.
Junior,5,Everyone is so friendly and helpful. They made this experience the easiest it could be as a transfer student.
Sophomore,5,"UMaine really feels like home. The food is not the greatest, but it's about average. The staff really seem to care about the students. I truly love the environment and the people are mostly really friendly."
Sophomore,5,"I enjoyed UMaine! It's the right choice to go to college, it's not overly expensive to live around the area, the teachers are nice, and it has an embracive student life. 10/10"
Sophomore,5,"I took five online classes at the University of Maine during the second half of the 2020 spring semester, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Most of my classes transitioned very smoothly to the online platforms (all but one, because of a professor I was not particularly a fan of). Although I found taking classes online to be more difficult than in person, because of my learning style and living situation, I think the transition was very smooth considering the circumstances."
Sophomore,5,"I am in love with the University of Maine campus. There is never a shortage of activities happening on campus. Combined with the abundance of clubs and activities offered, it is so easy to feel involved in the community. The network of staff and students is very supportive and welcoming, and I have learned so much in all of my classes so far. I am proud to be a UMaine Blackbear!"
Freshman,5,"Most of the academic advisors and professors are kind and understanding. Even though it is cold, the campuses are beautiful."
Freshman,5,"I have not yet done an online class. However, it will be most likely that I will do an online class."
Junior,5,"When I started at the University of Maine, I had never even visited the state before. I was from Illinois and had moved 1,200 miles away from my home and everything I knew. I was nervous about what college would be like as a first generation college student. However, the first lesson I learned while at college was that you will never be lonely as long as you surround yourself with others who are passionate about their dreams. The University of Maine quickly became my new home due to the fact that the staff and the students were all passionate about their lives, dreams, and opportunities. The friends and professional relationships I developed are the main reason I would rate this University 5 stars!"
Alum,5,The Honors College really ramped up my education - I found it to be incredibly resourceful and recommend it to all students.
Alum,5,"UMaine was by far the best undergraduate school I could have attended. The faculty is wonderful and the costs are amazing, comparatively speaking."
Senior,5,"I took a winter course online and it was excellent. The professors are very helpful and understanding. They are always available and reply to emails asap! I also was taking a spring course before the COVID-19 pandemic occurred and changed all courses online. Even with that happening, I still thrived in online courses and all professors were very understanding."
Senior,5,It is a great university with a big diversity. I felt so welcomed upon joining and feel like it became my second home.
Alum,5,"The University of Maine has allowed me to grow as a person and make meaningful connections throughout the past few years. The school has given the opportunities to travel, make friends, try different activities such as boxing, and more."
Alum,5,"Intellectually challenging, inspiring.  Friends lasting through time.  Campus resources to assist as needed.  If it is a nightclub lifestyle you are looking for, this is not the university for you.  However if outdoors, fresh air, daily activities are of interest then welcome to UMO."
Freshman,5,I love this school. I get to study what I want and the staff and teacher are very nice. A lot of the professors care about what they teach and that is easy to tell.
Freshman,5,This school is everything I ever needed. I felt accepted the moment I stepped foot ion campus. I became involved in my classes and clubs immediately. UMaine has provided me with so many opportunities already.
Freshman,5,"The University of Maine (UMaine) offers extensive academic opportunities expected from a major research university, with the close-knit feel of a small college. The University of Maine is Maine’s Flagship University offering the most comprehensive academic experience in the state. There are nearly 100 majors and academic programs, 75 graduate degree programs, and 30 doctoral programs. All majors benefit from a strong foundation in the liberal arts."
Freshman,5,I am a first year student at the University of Maine and I absolutely love it. All of the University staff has been very welcoming and has done a more than excellent job making me feel comfortable. I very strongly believe all the staff here is focused on providing me with the tools to help me succeed.
Freshman,5,"Love the campus, there is something here for everybody with tons of clubs and activities you can never get bored."
Freshman,5,The atmosphere is absolutely amazing and fun. There's so much to do so you're never bored. Some of the professors could get better at actually teaching in regards to how fast they talk and how clearly.
Freshman,5,"I love it, great people and opportunities, The school, truly opens your eyes and allows you to be in a different environment than the one you are used to."
Freshman,5,"The University is very inclusive. As a gay transgender male I experienced a lot of hate in high school, college has been much different. I feel respected and accepted in the community."
Freshman,5,"UMO IS A GREAT EXPEIENCE, VERY WELL ROUNDED SCHOOL. IT HAS BEEN MY 1ST YEAR, AND I AM VERY IMPRESSED. THEY TAKE YOU UNDER THEIR WING AND MAKE YOU COMFORTABLE."
Freshman,5,"If you're on the hunt for a school that is affordable and has academic quality that constantly outshines expectations, UMaine is the place to be. The administration at this school is fantastic, as are the professors and resources on campus. There's always something going on, and the sense of community and school spirit here makes it feel like a home. The campus is also endless and looks amazing, even when covered in snow. If you're a student considering attending this school, I can't recommend it enough."
Sophomore,5,"I like UMO because it is a huge campus, but once you're in it, it really doesn't seem that big.  People build good communities for all types of different interests."
Sophomore,5,"UMaine is an affordable state university and a major destination for research. It's one of only a handful of schools that are Land, Sea and Space grant school, and every PHD doing research is required to also teach. The campus is beautifully forested, though the winters are harsh."
Freshman,5,"The overall;l campus and vibe of the school is very child and nice considering its open layout and natural features. Like most places in northern/center, Maine there is a big empspis on the outsides. but there is also thjiongs too do in thje nerbyu city bangor. The classes are easy to follow if you atleast try and seem like they teach you stuff you will use. Most teachers seem to care about thier class,but some seem to hate thier job/life"
Sophomore,5,"The University of Maine Orono should be considered the top option for all students in their leading ten percent from high school. Not only does it have many fantastic options, but resources abound."
Freshman,5,My decision to come to the University of Maine is by far the best decision I have ever made. I extended out of my comfort zone by moving out of state and I don't regret it for a minute. I love the size of the campus and the people here are generally very kind and welcoming.
Sophomore,5,"The University of Maine is an incredibly unique academic establishment that is truly cherished by many alumnae, students, and staff. The University provides many exquisite resources to accommodate almost anyone. It's placed right in the middle of Maine giving it easy access to the beautiful coasts, mountains, or cities, with relative ease. The rigorous academic schedules of the students combined with the willingness of professors to watch help their students succeed makes this University special as well."
Freshman,5,The campus is beautiful  and the surrounding towns and area offer the best of outdoor activity. Academically you can be challenged but there is always ready help if needed. Everyone is more than willing to give a hearty 'Maine Hello'!
Junior,5,"The University of Maine always has something interesting going on, The memorial union hosts many events throughout the school year, and Greek life on campus will participate in many fun and interesting fundraisers."
Niche User,5,"I have visited the campus multiple times and it is gorgeous, everyone there was super helpful and friendly, all an all it was a fantastic experience"
Niche User,5,Can't wait to attend this school! I've committed recently and I am attending the accepted students day on April 12. I cannot wait to spend my next 4 years here.
Niche User,5,"It is a very friendly environment that strives to help out its students to the best of its abilities. It is a safe and secure campus that holds many wonderful activities, clubs, sports, etc."
Niche User,5,"Great place learn and grow.  It is a long way north,but once you get use to it it is awesome.  Love the community of students"
Freshman,5,"The campus itself is very good, and most of the professors here are very willing to help their students. There are a lot of activities and ways to get involved on campus as well, making it easy to get adjusted to campus living. The dorms are also pretty good. The food depending on the dining hall and day can be good, although sometimes it isn't the best. Other than that I am enjoying the University of Maine and would definitely recommend it!"
Freshman,5,The University of Maine has a diverse and caring community. Students and teachers are incredibly friendly which makes it a very welcoming school to attend. Both staff and students show passion towards learning and help support those around them towards their goals. The campus itself is very beautiful throughout all seasons and there is always an activity to go to. The school has strong spirit and sports games are very exciting to attend.
Sophomore,5,"Beautiful campus and Maine is a great state to spend time in. There are lots of activities to do on campus and off campus. The staff is helpful and super nice and so are the people in the surrounding areas. The winters are cold and lots of snow, but there are still lots of things to do."
Junior,5,"The University of Maine is very welcoming place and I've always felt comfortable. The teachers for the most part are very understanding, caring and versatile. The sports scene is a great way for the students of UMaine to connect and become a community. The music is also I large part of UMaine in a sense that there are several different ensembles on campus with a couple that tour every spring to spread musical awareness."
Senior,5,"The University of Maine has been a home to me for the past five years. My freshman year I was able to experience the more social scene of the school and it was a blast.  In my later years, due to personal circumstance, my relationship with the university has been more professional.  That just gave it the chance to prove it really is more than fun.  The faculty members have always been more than willing to help with whatever problem you encounter.  My only complaint is the undergraduate health insurance policy, I'd rather not be insured because their plan is awful.  Copays are high, the deductible is ridiculous, and only the bare minimum is covered."
Freshman,5,"I have only been a student for one semester here so far, buy my overall experience has been nothing short of exciting. I am currently involved in athletics here and have been treated very well by coaches and faculty. The food here is excellent and everyone is very friendly."
Freshman,5,"I love the deep sense of community at UMaine. Overall, people are very friendly whether it be teachers, classmates, or community members. There is a sense of pride in the school and the community surrounding it is very supportive of all that UMaine accomplishes."
Junior,5,The teachers are so understanding and the food is amazing! And the campus is denfinalty big and beautiful
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love University of Maine! The campus is beautiful and the teachers work very hard to make sure the students understand the criteria. It may be somewhat of a party school, but the academics are wonderfully executed. There are many groups/clubs and sororities/fraternities to join so that you can really be a big part of the campus. They are fairly good at sports and have a sporting game or two almost every day-so if you're a sports fan, you'll really enjoy going here."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Maine provides an experience non specific to any student. The campus staff provides opportunities that are unmatched in many academic fields. Whether it be clubs, athletics, Greek life, or enjoying the Maine outdoors, The Univeristy of Maine, Orono is a great fit for seemingly every student in their perspective fields."
Sophomore,5,"I love it here! Even though I'm 5 hours from my hometown, this place has become my new home. Everyone treated the freshman fairly, but did not baby us. There are so many programs and outreach facilities if I had any questions. I joined clubs and teams I never thought I would do. I joined a sorority and it is one of the best decisions of my life! I also got scuba certified and a lab internship, I feel already really prepared for life outside of college."
Freshman,5,"The school has a great atosphere. The food is decent compared to local colleges, however does not compare to UMass Amherst's dining halls. The residence halls are old but still good. Some professors can be rude and not teach very well."
Senior,5,I fell in love with this school the second I stepped on to the campus. The campus is beautiful and I have had a great experience with the faculty in my program.
Junior,5,I transferred to UMaine after my Community College experience and I can say I have not only learned a ton in my first year at Orono but I’ve also grown as a person. I can personally vouch for my experience within the College of Engineering specifically the Construction Engineerig Technology and Surveying Engineering Technology majors. Orono has the best Land Surveying faculty in the country.
Senior,5,"The University of Maine has provided me a great chance to grow and expand myself. I joined clubs I had never planned to be a part of. The academics were great, and my particular major allowed me to be very hands-on. For instance, I have been allowed to observe in the clinic which solidified my dreams of becoming an audiologist in the future. I will always keep in touch with the friends I have made here."
Niche User,5,"Im not a student here yet, but I plan on attending in the fall. I fell involve with the university. I felt at home, and thats what was most important to me"
Niche User,5,"The University of Maine provides an affordable, flexible learning environment for students from anywhere to get involved with. It has great academics and a great learning environment."
Freshman,5,"Although I am only a second semester freshmen, I have been so pleased with my decision to enroll with the University of Maine for my bachelor degree."
Freshman,5,This school is very community like. Right when I arrived at school I felt at home. I have not had any bad experiences during my time here and would recommend the university to everyone that enjoys the feel of community and likes to be in both a very small town and near a large city. It has an opportunity for anyone that wants a college degree.
Sophomore,5,"I love umaine. It has great facilities and great people. It has a spirited and positive feel to the campus, and there is so much going on that everyone can find their niche."
Freshman,5,"I like the community that UMaine naturally has. Since it is my first year I have only met a handful of professors, but so far they have been very helpful in obtaining my goals."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Maine has amazing professors, as well as a great variety of courses and majors to choose from."
Alum,5,"This campus is big, beautiful, and full of life. There is always something to do and activities going on that you can never be bored. The classes are great and the professors are amazing."
Freshman,4,"It will get better when most classes are not online only but as of right now, the school is great besides the requirement to be incredibly organized to get through the first semester."
Sophomore,4,Beautiful campus and great student body. Classes are good and student life is great! It's cold though. Really cold.
Sophomore,4,"It really depends on the professor, but BrightSpace is soooo much better than blackboard. So far Organic Chemistry with Dr. Machamer and Microbiology with Dr. Bernard are really good."
Sophomore,4,"At first last semester my online experience wasn't that good but now they are using the brightspace program which is very nice! Could be better, if you're looking for the best online experience I would recommend Husson."
Junior,4,The university of Maine feels  like I'm home. Most of the professors that I have had are fantastic and accually care about their students. The University also has a lot of programs to help students succeed. They have many clubs and activities you can be apart of and also have one campus jobs.
Sophomore,4,"If you want to see funding in your major, make sure it’s STEM. International Affairs only has one full time professor, for example. The Honors College is a great opportunity if it’s offered to you, and the overall academics that are offered are as good as or better than any other state university you’ll look at. I’m loving my experience here, but the weather sure takes a bit of getting used to, especially if you’re from the South like me."
Alum,4,The University was able to make a graceful transition to online schooling during the coronavirus. They assured that all their students would receive the help and support need to succeed.
Junior,4,"The atmosphere is amazing, students and staff are typically great to work with. There are amazing opportunities for kids studying in my field. The only thing I dislike is the cost. For an out of state students the amount is approximately 5 times in state tuition and I don’t find it fair I’m being penalized for not living in a state with a marine science program."
Sophomore,4,"I love the University of Maine because it allows me to take a unique path in the pre-med world, which I appreciate greatly! I am also a student-athlete, and the support system for athletes and students is incredible. Professors are always available to me when I need help, and the advising is great. Diversity is an issue at UMaine, but that would be my only complaint. I always feel safe on campus, even when walking back from the library super late at night."
Junior,4,"UMaine is a good place for someone looking for a medium-sized school where there are enough people that you don't know everyone, but small enough where you can easily make connections with other students and professors."
Junior,4,"Excellent four years spent in this rural town, and I happily support this flagship university. Diversity in organizations and unique qualities shine bright across the nation from our scientific research and studies to athletics and art."
Alum,4,"The University of Maine is a great campus with a lot of students and many opportunities. You have to enjoy the snow to go there! The campus is absolutely beautiful in the Fall and Spring but the snow starts and stays for a long time.
There are some older professors that need to go and some really great new professors. The food and housing are both top notch, and there is a great hockey rink and football stadium. One thing I would have liked to see is more support for Liberal Arts students. There are a lot of great facilities and resources, but not a lot of guidance or easy access to them."
Sophomore,4,"University of Maine often struggles with management in tough times, when it comes to weather issues or global pandemics their reaction is often slow and lacking. However, they are of the most cost effective universities you can find in the country."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I love the University of Maine. Being apart of this community is an amazing opportunity, and I am so grateful to be a student here. The business program at the University of Maine is ""top of the line"", as well as the engineering program. However, a couple things this university could work on is the safety of such a large campus, and the dorms."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy going to the University of Maine. While the campus might seem large, this community is very closely knit and it’s so easy to get involved with what you love, and meet people who share similar interests!"
Freshman,4,"The university has a beautiful campus with lots of open green spaces. The lecture halls are well equipped for the classes, and the professors I've had are all very knowledgeable in their fields."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Maine academics are very challenging, but teachers and tutors are always willing to help, which creates a positive learning environment. The buildings around campus are easy to find, which makes finding classes easy. The local area around campus is very lively, and there are plenty of restaurants. The campus could improve on making the dorms more appealing to students with having TVs on every floor, and more than one small study room."
Sophomore,4,"I love the University of Maine because of the positive environment. It is one of the best colleges for my degree, and I feel I’m learning a lot."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at the University of Maine and I love it! What at first seems like a big campus, the more you walk around and explore the smaller it seems to be, which is great compared to other much larger universities, and in the winter with the weather. The professors are all very nice and want to watch their students succeed. There are hundreds of student clubs and sports and other activities to join on campus, so you will never feel alone."
Sophomore,4,"The degree that I am in at the University of Maine, Ecology and Environmental Science, has an amazing program and department heads. They are always willing to help you out if you have any questions, point you in the right direction for internships and scholarships, and have so many different seminars that really spark your interest and could even lead you to the area in your field that you're meant to be in. Along with many other extracurricular activities and clubs, they have amazing greek life that also leads you to amazing opportunities and can help with making connections in the future and professional world as well. If I'm going to be critical, I would say that the level of diversity at the school is lacking and I would love to see more of a representation of minority groups on campus."
Sophomore,4,"While the classes themselves are not necessarily stellar, the hands on experience in your field makes up for it, and really gives the extra boast for vet school applications."
Freshman,4,"I like how the professors there are very open to discussions about almost any topic, and how switching classes and majors is less stressful."
Sophomore,4,People should take advantage of the Flagship Match Scholarship if they are looking for higher education in STEM. I think this school has an excellent STEM department. All of the professors are motivated and excited about their fields.
Junior,4,"The university is a nice and generally safe community. It eventually grows on you and begins to feel like home. The only downside is the weather, it is constantly cold and snows often in the winter. The university is not considerate at giving adequate time before deciding to cancel class and they do not always consider the safety of the students when the weather is poor."
Senior,4,Great faculty that actively support students. Tons of research opportunities and research assistant positions are not highly competitive.
Sophomore,4,"I like the small classes and the food is okay. What I'd like to see change is I want more discussion events on campus, talking about current events or modern issues affecting students on campus. I would also like to see more security cameras in the halls and especially the stairwells."
Junior,4,I liked how welcoming and open the students here are. the atmosphere on campus is very related and welcoming.  Nice buildings and classrooms for the most part. Lost of clubs and activities to get involved in. Greek life is available as well.
Freshman,4,"I will be beginning my first semester at this University in 10 days and I have had an overall amazing experience during the admissions process and at orientation. Everyone is so welcoming, easy to talk to, and willing to help with anything you need or any questions you have."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy this school. The student to professor ratio for my classes was a good amount and the professors care a lot about the student. Since I’m out of state the school is very expensive, but they have a flagship scholarship that helps with that! The last thing is I’d like to see the condition of the campus itself improve."
Senior,4,"UMaine is great school if you're looking for something small but also large. The community is huge and you are able to join a multitude of clubs or sports or even greek life! It is cold, but you do get used to it, the dorms aren't the best after the first year, but most people live off campus after that anyways. Overall the academics are great and everyone there is there to help you succeed."
Alum,4,"Quality faculty, nice small town feel, plenty of opportunities for research and work, excellent opportunities for graduates."
Freshman,4,"The professors and TA’s are extremely friendly, always willing to answer your questions and help in any other way that they can. The students are pretty much in the same boat so getting along with everyone is quite easy. It’s in an area with plenty of things to do nearby (ex. restaurants, river trail to bike and walk, etc)."
Freshman,4,"UMaine is a great school for the price, the roads and travel conditions are awful, they spend little money on student mental health, but if none of that effects you than it is a great place to stay!"
Freshman,4,"driving can be a little rough with parking and potholes but other than that pretty good. They are very big in having different things in the union, pride week, diversity type stuff. They also are very understanding in minority religions with making sure teachers are doing the best they can to help out with certain holidays we may not have off for, and even is in all the syllabuses that you just need to give a couple of days heads up and it will be fine."
Niche User,4,University of Maine has been very helpful during the college decision making process. They have showed me that I want to go to their school for the next four years of my life to study Nursing. The Nursing program is one of the best in the state and program is outstanding! The teachers and faculty that run the program are friendly and are ready to help me become a registered nurse.
Freshman,4,"Everyone here at the University of Maine is so friendly. You truly have a whole family when you get here, no matter how far away from home you are."
Freshman,4,"While I was able to skip living on campus my freshman year, I found that those who lived on campus were able to make connections and friendships a lot easier which proves to me that the campus community can be a close and friendly place, with lots of opportunities to make connections. Academic-wise,  I find my courses challenging and thoughtful that really teach me and give me skills that I can use in my chosen profession."
Freshman,4,The University of Maine is a very welcoming and uplifting place. The atmosphere of the campus brings a smile to anyones face. The faculty is overwhelmingly helpful and kind. There is always something to do on campus and it feels as if everyone is always getting involved. The first time I stepped foot on campus I knew it was the place for me.
Freshman,4,"The University of Maine is a wonderful place that I have been really enjoying over the past year, both academically and socially. I am in Civil and Environmental Engineering, and have been able to learn a lot because of this schools superb engineering school. Almost all of my teachers have been very nice and informative, and even when I had trouble in classes they would always be flexible with students availability hours for extra help."
Sophomore,4,"Only been here for a couple months. All my professors have been great, very attentive, and good at communication. The campus is very beautiful."
Freshman,4,"The application process was very easy. Not sure if it was set up that way but I really liked how my dorm was close to all my classes making it easier to find things as a first year student. They need a better process for pre ordering books
as a freshman I thought this would be a good idea and they were delivered to my room upon arrival, but half my books were missing or wrong and made it very confusing ."
Freshman,4,"It's a nice campus. The weather is terrible, but that's more of a problem with Maine than it is with the university."
Niche User,4,"The view on campus is amazing, high security to feel safe wile walking with friends or alone. Food is delicious with a good variety, dorms are nice and cozy."
Freshman,4,"I like how the university has a home-like feel with the academic and social support at a high level. The classes and on-campus living is not demographically challenging, since the enrollment is not too big, yet not too small. I feel even though there is over ten thousand people in attendance, I still receive support in all areas as if I am the only person enrolled. With highly experienced professors and staff, I feel I am getting the most out of my time at the University of Maine."
Freshman,4,"It's a big campus so there's plenty to do and it's easy to get out of your dorm and do something. Lots of beautiful architecture, the only thing that really sucks is how cold it gets in winter."
Sophomore,4,"The University overall is great. The professors are always nice and the school has you take a college prep like class first semester, which is nice so that you learn what the college is like and where things are. Some cons though is the school doesn't like to close when the weather is bad and the parking lots for on campus students is full of snow and ice during the winter. If you come here make sure your car has 4-wheel drive."
Sophomore,4,Coming to the University of Maine from California was a hard adjustment for me personally. Luckily the community here is very tight and I made friends and found myself acclimating very quickly. The STEM programs here are very good and I find myself excited about the classes I'm taking and the classes I plan to take because they're exactly what I wanted to get out of college.
Niche User,4,"I like the focus towards STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math). They also have very nice labs and workspaces!"
Sophomore,4,"I enrolled in UMaine for their School of Forest Resources and I couldn't be happier about my decision! Faculty is extremely knowledgable and are personally invested in your success. Winter seems to last forever but the party life is active and helps it go by. I wouldn't reccomend staying on campus after your freshman year, the dorms are average at best and compared to alternative living prices, not worth your time in my opinion."
Sophomore,4,It is a beautiful campus. The staff is extremely helpful. There is a variety of dining options. The town of Orono is a quaint town with lots of character.
Sophomore,4,"my overall experience at the university of maine is that it is a very well rounded school, that likes to focus on every aspect of its curriculum. I wish the made more on campus housing options, updated buildings and departments where needed"
Sophomore,4,College sophomore this year and I have had nothing but good experiences from this school. The only thing I would complain about is the financial aid office.
Sophomore,4,The academic advisers are there to help you which is great since being the 1st in my family to go to college was difficult for us
Sophomore,4,"Extremely open and friendly campus. Heavily scheduled weeks for first year students, however nothing extreme. A few professors hard to understand, especially in the STEM majors, but all are willing to give students the help they need. Dorms could use some touch ups, but pretty average."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Maine at Orono is very nice.  The campus is very nice, everything is in walking distance.  The campus is 10 - 20 minutes away from shopping areas.  Professors are very nice, always looking to help students.  Food is amazing, there are three dinning halls all have different foods that are served."
Junior,4,"Rural setting, yet it feels like you're in a different location at the same time. It provides a quality education for a fraction of the price of other schools. The staff is excellent, receiving doctorate degrees from world renowned institutions."
Sophomore,4,"I found UMaine as a great place to start my adult life. For me, the campus is perfect. It's small enough to walk around but you see people that you have never seen before every day. Out of state prices are steep but I got a job the summer after my freshman year in my field of study partly because I go to UMaine. The professors are great. They don't really care if you slack off but for the students who work hard and show their effort, most professors will go above and beyond to help you succeed. There is also so much to do on weekends. There are almost endless things to do for less than 2 hours of driving. Games on weekends are great to go to as well"
Junior,4,I am a transfer student at UMaine. I have felt extremely welcome. The campus is the flagship college of the State of Maine system. They have a top of the line research engineering program and have great job placement after you complete your degree. Everyone seems approachable and happy.
Junior,4,Many of the classes at the University of Maine have been incredible and worth the hard work that you need to put into them. I would say that I wish the criminal science and legal studies were more developed on the University so that there could be more opportunities for people like me who would like to focus their studies in those fields.
Alum,4,"I’m not a huge city person, so Orono was perfect for me as far as atmosphere. Technically located on an island between two branches of a river, there is plenty of outdoor activity for you to take part in.  Once there for a couple years, the whole university becomes something of a family. There are great professors who challenge you, but are also there to help you succeed. It seemed to provide a good mix between the liberal arts and the sciences. If you are a city buff, Bangor leaves something to be desired, but it has got it’s perks.  There are some great restaurants for young folks.  Grab your climbing gear, your canoe, and fishing pole, and come to UMaine for a great education, and some outdoor adventures."
Freshman,2,"Do you want to get drunk for 4 years while learning nothing, and get a degree at the end of it? Then this school is for you! Do you care about your academics, extracurricular activities, and overall well-being? Avoid this place like wildfire. The only good college in the system is the wildlife/nature based programs. Everything else is half baked curriculum. You can pass the classes without ever going to them, because the professors expect all their students to be wasted the entire time. 
There are many smaller quality of life things missing: There is no system for pairing dorm roommates based on lifestyle, many of the walkways are poorly designed and ice over in winter. Many of the students and staff are very close minded, with little care for mental health, LGBT equality, and POC despite what they may say.
UM is one of the biggest schools in Maine, but it is FAR from the best. Unless you plan on going for wildlife ecology, or you just want to party while burning money, STAY AWAY!"
Junior,2,For me online learning is not the best way for me to gain the knowledge I seek to gain. And my professors didn't have a lot of time to prepare for the switch very well.
Sophomore,2,"I love the sisters I have joined in Greek life, and the professors are nice. I disagree with a great deal other aspects I don't feel at liberty to say."
Alum,2,"The student advisory system during my time at UMaine was awful. When I first arrived at the school, I tried emailing my advisor and never received an answer. After two months into school I finally got an answer back after emailing her to say I was thinking about leaving the business school.  She told me it'd be best I leave and find another professor to advise me because she didn't have the time.  I never met the woman. This was one of many instances where I felt alone and disrespected as a student at UMaine."
Sophomore,2,"It started out great here. I loved being far from home and the campus seemed great. Now being here a second year, I realize it isn't all that grand. The school takes every ounce of money it can giving you ridiculous charges and finding ways to make you buy the books at the school whether than elsewhere. the education isn't all that grand. Most of the class are basically you teaching yourself and getting in contact with a professor can take days, sometimes over a week. The diversity is also low. The food isn't that good. Also, if you don't like the cold or snow. This place isn't meant for you."
Freshman,2,I didn't like it. Their organization on students majors and how to fix it was bad. They did have good club activities but besides that not good at all.
Alum,2,Professors and class options are great. When you need help no one wants to help you. You get shuttled around from department to department as they try to pass you off because nobody wants to have to deal with your problems. Overall I've had more problems with this universitythan anything else.
Sophomore,2,"I am an out of state student writing this in the second semester of my sophomore year. I came here because I always knew I wanted to go out of state to school and not stay at home, in New York. However, I don't think my peers got the same memo. Almost every single person that goes to school here is from Maine, some 10 minutes from here. Everyone that is this way goes home on the weekends and gets coddled by their parents. It's basically high school all over again for them, because they are with everyone that they have known their whole life. This really bothers me as an out of state student because there's no way to know this before you come to school here. Furthermore, everything on campus closes after 4 pm. I'm not kidding, look on the umaine website for dining. This is terribly inconvenient and very unusual of a college. The cubby, where packages are received, is closed on weekends too. Everything is far away, academics are okay. I hate this place, it's made me terribly depressed."
Niche User,2,"University of Maine is complicated and messy. They did not provide me any assistance when I was about to pull my hair out. I would definitely suggest anyone searching to keep searching unless they are looking for large, crazy and messy."
College Freshman,2,@parties some people be doing coke and ketamine :\
College Junior,2,Greek life monopolizes the party scene on campus and are very cliquey. Some are better than others though
College Freshman,2,"Fraternities are here for parties. I have plenty of friends in frats and sororities and they all say they love them, but you're only going to a frat to try to get into the party if you're not one of them."
College Freshman,2,"We are Division 1 and expected to be this great hockey school with at least a decent football team, but I think the worst thing about Umaine sports teams is their inconsistency."
College Freshman,2,"Maine is the most white state in the entire country. UMaine has a pretty good economic diversity, but ethnic no. There is little blatant racism, but not many people from Maine know how to handle minorities. I am a part of a very diverse family, and have seen racism first hand. I feel confident that there are those here who would stand up to bigots, if the need arises."
College Freshman,2,"With Umaine, the devil is in the details. Before I went there, it seemed like a pretty good school. There financial aid package was also, comparatively, generous. However, there are absurd rules that nobody tells you about until you get there, such as loans being included in financial ""aid"", frivolous charges tied to your bill, like Recreation center fees, T.V. charges, being kicked out of almost every residence hall for breaks, or refusing to reimburse students when a professor cancels class several times. There are many issues like this, and they are far greater than just ""annoying"". My overall suggestion to anyone going to college: if you don't have a lot of money, and you are a Maine resident, certainly consider this school, or another Maine school; in-state tuition is very enticing. If you have a LOT of money, and can afford an out-of-state school, then do not choose this school; I'm quite sure there are far better schools than this one."
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, make sure you don't forget anything when doing financial aid, if you miss the simplest checked box you may screw yourself over."
College Freshman,2,I had a GPA of 3.76 on a 4.0 scale and they only gave me 1500 for the year because my fafsa is too high.
College Freshman,2,"I personally only got the Blackbear scholarship for $1,000 and received only a couple other scholarships from my hometown."
College Freshman,2,"The food is sometimes okay, I personally really enjoy the stirfry and the pasta bar is good most of the time as well. Sometimes it just seems there is a lack of variety and the options they offer get old after a while and Easy Mac in my room looks more and more appealing."
College Freshman,2,"I'm from California, which people assume is a very stuck up and judgmental place, but I have found that here is so much worse. There is a lot based on looks and not much based on intelligence when it comes to making friends. If you aren't into partying and aren't super beautiful or outgoing, you won't have an exceptional amount of friends. You'll make some but it won't be like the movie. I have also found that people here are pretty immature. It's all about sex. I get it, we're still teenagers, but honestly, sex jokes get old fast."
College Freshman,2,"I really don't like it here. I'm transferring after this year. I am coming from the west coast so the winter was brutal, the small size of the school was frustrating and the lack of cultural diversity was annoying. Personally, I made the wrong choice coming to this school. I have made some cool friends and I did enjoy most of my classes, but if you're from a big town or a very diverse area of the country or haven't experienced a New England winter, do your research well before coming here. It's a very different environment, one I don't enjoy much."
College Freshman,2,"I don't think a degree from here means much just because very few people actually know the school. New-Englanders know it, but the rest of the country doesn't. When I told people back home where I was going to school they had to ask where Maine even was. This state are school are just under-known."
College Freshman,2,The cops and RAs are very strict. Don't get caught by either if you are drinking underage because you will get it a large amount of trouble that could result in a mark on your record and fees. They are strict about drug use in and outside the dorms.
College Freshman,2,Frat houses and the grove can be pretty disgusting. Better of just going off campus to a house party.
College Sophomore,2,"not that many things to do in orono, but we make do"
College Sophomore,2,"I am the fourth person in my family to attend UMaine, I have applied every year for financial aid but have not received any."
College Junior,2,I didn't like it at all. My major wasn't what I thought it would be.
College Freshman,2,The weather is always cold and windy. Sun is nice
College Freshman,2,"I got very little financial aid, just some loans"
College Freshman,2,It's very hard to find a spot.
College Senior,2,"Internship opportunities are somewhat limited in terms of proximity. You have to a) do your own research, and b) be willing to move down south or out of the state of the summer."
College Senior,2,"The program's getting better, but it needs improvement. Better retention rate for professors and more targeted curriculums focusing on today's skills and not yesterday's."
College Senior,2,"Dorms desperately need improvement, however, their locations are nice. Small rooms."
College Senior,2,"Like the state it calls home, not too much diversity here."
College Freshman,2,"As according to the school presented statistic, 85% of people drink. I wouldn't be surprised if more than that smoke marijuana."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot to do even when you get off campus! The town is cute, but too small to provide any entertainment"
College Freshman,2,A lot of people use drugs recreationally and the policies in place can't stop it.
College Freshman,2,"For the majority of the school year, you have to speed walk to class and pray you haven't lost any extremities due to frostbite when you get there!"
College Sophomore,2,It is fine. Nothing too special about it. still tons of things to do.
College Student,2,"The UMPD should be protecting us from real crime, but instead they send two cop cars within 45 seconds at the first report of underage drinking in a dorm.

People should stop consenting to searches and opening their doors, I guess."
College Student,2,"Either you got good grades in high school and get a lot of institutional aid, or you get none."
College Student,2,"The bathrooms are always a mess by Sunday, the buildings are old, and it costs too much for what it is."
College Freshman,2,"This year they ran out of room for first year students and turned nearly all of our common rooms into quads. On top of that they turned many double rooms into triples. Things have been very cramped and in my dorm, there is very little social and atmosphere and resident community. It's just the place where I keep my stuff, basically."
College Sophomore,2,Bring cold weather gear and layer up kids!
College Freshman,2,"Although I normally live farther north than this, the weather here is still difficult. It is certainly cold, but what I cannot get over is how WINDY it is everywhere. There are wind tunnels between just about every building and you WILL lose your hat once or twice. Other than that, I'm used to everything that happens weather-wise."
College Freshman,2,"It's kind of bad around here because you're so far up north (relative to the U.S.) and with a mostly white population. There are others that definitely stand out, but no one antagonizes them. They are more in awe of them because they don't see that anywhere else."
College Freshman,2,"You can definitely tell who does and doesn't do drugs. However, I do not really hang around those people, they are just kind of there. Nothing is really done because they are never really caught."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not able to find any, and the ones that I do find I do not qualify for. When I do get any scholarships, they are generally small  in amount."
College Freshman,2,"Orono is a small town with very little going on, including food"
College Freshman,2,It is cold and snowy
College Freshman,2,IT IS FREEZING DURING THE WINTER. I mean it. November through April requires much bundling up. Summer is great though!
College Freshman,2,"I would say that every weekend and sometimes during the week there is drinking and drugs involved. There is a lot of weed smoking and drinking alcohol on and off campus. Overall it is bad here, there is a high level of both"
College Freshman,2,I have not had the greatest experience in this school.
College Freshman,2,There isn't much diversity on campus which impacts me a lot.
College Sophomore,2,"Not a great experience, pretty boring. But not the worst. I have had some good times."
College Sophomore,2,"The only good thing about Orono, ME is the Orono House of Pizza. It's amazing. But other than that, there is nothing to do in the town (besides partying). You have to go to Old Town or Bangor for things."
College Freshman,2,I personally don't like all of the partying that goes on around campus. A lot of kids flunk out quick but I think it is common in most colleges. The parties are avoidable but can be obnoxious throughout the dorms- especially while studying. 
College Sophomore,2,i lost it one year when i was blind sided by some regulations i didn't know i had to meet.
College Sophomore,2,they always over sell permits and there isn't enough space to go around. better get to class early
College Junior,2,"I am very lucky I am able to transfer.  The school made a lot of false promises.  The biggest problem is the greek life and the drug usage.  If you aren't greek, you aren't anyone."
College Freshman,1,Not very helpful. Do everything you can as early as possible so you have more time to fix the inevitable problems.
College Junior,1,"Housing is fine if you are a First or Second year, but starting this year the only housing offered for upperclassmen is the apartments at the top of the hill that are far away from everything, and are more expensive than regular dorms. The only way to stay in a dorm if you are an upperclassman is to be in the Honors College and stay in the Honors housing. Everyone else either has to live in the campus apartments or find housing off campus. Not the best idea UMaine has ever had."
College Senior,1,"Honestly, this is the worst aspect of the university. I love a good snowfall every once and awhile, but the brutal winters are the reason why many don't take a chance at applying and/or leave after a couple of semesters. It's ""shorts weather"" for approx. 1.5 of the 8+ months of the school year, if you're lucky."
College Freshman,1,"I'm not sure if this is a regular thing or not, but this past winter was one of the worst I've ever experienced. We had weeks at a time with -20f weather."
College Freshman,1,The office isn't very helpful or nice. They act like they don't want to deal with your problem.
College Sophomore,1,"The first month and last month of school have nice weather. Everyday in between it's cold and only gets colder. You go months without seeing the sun. You have to walk across campus on slippery ice, slushy snow, in below zero degree weather. It makes it hard to get out of bed."
College Freshman,1,"There is hardly an diversity on campus. 80% of student are from maine, this makes the campus primarily white. "
College Sophomore,1,"The school starts freshmen out with a good amount of aid, then takes it away and makes many students have to take out more federal loans and/or private loans.  The school needs to admit less students, and take care of the students who are already contributing to the school.  Financial aid is terrible."
College Junior,1,"I believe I have made literally two friends, because I refuse to participate in drug use.  I have been treated horribly, mocked, made fun of, and verbally harassed by people on drugs on campus. "
College Junior,1,"Internships just don't happen here.  You will be told you they will, but they wont, unless you are in the lab and are best friends with a professor, it's most likely you will never get an internship."
College Sophomore,1,New construction on campus has made the parking issue even worse.  It can be difficult to find spots on campus and ticketing happens quickly and often.
College Freshman,1,Maine gets pretty cold in the winter. 
College Junior,1,The parking at UMaine is the worst experience on campus! There are never enough spaces and they mark the lots full so you end up walking very far to class! The parking police stalk the cars and will ticket you at every chance that they can. UMaine needs more parking!!
College Sophomore,1,"There's very few really good restaurants. There's an excellent coffee shop with a grill/bar that's run by the same people, but besides that there's some lower quality pizza places and chain fast food."
College Freshman,1,"My major is History, and the department itself is going downhill. The professors with the love of teaching and knowledge in their subjects are retiring and leaving. Those who are left are incompetent and don't like their students."
College Sophomore,1,"Really, really awful. The bus stops in like two places, and it takes hours to get anywhere. Plus, it stops running at like 4pm."
College Sophomore,1,There is not enough parking spots for all the parking passes that are handed out and they are also inconveniently far from the academic buildings.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is not the best, there are never enough spaces for anyone to park in if you live on campus. Also the only available parking for freshmen is so far from any of the halls you need to attend class in."
College Freshman,1,The umaine police department is very strict about parking. The signs are very confusing when parking in the different lots. They aren't lenient when it comes to visitors who have never been there before..
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is near impossible. I live 5 minutes away from school but have to leave 30 minutes before class in order to find a parking spot. Also they go a little overboard on handing out the tickets.
College Junior,1,Not the Best – There is the BAT Bus and it is free for students but it doesn't go very far and the times are not that great either.  They don't run late at night or the places you really need to go.  The best way to get around is to bring your own vehicle or carpool.
College Sophomore,1,"It's Huge – Marijuana use is noticeable but not too bad, and probably 80% of the campus partakes in drinking.  The drinking is ridiculous here."
College Sophomore,1,"Well above half of the students that attend UMaine are from Maine, so diversity is severely lacking. The minority population is almost nonexistent and it basically an all white, Maine resident university."
College Junior,1,Not Helpful – I am on the Dean's List and I am in the nursing program and the financial aid office refused to give me any extra aid.  I even called and asked for a small work study (if they had some left over) and they refused immediately and told me that if I applied I would most certainly NOT get it.  Both my parents also lost their job last year and we wrote an appeal asking for more financial aid and I was denied.  It is absolutely horrible.
College Sophomore,1,The nightlife at the University of Maine is not too good. It can definitely need some improvement. Everything seems to shut down around 10:30 and then it is very quite. I would consider looking else where is you want a good nightlife atmosphere.
College Sophomore,1,Rating for Experience – The campus itself isn't really too bad but the experience isn't something that I look forward to. There are times when there is little to nothing to do and there are now fewer activities than there have been in the past. If you are looking for a great college experience steer clear of this particular university for now.
College Sophomore,1,"The parking at the University of Maine is far from adequate. There is limited parking for such a large facility. On one occasion, graduation and a track and field meet were held on the same day, in which finding a parking space was close to impossible. Parking for students is located in areas in which the dorms and classes are a distance to walk to. 
Not only is finding a parking space a challenge, but when one is found, there is always concern about evading the ticketing and fines. The parking reinforcement, easily recognized on their three-wheeled segways, on campus will find any violations to stick a ticket on a windshield.
It may be a strain to have a car on campus, but it is useful to getting to the large variety of places around the area. Orono and Old Town house  a number of fun restaurants with Bangor only 15 minutes away where there's a mall, common box stores, and chain restaurants."
College Sophomore,1,"Overpriced, almost mandatory, lack of options – The basic meal plan on campus is $2,000 a Semester. If you live on campus you must atleast buy the basic plan. Hilltop is the only dinning facility that is regularly open. This facility is about 1/2 a mile from my dorm and almost a mile from others. The other options close by 7pm. My primary dining hall is Wells Central. On the weekends Wells opens at 11am, and serves breakfast until 2-3pm every weekend.

As a whole, the university does the bare minimum to feed its students and make itself look good on paper. Paying 4,000 for 8 months of a year for the bare minimum is unreasonable.

Food itself is bland, and usually is the same day to day, except for the occasional gimic, once again to make the school look good.

If you plan on going to UMO, Get off campus as soon as you can."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is way too stick here. One false move and you will be charged with a ticket or get towed. Also, underaged drinking is taken incredibly seriously - I was charged with possession of alcohol twice as a freshman, but I only drank once. I'm still not sure how or why they tried to charge me the second time."
College Freshman,1,Parking here sucks. It's hard to find spots and everyone gets ticketed!
College Senior,1,Dont Get Me Started – Come here if you want to be inside 80% of the year
College Sophomore,1,The winter is probably the most terrible thing i have ever experienced. Every year i want to transfer.
College Student,1,"Police Are Vicious – Although the campus police are have been known to turn a blind eye, the Orono Police, who call most of the shots, are intolerant, aggressive, and extremely powerful. Once a fairly limited operation, as one would expect in a sedate town of 10,000, word on the street is that they have recieved millions of federal dollars over the past ten years and have since become a sprawling, well funded, untiring menace. No where is safe. Hallways are patrolled and if you drink or smoke in your room there's a high chance the door will burst open followed by 5 cops. House parties are nearly always busted, and even the abundant forest surrounding the campus is regularly patrolled. If you are caught, it doesn't matter if you've had one drink or ten, they will probably arrest you, handcuff you, and send you to court. These people haven't a touch of feeling or a spark of kindness. Don't come to Umaine if you want personal freedom, or even a little peace and quiet."
College Freshman,1,"Patience, My Dear – Dealing with financial aid is a total pain. Things take forever to process, and some of the staff are rather unprofessional or unhelpful"
College Senior,1,since our school in a small town there is not alot of of campus parkign u have to pay for parking on the school grounds which is a lil rough at times
College Senior,1,Dont Mess With Them – our school has a high level of campus police along with local police that keep everyone safe and in check.
College Junior,1,"Parking at UMaine is almost always a nightmare. There is very limited parking, and the parking lots are really far away from the center of campus (mainly the Freshman dorm parking lot). The price of getting a ticket for parking in an unmarked lot or parking space is outrageously high."
College Sophomore,1,When winter is here it is aweful the windshield factor is freezing.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is worse if you're living on campus and have your car there. Although the fee is better than lots of colleges I've heard of ($40 compared to over $100) You may have to park very far away from your residence hall and move your car when they do snow removal, or face getting towed and/or getting a ticket. If you live off campus and drive in everyday you will most likely have to park very far away from wherever your class is. Make sure to park in the right zone or you'll get ticketed."
College Junior,1,Not Much Here – UMaine doesn't offer much that other schools don't also offer. The campus's commitment to green technology is impressive though

Graduate Student,5,Overall this school is pretty good. There was a lot of renovations and construction taking places but since now its all finished I did say the campus is fantastic. Professors and Instructors are good as usual. The career outlook is amazing as well. I was able to get well paying job after graduation thanks to their Career Development Services.
Graduate Student,5,Online classes will always be more difficult. But it was just as you what you would expect anywhere else. A combination of using WebEx or Zoom with completing assignments and projects on Canvas.
Niche User,5,It is great. Highly recommend. It is always great to be able to work online considering the times we are living in now.
Niche User,5,It is great. Work hard and make sure you manage your time wisely but other than that it is a great place to be.
Freshman,5,"The teachers had to adapt pretty quickly to COVID-19, which has placed everyone under online classes. Which is why I can say with confidence that the online classes at NJIT are incredible. The quality of teaching doesn't lower a bit, and because of the amount of resources, we have everything we need to succeed."
Freshman,5,NJIT is a marvelous university that has an insane amount of resources. Everyone is out to help you and I haven't yet met a single bad teacher. The classes are very informative and I have learned a lot.
Sophomore,5,"it was pretyy good. overall not bad. well planned, professors were accomodating and overall good lesson plans."
Freshman,5,"The experience online is almost the same as being there, I did not have any class time sacrificed just because it was online and the learning experience was just the same and just as interactive."
Freshman,5,"I enjoyed going there, even though it was just my first year, the campus is not ridiculously big, so navigating the campus is very easy. In addition, the professors care about the education of the students and there are more than enough tutoring centers to visit for assistance, and enough places to sit down and get work done in as well. The food on campus is not the hottest around, but there are many different food trucks on warren that will suit your taste"
Freshman,5,My online professor was very willing to extend any deadlines due to internet issues and was very accommodating to my needs to pass the class.
Senior,5,"NJIT is what you make of it. Theres plenty of opportunity to get involved, make the most out of school and definitely get ahead in your career, no matter the major."
Alum,5,Good education at an affordable price. I graduated and was able to get a job immediately. Now I am going back for another bachelors and they are letting me use my credits.
Junior,5,"New Jersey Insitute of Technology or better known as NJIT is a university located in Newark, NJ. While being located in what is known as a dangerous city, the public safety officers posted all over campus make it a safe environment to receive an excellent education whether the desired field be engineering or computer science. The price of admission is relatively low compared to other colleges and a degree received from this university is widely regarded. It is a great place to attend if you are only interested in academics and want to have a good return on your educational investment."
Junior,5,"My experience so far at NJIT has been a great one. I am currently an Architecture student trying to receive my Bachelors degree which is a five-year program in the Hillier College of Architecture and Design. NJIT is a melting pot of many different peoples from many diverse backgrounds. The student life on the NJIT campus is great, the people who come to this school will get the most out of their education. At time the classes may be very challenging but in the end it is very rewarding. The athletics are great, and the party scene I know it may be shunned on but coming from the mouth of a college student it is going to happen almost anywhere and I have to say it is a great experience."
Sophomore,5,"The first quality of NJIT that I noticed as a freshman was its diverse student population. Coming from a small town I didn't get to experience such different ethnicities and cultures. I also appreciate such a strong emphasis on research on campus. There are so many opportunities that I have to get involved in on campus, too. One thing I'd like to see happen is more communication between certain departments and more cohesive method of exhibiting their actions."
Sophomore,5,"I'm an international student from Spain. Before deciding to go to NJIT, I had read so many bad reviews online that I considered not going even if they were offering me a full ride. I'm so happy I decided to go because this place is great. It obviously isn't perfect and there's many aspects that could be improved but I totally recommend it."
Niche User,5,They offer a wide variety of programs for anybody interested in going to college. Their campus is located in a culturally-rich area where food options are endless. The students there are helpful and are willing to help new freshman in finding their classes and getting adjusted to the new college environment.
Freshman,5,"I am an incoming freshman, living on campus and I have been treated like royalty from the minute I got accepted. My university has supported me from every direction. 

The  upperclassmen have enthusiastically ushered me through campus meetings, tours and events. The faculty have provided a vision of the incredible future that inspires me.  

Lastly, the alumni have shared their diverse experiences and growth as a result of graduating from NJIT. 

I am proud to be an NJIT Highlander!"
Junior,5,"Ive learned alot so far at school and im glad i decided to apply.
they are very close to me and the classes are small so its easy to talk with the professors and go over things in detail."
Senior,5,"Well I visited NJIT in the begininng of August and one thing I love about this school is that its so diverse and the academics given are so good. Although it is located in a type bad area, they ensure us that safety is everywhere if we need it and provided us real life situations about it . The dorms are average but they arent the worst, some building have nice dorms but others have average type but they include many activities for you to get involve and to know more people in campus."
Sophomore,5,The community there is fantastic. If you believe you won't fit in then you are wrong because there is always a group for you.
Niche User,5,My relatives go there and that's how i got to know this university and my every relative likes it including me. It's been awesome to know about it and experience it.
Sophomore,5,The small size of the college allowed me to take advantage of research opportunities and student organizations. NJIT also provides amazing financial aid to students who are in good academic standing.
Alum,5,"Thisis the school of my choice, I haven't entered yet, but from the visit I took and what past alumni have told me, this is an incredible place, which will offer incredible opportunities to all kinds of people"
Freshman,5,an Astonishing campus with very competitive and humble spirit people. Glad to say that this is my dream college!
Freshman,5,New jersey institute of technology is a perfect match for students searching to enroll in real serious colleges which will make you one of the best in your major
Freshman,5,"Challenging coursework, especially for honors scholars. Overall great environment with helpful professors. Honors dorms are pristine and well maintained."
Freshman,5,"The opportunities for students both on and off campus are incredible. I feel comfortable being who I am in the prescence of other students and I am able to safely get from one point on campus to another at every time of night. There is always something to do on campus each week, and they offer incredible deals for students with online applications (MatLAB, Adobe, etc.)."
Niche User,5,From the start NJIT was a great fit for me. I loved everything about it. One awesome thing is having the city right around you and also New York right there. This gives students always something to do.
Freshman,5,"It is everything I had imagined plus more. Professors are wonderful. They care about every individual in the class. 

NJIT is a research based institution, so getting research opportunity is too easy here. I started mine in my freshman year. Just be proactive and free couple of minutes after class to build good teacher-student relationship. It will benefit you in the long run."
Sophomore,5,I like my experience so far here at njit because it was easy for me to balance social life with my academic career because of the many extra curricular activities I do as well as the relationships I've been able to build with my professors due to the small student to faculty ratio
Junior,5,NJIT is great small school with challenging academics that will prepare you for the industry of your choice.
Freshman,5,"I feel very welcomed in this school. The atmosphere is lively and it makes me happy compared to community college. Beautiful campus, and excellent clubs. Many food options."
Senior,5,"NJIT has been challengeing and has probably destroyed who I am as a person multiple times, however it has helped me and def challenged me, NJIT also is well known within the stem world I have done internships in NJ, NY and Neveda so there is a lot of opportunity, like anywhere NJIT has a lot to offer for life on campus and thereâ€™s always events happening"
Sophomore,5,Great school especially if you prefer the smaller campus feel. Great teachers and advisors. Lots of clubs to get involved with and studetn life activities. A little dead on weekends.
Junior,5,"I came to NJIT because of the undergraduate research opportunities provided, in addition to financial aid. I also liked the small college feel of the campus, but with big college money and resources."
Niche User,5,The campus is very welcoming and student friendly. All of the staff greeted me and exposed me to new majors I would not have epected to be interested in.
Niche User,5,"Upon visiting this campus, I was automatically welcomed and felted involved and included by all of the college students. Its as if I myself were already a part of that school and I hope will one day."
Freshman,5,Everything is organized. Everything is new every year; there is always something big like new soccer feild or new gym or else being built.
Senior,5,"This is the best school in the world. There's a state of the art multi-million dollar makerspace right next to the brand new $100,000,000 gym. The Professors are extremely intelligent with a lot of them having patents. There are plenty of Easter eggs hidden around campus, like the BOWLING ALLY in the basement of campus center."
Graduate Student,5,Although the major I was pursuing was very tough I had a great time at NJIT. I met my husband on my first semester. Being a transfer student took some adjustment but I am glad I chose NJIT versus CUNY which would have been a longer commute from home and my long nights of studying in campus may have not been possible.
Sophomore,5,NJIT has a vast and diverse society that come together to help each other. It has a very beautiful campus as well that neighbors Rutgers - Newark.
Sophomore,5,NJIT has a lot to offer. All that is on a student's end is to explore and avail what the college has to offer.
Sophomore,5,Amazing school and prepares you for your future . As a freshman I've contacted many companies about future internship opportunities  . Also the best priced engineering school in the northeast and the school is extremely diverse . Professors are very experienced and caring toward the students. Campus building are are well updated with the best technology and one of the best groups of public safety Ive ever seen .
Sophomore,5,NJIT was amazing about the admissions process making me feel comfortable throughout the entire experience.
Graduate Student,5,It is a pretty good school. Very small with less distraction compare to bigger school. The teachers are average for the most part but are always available. No student life. Most of the student commute to school and are not around on the weekends
Junior,5,"The university gives fair chances for all students to grow in their desired field and attain jobs through the Career Development Services. Professors and office workers are cooperative and willing to help the students. The campus is not as big as many universities, which makes it easy to get around and make it to your classes on time. It is a safe environment despite of the rumored danger surrounding the campus. I would like to have more options on the food selections in campus."
Freshman,5,"The professors at NJIT really push their students to exceed their limits. I've had a lot of great artwork to add to my portfolio thanks to their art programs. The technology here is free and hosts a ton of expensive applications, so I take advantage of them whenever possible. I don't see what could be improved about NJIT, except for maybe the bathrooms."
Junior,5,"I love NJIT everyone here is great, hardworking and determined, there is a lot to do, and a ton of resources. I recommend NJIT to anyone that plans on making the most out of their college career and that wants big opportunities in the future!"
Graduate Student,5,"Great school for engineering students. Great faculty, infrastructure and facilities available. Friendly staff. Well stocked library. Dorms available. Food plans available. Good shuttle routes to all nearby places."
Freshman,5,"NJIT has very good diverse community that embraces every individual in the college. Also, there are many clubs that everyone can find and join. I personally like the URI, undergraduate research and innovation program that lets anyone to propose for a research and get funded to do the research. This school is truly hand-on learning style school. In the labs and technical electives, we learn basic programming and computer language which is very helpful."
Freshman,5,"I have visited a few activities on campus, and have heard a multitude of extremely good things about the university from friends, family, and colleagues,  so as a freshman, I am extremely excited to start this spring!"
Sophomore,5,It is a very underrated college and provides great opportunities for everyone. There is a lot of room for research on campus.
Sophomore,5,"Recently, I transferred to NJIT from William Paterson university. Thus far, the school has provided me with the many opportunities it has to offer. NJIT definitely a great return on investment."
Sophomore,5,I am a transfer student to NJIT the education is top quality I would recommend this school to anyone !!
Junior,5,"It's a very good college which is well connected by NJ transit. The education is tough, but it has a good reputation."
Freshman,5,"Really good college. Great things going and also many plans to improve in the future. The academics are focused on STEM, and they offer many different majors and minors for students to choose from. There is a good level of diversity. The campus is big, many resources available."
Alum,5,"Some would say that the fact that this is a relatively small school detracts worth from it. I would beg to differ. The nice thing about this place is that there is a reasonably low student to faculty ration. As a result, professors are more approachable and actually remember you. In my experience, professors have been genuinely interested in my success and have generally been available outside of class hours for questions. While not all students are motivated to learn, people are generally down to earth and easy to talk to. Overall, this is a great school where students can ultimately get out what they put in. One last thing to mention. While it is situated in Newark, not the safest city in the world, the campus safety does a good job keeping students safe. As long as you don't go out past a reasonable hour and stay on campus, safety is not a concern. Also, every city has its good and bad parts. The downtown part of the city has a nice selection of Portuguese restaurants."
Senior,5,I liked the fact that my professor's were very helpful and were willing to spend extra time with the students outside of class to help them understand the material better. The fact that the school has a bowling alley in the campus center is great as well. I think that some of the older dorms should be renovated and the dining hall should be open later at night.
Junior,5,"For a university that has a lot of diversity of students from all types of ethnic background you name. All the lectures and lab courses has a lot to offer where you're giving real world problems, giving that professional experience in your actual classroom. There are many on campus clubs/organizations that anyone can get involved with creating a experience for to students to become future leaders in the workforce. NJIT is ranked #1 on tuition/salary ratio in the whole country, meaning you your college education really worth it. Our University offers career services and a large network for many employment opportunities. NJIT really has a lot to offer to, possibilities are limitless!"
Sophomore,4,"NJIT is a great college in terms of size, cleanliness, and education. However, I would like to see more interaction on campus. The campus is very dry a lot of the time and the workers are sometimes rude. I would like to see more clubs and events on campus where everyone can get involved."
Sophomore,4,Online classes are pretty good and it was well organized even though it changed very all of a sudden.
Freshman,4,"I was a mechanical engineering major and the calculus and physics courses for freshmen were very difficult. It gave many students a significant load of stress just graduating from high school. In other words, the learning curve was steep. Otherwise, the campus was nice, clubs were engaging, student life/events were plentiful, the campus was relatively small/med (if you prefer that), and there were no shortages of food places to choose from, esp since this area also included other universities/colleges nearby; Rutgers-Newark and Essex County College. If you're worried about safety; Newark is mildly dangerous, but there are like 4 different police forces(one per college and one city) and don't stray away from university heights and you'll be relatively safe."
Sophomore,4,"The institute is an amazing school, especially, for engineering. The teachers are extremely knowledgeable in their field ."
Sophomore,4,The online experience is great. The classes are very organized online. The teacher are easy to access if you have any question as well.
Freshman,4,This University offered a satisfactory education and it was an affordable option. The instructors are very helpful to their students.
Freshman,4,"I started attending NJIT in Fall 2019. As an international student, I thought my transition would be harder but the people I've met helped me a lot in this process. In terms of academics, the courses and professors I've had so far have been very helpful. They are always eager to hear your opinions or questions during class or office hours. The food from the cafeteria is ok, but in case you don't feel like eating cold chicken you can always cook. Campus security is active, specially at night there are always police cars and officers making rounds on campus."
Freshman,4,"I am not a fan of online classes but due to the COVID situation, we had the second part of the semester from our houses. Professors learned quickly how to use the resources and enhanced the lecture quality."
Alum,4,"Extremely versatile campus. You are definitely exposed to many cultures and backgrounds, which is a mirror image of the corporate world. I do not know how the university will be after COVID-19, but I am quite sure the highlander pride will still be there!"
Alum,4,I only took one online class and it was a capstone/work experience course. Fairly simple for my major. I just had to sign in and respond to the weekly prompts.
Graduate Student,4,Good school with good feedback from professors. School could be more lively and foster a greater community feel.
Sophomore,4,"NJIT definitely has a lot of opportunities and resources. Especially considering the low cost. It is very easy to find job, internship, and research opportunities as well as become adequately prepared for a future career. Campus life is pretty quiet, but university heights is a very comfortable and safe place to be. On campus food is not the best, but downtown restaurants and food trucks are also great options."
Junior,4,"In NJIT, a smaller school, it is easier to get to know people and make friends; there is a sense of community. All of the buildings on campus are located in the same area/ block of land and the campus does not take so long to get across, making it easy to move from class to class. With Police and Public Safety Officers encircling the campus area, it feels safe."
Junior,4,I have had very good experiences/ no problems with the online courses I have taken. Online learning may not be for everyone; some people may forget to look at the online material and prefer to have an in-person-meeting class in order to attend and successfully learn the lessons.
Freshman,4,They took the situations very seriously and did their best when it came to timing. It was not easy to plan this out and had methods to help the students. Teachers were learning as we were to which they did a great job to see what works best for the students at the end of the day. The grading they implemented benefited every student since there was an option for pass/fail or a letter grade.
Freshman,4,Over all a very nice school. The same classes allows for smaller classroom sizes which is helpful to have a clear interaction with the teacher. Everyone on this campus is friendly and motivated.
Freshman,4,"Pretty difficult if you transferred. Most professors are willing to help during office hours. People are really friendly, especially those in fraternities and sororities."
Freshman,4,"My experience was not good and not harmful. I had a love and hate kind of relationship with NJIT. The only thing I would have hated about this school that they still have 80+ professors in the school, and they are having a hard time teaching, but I even don't understand that why they haven't taken retirement yet? Another thing about this school is that its not a friendly school. People are mean, and even sometimes, professors are rude as hell. But on the other side, just do it. Its national highest-ranking school and people say that it's worth it. If you don't have financial aid, then be ready to empty your pockets as fast as a rocket. The student commuter parking permit is above $300, and there is no promise that you will find the parking all the time. If you desired to get the parking, then leave your freaking house 2 hours before the class starts. You heard it right two hours before the class start.
Nonetheless, you will miss half of the course if you will leave your house"
Freshman,4,Difficult and challenging but people always ready to help. Campus life is great and staff cares about the students.
Freshman,4,New Jersey Institute of Technology is a great school with great professors. Number 2 in the nation for civil engineering. Ranged 57th top school on the nation.
Junior,4,"NJIT is a great school if you are pursuing a degree in Engineering of Technology. They offer a lo of class, therefore you have the choice to choose classes that interest  you."
Junior,4,"I enjoy the small campus setting, although some classes still lack the intimacy of small class sizes. Common exams are not my strong suit but other than that it has been a relatively good school."
Sophomore,4,"NJIT is a great place where you can really push yourself, coming from a school that didn't have much of anything it feels great to be challenged. Sometimes the school can be very tough and sometimes lax. My main problem is sometimes there are language barriers with professors but for the most part they are willing to help you and over come this challenge, at the end of the day I am a proud student."
Niche User,4,It is a good environment if you work hard and involve yourself in extracurricular activities. If you are not good at studying this would not be the environment fr you
Freshman,4,"The New Jersey Institute of Technology is a great college; however, there are factors that make people turn away from making NJIT their first choice. Personally, I have had a nice time on campus and while I am not a city boy, it is nice to break out of my shell and try to get comfortable with open areas. Newark is not the safest area, but I have felt completely safe in campus. There are foodtrucks filled with halal food that are perfect for Muslims who do not have a food plan and they are in the campus area. Getting some Halal Guys and finding nice spots inside the buildings or anywhere outside has not proved to be a difficult task as there are many places to relax and study. The professors are nice and like any school, you'll have both good and not so great ones for you. That's fine. It happens. So far, I've had a nice time at NJIT."
Freshman,4,"The atmosphere is extremely nice, students are kind and most teachers I have are encouraging and want you to succeed. They are more understanding, especially if you're a determined student. There are many resources that assist in your success."
Freshman,4,"I was so nervous coming into NJIT but the people there made me feel very welcome. I was totally lost on my first day and there were people that were kind enough to help me out. There are so many clubs to join and you should totally interact with them because they are so fun and you can make a lot of good friends there. The classes are fairly small compared to other schools, roughly around 70 people in each lecture class. The food at GDS is bland but there are a lot of great food places around, especially food trucks. The party scene is alright compared to other schools because it is Newark."
Freshman,4,"New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) is a very STEM-driven, technology-based school where most people are engineering, computer science, or technical majors. Very few people are more humanitarian or liberal arts based, and the academics are rigorous with emphasis based on math, science, and even a requirement for coding classes for everyone. It is the place for you if you are looking for great technical and STEM curriculum at a very reasonable price and love a smaller school. It is not a big party or typical ""college"" school, but it is great for innovation, research, and good academics."
Sophomore,4,"NJIT was my last choice and one of the few colleges I got accepted to. I didn't think the quality of education would be nearly as good as the top colleges such as MIT or Stanford, but I was wrong. NJIT pushes you to work hard and succeed. Classes are rigorous and enable you to use critical thinking and problem solving skills. The staff is always more than welcome to help you if you're struggling and the students are the nicest people I've met. This college is home to many clubs and extracurricular activities that suit everyone's needs. This school should be anyone's first choice."
Senior,4,I like that the professors are helpful and want you to learn. The classes are great and very beneficial for your respective fields.
Freshman,4,"NJIT is a very welcoming campus with students from all hemispheres of the world. It is a dedicated STEM school with research opportunities for any talented students. The faculty, however, may need some improvements in teaching and pedagogy."
Sophomore,4,"Since the campus is small, roughly 3-5 square blocks, it's very easy to get place to place and you'll eventually get to know everyone. There are a lot of clubs, and a lot of programs and services offered by the different departments and development services all the time. However, since the school is mostly comprised of commuter students, finding parking has been difficult lately with large incoming class sizes. Good and bad, there is always a lot of construction happening on campus, almost all the time."
Sophomore,4,"I love NJIT. I definitely made the right choice for me when choosing a college. I prefer smaller campuses, and this campus fits that. I can walk to any building on campus within 5 minutes. I also love that the number of students isn't incredibly high, but also not small. I have made great connections and friends at NJIT."
Senior,4,"Overall New jersey Institute of Technology is a great public University. As an upcoming 2020 graduate I can say that my experience at this school is a memorable one.  Is it the best school no, but it is absolutely a school I am proud of attending. There are plenty of extracurricular activities for students to be involved in, and plenty of resources that allow students be successful inside and outside of the classroom. The new maker space is a great addition that allows for new cutting edge learning. The downsides are cafeteria food isnâ€™t the greatest but that isnâ€™t to big of an issue as there are plenty of food trucks and choices around. Also the location of the university. Newark isnâ€™t the safest place, and I often would like to explore around campus but that is next to impossible in Newark."
Junior,4,"The university has a very good academic program. Networking with alumni is not difficult to do. However, the campus is constantly under construction, and the dorms are not really worth the money."
Freshman,4,It is not a party scene. The academics are rigorous and the faculty and staff are so willing to help
Sophomore,4,"Very diverse student body. Many professors are passionate in the subjects they are teaching. The campus is constantly improving and new buildings are being built. New Jersey Institute of Technology has recently built a new gym and is currently building a soccer field. While math and science classes are difficult, NJIT offers tutoring services to students who wish to improve and do better in those classes."
Freshman,4,"In terms of academics, Njit is a really good school. They know to drill information into you to make it stick."
Sophomore,4,"this school is what you make of it.  personally, I love it, I have a great group of friends and we have a lot of fun here."
Niche User,4,"I would love to see NJIT in a different location. Newark, NJ is not the most desirable. Additionally, more of a ""college"" atmosphere would make it more dynamic. What I love is the economic value. The price you pay for the college and the possible return after graduation.  It has wonderful STEM classes as well."
Alum,4,"NJIT is a great technical school. The student body is incredibly diverse and allows for students to experience a wide variety of clubs and cultures. However, the professors are sometimes hard to understand and the course work can be very challenging."
Freshman,4,"NJIT had the best Game Design major. When it comes to Game Design, NJIT offers just what I'm looking for. The structure of the building was great; even though its campus seems a little big, I still loved the way its set up. Don't get me started with the food, I loved it."
Senior,4,The school has excellent programs and scholarships available to help students afford their college education.
Sophomore,4,I like the diversity that's on the NJIT's campus. One thing I would like to improve is the campus life for students.
Freshman,4,I like that the school is very small and most professors are open to helping with all of their energy. There are an abundance of resources to go to should you need help with anything.
Freshman,4,"For a university that has a lot of diversity of students from all types of ethnic background you name. All the lectures and lab courses has a lot to offer where you're giving real world problems, giving that professional experience in your actual classroom. There are many on campus clubs/organizations that anyone can get involved with creating a experience for to students to become future leaders in the workforce. NJIT is ranked #1 on tuition/salary ratio in the whole country, meaning you your college education really worth it. Our University offers career services and a large network for many employment opportunities. NJIT really has a lot to offer to, possibilities are limitless!"
Sophomore,4,I like the new buildings and new technology being added to old buildings. I wish they would speed up the construction process for the new soccer field so that the campus would look more open and scenic. The bowling alley in the game room is a plus. I wish they would add another gameroom so it wouldn't be as packed.
Sophomore,4,New Jersey Institute of Technology does a great job at marketing their school. I knew I wanted to do computer science and they advertised their computer science program well. The opportunity at NJIT is fantastic.
Junior,4,"As a 3rd year student, I feel I have a sense of the university. It is an experience that people might confuse, but that also goes for all colleges. If you don't participate and branch out you won't be really capitalizing on your overall college opportunity. I feel I have used these resources the school offers to benefit me and I continue to still use them along the way. NJIT is a great platform for greatness, you just have to believe in yourself. They challenge you in levels that you won't really see coming, but it's all a recipe for individual development and will. They even copy the curriculum of many colleges like, Stevens and MIT, helping students to compete at one of the highest levels. As a NY resident, I know that it would have been easier, as well as cheaper, if I didn't go out of state. However, the promise and potential that I saw NJIT to have on me helped me make one of the best decisions in my lifetime."
Sophomore,4,"Amazing professors who not only teach you whats required, but other things you should be aware of. Study heavy atmosphere with students who work hard."
Sophomore,4,NJIT is a really interesting place to learn. It is located in the middle of a growing city so there is always something to do. And small size allows for the occurrence of small and close friend groups.
Freshman,4,Very helpful and knowledgeable staff. Campus is also very updated. The new Maker lab is also a great addition to the school and to the learning experience. The tuition fees are also very reasonable for in state students.
Sophomore,4,"I'm a CS transfer student from a community college. They've credited all my classes however GPA won't matter even if you're a 4.0 or a 2.5, you can start from a clean slate when you transfer here. Students can also cross register at Rutgers."
Senior,4,I like the campus and diversity. the fact that the professors are there to help you out. the number of jobs and doors you ope for yourself after you graduate from njit are tremendous. i really love the fact that it is 20 mins away from new York and we can have fun with our friends whenever we want.
Junior,4,"The best part of NJIT are the students, the whole campus is tuned to the same frequency. The community of STEM students is very close and motivated."
Sophomore,4,My favorite things about New Jersey Institute of Technology is the calm atmosphere with students who genuinely care about learning and enjoy networking with other students.
Senior,4,Institution could use more campus locations around New Jersey. Dorms can use an upgrade in terms of having facilitated kitchen space as the neighboring hall does. Most halls share one kitchen per six hundred students. Ideally dorms should look like the rooms in the Honors College. Most of the time facilities is not proactive when things such as HVAC systems break down. Student life is fairly well in the institution as it is known to be a geek school. What can improve is the department of Career Development Services: it should be implemented within the program of study that a student must take a minimum of two internships in order to graduate while at NJIT. Looking for internships is a hassle: and being located in the Greater New York area it shouldnâ€™t be a problem for the institution to form partnerships.
Senior,4,"I enjoy the downtown area. Broad Street has a diversity of shops and restaurants. The new athletic center is great for working out. They have billiards, bowling and a bar above the campus center."
Sophomore,4,"My experience so far has been really good. As a freshman this past year I was able to get in touch with a lot of people that gave me great opportunities to volunteer and participate as an active student. The professors I had this year were very helpful and were fair in their grading. I had fun making friends and was really pleased with my dorming experience. It is a diverse campus, so you'll definitely come across a lot of different kinds of people. The dining hall's food is not the best, so students get tired of it pretty quickly and you find yourself eating pizza all too often. It is a small campus and that means that you have to get creative when it comes to finding things to do. A student's best bet is definitely going downtown, which is a two minute walk from the campus."
Sophomore,4,"NJIT is a really good college. Sure the courses are harder and the professors expect a lot out of you. However, student life is really good and you could find many people with similar interests."
Junior,2,It is okay. They should give more funding the the architecture and design major rather than just adding more to the sports team. They have very nice clubs and ways to get connected with many people.
Niche User,2,"Overall I learned valuable lessons at NJIT, most of their courses are well taught and the professors are always available to help dedicated students. However, life on campus was very displeasing. Students had very little school spirit and hardly anyone participated in events hosted by the school. There is a ton of construction on campus and housing is very expensive for the amount of things wrong with the buildings. Water mains have broken leaving buildings without water, cockroaches and rats were found in dining halls and residence halls, and many things were broken by students in which you have to pay. There is not much to do around campus in Newark, and the food quality was horrible. I now have gastritis and gastroparesis and I fully attribute it to NJIT's poor nutrition and environment."
Niche User,2,"I honestly learned nothing at this school I couldn't have learned by just reading the textbooks. ""Professors"" don't care about you, neither does faculty. Some TA's were helpful. Told my advisor I was having difficulty and was told I should just drop out and try Essex County College instead. I'm so glad I left this place behind and went to a good college instead."
College Sophomore,2,"Our teams are pretty like in general, some of our fencers were nationally ranked, our basketball team nearly made it to march madness and we have soccer teams. But not a lot of their games are well attended. Mostly because NJIT is a mostly commuter school so the people who go to the games are the people living on campus but a majority of them would rather study and not go to the games. We only have school spirit whn the game might be on TV which only happens for our basketball team. The facilities are good, in fact they are undergooing a huge renovation to add more space and a higher quality gym in general. But that means currently there's no soccer field or track so that hurts the rugby team, the baseball team, the track team and of course the soccer team."
College Freshman,2,"NJIT is located in the center of Newark, which is a town with a crime problem. As long as you are with someone when stepping outside of the campus you should be fine, and stay aware when walking at night. If you feel unsafe or nervous you can call the campus security for an escort."
College Junior,2,The athletic facilities are very smelly and getting to different parts of the buildings is very confusing. most parts look creepy.
College Sophomore,2,"The athletics are very dismal and it seems that they are at the bottom of the totem pole on campus. Aside from other athletes support, not many people are aware when games are or what sports are offered. The facilities are very poor and do not offer opportunities for many intramural leagues."
College Junior,2,I am not involved. I do not know it.
College Junior,2,We often receive emails of thefts that occur around NJIT grounds. They are frightening sometimes but nothing has happened to me personally.
College Sophomore,2,It in the middle of Newark but public safety do what they can to keep the students safe.
College Freshman,2,"The Greek life at NJIT do not have much effect on the campus atmosphere. Joining the Greek life is always a great thing to do, but it is not recognized too much by the school."
College Junior,2,"Crimes around campus are bad. You can't go out alone at night, and even in a group you're putting yourself at risk. Stay on campus if possible."
College Junior,2,"The sport events aren't really attended to much, but by the fall of 2017  a $100 million new athletic center going to be opened which will definitely improve athletics and the facilities tremendously."
College Sophomore,2,"Make sure you've filled out the fafsa and make sure your parents tax information is up to date as well as your own if applicable, otherwise you may get your financial aid package delayed"
College Sophomore,2,The food served at GDS is repetitive and usually substandard and it closes way too early during the week.
College Freshman,2,Someone found a cockroach in the food one time
College Senior,2,There arent any parties that I went too or am aware off.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the school funds go to the basketball team instead of it being evenly split to all sports team.
College Sophomore,2,There not a lot of of variety and sometimes the food cost more than it's worth.
Recent Alumnus,2,Very few places to eat and you have to risk being mugged in the process at night.  Better off driving to the supermarket and making your own food.
College Sophomore,2,"The cost of food near the university is pretty expensive. The food is alright, but they are very little options especially when a person doesn't have a car to go to new places in a convenient amount of time. The pizzeria cost a lot per slice and most of healthy options are the most expensive."
College Junior,2,college is amazing but in the middle of high crime area
College Sophomore,2,the social aspect of this school is terrible but you learn a lot.
College Sophomore,2,You cannot take any classes you want to take. Everything is already made.
College Sophomore,2,"Teachers do not speak english. Big classes, Math is tough."
College Junior,2,"In the Architecture building, the ratio from guys to girls is a bit wild that it can be better, yet the work and other activity make it bad for anyone to join."
College Junior,2,Very expensive and not flexible !
College Sophomore,2,"There has been a semester of constant muggings, robberies and violence, because of the outlying neighborhoods."
College Freshman,2,Frat row is really the only place to go to find parties.
College Student,2,very old and outdated and cheap
College Student,2,"they dont really do much, they just sit there and watch everyone on the green"
College Student,2,no one really cares about them
College Freshman,2,Area isn't the best but it's for your future!
College Freshman,2,The campus shuttle mainly goes around the Rutgers campus and the downtown area with one stop at njit
College Freshman,2,Frequent snowstorms this winter has caused numerous class cancellations. The spring semester calendar may need to be adjusted because of this.
College Sophomore,2,As I say my group of friends are diverse this is not considering sexual orientation NJIT is dominantly a male school that being said most of my classes consists of one or two girls.
College Freshman,2,Snow is poorly displaced and salt is not put down properly throughout the entire campus.
College Freshman,2,Disappointed in not receiving as much aid as I had hoped for.
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of guys and not many girls. There are certain guys that are attractive in school and are hard to find. Most attractive guys are athletes. The rate of girls in school is low and guys are impressed when they find a girl that is pretty in school. People dress in their own opinion of fashion such as Muslim girls have dress codes because of their religion and other people dress in their own way.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't like the weather at all, its mostly cold, at least in the middle of the fall to the first half of the spring. You just feel a little bit of warm during both semesters."
College Student,2,"It is unlimited, which means you can go in any time you want. This rocks. However, the cafeteria's hours are awful, ending at 9 most nights. The food is mediocre at best, usually worse. However, if you are creative, you can come up with decent, edible concoctions by mixing the items from different self-serve stations. "
College Senior,2,The school teamâ€™s performances are always poor and go without notice.  I believe maybe one team has made it to the playoffs in the schoolâ€™s history.  Sporting events are not a huge part of campus life due to team performances and that is why school spirit is low.  The weight room and availability of athletic facilities are very limited to the average student.  All priority goes to student athletes with no regard to the average student.  This does not promote a healthy lifestyle for college students who are now facing health issues.
College Senior,2,"My overall experience at NJIT has not been great.  The only reason I chose the school was due to proximity and because of the Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) located on campus.  All of my favorite experiences have been with the AFROTC program.  The reason why my experience has been poor is because of the social atmosphere of the school.  I am a very social individual who thrives of the energy of those around me and this school fails to provide the students and the atmosphere to thrive socially in.  The school holds very little school functions and has very little school spirit.  The entire population of NJIT is ""clicky"" as is less welcoming to outsiders.  The professors at the school are hit or miss.  There are some great professors and there are even more poor professors."
College Senior,2,There are very few girls on campus.  The girls that are on campus are either very religious and stay with their own nationality or are usually stuck up.  Many female students are not very welcoming to meeting new people unless they already know you. 
College Senior,2,"There are 10 different places to eat on campus however, a majority of the dining places are owned by NJIT and have similar menus and taste.  The only difference between each eatery is placement throughout campus."
College Senior,2,For a student that dorm a car is not needed because there are a plethora of public transportation sources close to the campus.  For commuter students the parking is outrageous.  We pay over $200 in parking and the nearest parking where you are most likely to find parking is just short of a mile away from campus with no shuttle service.
College Senior,2,"The main focus of the school is to increase enrollment although they are failing in the retaining aspect.  The recreational facilities are always in use by the school's teams.  The weight room is small and cluttered with useless equipment that is always in need of servicing.  There are few campus events or traditions that gain enough popularity for students to go too.  The academic atmosphere is very cut throat.  Every student is there for themselves and nothing more.  The math and sciences department do not care for the students and only continue teaching just to finish the curriculum.  However I must say that the professors that are in your specialized field of study are outstanding.
"
College Freshman,2,There was really no real drug safety type thing at NJIT. Most people smoke weed but some snort coke and few drop acid. Sometimes you'll walk into a bathroom and smell pot or walk through one of the floors in a dorm and smell it. Alcohol is nearly everywhere in the dorms and the Greek village. 
College Freshman,2,There are barely any girls here. The ratios are a complete joke. I saw a total of 4 girls in my first day. Most Greek parties invite Montclair girls to their parties. A lot of the girls dress in sweatpants and almost all of them play soccer. 
College Freshman,2,"There is literally three places you can go: Subway, Pizza Hut, or a Chinese restaurant. There are no student discounts. And you should really only go there before sundown. Any time after that and you could get mugged. "
College Freshman,2,"Literally there are like two streets that you can safely walk down at night. Otherwise, don't try to walk off campus at night. Students get emails every couple weeks about a student who got mugged on the surrounding streets at night. Newark is cleaning up its act but its far from a safe neighborhood. There isn't much to do around Newark. There is a bar/club a few blocks from campus that doesn't card and the Prudential Center isn't very far either. "
College Junior,2,I would recommend anybody to live in Newark or specially around campus area. It is dangerous as there's always (almost daily) reports of robbery.
College Junior,2,"I would qualify as bad since some of the parking locations are located in the guetto. As a result, it is very dangerous to walk on these streets at night."
College Sophomore,2,"Not many students attend the schools athletics, I personally enjoy to attend but the students have no enthusiasm and the basketball court needs MAJOR updating, if it is not a good looking court such as a Duke or St.Johns why would students come and watch. The court is like a high school court its disgraceful."
College Sophomore,2,"It is only a C because we have access to the Prudential Center, so we are able to watch the NJ Devils, and access to NYC via the path train to Penn Station then NYC but other than that there is nothing to do around."
College Sophomore,2,I may have gone to a couple games but sports aren't really hyped up at our school maybe because our division.
College Sophomore,2,A lot of the courses are really easy or super hard no in between. Scheduling is okay sometimes if you get lucky but registration is very hectic.
College Junior,2,The school does not allow clubs and organizations to have stores for fundraising.
College Junior,2,The weather is usually gray and I think that affects the grades of the students. It also gives the campus a depressing feeling when walking from class to class.
Recent Alumnus,2,For a technology school you would expect better operating systems and more programs also faster processors.
Graduate Student,1,One instructor handles the online experience well. The others are talking robots.  Stick with coursera if you want value for your money
Graduate Student,1,Iâ€™m in the master of data science program and unfortunately the instructors mostly are poor. There is maybe three worth it. Only two I would ever take again.
Alum,1,"DO NOT GO TO NJIT!*

Hard facts: average 35k in DEBT in loans post-grad. Extremely low job placement statistics (for anyone who is not graduating with an engineering or design track accounting degree.) 

IF YOU ARE NOT AN ENGINEER,  they will not get you any on campus interviews besides commission-based sales with Enterprise, or some ""financial insurance agency"" that will, still, only offer commission.... THEY WILL email you continuously to leave feedback on their career placement service 3+ yrs postgrad . All of which will be SKEWED QUESTIONS to support their own agenda in stats, and increase FRESHMAN YEAR APPLICANTS. 
THEY INFLATE THEIR JOB PLACEMENT RATES. 

I graduated with a BA in '16. About 3 years for NJIT to prove they have an ""in"". Result? YOU HAVE TO HOUND COMPANIES (on your own) FOR THEM TO EVEN CONSIDER YOU.  5/100 HELP FROM NJIT Career Services."
Niche User,1,"Worst experience EVER!  This school ruined my son's life.  Rude staff, especially the housing director was nasty and disrespectful to us.  Made us pay $750 housing fee after we opted not to dorm. Walk a block or two in either direction off campus, and be prepared to get mugged. Language barrier made it difficult to understand many of the professors.  I spoke with a student on campus who said he hated it, but was only there because he was getting paid to go. Stay clear of this place! Horrible!!"
College Sophomore,1,"Professors are as many studies concluded; some of the worst in the nation. While some are very good, most are very hard to understand and do not help very much. One plus is the large variety of classes that are offered, but it is tough to deviate from the curriculum."
College Sophomore,1,"Unfortunately I would not choose my school again due to the lack of activities that are available on campus. Aside from going to class and the lone dining hall on campus, there is nothing to do and it's very often that the campus is barren as many students are in their rooms either studying all night long or playing video games. While the education is very strong, the campus life and actual campus itself make it very hard to go to school here."
College Junior,1,"I feel very lost in my school. I commute so making friends is hard. I transferred there my junior year and the transition was terrible. The method of teaching was completely different from my other school. Here the professors assume that you already know the material and just go over the basics of the material. It is hard to keep up if you are struggling. If I had to do it again, I would choose a different school or live on campus."
College Freshman,1,I'm not coming back more than likely.
College Freshman,1,im an athlete. Only athletes support athletes
College Freshman,1,TKE will have one good party and thats it
College Senior,1,Student with poor support from family should receive more aid.  All the money college receive there isnt much imporvement seen in this college.
Recent Alumnus,1,Never knew there were any parties to be honest
College Sophomore,1,"The housing is alright. However, only the honors dorm is nice."
College Sophomore,1,The food is terrible. I lost so much weight eatting it.
College Sophomore,1,There are only like two resturants to go to chinese and subway
College Sophomore,1,I am part of the athletic program and it is terrible. Our facilities are old and we do not get enough money from the school.
College Sophomore,1,"Too many guys, not enough interaction."
College Junior,1,Very unsafe to walk alone or to be in one place such as in basement study area.
College Freshman,1,Not many people live on campus most people commute.
College Sophomore,1,New Jersey Institute of Technology has closed about 4 or 5 times this winter due to the snow so it has had an effect not only on my daily commute but as well as my travels on campus.
College Freshman,1,Literally anyone can walk on to the campus. There are always robberies right by the smaller student parking lot behind the athletic center. Never walk alone at night even if its less than a block away. Students are always getting emails about someone who has been mugged. 
Recent Alumnus,1,There really is no night life except for going to friends rooms to do whatever happens.
College Sophomore,1,There is no club life at the New Jersey Institute of Technology.
College Junior,1,"The local atmosphere is terrible. NJIT is surrounded by the ""hood"". In other words, there is a high chance of someone getting shot by a stray bullet."
College Junior,1,there is limited transportation generally in the city of Newark
College Junior,1,"If you know anything about Newark, you know how not safe it is. The housing for students is ok and Frat Row is decent."
College Senior,1,"It's Newark, so don't go out at night. People who go out go to NYC for clubs. The frats are pretty lame. There aren't many girls around for the guys. Night life basically means stay inside and study or play video games."
College Freshman,1,"It's really the hood. People get mugged frequently and you get emails about it all the time. Don't go at night, especially alone."
College Junior,1,For a technology school Njit lacks in the actual technology portion such as slow and in dependable computers and outdated projectors.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Parking on campus is very difficult to find. One of the parking spaces was demolished to create more housing, which has made parking a nightmare. They have additional parking off campus, but they are mostly in the unsafe side of the neighborhood. So no one wants to park there. This new housing will make parking even more difficult with the additional students it will bring in"
College Sophomore,1,"athletic centers are small and full of people 
in student center there is no activity and nothing is going on 
libraries are ok
there is only one green space
everything about activities and hangouts suck"
Recent Alumnus,1,"They demolished one of the main lots to make room for more housing, so now the parking deck is often full and the new lot is in a sleazy looking area."
College Junior,1,New consturction â€“ The school has good facilities but they are worrying about expanding to greek housing which they demolished an parking lot. Currently the parking condition in NJIT is horrible and the issue should be adressed
College Sophomore,1,"Nothing to Do â€“ The campus is located in Newark, NJ and there is nothing fun to do here. But the upside is it is quite close to New York City. Although there are plenty of universities around the campus life sucks. Commuting would be your best option. Local atmoshpere, do NOT go off campus (it is not very safe... not safe at all actually)..."
College Sophomore,1,"Very Unhealthy, No Consideration for Religious Requirements â€“ GDS (Gourmet Dining Services) is the vendor for New Jersey Institute of Technology. GDS does not consider other religious groups (like Jews or Muslims), GDS does not provide kosher or halal food. Furthermore almost all the food is unhealthy and greasy. If you are planning on coming to NJIT and can get away without a meal plan I would do not get a meal plan because it will be a waste of your money!"
College Sophomore,1,"GDS (Gross....Er...Gourmet Dining Service) â€“ The food in the cafeteria is terrible. They have a variety of foods, but their ability to maintain that look of freshness is anything but average. They have pizza, but its looks fake when it's out for too long. The meat of the fried chicken looks fuzzy. The ice cream seems anything but made of dairy. They constantly run out of condiments and it may take days until they are refilled again. The only good thing about it is their drinks."
College Sophomore,1,Security Is Not So Great â€“ I am majoring in architecture so school requirements are that you have to buy a computer of your own and store it in school one of the main problem with this is the only security we have is swiping our IDs to enter the building at one point it was fine. But  at the end of the semester when everyone is taking there stuff back home. Some of the students got there computer towers stolen from students in their grade year. The oficials are never visible they are alwys drivin around campus and the rest are in the office. Their also isnt that many to begin with at night. they should learn that cameras are very important to have. my computer was not stolen thankfully but a couple of students in my year wer and some of them had to buy new ones. There should be some type of procedure on how to take your computer from campus.
College Junior,1,"NJIT is not an athletic oriented school. The gym for regular students is horrible and all the machines and weights are deteriorating. The student-athletes have a separate, cleaner and nicer gym. The staff is not too kind either, and the gym is very limited."
College Freshman,1,There Is a Reason They Say Bring Your Own Computer â€“ The computers that are in the labs are extremely old they range from possibly 5-15 years old. The computers are extremely slow even the log-ins
College Senior,1,No Fun at All. No school spirit.  No one attends games unless its for a large prize opportunity. Teams are not very good.

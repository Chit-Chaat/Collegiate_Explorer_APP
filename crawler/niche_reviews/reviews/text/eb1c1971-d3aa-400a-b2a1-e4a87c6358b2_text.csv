Freshman,5,I have taken a course of the summer and are current taking 3 courses. I couldn’t be more grateful to my professors who  have been very helpful and are attentive to any questions. They are easy to reach out to and have encouraged students to contact them with any issues whether it’s with technology issues or with the material. My online experience couldn’t be better!!
Freshman,5,Santa Monica college has made my transition from high school to college very easy. There are counselors available to help you every step of the way. The professors are very encouraging and understanding especially during these circumstances. Santa Monica college is amazing!!!
Alum,5,"Santa Monica College is a nice place for people who would like to transfer to a four year! The instructors there are some of the nicest and most down to earth people (At least the ones that I have taken, make sure to use RateMyProfessor). 

I would say that the campus is just the right size and the environment feels very welcoming, not to mention that there are a lot of clubs to join!"
Freshman,5,"In some ways, my ability to learn was enhanced when all classes went online. The professors were extremely understanding and offered quick feedback or answers to questions, and also were open to meeting privately over ZOOM to meet with students if need be. They took full advantage of our CANVAS platform, offering extra links and resources, and just overall taking care to organize the class sites."
Freshman,5,"The student body is extremely diverse in terms of demographics and experience. My peers include veterans, full-time working parents, senior citizens, elementary school students, folks with disabilities, folks without homes, and more. The professors at SMC are dedicated to teaching these students. They care about bettering the community and want their students to succeed. Classes are affordable. The campus is close to public transportation options, the beach, restaurants, and more. When the coronavirus pandemic started, SMC created a food drive to help feed students in need. Professors were very understanding during this difficult time."
Sophomore,5,Most of the professors are very professional and available if you need assistance. Lesson plans for online classes are very structured which I like. I am not sure how they are dealing with the pandemic and preparing to take classes online which weren't previously online so the transition will probably be difficult... but the existing online courses are run well
Junior,5,"I’ve taken online classes before and the classes are easy and great! There will always be a teachers that makes it more difficult then it actually is but when you get used to it, it gets easier"
Junior,5,"Excellent education and helpful counselors! I know some might be hesitant about going to a  community college and then transferring but honestly it’s a great way to learn more and transferring will be easy! Also the location of the school is amazing, and the campus is great and there’s so much space to roam around and take a tour.  It’s also a very diverse campus which is amazing !"
Senior,5,What i like is the campus is big and a great place to work at and also the professors over there are very nice people.
Senior,5,"It was interesting and a very good experience to work at.,,,,,,,,,,,,     Cccffdjahahshshsjsjdbdhdjdndndndndndnddndn"
Sophomore,5,My online learning experience is like no other. It has been quite easier than I initially thought. It is easy to figure out where to go and how to work the online learning system.
Sophomore,5,"This community college is amazing, there is nothing more helpful than a school full of teachers who care about you and who are willing to go the extra mile just to help you succeed in school. Santa Monica college is diverse and offers many programs to many different groups of ethnicity, that also help the students prosper and grow fluently. Great professors, great environment, clean campus, and great academics. SMC never lets their students down, thats why I give them 5 stars."
Sophomore,5,It is pretty good but it does take some getting used to. Some teachers will be very understanding and some teachers will not want to help you as much. But there are plenty of online and outside resources that they give you.
Sophomore,5,Amazing positive experience and everyone wants you to succeed! I am so happy and beyond proud to be part of the Santa Monica college community. They have an immense variety of resources to help people succeed! They want you to succeed!
Sophomore,5,This school is absolutely amazing and has exceeded all of my expectations.  They truly care about the success of each student. There are many programs available to help students with diverse backgrounds achieve success in their academic careers.
Freshman,5,Smc is great for people not sure what they want to do yet in life. They are number in transfer in the state so it’s also great for moving on after you’ve found what you want to do.
Freshman,5,The online classes are great also. The teachers really care about their students and want to see them be successful in their class also they give you all the help you want.
Junior,5,Diverse students. Teachers are great!! so many opportunities for anything academic endeavors. Very relaxing campus.
Junior,5,we do use canvas. A portion of homework is done online. Professors are typically good at keeping the online resources or homework organized. They may even have their own website.
Sophomore,5,"Online classes are very structured and easy to access. They are usually backed with very clear instructions and helpful professors who are available through the software the class is offered through or through email. It is amazing how much you can learn in an online setting, while still sitting at home. These flexible classes make it easier to attend school under any circumstance that would keep an individual away from the campus."
Sophomore,5,"I liked the diverse and welcoming environment. Every student is welcomed and is thought of as a special and unique student with extraordinary potential. This environment, mixed with the exceptional, kind, thoughtful, and caring professors made this school a truly enjoyable experience. They offer intriguing classes with highly qualified professors and each students needs are met with upmost care. It was an inspiring and and fun experience."
Sophomore,5,The only time that I took online was when the Covid situation came and I honestly can say that zoom was not the right fit for me just because I am more of an in person learner. How ever I will be taking online classes this Fall semester and I am very excited for that and prepared.
Sophomore,5,Love the campus and the few professors I have taken were great! Also has a high rate in transfers to Cal States and UC's.
Junior,5,After graduating high school I attended SMC for three years and I am proud to say it was one of the best decisions of my life. I am now graduating with my Associates of Liberal Arts and will be transferring to a four year in the fall. There were many different programs and clubs to join as well as getting help from counselors. I also did work-study the entire three years I was there. I worked in the financial aid office and that opened my eyes to the importance of funding your schooling and looking for scholarships. I am very grateful for my opportunities at Santa Monica College.
Sophomore,5,I took an art history class online and it was very easy! Very easy to build your schedule around it if you have work commitments or sports you participate in.
Junior,5,"I met some amazing people at this college, some lifelong friends who I will cherish forever, I met many like-minded people with similar goals as mine, attended different clubs and picked up on many new skills."
Senior,5,"I attended Santa Monica college for 3 years as a part time student. Within this time I was able to maintain a 4.0 GPA. I love SMC, they provided all the tools necessary  to help me succeed and transition into the next academic level, UCLA."
Senior,5,"As a non traditional student, my online learning combined with on campus classes was excellent. I was able to succeed in my studies and will be transferring UCLA in the fall of 2020."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Santa Monica college are my most favorite place to be ,everything there is so beautiful and peaceful , even the professor are amazing and caring they give me so many good advice and guidance, also the students are very friendly and helpful whenever I need them it’s like a second home , with SMC I feel like I would be lost they provide me safety in every way, I hope to see everyone again"
Sophomore,5,"My online experience are good, I just love having online classes it’s much easier and helpful because everything is digital and you don’t have to get up and leave but online is amazing you don’t have to worry about anything but finish your assignment on time and participate in the work nothing too big , you can’t go wrong with being online but probably sending the wrong message to someone."
Freshman,5,I have taken many online classes and they are pretty relaxed. They aren't too hard at all and can be pretty interesting
Sophomore,5,"Online learning has been easily accessible and not hard to adapt to. While it’s different from traditional learning, the professors have made the experience overall fairly simple!"
Sophomore,5,Santa monica college is an amazing school! The campus is great with lots to do. The beach is just a short bus ride away and you never feel bored!
Sophomore,5,"SMC is one of the best places to start college life. It improves your academic skills and it helps you to engage with good causes. I have learned a lot from my professors and workshops during my studies. The material is great and truly makes the student think about their lives and attitudes. It's not just one more subject that you will study to earn credits, it's about the ""material of life"" because you can really bring what you learn from SMC to your daily life. Besides, there are lots of groups and communities that make you engage with good and real causes. The best thing about Santa Monica College is that they are concerned about their students and make what is possible to help them achieve their goal. Most professors are always present and willing to help. I have been in love with the work of SMC counselors, which they try to understand your experience and prepare you to next steps. I just love SMC and I'm so happy that I had the opportunity to study there."
Sophomore,5,"My online learning is doing great! The quality of my classes are still the same as on-campus classes. I'm really impressed with my professor and with SMC workers after the ""stay at home"" order from COVID-19. They are doing their best and I'm so thankful for having them in my life."
Alum,5,I participated in the Scholar's Program with Santa Monica College for a year and a half. I loved it! The classroom sizes were smaller and the professors really engaged with you. I learned so much and took so many interesting classes while at SMC.
Sophomore,5,Santa Monica College is a great college!! I would recommend this Community College to anyone. The campus is very diverse which I like.
Sophomore,5,"Santa Monica College is wonderfully nurturing place. The professors are knowledgable and caring on the whole. The campus is beautiful and well equipped.  Also, SMC has many great resources, clubs, etc, which make for a positive experience and help you to achieve your transfer goals."
Sophomore,5,Teachers there are very supportive and they care that you do well.  There is a great Wellness Center.
Niche User,5,It is affordable and very convenient with a great campus! Easy to navigate and the workers are very kind and helpful. Professors are also very attentive and try their best to help when you don't understand a concept.
Junior,5,"The atmosphere at Santa Monica College is one that always makes you feel welcomed and encouraged to succeed. I've met so many wonderful mentors, counselors, professors, and faculty that have supported me in my journey through school, and encouraged me throughout it. With so many leadership opportunities and different ways to get involved in student life, there's an individual experience to be had by each and every student. Safety of students and faculty, especially in light of the recent pandemic, has been at the forefront of administrators minds and highly influences decisions made on campus regarding students. Going to SMC has honestly prepared me for higher education and to be a leader. I believe education is a right, and SMC has made great efforts to make it equitable, and always seemingly trying to improve. As someone who has worked with faculty behind the scenes, I truly know that they care; they care about me, how I'm doing, and what lies in my future!"
Freshman,5,"It's a good school and excited to go back, the campus is always clean and gives you a general safe feeling. You can always go to the school with confidence to be able to learn."
Sophomore,5,This institution has been by far the biggest blessing. I've met the most amazing students and professors that all really want each student to succeed. I will forever be grateful especially to the Adelante program and Black Collegians program for giving us so many opportunities and emotional support. SMC is home and the people will forever be family!
Sophomore,5,The professors care about you succeeding further in your education. Everyone is rooting for you. You really feel supported not just by the faculty but by the students as well.
Sophomore,5,SMC is an amazing school that actually cares about its students. Counselors are there 24/7 to help with anything and you can study almost any major here. Great school for transferring! They pay a lot of attention to safety here too with campus police right there.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy how my school is there for you . If you need anything smc has the resources for you . Since this whole covid 19 thing has happen and school has let out smc has been doing their best to provide students with the resources that they need . I don’t ever feel like I don’t have anyone because teachers , staff members , principal , the programs I am end are always making sure I get the resources I need to be successful at this institution. Even before this happened I had several of places to go if I ever needed something that would help me academically. I have several of teachers that are there to support me even when I’m not enrolled in the class anymore . Everybody wants to see everybody win and that’s what I love about smc ."
Junior,5,"As a Santa Monica College student, this college is hands down the greatest community college in California. They offer a great deal of help for free, and the administrations of this school greatly care for their students. The staff here are also greatly honored as they themselves come from different areas of life and achievements and can be respectable to be in a class with one."
Sophomore,5,"Santa Monica College is a great school to attend, especially if you are planning on transferring. The counselors really helped me make sure I had everything I needed to transfer, and I will now be transferring to a university. The professors are great and helpful, and I've only had good experiences with them so far. I would definitely recommend coming to this school to get GE's done and to save money, all while receiving a great education."
Freshman,5,"I love SMC because i can find every thing  that  i need in this college

It has the best classes  and best gym

they are in the best area close to the beach"
Sophomore,5,I really love the overall environment. I wish I can pursue my dream after transferring to other universities to get the degree. I came back to my home country due to COVID-19.
Sophomore,5,"Santa Monica College has many great resources for students, such as free tutoring for many different subjects, and free counseling. Campus life however, is not that exciting due to being a commuter school. Everyone leaves after their classes are over."
Freshman,5,"The campus is beautiful and the welcome center is awesome. I hope the course can be more diverse and we can have more student clubs. The opportunities of volunteering are a little bit less, I hope I can get more volunteering opportunities in the college."
Junior,5,The First-Year Staff is very helpful! Where they set you up in all of your classes and make sure that you are fully helped with. Even the professors guide you to resources when you cannot succeed at home. the Library staff is always there to help you through a program or research paper. The Campus is open until 10:30 which allows students to stay there after their classes in the library to do whatever they need on the computer. Even a cafeteria is a place where you can go and study. There are so many places where students can just lay on the grass and enjoy the weather.
Freshman,5,"Smc is a very great college with amazing professors who care about their students, yes there are bad professors here but you have to be smart and pick the best professors to make your experience easier and better. The counselors are amazing and they do their best to help you succeed."
Sophomore,5,I LOVE SANTA MONICA COLLEGE! There are so many incredible programs and teachers. I had an English teacher who graduated from Harvard!  They really do their best to make the school a community. I made so many friends on campus and in classes without even trying. They also do a great job at focusing on sustainability. The school really cares and it makes me so happy. They also have an incredible transfer rate.
Freshman,5,"What I enjoy most about going to Santa Monica College is you have the ability to meet so many people, form so many different walks of life. The faculty is super helpful and the campus is great."
Freshman,5,"I like how the campus is very fresh and clean, there is a lot of diversity here and friendly people with awesome professors. It provides various opportunities to excel in your career interests, and offers a variety of clubs and sports to join. Counselors and staff are always willing to help out with whatever problem you may have."
Senior,5,"Santa Monica college has been very helpful in allowing me to experiment with the various classes offered. Coming from a low income community there were not many interesting classes that would inspire me to try new subjects. Before SMC I did not know what anthropology was, but after taking all of the anthropology classes i decided to major in it. This just goes to show how impactful having a wide variety of subjects can make to people who were not fortunate enough have that available to them in their immediate community."
Sophomore,5,"This is a great 2-year college. The professors here are top-notch, and the school puts great emphasis on transferring to 4-year colleges and universities (it's #1 in transfers to UCLA), and offers a variety of support resources for the basics (English and Math). I'm very happy with my decision to attend here."
Freshman,5,I like that Santa Monica is very diverse and accpeting of everyone. Everyone is involved in some sort of program or club on campus and there is something always going as well.
Alum,4,"The thing about online classes is that one has to make sure to be on top of their schedule. It is very easy to miss assignment deadlines and online quizzes. 

I would recommend that you take easy courses online such as writing or political science since it is more forgiving. Save the more challenging ones such as your Math and Science classes for in person so that you can get the proper help from either the instructor or a fellow classmate."
Sophomore,4,"The online classes are constantly expanding. The professors are aware of the limits involved in the online study, therefore, many offer in-class tutoring and/or zoom office hours for extra support."
Senior,4,I've met a lot of amazing people that are willing to help me achieve my goals in life. My professors have been very helpful in making sure that I understand the material.
Graduate Student,4,"Since I lived far and had to commute over and hour to reach campus, online classes were a lifesaver in helping me save money for gas and other expenses. It's best to take classes that are only offered on campus in the Fall and Spring semester, and to prioritize online classes for the Winter and Summer since the semester is shorter. It is a lot of work, so make sure you utilize your time wisely and don't fall behind on assignments as it can be hard to catch up. Using the ratemyprofessor app can help you find a teacher that fits your preference or work ethic, such as wanting a professor who is strict or one who gives less written work. The app is used by students who have had the professor before, so it is useful for online classes where it likely you won't meet them in person. All assignments are done on CANVAS, and often times the professor will provide you a digital form of the textbook which can save you from buying one. The classes are very informative and I highly recommend them."
Graduate Student,4,"I have finished attending SMC for two years, and will be attending a CSU school this Fall. I am grateful that SMC was my first college because my edplan was concise and remained on track for the duration of my time. The counselors helped me plan the classes I needed to graduate and be accepted as an art major with my GE's and IGETC completed, letting me earn two AA's and an ADT which helped me in my transfer application. I left feeling accomplished at attending a community college and would recommend from experience that freshmen utilize all the services provided by the school. Although I had payed for everything out of pocket without any financial aid, other students told me how SMC was helping them financially remain in school, and that the financial aid services and offers were beneficial to low income families and students. There are many clubs, and I made friends that I trust and who've helped me pass my classes. The parking can challenging but I'm proud to be a student from SMC."
Sophomore,4,"The classes on ground are great and are very engaging. You get to interact with your teachers and classmates, whereas online is much different. The classes online are pretty hard, you get more work, and you have to have lots of self discipline."
Sophomore,4,"Santa Monica College offers a variety of different classes that can either help you fulfill your G.E. Requirements or even help with your career goals. The classes are a bit hard, but the professors are fairly good. The campus is big and clean for a community college. Admission is pretty easy. Campus life is smooth. There are also many clubs offered at the school to help you, including EOPS and Black Collegians that help you pay for books and get priority enrollment."
Freshman,4,"As a new student entering the college life during a global pandemic it's really hard to keep track of things like school and work. Santa Monica college has made it easy for me. They have resources such as QLines so you can get into contact with a councelor and they answer very quickly as well. You will run into staff who just sound like they don't want to be there but that's everywhere. My experience with one councelor made me feel very welcomes at SMC. They make sure all those resources are available to you virtually. I want to say it's been a great first couple of weeks enrolled as a student. Because of them, I won't be paying full enrollment because of their financial help. Love it so far!"
Freshman,4,"All of my classes are taking place online because of the pandemic. What's great about being at a community college is that, yeah you have the help and the tools they give you to start out, but what's most important is that you get to decide the type of schedule you want, they have an easy resource to do pick your classes and check out the proffessors. I would definitley recommend SMC if you wanted  a school that helps you out independently."
Sophomore,4,I'm a fairly new student but SMC has really been a good experience thus far despite what had happened post-pandemic.
Sophomore,4,"I had taken two courses online and although it is a lot of work the professors were constant communication with us and kept the students involved, engaged, and very open to answering all of our questions and concerns."
Alum,4,"The professors did a very good job transitioning to online learning. While some were confused, they adapted quickly and students were able to keep up."
Sophomore,4,I ususally do not take online classes only in person classes. But because of the pandemic  I  we switched over to online classes and the transition has been quite smooth. We usually have either youtube videos and assignments we have to watch and do each day and then for exams we have zoom meetings. O r we have zoom lectures.
Sophomore,4,"It is a greats school. It has plenty of resources. For example, it offers different types of support programs for each major, such as the stem program for stem majors. The stem program helps you find stem related internships, and research opportunities. Moreover, it also has many great professors. Additionally, the school has a very welcoming environment. Furthermore, they are really committed to making sure you are able to successfully transfer to a 4 year university. They make sure of this by letting you know which classes you are supposed to take in order to transfer."
Junior,4,"The campus is pretty decent and the smaller class sizes are a bonus for students like me, who tend to make the effort to get to know their professors. Classes are the mostly reasonably priced out of any college I've seen so far"
Sophomore,4,"Santa Monica College has a great selection of courses and the campuses are very nice and clean. Academically, my professors have all been very professional and inspiring. The one thing I would improve about Santa Monica College is its lack of student body unity and school spirit. There are many older adults who attend classes here and the diverse age groups and background of the students make it difficult to connect and build friendships."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at SMC was great, much better than I expected actually. I attended this college as it was very close to my parents home, so I did not have to drive much nor did I have to pay to live on campus, the party life at SMC is next to nonexistent, it's the type of school you go to get into a 4-year university. The food was okay but not great, the campus is safe but could be safer, and overall it's a beautiful school to go to get the education you need."
Junior,4,"It was good. Classes are hard to find and it is very crowded, but teachers are good. They could teach better and be more clear in explaining the subject."
Freshman,4,Good school. Good classes. I like that there are different types of people to talk to and meet. It is a good place to be. Parking isn't good though so its smart to have morning classes
Sophomore,4,"From what I can rate it. Santa Monica College is where you get a lot of different people who want to get an education, from the lower economic status of the world who are taking out loans to start out their American education. To people of the higher economic class. Everyone is here trying to obtain their transfer, and meet new people and friends. I love the college campus for that sense. Got to hear their life and what they wanted to do and see what kind of fun personalities they have. The only downside to the place is the mediocre food, and the occasional slacking classmates which can potentially bring down classroom atmosphere. Other than that, everyone out here is always social and the professors do try their best from having high patience of our questions. And always being up to date on the social support system and help the school or city offers and forwards it all to their students. A prime example are constant updates I get about potential help to recieve because of Covid19."
Sophomore,4,"Online classes, so far in my experience have been good. The ones I enjoy the most are recorded lectures that my professors post for us to view on our own time and take notes at our own paste. It helps a lot because you can fast forward to or replay parts you don't understand. They know that teaching via Zoom isn't the same as a live classroom, so they made the appropriate accomodations to suit the needs of the situation. Zoom is not the most ideal, but my professor has been trying to make the best of the situation"
Sophomore,4,"it can be a little different to learn topic that are better to learn in person, like a laungues or mathematics."
Sophomore,4,"I've had a good experience on this campus, most teacher add real world topic to what they teach you. They also aren't scarred to admit that they don't know everything. They want to learn with you"
Freshman,4,"SMC is a really great school—great location, pretty good classes/professors, and lots of support. However there’s always room for improvement, especially with some of the student services. I sometimes find that I’m getting more information from the school website than what the people who are supposed to help in person give. Other than that, can’t wait to finish off in 2021!"
Freshman,4,Santa Monica college provides many opportunities for their student's success. They have a variety of class options and a great transfer rate to many top universities.
Sophomore,4,"SMC is a good school, I really had a good time there. I am an international student and I was really happy to see the wide diversity on campus. The location is perfect, the teachers are great and are often teachers at 4-year colleges which allows us to be well prepared if we want to transfer to a university. You won't find a big party scene or a lot of athletics at SMC but it's a great place to make friends compared to other community colleges."
Sophomore,4,"Santa Monica College is a great place to start your college experience, as it has great classes, transfer resources, and it is cheap. You will save an incredible amount of money while getting your GE's done, and then you can just transfer to a 4-year university with the specific program that you want. The campus itself is really nice. With the exception of a couple buildings on campus, most buildings are new and it is a great environment to study in. I would really recommend SMC as a stepping stone to earn your degree, or just to try out a few different classes if you are interested in a particular subject."
Sophomore,4,"Santa Monica College is a great college since it contains diverse associate programs and is helpful for transferring to many in-state, out-of-state, and private four year universities.  The campus is beautiful and surrounded by shops, fast food and small restaurant, and is only 1.6 mile from the Santa Monica Pier. The professors are amazing and care about their students. SMC  is affordable and helpful with helping students achieve their goals and dreams."
Niche User,4,"What I like about Santa Monica College is the way classes are taught. The professors know their material very well, and they know how to convey the information well. The library is fantastic for getting work done and the college provides ample resources for students."
Freshman,4,"Teachers are great, they dedicate their time to students and hope that the students understand the concept. Campus is very clean. Lots of places to sit and many quiet places to study besides the library."
Sophomore,4,"Santa Monica College is a great place to go if you are looking to transfer quickly and get into your dream school. SMC offers classes that are rigorous and affordable, which is very important to students trying to graduate debt-free. SMC has tons of clubs and groups on campus that make it easy to build a set of extra curricular for internships, jobs, or transferring, while also facilitating and fostering friendships among students who might otherwise, not interact with one another (SMC is definitely a commuter school)."
Freshman,4,"Santa Monica is such a diverse school. First of all, nice location, beautiful location actually. Every one is nice to each other and the classes are diverse with so many majors for everyone and I get why its number one as transfer rate. The campus is beautiful and modern. One thing that put down the star is that sometimes the financial aid office is somehow occupied all the time"
Niche User,4,"I've been researching the university for months. During this research I came across Santa Monica College, a university that I immediately liked. I'm not there yet, but I'm starting in September. However, it already gives me a feeling of welcome, as well as accepting all the boys who apply, it is also inexpensive and can therefore be attended by many people depending on their salary."
Junior,4,Santa Monica college has great options monthly for elective classes.. I've been for 2-3 years and I have had no complaints. 📊📊📊📊
Freshman,4,"A freshman at SMC is difficult because your in different environment than your High School. Honestly, SMC has some good Professor and advise people to do research to get the best professor. Diversity is clearly here, people are nice and talkative and the staff are the best . There really out their to help every student succeed just simply ask for help:)"
Freshman,4,Santa Monica College offers a wide range of courses that makes it easier to find a class or topic that interests you. However one negative aspect about SMC is the office staff. I have found them to be uncooperative and rude at times.
Freshman,4,The schools environment is chill. There’s lots to do and see in between classes. Some teachers are harder than others just like any other school.
Niche User,4,"Fast and easy admission process. Helpful staff and student workers who get you easily accustomed to the school. A lot of resources on campus--learning resource centers, affordable printing locations, diverse population, a lot of classes for every major. Cafeteria needs a lot of work. A lot of first time professors (which sometimes doesn't help your learning or your grade). Overall pretty satisfied for it being community college."
Alum,4,i really love smc. most of my professors are very helpful and want success for every student. not to mention most are very understanding when it comes to other obligations.
Sophomore,4,I enjoy Santa Monica very much not only for the beautiful campus but in my experience the teachers are very helpful and willing to go the extra mile if you are. Parking can be a drag if yo have classes on more than one campus
Junior,4,"One thing I must say about this college here at Santa Monica , is that they give you full on support and the staff members are quite friendly. When ever your in need for understanding of math that offer free Amati tutors in the math lab which is such a blessing! If there’s a will there’s definitely a way! ☺️"
Junior,4,"I've been going to SMC for Three years like at any other college it has its ups, and downs but overall its a good experience I would say myself. At this junior college you will get the necessary tools you'll need to achieve once you transfer, or get your AA."
Sophomore,4,Santa Monica College has been great for me. Most of my professors also teach or have taught at highly respected 4 year universities. The campus is beautiful and always improving with modern renovations. I would like to see more support for parenting students and students with dependents. I am founding a club for students with dependents this fall to make our experience a better one.
Freshman,4,"i enjoy studying in santa monica college. professors are nice, patient, and very willing to help their students to do well. the school provides free academic help for students who needs it. also, the school recognizes students who do well in school, by providing them job opportunities as a tutor / SI / TA. the only downside is that the school food is horrible (and maybe quite a old campus). other that that, everything is perfect! :)"
Sophomore,4,"There are lots of opportunities here - especially when it comes to transferring out; it's #1 for transfers to the UC system, for instance. Don't get the wrong idea and think that means you'll ""magically"" be able to transfer to your dream school, though. Ultimately, it's what you make of it - as with many things in life."
Freshman,4,"My education at Santa Monica College assisted me in getting accepted to the University of Southern California for the spring semester of 2020! I took mostly general education classes that were usually interesting, and I learned a lot. It was easy to apply for financial aid through the financial aid office, and I had a great experience with a counselor that assisted me by helping me pick my classes. However, the atmosphere of a community college was quite discouraging, because no one really talked to each other. I spent most of my time with friends from high school and working when I was not at school or studying. I took 15 credits, and although it was a lot of work, it was manageable and I recommend taking 15 credits to anyone that wants to show a 4-year school they mean business!"
Freshman,4,"Santa Monica College is excellent for students who value diversity, education, and want to save some money along the way. You'll find all kinds of students here with fascinating stories to tell. Academics are high quality. You will definitely be able to find classes that interest you and professors that inspire you. One of the downsides of community college is the supposed lack of social life, but there are plenty of clubs to join. As long as you get involved you should be fine. Two things I'm not happy about at this school are the lack of cleanliness on campus and the poor quality of food. The campus itself is quite pretty, but some places aren't as clean as they should be. The bathrooms are atrocious. Food is also a solid 2/5. You'll find variety from ""Chinese"" food to salads to sandwiches, but they'll all be overpriced and poorly made. There are plenty of places to eat outside campus for much cheaper, so I would recommend that or bring your own food from home."
Sophomore,4,The professors were very good in terms of their teaching style and desire for the students to succeed. I felt very connected to my professors and felt that they truly wanted me to succeed in my major.
Sophomore,4,"Generally a good school for students from all over the world and start their academic career.  It has great resources to support students especially for transferring students.  The clubs and programs they offer are also helpful, but the price of the house near the main campus is expensive."
Junior,4,"One of the things I really enjoyed about Santa Monica College is that it has Phi Theta Kappa, perhaps the most prestigious honors society ever. It is also an excellent place to start when a student needs to transfer to another college. The professors are great, the academics are very solid, and there are plenty of resources available to the student. I just wish that there is more room for diversity of thought, or at least encourages a dialectical discussion."
Alum,4,"This was a good transition in between high school and university. The professors and counselors are more helpful than at a university, but let you discover your independence and help you better prepare to transfer."
Sophomore,4,SMC is a great school to go to when transferring. The resources are great so take advantage and also the counselors are invested in making sure you're on the right track. It is best to see two or three different counselors to make sure all your requirements are fulfilled.
Sophomore,4,"SMC is a great 2 year college that offers several resources to help you tranfer to university. I have attended many workshops that thoroughly inform students about applying to California State Universities, University of California institutions, and private or out of state schools. I met many professors who are enthusiastic about forming close relationships with their students, and willing to help beyond their class with favors such as letters of recommendation or assistance with balancing school and work. Although Santa Monica College is one of the best community colleges, some teachers and faculty members did not seem well versed in their position (which is the case in all schools). Just make sure to look up your professors online before enrolling in their class, and seek out a good admissions counselors."
Freshman,4,What I love about Santa Monica College is the atmosphere at the college. Everyone is so optimistic about there career and for the most part are extremely positive and hard working. That kind atmosphere not only allows the individual to strive for excellence but others around as well and makes the investment to SMC worth it.
Sophomore,4,"This school was my last option since I did not have the funds to go to a 4 year. I love everything about this school from the area to the professors. There is plenty of help for anyone who asks too. One thing I did not like about this school is the lack some professors have on their students or students attending here not keeping the school clean and professional. Overall, no school is perfect."
Freshman,4,"Santa Monica has great classes, but they aren't challenging and they don't put much consideration into parking for students. Very transfer friendly school though."
Junior,4,Professors that care about their job and their students. Helpful campus resources from school clubs to life counseling where you can definitely find your place as a student. As well as academic counselors that are there for you when you need them regarding classes.
Freshman,4,Santa Monica college is a great school to go to! They provide many opportunities to discover what you are truly passionate about!
Senior,4,"Santa Monica College has great teachers for being a community college and is one of the best when it comes to transfers. They have a great curriculum and other universities know that which is why they accept many transfers from here. 

The problems are while some of the infrastructure is new, a lot is over 50 years old and are not fit for modern classes. They also do not offer many trade classes and seem to be cutting more unique classes for more generic classes that everyone needs and that is killing the school. Also, the parking needs a lot of work."
Freshman,4,"They have good supporting programs for international students, but the tuition for international students is too expensive."
Alum,2,"Santa Monica College is a commuter school for the local high schools. I ended up transferring to an incredible school, but I do feel like I did not get much help from the school. The counselors continuously recommended incorrect classes and the tutors only meet with you for 10 minutes at a time, which often times is not enough. I did a lot of research on my own to find the correct classes and had to find outside help for my classes. This school is great for people who are determines and hardworking. If you feel you need a lot of guidance, this may not be the school for you."
Freshman,2,"What i liked about SMC is that there's a lot of diversities.  In addition, the professors there are really welcoming and they do seem to care about the students academics. However, if you're a math student in the math department, the professors there aren't really courageous and lack in support and teaching the students well."
Alum,2,"This community college offers no guidance. I was there for 4 years taking GE classes. The counselors did not guide me at all. One advisor told me I should reconsider becoming a Nurse. How can an individual crush a young persons' dreams. Instead of pushing me and offering assistance an a clear pathway as to the classes required they just gave me a page with classes and told me to choose from that. I wasted 2 years of my life taking classes such as Media, Child development and Geography. Classes I truly did not need to take. Most hyped transfer college but honestly the least helpful."
Freshman,2,It is very hard to make friends at a commuter college.No one really feels involved with the school and everyone is yearning to transfer.
Sophomore,2,"Overrated, but considering the other options in Los Angeles it is pretty good. Professors are stretched to thin by the system and they are truly not committed for your growth. The counselors are not very qualified  for the job, I can only say this after my experience of cross referencing what they said with other from major universities. Facilities were poor, unless  you play football (brand new facilities for them)."
College Senior,2,Courses fill up fast!!! You must be ready to crash courses if possible.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The career center is absolutely atrocious, and the councilors offer little support. You have to make your own plan, the councilors are overwhelmed with the number of students, and generally attempt to rush you out of the door as fast as possible."
College Student,2,"The courses are convenient and professors are typically good, however, the web system they use to administer the program is terrible. Doesn't work with Mac well, doesn't operate on any iOS operating system newer than 5. The whole web system is set up in frames, so even if you can access on your mobile device or tablet, you can't scroll inside the frame to see the entire document or page. 24/hr customer service never knows how to fix issues (spent upwards of 2 hours on phone one time with no fix) and on campus support never returns phone calls."
College Sophomore,2,The work is useless and at times the workload is too much
College Sophomore,2,It is very very difficult to find a job on campus especial for International students. I can say  possibility of getting a job on campus is twenty percent. Career center is medium.
College Sophomore,2,"I don't know anything about student government, and I am not sure if most of the students are aware too."
College Sophomore,2,"School fee is very expensive especially to International students. Education provision is good but it just too much expensive.

Am an International student we are limited about financial aid to get."
College Freshman,2,"The workload when taking online courses is like triple as if you were taking traditional classroom courses. There is no professor/student relationship, of course you can email the professor but most of the time it becomes a pain to deal with and there can be many misunderstandings. There's a discussion page for peer-to-peer interaction but again, there can be many misunderstandings."
College Senior,2,I feel like yes you have to seek help from the staff but there are times in which seeking help can confuse you further or seer you off  the right path. Its your future you just have to find the right counselors and staff to help your needs.
College Senior,2,My major is Nursing to become a Physician Assistant. It is very difficult to be considered this major in this campus because its highly competitive the point you wonder is this even a community college or a job search. The circular for this major is very in tune with the sciences. We have great science programs which make it quite easy.
College Junior,2,"I came into the school as an out of state student and I do think those fees are extremely over priced. It took me two years to become an instate student which the admissions office made very difficult. For two classes as an out of state student I paid $2,600. This was so much but now that I will finally be considered in state I find those fees reasonable."
College Junior,2,There aren't many programs or courses for architecture.
College Senior,2,"I have never experienced a more competitive environment. Everyone is in and out trying to get their stuff done which is good but I experienced a lot of people just trying to get the A and not there to learn which was even more stressful for me. I want to learn and understand everything I am being taught but when people are trying to just get the a, it opens the environment up to more deception in the classroom. Some people are very nice and helpful but mostly I have experienced people who are not willing to help and just want to get ahead of everyone."
College Senior,2,"n some classes, we do things that have nothing to do with our studies and I feel like it is a waste of time and money to be in those classes. The facilities are run down, dirty, and small."
College Senior,2,There are not really things to do other than taking classes. People are trying but it's not really obvious.
College Senior,2,There are not opportunities or internships for my major at all.
College Senior,2,International students have to pay about 6-7 times more than the domestic.
College Freshman,2,"There is hardly any Campus activities, the library computers are extremely old making it difficult to do certain things, and the staff members are always in a bad mood."
College Freshman,2,I dont know if my school has a career center or an alumni network..
College Freshman,2,"Getting classes is extremely difficult and when your enrollment date comes along, a lot of the classes you need are taken."
College Student,2,"The computer lab is okay, I have my own computer so my opinion is not very in-depth on that aspect. I will say if you expect to be able to hook up to the wireless internet on campus, don't count on it. Even when I manage to get access to it the internet is very slow as far as wireless goes. The printing on campus is an easy set-up and if you pay the student member fee you can get about $15 worth for free, the wait can be long though."
College Senior,2,"Counselors not always knowledgeable, took more classes than I should have because nobody told me my credits might be transferable (despite having spoken to several counselors) until my last quarter"
College Sophomore,2,"If I can change one thing about my college it would be the class registration process because it's very hard for a student like me to get into the course that I need. Courses are often full too quickly and it aggravates the process of making sure that I am a full time student. It is very unfortunate that I have to hunt for available seats for almost any class. On the other hand, the study option vary from individual to group studies and one on one tutoring sessions."
College Sophomore,2,"I am an AB540 students and finding the right assistance for financial aid at my college is very difficult. The tuition at my college is fairly high compared to what the student gets out of it. Although, I have no financial aid assistance as of right now, I work to find other ways that help me in paying for textbooks, college materials, etc.. such as joining opportunity programs and assistance"
College Junior,2,"The Career center i have no idea where it is located and what i can find there, we need more help in informing the students of everything posible. "
College Junior,2,I have never been told where to find resources nor where to locate the counselor or any basic functions  
College Junior,2,Really Hard for me to get any financial aid at all 
College Senior,2,Most people are there to get their credits and transfer. Most kids commute and have a social life outside of school that they stick with. 
College Senior,2,"All staff is painfully difficult to deal with, their website is outdated, if you are trying to get in-state tuition after one year of residency just forget about it because they give you this paper with all the guidelines on it and then they tell you something completely different a year later when you go in to get residency, the facilities are absolute crap, and there are over 30,000 students on such a small campus so forget any intimate experience, and you can forget about parking on campus because it's next to impossible."
College Sophomore,2,Fairly typical for a community college. They offer free bus rides with your student ID which is nice.
College Junior,2,I haven't really seen and helpful resources that come with the school thus far
College Junior,2,sometimes they can be very helpful but the school is big and sometimes you cant find a certain building because its on the other campus
College Junior,2,sometimes the network disconnects and tat is not helpful when im researching a paper
College Senior,2,I have had issues with the wifi connections in certain buildings on campus; some weren't as good as others. We have a couple different computer labs and there are outlets everywhere to plug up power cords. Wireless access is available for all enrolled students.
College Junior,2,"Even though my parents aren't paying for my college, I couldn't get any money because of they're high income. I specifically stated I was paying for my own college not by choice but because my parents will not pay for it, yet I didn't recieve even close to the amount of money that I needed to ensure my full potential."
College Sophomore,2,"Unless you're in the Scholars program at SMC, your registration deadline is horrible. You don't get a good date to enroll into classes because they give everyone else priority. It's important to see if anyone can hold classes for you because otherwise your screwed! I can't tell you how many times my schedule got screwed up due to my registration date. I wish the professors were more involved, but I understand how difficult it may be because the class sizes are huge. We have a large student body and hundreds of people are trying to crash classes. SMC is a great school, but as far as academics go, I've had a horrible experience."
College Junior,2,"At my school my experience has been hard because there isn't many film classes to take and it's hard to get in a film class because they are usually full. I need to get in more film classes because film studies is my major, so it would be nice if my school offered more film classes. I never needed to crash a course though, except film classes. So getting other classes besides film has been easy for me. I'll have plenty of credits to transfer to a college that I want because I have been going to school full-time and I only been focusing on my classes."
College Sophomore,2,There is a wide variety of personalities when it comes to professors at SMC. The occasional grouch is probably when choosing a history class. There is also a chance that you may get a flustered teacher whom cannot keep her priorities in check. More or less often you'll get a rude and insolent teacher who can walk all over you during class and patronize your for not being up to level.
College Freshman,2,"Some days computer are filled and none available for use, as there are many students. Need more spaces for lab work."
College Sophomore,2,"I haven't received financial aid and every time I try getting it they take too long for it to happen but for most people not including me, it does them good."
College Freshman,2,I prefer the regular classes beacause i'm more of a hands on type of guy. I also learn better face to face.
College Sophomore,2,"I've been taking online courses because I worked full-time. There is always a limit on what professors can actually teach you online. Online courses are basically home-schooled material therefore, you must teach yourself. Yes, the professors are there to help you when you e-mail him/her but there's a limit on how much they can expalin to you online. I recommend to make time and go to a on-campus class."
College Freshman,2,"As a result of budget cuts, the financial aid office has something like 4 individuals reviewing FAFSA applications. I did not receive my financial aid checks until well into October, leaving me to struggle financially for half of the semester. Very stressful to deal with on top of classes and the job I was required to get."
College Sophomore,2,"I think that the school is still missing a precenses of a stronger carrer center. Students are not aware of it. For international students, the job opportunities in campus are very limited (reduced to the bookstore). Since this school is a Community College, many students just try to get their GE done and move on to another college. This is another reason why there is not support in the carrer center. I don't know how sucessful is the people who just get an AA degree in their future trying to find a job."
College Senior,2,"Getting classes is HARD. Classes are over crowded, people who aren't serious about school take seats from those that are, and then drop at mid terms. If you don't have a flexible work schedule, going to school here may be difficult."
College Junior,2,"The network overall is slow and the computers are old. There are two exceptions, the business building has a newer set of computers and a faster network connection as well as the lab in the Cayton Center"
College Junior,2,"So-So, Definately Can Be Better – when computers break down, they take a long time to fix them.  There are ALWAYS something broken.  Printing is good; free $15 worth (or 150 pages) or printing if you pay for your A.S. thing (which includes free Big Blue Bus rides for the semesters).  Not enough computers compared to the amount of SMC students (secret: go to the Business Computer Lab).  There are always lines to get to the computer, sometimes taking 15 minutes or more.  Having your own labtop can help save a lot of time.  Computer labs can get pretty noisy and the ones who work there (especially in the library) are very lax about the noise level, so for those that need a lot of quiet and want to study in the computer labs, I don't recommend studying there."
College Freshman,2,"Be Patient – The financial aid office is difficult and don't even try calling but as long as you go before everyone else realized it's that time of the year, you should be fine. Tuition is a mess with all these new rules they are coming up with, but it still beats 300 a unit."
College Sophomore,2,Stay Focused and Use Your Resources – classes are extremely overcrowded and its difficult to get enrolled in the classes you need. joining a program is the key to get priority dates. you can join the trio program or adelante among others. the tuition just recently increased but if you cant afford it apply for financial aid and also apply for e.o.p for financial help. its really easy to get of track. if you stop doing your h.w. or stop showing up to class is the worst thing to do. you will not succeed here.
College Sophomore,2,"They Are Alright – I failed an Econ 2 online class because of a missed exam AND an internet/computer/website glitch. We were warned such incidents won't get a make-up.

English 2 was convenient. Just remember the deadlines."
College Freshman,2,An Okay School – The school is okay. I didn't participate much in any activities they held.
College Senior,2,"General [Ly Slow] Education – The teachers rarely give time to answer questions, however, some of the elderly population really slow down the pace of the class schedules. While they answer all their [the elderly] questions, younger students take time to be on their electronic devices or mobile phones. I really learn a lot when the classes are hands on and the class is NOT a general education class."
College Freshman,2,"Most students are only aiming to transfer out of SMC within two years. There isn't all that much campus life to talk about. There are a lot of opportunities to get into honors programs and finish classes to transfer to UCLA, which is what most students go to SMC to do. Alumni is relatively involved but no one seems to care much. In terms of finding a job, you're on your own."
College Freshman,2,"Academic Flexibility – Classes are often very strict on attendance and not really willing to cooperate with your schedule. During registration it's difficult to take your own schedule into account because it's really a take what you can get basis. By late registration dates, all that's left is photography and basic ESL classes. Certain teachers will work with you, and others wont. It's a very case by case experience."
College Sophomore,2,High School College – The social life at Santa Monica College seems a lot like high school.  There are every different types of people and cliques and they usually hang out with each other.  I have met many new people at college but I still associate myself with the friends that I went to high school with.
Sophomore,1,I’m not even starting on online classes. Professor never let you know what grades you have during the semester and you are forced to work in groups and you’re all graded the same. You pay money here to be graded like lazy students.
Sophomore,1,"Absolutely not worth the money, especially if you’re an international student. There are cc who take better care of their international students."
Sophomore,1,"This school and the faculty SUCK. I am so tired of it. They are completely incompetent. I can NEVER get help in the counseling or financial aid center, no matter how many times I email, call, visit in person, BEG FOR SOMEONE TO HELP I'm always in line behind 500 people. This school seems like its run by 1 single overworked monkey who will email you back 3 months later IF they get around to it. I can't take classes this semester because I can't get a response to my issue in time for help. You are affecting peoples lives!!! Why can't you hire more people to actually provide essential services ???????"
Niche User,1,"I'm a veteran using my 9/11 GI benefits and my horrible instructor (Saul Rubin) drops my without notice losing me part of my rent money (BAH) which has gotten me evicted from my house because of their negligence. I now live in car because of SMC. I have learned that there is now over 200 homeless students at SMC. The college has closed down the organization that helped out these students out. 
 
I recently enrolled in a new class and they have not updated my enrollment either. This place is trash."
Works Here,1,"This should be 0 star, to find a person who care are rare here .
To find a person care about your wallet is available here, Sad Reality 
Nice area it's the only good !!!
it's funny they call it an nonprofit organization lol"
Freshman,1,Awful experience in a beautiful area.  They care more about your money than teaching you anything.  The professors all use purchased curriculum and are lazy.  I had a life threatening medical emergency which required me to drop one of my classes two days after the drop date.  They refused to refund me anything and added a W to my transcript.  This was an unexpected life threatening emergency that I petitioned against and they said they could not refund me based on a law.  I have talked to a number of higher up employees and none of them can tell me what this law is or where to find any information on it.  I have researched this topic and have found nothing.  This college would rather take money from a student that has experienced a costly medical emergency than provide help and care.  DO NOT GO HERE.  The professors are terrible and unmotivated.
Niche User,1,"Started SMC after returning from Paris, where I attended HS but became disabled age 17, and didn't get my OIB but was now too old to attend SAMOHI. Took the placement exam for English and Math and was allowed to enroll, got FAFSA and just paid books.  Eventually I pursued an transfer and figured it wouldn't matter from one college to the next if I met the credit requirements. I was pretty upset and far in the process when that school told me otherwise. Went back to retail then decided to pursue linguistic anthro, and enrolled into amazing classes and even paid out of pocket for units, supplies, books, and waited for my FAFSA. 3wks later, counsellor said that everything had changed and they require a proof of HS completion to ENROLL AND GET Fafsa. Now it was too late in the semester to be refunded ANYTHING, and since I was unable to financially sustain myself there, I went back to retail. Be very careful, even as a disabled person! This place wasted my time, money and crushed my dream."
Niche User,1,"The admissions staff and residency specialists here are just the worst!  I spent over a month going back and forth with them, and they were so unhelpful.  And that was when I could actually get ahold of them!  They ignored emails, calls, and when they responded, it was just generic responses!  They wouldn't accept anything, even though they were on their lists of accepted documents, and they refused to look at the case individually.  They're awful!  This is the worst service I have ever received.  The staff here is the worst, plain and simple."
College Senior,1,"Each counselor will tell you something different in regards to transferring your credit. At times it becomes very frustrating since, each counselor informs you with different answers."
College Senior,1,"The student body is existent. You have to seek out them like if it's a society only exclusive to those involved. Diversity is not issue , it's a kettle full of various cultures around the world all meshed together nicely. There are many oulets to your preferences and opportunity."
College Freshman,1,The computers are old and do not let you access certain sites such as google docs. The printing on campus is alright but the machines do rip you off. The internet is quite slow and crashes.
College Freshman,1,Personally I do not know much about student body. There are very few student activities on campus and there is no school spirit. Most of my peers agree to just going to school for class because no one really knows about clubs.
College Junior,1,I've never taken an online class.
College Sophomore,1,I found it way to over whelming since almost all the information was there. 
College Senior,1,Terrible. Unless you're a homeless bum or a foreign student you will not receive any money.
College Sophomore,1,"Library is generally very full and hard to find a computer. Printing is fairly expensive. Also, the library is dirty."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Teachers, Ignore Rules – I have a good overall experience with SMC, with a few exceptions. For instance, there are clear no-smoke signs, however everybody ignores those signs and actually smoke in the very same areas that prohibits smoking, campus police and other school authorities ignore that and allows student to freely smoke there, not cool. I hate smoking. And lastly I have had bad teachers who do not explain nothing."
College Student,1,Scholarships and Grants – I'd like more scholarship and grant opportunities.
College Student,1,"Getting Classes – I'd like it to be easier to get classes.  They don't offer many, and they fill up quickly."
College Freshman,1,"Wireless Works Less – There is wireless internet, but is not compatible on a MAC."

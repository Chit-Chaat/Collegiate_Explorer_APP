Senior,5,Haskell Indian Nations University is an excellent tribal college for Native students across the country wanting to receive a 2-year degree or 4-year degree while learning about other Native communities and cultures.
Sophomore,5,My experience here at Haskell has been amazing. The community is very welcoming and helpful. The campus has beautiful history behind it as well as the students and faculty who attend. It is a very diverse tribal college. You get to learn about other native American tribes and take the classes you want. I highly recommend taking a tour.
Sophomore,5,I would love to see the football program brought back. The campus life is amazing. It really is inspiring to be furthering my education at an institution where my ancestors once were.
Freshman,5,"I think Haskell is an excellence experience for me, because being here taught me to be responsible through all situations and motivated me to be a better leader. I would recommend this college to any Native American because it’s only 715$ to attend this college and you will be surrounded by different tribes and many cultures."
Freshman,5,"On different conferences that are affiliated with my education, it’s nice to see their determination/motivation in persuading indigenous children to attend college."
Sophomore,5,Haskell is a very affordable college for Native American students. I have learned a lot about Native cultures that you don’t learn about growing up.
Junior,5,"I like the fact that this university consists of more than 100 federally recognized tribes. It is a huge enough campus for everyone to know a lot of people but not small enough for everyone not to know everyone, therefore I would like to see more campus gatherings."
Senior,5,"First of all, I like the fact that it is a small university. With that being said, the sense of community and support is very prominent. I love being surrounded by other Indigenous people who are also striving to ensure a better future for themselves. This university, to me, is my second home."
Freshman,5,"I love Haskell, It feels like i am right at home with my Native American Culture. The teacherd here are amazing, they really know what they are talking about and how to teach a student the subject. Haskell is a wonderful College to attend if students are struggling in some areas, Teachers and staff take the tme to help students."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Haskell Indian Nations was great! Being surrounded by so many different people from so many different tribal nations was a feeling i'll never forget! It truly is a blessing to be apart of the Haskell community, I love it and I love everyone there. Lawrence, KS in general is an awesome city to live in. I've traveled over 1,800 miles to attend school there and it's 100% worth it."
Freshman,5,"Being a freshman in college was a great experience for me because the college I went too, Haskell Indian Nations University, was very helpful to me and everybody on campus whether they were new, transfers, or continuing students. And it was also great too because it was a school where there were many different native American tribes whom some I gotten to know and it made me feel like I wasn’t the only native going to school there. This school made my freshman year in college great, I learned a lot, from getting to class on time, many of the courses I had taken were simple, classes weren’t that long, and I had class on certain days. And the only think that I would want to see change is making the school a bit bigger with new roads and more buildings like dorms or classrooms."
College Senior,5,"My overall experience has been great at Haskell. I enjoy going to class knowing that I have a good relations with my professors. Everyone is like family. Haskell has many support services for academics, that are very encouraging. Dorm life was easy adjusting to, because everyone is friendly here at Haskell."
College Sophomore,5,"My experience at my school has been convenient because there are like 3-4 different sections for each class available. They vary by times and days of the week. It's convenient because you still have time in between to do whatever you need to do and the classes are available depending the type of person you are, a morning person or do you consider afternoon classes, it all depends on you. I've had a little hassle and frustration with my advisor who enrolls me into my classes but it was because he is a brand new advisor here and he was still trying to settle himself in the new environment. I transferred one credit from San Juan college and it transferred very easily."
College Sophomore,5,"The quality of post-grad services here are great. We have work study and that's one of the biggest things on campus. Work study gives you different opportunities and sometimes you get to travel around, going to different events and seeing new places. The alumni is very active on campus, they love to help us current students a lot. They give us tips and show us around. The alumni, I heard, stay in touch with one another all the time. We also have opportunities to work, get jobs, use facilities and study at our neighboring college campus, University of Kansas  (KU)."
College Sophomore,5,"Students at Haskell have big interests in degrees in American Indian Studies, Education and Business. But we also have many other degree programs here. We do have work study and internships available. Alumni is a big impact on the campus, most of our staff and instructors here are a part of Haskell's alumni, as well as many of the student's parents. We have many departments open to the students like the student success center where mostly everything like printing, copying, computers, and other resources are free use to the students. A value of a degree from this school means so much to the students and also the staff, we are working hard to earn an education that will not only make us successful but it will make our tribes proud."
College Sophomore,5,"The courses here are great. We have general studies, Native American culture classes, associate and bachelor degree programs and we also include a whole different variety of classes. Instructors here go by syllabuses and it is very helpful. The class for the whole year is basically set out for you so the whole time if you were to ever miss a day then you will have no problem looking at the syllabus and figuring out what you missed or what you were supposed to be doing that day. One of my instructors right now is very friendly and optimistic, she knows her role for being here for the students, she reminds us all the time that if we for whatever reason miss our class at our specified time then we are more than welcome to sit in on the next class. Oh also each class is about 15-20 students, meaning there is an easy opportunity for one to one contact between the students and instructors."
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at school right now is great. There are so many tribes of Native Americans coming together to earn an education. Everyone is very friendly, helpful and easy to talk to. There is many activities to take part in on campus and off campus. Everyone likes to enjoy themselves and have fun. There are also a lot of unique clubs to join. I would choose my school again and do it all over because Haskell gives me many great opportunities to be successful in my education. I would invite and encourage more of my friends and people to consider Haskell."
College Junior,5,All the employees are a great help when it comes to the financial aid process. It's pretty simple and easy. They even offer to walk you through everything.
College Sophomore,5,"I've met a lot of great people here, I've bonded with some cool professors, the atmosphere is very different. It's accepting, unique, laid-back, but strict, it feels homey and family-like. I'd definitely come back and do it all over again. I would recommend this school to people as well. I've already recommended it to my sister who will be joining me here in the fall of 2016."
College Sophomore,5,"My overall experience here at Haskell has been tremendous. The staff and faculty are great and helpful. The students are interactive, fun, and outgoing. The community is historical and there's plenty to do on the weekends. The classwork is fairly challenging and educational."
College Sophomore,5,"Orientation for HINU was awesome. It was fun, informative, and efficient."
College Sophomore,5,"Financial Aid and tuition are low cost and super affordable for Native American students. However, pell grant and scholarships can only last a student so long if they dont have a job. Overall, the cost and education quality are fantastic."
College Freshman,5,"Student Success Center helps with providing free faxing, free printing, computer use, hours of office are opened till after school hours. the library is a nice and quiet place to study computers are great. Campus activity happens almost every weekend free of charge, transportation provided. enjoy the campus church they are very helpful with toilette trees."
College Senior,5,I love it here. I plan to come back for my junior year.
College Junior,5,"A lot of helpful teachers and faculty, will help you out with materials that you may not have in your personal possessions such as computers or printers. Also have a financial aid and a business office that will help you with money related subjects."
College Junior,5,"It is definitely worth the money because many students come from low income homes, yet we still want to be able to go to college."
College Junior,5,HINU is almost like being at home. I enjoy everything about HINU.
College Sophomore,5,My overall experience has been the best. I have learned so much more of the real truth about my people and their treatment by the non Natives that was never taught at public schools. I find the family experience has been one of my best experiences. Everyone who has graduated from HINU considers the University home. My basketball coach is the best. He is Native as well as traditional and lives up to these values. He is hard working and works the team the same way. He treats everyone the same and the guys who work the hardest are the ones who play. He is a great role model as well as a mentor to me. I am so glad I decided to transfer to HIUN and would do it again and again. I would encourage all Native students to come to HINU.
College Sophomore,5,"HINU is unique in many ways. There are 110 different Native Tribes that attend HINU. Learning about the differences in Tribes and how we are so much alike makes my experience here very remarkable. We are all one big family which includes not just the students but extended family. People say that HINU is just a party school but I disagree. The campus is a alcohol and drug free campus and if you are caught doing the drugs and alcohol you will be let go. At the other University I attended, it seemed that partying was the only reason kids went to college. Partying was everywhere, in the dorms, in the Park and every where. I was even told by my coach that I should go party and clubbing with the other members of the basketball team even though I was underage and all that lifestyle is not my values."
College Sophomore,5,"Since I am a member of the men's basketball team, I find the athletic center, weight room,gym and other facilities just what I need. Anytime I need to use the library I find the staff very helpful as well as the resources especially the older documents concerning Natives very helpful as well as just interesting to read. There are lots of campus activities and I am very happy with my experience at HINU."
College Sophomore,5,HINU has programs that help with job placement or helping you to apply to another University to continue your education for  higher degrees. Most of the staff are former students of HINU so the job prospects are great.
College Sophomore,5,The students are all Native from federally recognized tribes all over the county. The student body are always helpful to anyone who needs help. I wouldn't want to attend school any where else.
College Sophomore,5,The tuition is great and I had no problem with the financial aid process. The financial aid office was very helpful and I have no complaints.
College Sophomore,5,"I have found everyone helpfully with any matter I need help in. My credits transferred. The only problem I have encountered is since I live of campus, I find that rental agencies take advantage of Native students by charging higher rent because they believe all Native students receive money from the casinos. The rental agencies also misrepresent themselves to the Native students and when you arrive for your apartment it is usually the most run down and oldest part of the apartment complex."
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone professors, staff and students are willing to help anyone. Everyone is treated fairly and not judged by their income or social status. I have not had any problems finding answers to anything I need. I would recommend any Native student to attend HINU."
College Sophomore,5,"The degree I want to receive in Education has all the classwork and courses I need. I can even earn my teaching certification here and unlike most Universities, I do not have to wait and take extra classes. All my professors are helpful and this is the only University I know of that considers family situations such as serious illnesses or the death of family members and give the student time to attend to these needs and give them time to make up their work when they return. The workload is great and we have lots of discussions in all of my classes. The professors are helpful in any area we need help in. The class registration process was much more organized than the first University I attended."
College Junior,5,"This is the most affordable university ever. I do not qualify for financial aide, but whenever I needed something from that office, it has been taken care of and was quality service. "
College Junior,5,"The Elementary Education program that I am in is the only nationally accredited tribal program in the nation. It is the only program at Haskell that requires you taking classes for the program before you get into the program. The workload can sometimes be overbearing, but there is a lot of information that you need to know and understand as a teacher. One of the best things about our program is that instead of only doing student teaching for one semester in the spring, you are in the same class for the entire year. You get to see what the first day of school is like and you are able to see how the classroom is run before you start your student teaching. Our facilities could be a little better. It is an older building and the heating/cooling unit is not always the best for the weather. It can either be extremely cold or really hot. "
College Sophomore,5,Always seem to be welcomed back and always there to help me out
College Freshman,5,"I think that the professors are understanding. The curriculum is good, and the class size are small."
Freshman,4,"I’m a student at Haskell Indian Nations University. So far as I’ve been here, the thing I like a lot about this college is the diversity and people with different backgrounds. You connect with people from different Indian tribes and I believe that’s the key to connecting with people. You get to know a lot about their culture and how their culture works. The resources that’s available to you here is pretty great too! Every building you go into, you see different resources you can go to to help with whatever the problem is you may be dealing or needing guidance with. It’s a great university that I would suggest to my friends to come here because it has a low tuition fee for students that’s not financially stable in life yet."
Sophomore,4,"Full of culture and diversity. Not very well put together or organized. Incredibly affordable, which gets natives into school and graduating from college!!"
Junior,4,"Haskell Indian Nations University is a tribal college/university where enrolled Native American students from across the US and Alaska can enroll.  Located in the middle of the country, Lawrence, KS.  HINU has a diverse student populations with Native's from all corners come to one school and share their culture with the campus, where it's accepted and celebrated to be proud."
Sophomore,4,Haskell is a great opportunity for me and many native American students. I experienced how it is to be on my own and to be responsible. I enjoy being here because I like the atmosphere at this campus because being here reminds me of my high school.
Sophomore,4,"I love it here! I have never been so emerged in a Native American culture, and being surrounded with Indigenous students just like my self is such a cool thing to be apart of!"
Freshman,4,"Haskell is such a good school for Native Americans. Once you graduate you will leave school debt free, tuition is so affordable."
Freshman,4,My experience at Haskell so far has been pretty good. The classes I have taken are nice and the Professors are good at teaching.
Freshman,4,"Personally, I chose Haskell Indian Nations University as my first school because of athletics. I am a duel sport athlete in both women's volleyball and women's basketball. One thing I love about Haskell is the low tuition for Native American students. Its a great school to start your first year if you are financially unstable. Its also not too big but small enough for a comfortable settle. Another thing I like about it is, they offer a bridge program with the University of Kansas so you can take classes there at a cheaper price than actually going to KU. The students and staff are super friendly and will go beyond measure to make sure you are successful! I would like to see a change in better buildings for classes and more intramural activities for students that play other sports such as soccer instead of just volleyball and basketball all the time!"
Sophomore,4,I'm glad to choose Haskell Indian Nations Univeristy. The best thing I like about the school is the cultural diversity it has. Native Americans come from all over to come to school. Its really a great place and friendly.
Sophomore,4,What I love about Haskell Indian Nations University is that there's so much diversity in the school and they all want to learn about their culture.
College Freshman,4,"Picking your classes is all on you. If you aren't a morning person, then take afternoon classes. Vice-versa. Haskell has a wide range of classes to choose from."
College Freshman,4,"My past classes do have some assignments on the online system, which is cool. It is nice to only have that assignment online and not have to show up to class."
College Freshman,4,Some of the professors I have had are really cool and reasonable about what they teach and the kind of homework they give out. They are willing to help.
College Freshman,4,"The academics is great. I like how there are many opportunities to get help from teachers and tutors. The TRiO program helped me stay on track of my grades by having grade checks to be turned every few weeks. Without it, I would be a hot mess. Seriously, Lol. I also like if you are having troubles turning an assignment in, they sometimes give you an extension and that's really cool. But only on a reasonable note."
College Freshman,4,"I think Haskell is a great place to be. Orientation week before classes started was great for me, because college is a new atmosphere. I didn't know what to expect and having that week helped me be confident in the semester ahead.! I also think the diversity of Natives is really cool as well. Its great to see the uniqueness of each tribe. The teachers here are great and really do want to help out. You also get your money's worth. It is only $715 a semester. So it is good to go to school here, graduate with a degree, and have no debt.! :D"
College Senior,4,The classes I have taken here at Haskell have introduced me to a new experience of learning. Which is not only applicable to the real world but very useful in and out of the classroom.
College Sophomore,4,"I am a Sophomore here at HINU. It has definitely been a different experience, because i wasn't raised on a reservations like most of the students that attend this University. What i like most about this University is the diversity of Natives. Everyone comes from a different place and has their own traditions and beliefs, which is truly amazing because it would be uninteresting if everyone was the same."
College Junior,4,I love a lot of the professors.
College Junior,4,For the most part I feel like I belong.
College Freshman,4,Scheduling classes have been great and easy they have a wide range of classes at different times you just have to get right on it or some classes will be filled but your advisor will try to help you work around your schedule
College Freshman,4,It is great and not hard at all to get your classes online and the teachers more than likely will email you about them putting up anything online right when it is up
College Freshman,4,The classes are small from as few as 8 to 35 people at the most. The teachers have time for everyone and know each others name so it feels more like they want to teach you
College Sophomore,4,"Right now I am currently enrolled in just my general study classes. In the next year I hope to be in an Associates program with the social health, mostly focusing on sports medicine and athletic training. My classes this year are starting out smoothly. The instructors here are very helpful and are aware of my needs here as a student. They challenge us and push us to keep moving forward. We have many facilities on campus also that are a major help to the students. We have many computers to use, study rooms, the library and student success center."
College Sophomore,4,The courses and teacher are excellent. the teachers communicate with every student and try their best to make the subject be clearly as possible.
College Sophomore,4,The students go after what they want and the teachers are there to help the students go after what career they want.
College Sophomore,4,The teachers are very friendly and helpful and try answer any question the best they can.
College Sophomore,4,The people at this school are very helpful with everything you need.
College Freshman,4,"I like how it is Native oriented, it helps make me feel more at home. This school has a lot of incredible and fascinating History here. I like meeting new people from different tribes, all across the United States. My overall experience here at Haskell would be, amazing!"
College Freshman,4,"Haskell is one of the only all Native American schools in the United States, so it feels very special to be able to attend."
College Junior,4,The amount of different cultural aspects here.
College Junior,4,"Overall, the experience is a good one."
College Sophomore,4,Ive been able to set up my schedules how I want and also taking classes I need. The flexibility range is okay when it comes to wokring and studying with most students.
College Sophomore,4,"The student body is compromised of all Native American students and so we all interact with each other and come together for pow-wows and cookouts. It is like one big family. Since the student body is fairly small, a lot of the faces on campus become familiar."
College Sophomore,4,I just entered and got accepted into the Business Program and the courses I am taking are really helping me be prepared for future courses and I learn what is taught.
College Sophomore,4,"The on campus facilities are great for the student and have the means and staff necessary to help the students in the course work, advising, and other things. The campus gym and activities are open to students for more than exceptional hours. Its great."
College Senior,4,I've learned a lot and my instructors are very helpful.
College Senior,4,It's understanding and good for online homework. I love it.
College Senior,4,So many unique individuals on campus. I find everyone exciting and fun to be around.
College Senior,4,Scholarships help a lot. Especially for school supplies and food.
College Senior,4,I'm learning new things everyday and enjoy working with other students and instructors.
College Senior,4,Everything and everyone is great.
College Junior,4,I actually really enjoy online homework. It's better and a lot of people whenever the teacher isn't around to help you out physically.
College Junior,4,"My school is tuition free, which is great. Process is sometimes a hassle. This semester I was told wrong information to fill out, which means I still have not received any money from my college to help me."
College Junior,4,"I really enjoy the library. They have nice, spacious study zones."
College Junior,4,"So far, most of the people I've met are really outgoing and all willing to help one another."
College Junior,4,The professors here explain more about the work and the lessons that are being taught is easier to comprehend.
College Junior,4,They have internships on the schools blackboard system.
College Junior,4,I like how the classes have an average of about 20 students in which it makes it easier to learn.
College Junior,4,"I love my school, i love the environment, i love being around native americans. I love the school, the programs, the staff, and all the students. Its a really neat college to attend. I moved from Oregon just to go to school here. So going to school at Haskell is a honor to be at, and want to graduate with my bachelors degree here."
College Junior,4,"I graduated in 2008 here at haskell and returned this year in 2014, and all of my credits remained the same. It was easy for me to jump right into my classes."
College Junior,4,We have job opportunities for students when positions are available.
College Junior,4,There are tutors available at all times. The class registration is straight forward and usually dont have trouble getting in the right class you need to get it.
College Junior,4,"The campus, library, activities, and the student center are all excellent places here. The staff does everything they can to help the students in any way, weather its school or activities. I love my school."
College Junior,4,The courses and professors are very knowledgeable and are very understanding of what it takes for a Native student to attend college as well as be away from family. I like the class sizes and choices. I would recommend HINU to any Native student.
College Sophomore,4,"I don't use these services too much since I live off campus, but anytime I have I have had no problems with them."
College Sophomore,4,"Learning more about other tribes and being able to share our traditions, and cultures with one another. The academic programs are good and the tuition costs are unbelievably inexpensive."
College Sophomore,4,"Attending Haskell Indian Nations University has been a life changing experience, and was worth moving from home to attend school. I appreciate the staff and their assistance in understanding my situation with being a single mother of a five year old. Haskell Indian Nations University is a great Native American Indian school, and Tribal College."
College Senior,4,Since we are a small campus there is a good opportunity to become a leader here and its also easy to meet people of similiar background.
College Senior,4,I enjoy the students who attend Haskell with me. Since we are a Tribal college there isn't a lot of diversity but we still experience each others tribal culture.
College Senior,4,Overall my experience has been good but my credits from my previous colleges did not all transfer.
Freshman,2,Haskell Indian Nations University is a great college but I don’t feel connected to it. My intentions were to go to a college that were less likely to see people from my hometown. My overall experience here at Haskell Indian Nations University have been vague to me.
College Junior,2,I can't seem to find a good schedule mostly.
College Freshman,2,there isn't really a career center here and not very many job prospects here at all
College Freshman,2,They do not have my major here I am going to school here for my first two years to get my associates degree and transfer
College Freshman,2,"The school its self is ok, a fairly old and some stuff doesn't work. The teachers here are more like high school teachers than professors besides a select few I have had"
College Senior,2,No organization. Only a few (4) degree programs. Dormitories need improvement. Recently cut football program (lack of funds). Strict.
College Junior,2,It is really hard when a lot of the classes are taken so you are forced to take certain classes at certain times. The teachers and classes are limited so it is difficult to control your own schedule.
College Junior,2,There isn't many jobs at the school that haven't already been taken. I had to look elsewhere.
College Junior,2,"They don't actually have my major at this school, and not a lot of majors are available at this college. I plan to transfer to a bigger college with more choices."
College Sophomore,2,Online courses are not available.
College Junior,2,The availability of various courses is very limited. We only have a handful of courses that are offered here. There are only four bachelor's degrees that you can obtain from Haskell. 
College Junior,2,We have many available computers on campus. You really do not need your own personal computer or printer here. The Student Success Center offers free printing. One of the only things that is really bad here is the Wi-Fi availability and connection. The connection is very slow and not available everywhere on campus. It is sometimes an inconvenience to have to go into the designated Wi-Fi areas to use your laptop or other devices. 
College Freshman,2,"Wireless access is available in most areas, but there are some areas with none."
College Freshman,2,Campus could use several upgrades.
College Freshman,2,They need to offer a few more degrees.
College Freshman,2,I am getting only my general education courses.
College Freshman,2,I don't know of any online courses available.
College Freshman,2,I would not have moved so far from home for my first year of college.
College Freshman,2,There are only a few cliques.  
College Sophomore,2,"Well this college I attend consist of Native Americans from all over the U.S. which is unique because I have never attended a college such as this. The student body at Haskell is about average because most students come there to receive an education whereas others take advantage. However, I am here to finish school and receive my degree."
College Senior,1,The school has career fairs but not a good variety for everyone. Mostly applied to the business side. There is really no center on campus to help you find a career. You have to talk to people and do it on your own.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is not anyone to talk to about careers expect the teachers. However a new program to start helping student with that.
College Freshman,1,HINU Computer Network – Computer wi-fi is always up and down and the technology is stuck in another decade in the past. I had to purchase my own computer because the schools computers are not reliable at all.

Junior,5,"The school is very inviting and friendly. In rolling at the college was a very simple process and all of the advisers are very helpful. My experience with this university has been nothing but positive and the instructors are very knowledgeable and very willing to help if you are having issues. The students enrolled at this university, From my experience are very friendly and diverse. There are lots of student programs and events the school put on and they like to stay connected with each student which makes the experience feel very unique and individualized for each student. I have really enjoyed my experience so far with Central Washington University, if you are considering enrolling at this university I suggest you do it because it Has been nothing but an excellent experience!"
Junior,5,"My online learning experience with Central Washington University has been a positive one. The instructors are very helpful and lay out a very balanced and informative curriculum that helps you complete all of your work without missing any due dates. The canvas application helps you focus on what you need to do, tailored by modules to educate you in a step-by-step format. If you ever have questions or problems, this university has many different Methods on helping you resolve your issues. There is the writing center that helps you with essays, which I have found very helpful. They have you submit your essay before it is due, and then send you a video explaining what can be done to improve your writing skills, grammar and punctuation, formatting etc. The online courses that I have been taking due to the pandemic are just as good as the in person classes, Central Washington University has delivered on their promise!"
Niche User,5,I took about three online classes and they were great I had a little bit of trouble since I was new to the system and didn't really know where everything was at but as time passed it was easier. The teachers were a great help they answered my emails and help me out throughout the course.
Junior,5,My experience was great and it was their classes are really flexible to fit in our busy life styles.
Junior,5,I had a great experience with all my online classes. My instructors provide clear expectations and were available when needed within their schedule. Class content was related to the courses and all the instruction was related to their course objectives.
Graduate Student,5,Great experience with online courses. I took online courses as well as traditional in person and all the courses worked out great and professors were amazing. There is no lack of earning from either type of setting. It also worked out for someone commuting 35 min so for winter being able to drive less was really nice. I also had a great experience with tech support if I needed to contact them. They were available late at night and I think even on  a weekend which helped me stress even less.
Graduate Student,5,Great experience transferring in as a junior and being gone from school for a couple years. It was a smooth process and comfortable learning and friendly environment especially for a non traditional student.
Freshman,5,My online experience has been nothing but a breeze. The professors all have high expectations but are very understanding and respectful of individual needs.
Freshman,5,I like just about everything about Central Washington University. One thing that I think can be improved is tour guides.
Alum,5,"Professors in Geography and Geology are excellent.  They are readily available for assisting in adjusting your program when a class is not available as well as in discussing your progress.  Field trips in Geology are a plus as they help solidify classroom instruction.  When these two programs are combined, a strong education in Earth Science is achieved.  Having grown up on the East Coast, I'm now probably more familiar with Washington than most Washington born citizens.  I would highly recommend these two majors for those who seek a challenging yet rewarding education.

As an intensive Geography major, I came to realize that this major prepares you to see things on a regional basis.  Even an insurance policy can be seen in this context.  There are so many diverse issues that must be seen to really understand the policy ."
Senior,5,I love Central! There are so many opportunities here. I have met so many people  along the way and hope to meet many more. Class sizes are small in comparison to other universities and the professors actually want to get to know you.
Alum,5,I have family and friends who have very much enjoyed attending Central Washington. I believe they have an outstanding teaching program that would most likely help me with becoming a teacher in the future.
Freshman,5,"Attending Central Washington University has been incredible. Even through the hardships brought on by this years Covid-19 outbreak, Central Washington University has continued to ensure the safety and overall well-being of their students. CWU makes you feel as if you are part of a family. The staff and students are all very friendly and helpful. I couldn't have asked for a better college to spend my first year at, and I look forward to the next three to come!"
Niche User,5,"I haven't attended yet but the process thus far has been incredibly easy and straight forward! As long as you stay on top of dates and deadlines, you'll do just fine!"
Junior,5,"I like the size of the cohort at the Central Washington University satellite school at Highline Community College.  Excellent professors, great classmates, overall good experience."
Freshman,5,"The campus is amazing and since this town is small, their a lot of outdoor activities to do and never a boring weekend. The school has great opportunities on campus to have some fun with rock climbing, basketball courts, and the diving board at the pool. The class sizes are not very big and the professors are all very nice."
Niche User,5,I had a tour at Central Washington University and had a wonderful experience. Going to CWU was very fun and pleasing. I felt very safe and loved the campus. The dorms were very clean. Classroom sizes were also good. I cannot wait to go again!
Freshman,5,"Everyone I've met from there has been super nice, the school is on the smaller scale, the price is affordable, the campus is super nice and it spoke to me."
Freshman,5,"At Central Washington I enjoy just being around the nicest people around, people are so kind and fun to be around. The energy at the University is fantastic. There are a lot of people who are involved in many different activities around the campus. In the University the teachers are very helpful and encouraging, that's something I approve of and like. The only thing I would change about this University is the food. I would change that because the food is the same every time I go out and eat but overall the food is still good. Also, on the weekends the campus is very quiet which I very much enjoy. The safety around the campus is amazing they have light polls that can call the police if there is an emergency. They have safety apps as well."
Freshman,5,"Central Washington is amazing. Very inclusive, very friendly people. The are is surrounded by nature and tons of outdoor activities perfect for adventurers. The campus is flat and easy to get around on. The dorms are well kept. There are no sororities or fraternities; I feel like that keeps people more focused and less trouble. The school has so many resources to help you learn , especially when you need a special testing environment. I am in the aviation program, which is fantastic. The Living Learning Communities are very beneficial as well. This school is pretty cheap compared to others in WA state"
Senior,5,the programs provided by this university are amazing. this university is the number one diverse campus in Washington State! They just added a wine  degree that talks about wine and the process of making it. the college helps the town by providing many on campus activities and events.
Freshman,5,Excellent school and great support network for mental health and career advancement. Find theopportunities offered by staff are utilized dailyand the help professors give is great.
Niche User,5,"They seemed very welcoming and helpful, the transition was smooth and I have had no bad experiences at this school."
Freshman,5,"I love the University.  Being a mature student and in hiding from an abusive ex, they have been huge supporters of helping me achieve and keep a 3.9GPA."
Niche User,5,I liked the size of Central Washington University the schools is not too big or not too small. The distance from home is great because I can still come home for the weekends. The school is very beautiful and the there is a variety of programs too.
Sophomore,5,I love how welcoming and helpful all the staff and students are. They make you feel at home. The classes are fun and engaging.
Freshman,5,"Central Washington University is a very accepting and welcoming school. I was very well pleased with the amount of safety, excellence, helpfulness, learning and engaging that Central has to offer. I am exited to attend in the fall of 2019, and am proud to call Ellensburg my new home."
Sophomore,5,Central Washington University is a wonderful school. Everyone is very friendly and respect everyone no matter what type of person they are. The professors and staff show that they genuinely care about  their students and their success at the school. The campus is beautiful and kept very clean.
Works Here,5,CWU really cares about people here. There is a lot of diversity where everyone is represented. Plus so many activities to get involved with anywhere from paint raves to skiing trips to drag shows to esports to haunted houses and everything in between.
Freshman,5,I'm a Freshman class of 23 and I've received nothing but support from the staff and i am so thankfull.
Sophomore,5,"I love the diversity on campus. There are students from all backgrounds and groups here. All students are warmly welcomed and appreciated. The professors are nice and the class sizes are relatively small, making it easy to connect with peers and instructors. The campus is absolutely beautiful and it is right in the center of Washington State."
Junior,5,"Central Washington University was the best choice I could have made for a university. I have made the best of friends, the professors are awesome, and the class sizes are small. I have never not felt comfortable on the campus, or in the dorms. They are constantly trying to better themselves. And the town it is in is absolutely wonderful. You get a nice southern feel without being in the south. Everyone is nice, and the town is clean, and the there is a huge community pretense. Only 40 min from the next city and only a couple hours from Seattle I would recommend this school to anyone and everyone!"
Freshman,5,From my experience from staying in the dorms and exploring the campus I feel like Central Washington University is very special and they really want you to feel at home which I believe is very important. A home away from home is there slogan and I truly think they're doing a lot in their power to make their students feel like this is true. I've heard many positive things about Ellensburg and the activities that go on so I really look forward to the experience. I look forward to meeting new people and pursuing what I love at Central Washington university.
Junior,5,"I've had a great experience so far. I work full time, so I'm taking online classes. I love that they offer 4 year degrees online for business and accounting majors. It was hard to find a reputable university that offers online programs that I wanted. I don't have any negative feedback yet. I just started there and since I'm not on campus I don't interact with the faculty or staff."
Sophomore,5,"I like Central Washington University because everyone is very accepting on campus. Ellensburg is a small town which gives me a sense of home. One thing I would live to see change would be helping one another whenever we observe that another night need help. To not wait. Instead, to act as soon as possible to make a difference, even if you might not think it is much, it is."
Junior,5,I really like the environment and how the teachers are really caring for having their students succeed. I wish there was more opportunities for Central students to assure them the career they want is best for them.
Freshman,5,I have not personally been there myself but i hear from a lot of people that the school is great and that there are many people who will help you in any questions that you have and assist you.
Junior,5,"I am currently attending CWU and I love it here. I feel that the professors really care about us getting good grades and want to see us become successful. Central is a small enough school so the party scene isn't crazy which I really like.  The campus itself is beautiful. Campus food wasn't great but with the new dining hall coming in we shall see. Students are excited about being involved, and our safety team is great. Dorms were nice too, expect old ones. They weren't awful but you could tell that they were older buildings for sure."
Freshman,5,I love the dynamic of all the diverse individuals and how the professors are always willing to go out of their way to help students and encourage them to do better.
Freshman,5,"The Central Staff have been great at getting me connected to college life.  I was nervous about going away from home, but the staff and students welcomed me and provided me what I needed to feel safe and secure here in Ellensburg.  I am not sure what I would add or change in my experience but it might be good to keep students and their families information about all the activities available."
Freshman,5,"All the students and staff members are outgoing and helpful. When I first visited for a tour of the campus, some staff members allowed me inside the buildings that I would potentially be studying in, which was very nice."
Sophomore,5,The professors and faculty are great! They are attentive to the success of the students. Class sizes are relatively small and a great learning environment. The dorms are nice and clean. The overall community environment is great and lively. There are always events and clubs to join! The only thing that isn't the best is the Financial Aid office they tend to run slow. Other than that Central is a great place to attend.
Niche User,5,"During my time at Central, I made many friends and connections with the students and professors. The staff are very involved in you learning and helping you create a solid plan after graduation."
Freshman,5,I love the school and the courses that are available are great. I love the option of online classes and professors are really good and helpful. Food could use a bit more variety but the campus is beautiful.
Sophomore,5,"The professors really care about your learning and want to help you succeed in any way they can. The campus is perfect size, not too big, not too small, and it has so many great resources for learning and many new facilities that are really nice"
Niche User,5,"My daughter will be attending CWU in the fall of 2019. We visited CWU twice and both times were impressed with the sense of community and welcome we experienced.  While there, we chatted with several students and heard nothing but positives. The head of the Exercise Science Dept. sat down with the three of us for nearly an hour and walked my daughter through the whole curriculum, really bringing it alive for her. At the second visit, the head of the Sport Management program asked about my daughter's long-term goals and talked with her about how to achieve them, as well as how this program fits into that. The professors seem to be very available, class sizes small, and there is a big focus on internships where students can make connections that will be beneficial in their chosen profession. We have heard similar stories from parents who have children at CWU and know several CWU alums who have only good things to say about it. It is also extremely affordable (as colleges go)."
Junior,5,Very welcoming and positive experiences being apart of the special education program. The people around are kind and encouraging. Campus is beautiful and clean and classes are sized well. Lots of opportunities for outside of class help and open door policies. Teachers care and make learning worth it. Good food and services offered.
Sophomore,5,What I enjoy about Central Washington University is the distance between campus and my home town. Central is also very welcoming with a variety of different degrees you could choose from.
Niche User,5,"Central Washington University, has a feeling of being at home as soon as you step onto the campus. Just when simply taking a tour of the campus, the students were friendly and helpful. I felt truly apart of the culture already."
Senior,5,"The faculty is willing to work with you on any issues you come across. My mom passed away earlier this month, and housing was willing to let me keep my apartment, even though I wasn't taking the required 7 credits for an apartment. A counselor got in touch with me very quickly as well to offer bereavement support. My adviser has been very flexible with meeting with me. Very nice people!"
Graduate Student,5,Central Washington has been wonderful.  They have different programs for all kinds of students.  The professors have been great.  This is the second time I have attended Central it has been so wonderful.
Senior,5,"Having one of the Top Information Technology degree programs was the major reason I chose CWU. Once I was accepted, I can see why CWU gets a lot of positive reviews. Living in Olympia Washington and CWU having other learning campuses outside of Ellensburg namely Lakewood (Pierce County), really makes it so much easier and the feeling of being part of the main campus. Hybrid classes are really good, especially for the Veterans whom require in seat classes for their Veterans Benefits. The teachers are very caring and want the best for you. I am always getting follow emails from my teachers during the Quarter asking me how I am doing and if their is anything they can help me with, just contact them.  The online Curriculum is really easy to follow.
Would recommend CWU to anyone seeking a great education with an well established University that want break the bank."
Junior,5,amazing faculty and staff! they go out of their way to help and are incredibly supportive in all aspects of students education.
Junior,5,"My experience at Central has been more than great. Class sizes are medium to the smaller side so it is easy to connect with your classmates and professors. If you need more time on homework the professors are very understanding and there are many places in Ellensburg where you can have study sessions. The campus is beautiful and you feel safe when you walk around. The services they provide are easy and very accessible and if you have any questions they are very helpful.The college is always updating its campus so buildings aren’t falling apart on the students, which is a plus. The only thing that is difficult about going to Central is the amount of housing there is in Ellensburg."
Senior,5,"Central Washington University is an excellent school and one of the most top rated Universities when it comes to teaching/education majors. Beautiful sceneries abound at this University as Ellensburg is most certainly photogenic. Take a stroll through campus and gaze upon the Ganges to watch the ducks fly in and teach their little chicks how to swim. 

Sculptures from artists rest, waiting for students to recognize their Masters talent for creativity and innovation as nurtured by the professionals here on campus. For the most part, Central has picked professionals that are kind and helpful yet challenge you to be your best self. Occasionally you will hear of that one teacher who is subpar but that’s life. Make sure you make a wise decision on which meal plan to accommodate you during your first year. After that I would advise an apartment off or on campus to lower the cost of living expenses. 

5/5 Stars."
Freshman,5,"What I loved about Central Washington University the most is that our campus is very focused on making Central feel like home and that everybody deserves to be treated with the same respect despite color, creed, religion or sexual orientation. Everybody has a place where they can fit in while also getting along with others who are different from them. Our campus is also very active! Something is always going on somewhere. Central really pushes for a 4 year graduation but also encourages you to move at your own pace while enjoying college while you can."
Freshman,5,"Central Washington University is an amazing campus. It is a small campus with many perks. You will always see a familiar face, and the classes are so small that the teacher will know your name. There is so much to do with all of the clubs & activities available to the students. Central Washington University is a decision that no one will regret."
Freshman,5,It is a diverse community and people are always open and very helpful. You can feel at home and should not be afraid to ask for help. Everyone is welcoming and may lead you to certain clubs that may even help yourself. Throughout clubs and organizations you meet a lot of people which is a great thing so then you can help and lead other to great recourses.
Freshman,5,"My school is located in a small town; therefore excessive partying takes place. I feel a student should have a broader array of options for fun. A small town such as Ellensburg also does not allow students to develop the kind of cultured and worldly perspective as they would in a city. Personally, I enjoy discovering new places, meeting many different people, and participating in music and art. All of these past times are extremely limited in a place like Ellensburg, so if you attend Central Washington University, be prepared to get imaginative and create your own kinds of fun."
Niche User,5,I went to Central Washington for a Thespian Festival  and had a great time. The atmosphere was very inviting. Lots of my friends go here and love every second of being there!!
Junior,4,"Central Washington University has been filled with exciting opportunities to learn and grow as an individual. From their inclusive on-campus activities to informational Zoom sessions, I have always felt comfortable and eager to learn as much as I can during my time here. Currently, I am in Central Washington University's physical education and school health program and I have been loving it! Not only are my professors fun and very knowledgeable about our career path, but they also care heavily about the success of their students and the importance of teaching as a whole. Overall, Central has become my home away from home and I couldn't imagine myself anywhere else!"
Junior,4,"Throughout the past few quarters, I have taken multiple classes online through Central Washington University. While online learning can sometimes be a challenge, many of my professors have practiced including multimodal assignments and information sessions to help students succeed within these classes. I have had positive progress throughout my online classes and my professors constantly communicate with me to make sure I stay on the right track for success within their class."
Freshman,4,For online classes we use this system called canvas which is very helpful in locating classes and keeping on schedule. The professors are always posting on this and this is how you track your work and know when assignments are due.
Freshman,4,Central Washington University is a very pleasant and smaller class size college which has many committed teachers and coaches. I deeply enjoy the view of the outdoors everyday and the small town feel as I love the country and CWU gives you many opportunities to go out and enjoy the outdoors.
Niche User,4,I went to this school for the Running Start program and the advisor assigned really helped me a lot. When I first got there I was lost as I've never been there I asked a random student walking by and thankfully they helped me find my way. The staff was a great help too when I was attempting to find the library in order to buy my books. Overall the environment was amazing I enjoyed being there the online classes were also great.
Sophomore,4,The online experience is great because professors are willing to adapt and are very understanding about situations.
Sophomore,4,Ellensburg is a beautiful place and CWU is a very welcoming environment. Everyone on campus is very friendly and overall a great place to further your education.
Sophomore,4,Summer 2020 is my first quarter at CWU but so far so good! Still early in my journey but I have don't have many complaints so far.
Sophomore,4,My online experience with CWU has been fairly good so far. Its been hit or miss at times getting in contact with different departments or faculty but overall has been a pretty good experience thus far.
Senior,4,"In comparison to in-person classes, I missed out on a lot of extra knowledge. I do not have the social interactions with my peers and instructor, so that is a bummer. However, I feel that I am performing at a higher level online than I do in person. The school is taking this pandemic situation very seriously and make the student's interactions with their classes as smooth as possible."
Sophomore,4,"Well... Due to COVID-19 our classes are online. It’s alright I guess, some professors struggle to use Zoom a bit and some have alternative websites doing the same thing as Zoom basically. Everyone’s friendly so far so I have no concerns."
Sophomore,4,"CWU has MANY events created for students... like literally every week there’s never an empty moment at school. Though I don’t like the fact that they are so far away from big cities (2 hours drive to Seattle?) but it is a very big and serene campus. The food has some healthy options but very limited in choices, the rest is not most healthy but I’d say it has a great cooking quality. Education so far is alright. The classes are usually not terribly dense which I appreciate so I receive more focus from professors. Very affordable school I’d say on average, unless you study the Aviation major. Music major here is a famous and prestigious program but quite stressful to keep us with. Also if you come Freshman year, ACs of most freshman buildings are BROKEN, literally its so cold in winter and so hot in summer..... unless you stay in newly built ones like Wendell or Barto"
Sophomore,4,Central Washington University is the most diverse school in the state. It has tons of clubs that anyone could find their own interests in. That’s how I met most of my friends. I attended BSU and MECCA and they welcomed me with open arms. The only downside of it is that there is absolutely nothing fun to do in the city. There’s no recreational facilities down there.
Junior,4,"I enjoy my time here at CWU in the music program. The music program continues to impress me at every corner and I am eternally thankful for the high quality of instruction and care given to all students in the music department. However, on a larger scale, many administrative aspect of the university can be a lot more efficient. The club activities organizations have ran  out of funds halfway through the year multiple times, and I've had to wait in the financial aid office for 3-8 hours for almost every one of my quarters here at CWU to be sure that I was actually getting aid for my education."
Junior,4,"I love the place in here because it brings the comfortable feeling. In addition, this place is good for study."
Niche User,4,I loved that I got to meet a variety of great people and make such good friends. However I feel like Central can do so much better when it comes to admitting students of color with all different identities.
Freshman,4,"Although I haven't done much on campus in general, the experience with the classes and the events has been awesome so far."
Sophomore,4,"At first I was lost and I felt like I didn’t fit. I got my classes and met lost of people and joined a club and like it. I like how different it is and how diverse it’s when you walk around campus. I also like how the students and teachers advocate for what is needed. For example, recourses for minorities, and more diversity within the staff etc."
Freshman,4,"Central Washington University is a great place! Currently, I am living on campus. The atmosphere here it awesome, everyone is really friendly to one another. All of the professors that I have had so far have been able to answer all of my questions and they are really helpful. We have a very diverse campus, so there is a lot of opportunities to make new friends who come from different places. I’ve had a good experience at Central so far, and I cannot wait time come back next year!"
Freshman,4,"As a freshman my outlook on CWU so far is great. I am in the honors college which has made my experience even better here at CWU. The campus is easy to navigate and walk around. The food options are somewhat limited if you are just eating on campus, the food does get tiring but you just have to remember to spice it up. The dorms are very nice, at least some of the newer ones (Dougmore and Barto)."
Senior,4,I like this campus because you can have big class like a large school or the most of the time small classes with a max of 40 students. The teachers and staff do care about you and weather or not you are learning or this is right for you. ThE want you to do well and encourage you to do better.
Junior,4,"I work full time and go to School full time. All my classes are online which helps me cause I live 150 mile from campus. My adviser has been amazing helping me getting my goal accomplished. Without these online classes I would not be able to do it. Our daughter lives their and attends school their. The parking is a joke, needs to build a parking garage and not new sporting field. It is a beautiful campus and no bums hanging around either. I look forward to getting my degree and using it."
Senior,4,The campus is great. The classes are not overcrowded. The instructors are engaging and knowledgeable. There are many different places on campus to relax and study comfortably and safely.
Freshman,4,"It's been a fun time. I really like this university because they have diverse people all striving for the same goal. They offer a ton of fun, engaging clubs as well, which helps with social interactions and meeting new people."
Freshman,4,Central is a good size university where you're able to connect with your professors and they know who you are for the rest of that quarter. There are lots of cultures to experience and a fun campus setting.
Senior,4,It's a great school with a great academic program. I took a star off because class quality also depends on the faculty that teaches.
Alum,4,"I enjoyed the community and culture at Central Washington University. I also had no issues with the administration, housing, or advisors. My only complaint was with my major (Recreation, Tourism, Events), the structure could be frustrating and there were some teachers that many students had complaints about and the department could have done more about it."
Freshman,4,"Central is an amazing school that truly cares for their students success. There are many resources and the staff is very helpful. The culture at central is like having a big family. Everyone is welcoming and friendly. There are many options in courses to take for freshman, which is nice because you can find out what you are interested and can potentially major in."
Junior,4,Great place to live and go to school! Central has incredible professors and the town is perfect if you're looking for a close community. The campus always feels very safe.
Junior,4,"I am a primarily online student so I don't have interactions on-campus. So far, I'm happy with my experience."
Junior,4,"If you're looking for a Bachelor's on a budget, this school is for you. With some of a cheapest tuition in the area, the return on your investment for your degree is pretty decent. There's a wide variety of majors, and don't require crazy prerequisites to get into them like other colleges. However, this isn't a college you go to if you're looking for a party scene. There's zero greek life and most people are just focused on their academics and hanging out with friends."
Niche User,4,"Even though I had visited during the summer, those who were there were extremely helpful. I was able to see an admissions counselor and got all of my questions answered. Definitely made me want to go here."
Junior,4,I love this place!I love the fact that when I come to do my homework I also find a place too study and a lot of the people here are really nice and friendly. I feel like I live back at home.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus, its very focused on comunity and diversity. The class sizes are not overwhelimg as well, most classes hold about 20 to 30 students in a class room so it gives you more student to teacher talks. I wish the food can be improved but I just might be a picky person"
Senior,4,"Just like the majority of students the learning can be a nuisance. However, there are teachers here that are amazing and help you out if you are struggling. My advisors (and others) are very helpful in helping one decide what is best for them and go from there. The school has amazing clubs and organizations that it is no problem finding one that you might like. I joined the club Alpha Kappa Psi and I am so glad for that. The people I met in this club will always be my friends. I'm glad that I chose Central and I could not see myself going to another college."
Sophomore,4,"It is a very welcoming and a very diverse institution. I've also made many new friends in my first year alone. The professors are also very helpful and willing to make time for each student, as class sizes are roughly 25 students per classroom."
Senior,4,"CWU is one of the cheapest universities in Washington, and that means you really get your money's worth. If you can stay away from living in the dorms, I highly recommend it. There are so many more ways to get involved on campus without having to live on the campus itself. The gym is very small, and often times top busy for comfort."
Niche User,4,I took a tour of the campus and was amazed at their facilities. There are many opprtunities for students all year round. Reall does feel like a fun community.
Freshman,4,"I feel like diversity could be better. they claim to be diverse but the majority of students are white ad the town seems to be rather conservative. You shouldn't claim to be something that you aren't. Also, the food could be better but it's not the worst. I enjoyed all of the professors to be very good and I didn't have any bad experiences with them. The counselors were very helpful when I decide to transfer schools and they made sure I was all set for when I left campus. The campus is beautiful and clean. It's also a good size so you don't get lost while finding your classes. There is also a multitude of activities that you can participate in on campus to help find people that you'll connect with. The dorm life is also really good and you can meet a lot of people in your building. I would recommend CWU to people as I did enjoy my time spent there."
Sophomore,4,"I'm an out of state student. I came to this school with the knowledge it had a lot of diversity and a good graphic design program. There a programs to help out students. However, students need to seek for the help."
Sophomore,4,"The people there are always friendly and willing to lend a hand. I would like to see more safety precautions regarding snow, and snow filled weather. The campus is beautiful and not too big. There is an abundance of food on campus and in town in proportion to the size of campus."
Freshman,4,"I like the school overall.  The food is good, classes go well, some teachers are helpful, and they encourage on campus jobs. However, there are a few changes that could be made to improve the school. There is a lack of school pride which takes away from the college campus feel. A lot of professors seem to not care enough about their students. Finally, there are a lack of activities on campus."
Niche User,4,I love the campus and the people I have met so far. The local area is quite small so you definitely could get homesick but you'll make plenty of friends so it won't be too bad.
Freshman,4,"Overall, beautiful and excellent campus.Great food service/quality. Perfect quality of housing if you get a brand new dorm. Most professors are friendly and passionate. But rarely, there are some assault alerts."
Freshman,4,"Central is a very welcoming and inclusive school, everyone is friendly for the most part but when you leave campus the town can be a little unfriendly to minorities, making us feel unsafe."
Niche User,4,"My cousins attend CWU and they love the hell out of it. Usually, they invite me to all the parties or eve to come to some of their events. CWU has become my second home and I will always appreciate how they made me feel welcomed."
Alum,4,"I appreciated the attention I received from my instructors in the music department. However, in the education department, the quality of instruction was unacceptable for several instructors. One instructor cancelled half of my classes. Another told stories about their life and give little to no feedback on our lesson plans. The structures of the university (housing, finance, etc.) are strong and gave me no problems."
Freshman,4,The class sizes are amazing and for the most part the professors really care about your education and want you to succeed. The camps size is also very good.
Freshman,4,I love this school. They always have activities to do if you catch yourself getting bored. The only complaint is the financil aid office taking walk ins but  not taking appointments
Freshman,4,"I have recently gotten into Central Washington University, so I can't really speak for a lot of things, but the campus is beautiful and the staff is extremely helpful, the whole school gives off a welcoming feeling"
Freshman,4,My experience at CWU has been great. Everything is great and so far I don’t think changes should be made.
Sophomore,4,"Central Washington University is known for its diversity and that is very much true. With an event every day connecting everyone as one, there is no one that one can feel alone or disappointed at this university. I would recommend this college to anyone who wants college to be educating yet fun."
Freshman,4,I have not begun my fall quarter yet but I'm very excited to get there and do so the staff is helped me greatly and trying to achieve my goals and getting financial aid to attend school
Senior,4,Central is a great school with a relatively small campus. It's the perfect school to get that one-on-one education.
Graduate Student,4,Central Washington University was a great stepping stone to finding out who I really was.  I love the small town atmosphere and family togetherness. I was a gym rat and I played basketball any and every second I was not in class or studying.  The School administration office and staff members where always so helpful.  My professors I absolutely adored. I went on to get my Bachelor of Science in Biology.  Great team of advisors and professors to help you succeed.
Alum,4,"I loved the community and the variety of classes. The town is wonderful and the campus is easy to navigate. The Education department needs to be gutted (avoid JBK at all costs) and the budget needs to be reallocated. The University President's wine budget is more than the entire History department. Priorities, people."
Sophomore,4,The students at central Washington University are very respectful and provide a safe and comfortable experience for others who attend the school. The professors are great and are willing to help you in any way they can so that you can succeed . I would recommend Central Washington University to anyone interested in joining a 4 year community college.
Freshman,4,"Welcome! The wildcat catch phrase, ""You are welcome here."" It's a very inviting and active campus that inspired me to attend it."
Freshman,4,"campus is pretty nice, barto hall is nice if you are staying on campus. The classes are all good that I have heard but double check what the counselors say because they are not always correct."
Freshman,4,I like the community at Central Washington University. Everyone here is very warm and welcoming. The activities on campus are engaging and you get to meet new people. Central Washington University takes the extra step to get their students involved in activities both on and off campus. This school has really grown.
Alum,2,"Graduated with a Bachelors in 1998; had a solid experience. Most recently, I contacted their Employment resources department (pre-COVID) for CWU Alumni as I’ve been unemployed since Jan 2019. Woman who answered my call could not help me with even registering online for their program and was overall rude. I’m more than disappointed in my school for letting me down."
Junior,2,"CWU has very disorganized administration in almost every department I encountered. I was given conflicting advice on everything. They tried to overcharge me on tuition both the semesters I made the mistake of attending.   The financial aid department is filled with incompetent people who do not return calls unless you become a pest. The academic advisors were useless.  I wound up taking classes based on their recommendations that were supposed to be junior/senior level classes, not freshman material I had already covered. I think they just wanted my money and did not give a poo if I wasted my financial aid on redundant courses. Most of the classes were repetitive and dumbed down. I only had one professor that I felt was worth their salary, Maya Zeller."
Freshman,2,"The atmosphere is very distinct. A lot of students attend without any intended major because the school is so easy to get into and it causes the university to be filled with students that do not take their academics seriously. Gen Ed classes are filled with loud, rowdy students. Food is absolutely awful. The town is small and there is very little to do."
College Junior,2,No one here really knows about the greek life on campus
College Freshman,2,i dont even know if i can trust the programs
College Freshman,2,i shouldve just sucked it up and spent the money at a different school
College Freshman,2,"i have been doing well academically, but i am having the terrifying high school bullying experience that no one deserves and its really kicking me down. i need to leave."
College Sophomore,2,"It's only good for the those who are 21+. If you are underage, you have to rely on word of mouth parties that are either huge ragers that get shut down or small parities that aren't much fun. The more common alternative is just sitting in a room drinking rather than going out and coming back (which is almost as hard as finding the parties to begin with."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a party school. The only ragers are at the wrestling house (which they only let a few people in to avoid being let in) or the Rugby house (which only lets hot girls in). If you dont know people there, you wont get in. Everything else is really hard to find and there are cops everywhere. There are parties up north, but they are hard to find and it costs to get in. No Greek life means no parties."
College Sophomore,2,"The cops know where the parties are, so you have to know some lower key spots and even then it will probably get shut down."
College Senior,2,Assault in all forms is a serious issue
College Junior,2,Fast food chains and small businesses.
College Junior,2,"Some meals are alright although others are very fatty and unhealthy such as all the fried food, late night food and even the food in holmes. They need to take away the sushi station since people hardly ever get any. What they have at the sandwich station is stuff they don't have at the salad station which is really annoying when you want to eat extra healthy such as spinach. The gato taco station is very unhealthy, allowing the meat to be just sitting in its own juices and fat. The food is very cross contaminated if your ever allergic to something due to the servers touching and dropping other items in each bin. An you can use your meal plan in the store, although I wish they would sell more things like whole vegetables and or things to be able to cook our own meals. Sadly in the Cstore everything is over priced even the candy bars and soda. Personally I wish you could just go to the store and use your money there to buy ingredients rather than having it pre-made right there on the spot. If it wasn't for the fact that I had to eat on campus due to money I would totally never eat on campus."
College Sophomore,2,Took months for them to even go through my file. I eventually got my financial aid only after several meetings in the financial aid office per week!
College Sophomore,2,They need to do surveys when assigning random roommates.
College Senior,2,the schools needs better food.
College Senior,2,I don't get any financial aid :(
College Senior,2,I have heard negative things about it
College Junior,2,We are only offered the shuttle.
College Sophomore,2,"The wind here makes it very cold at time and hard to ride your bike to school, and in the winter the snow can be a huge hassle."
College Freshman,2,"We don't really have a greek system, and if we do, it's not very well advertised."
College Junior,2,"I only know its homecoming week, when I see our mascot walking around the recreation building."
College Sophomore,2,Most of the off campus housing is small and cramped. They do not allow pets and parking is scarce. I chose to live in a house over a mile from campus.
College Junior,2,"Shuttle has very few stops and only takes one long route around the circuit, so a ride to Safeway takes 45 minutes."
College Freshman,2,Central Washington has really no night life for underage college kids.  You can find a party but that is not my scene.
College Freshman,2,Central is very small and does not have a lot of quality restaurants.  The cost is average because it is mostly fast food.  There are no student discounts off campus.
College Freshman,2,"For me getting financial aid is a headache.  My family is a middle income family who does not qualify for any financial aid.  I am an average student that does not qualify for any financial aide.  I would love to even have work study but I find I am not eligible for that even.  If I want any type of aid it will be student loans that I have to pay interest on while attending school.  For me, I feel like a middle income family can not get any financial aid."
College Freshman,2,"Because Ellensburg is such a small town, there are very few restaurants. Most students can name every restaurant in town off the top of their head. There are lots of fast food places, but only a few sit down options."
College Freshman,2,Drug scenes here are not as noticeable as alcohol scenes. There is very little peer pressure and the policy is enforced quite harshly for those found breaking the policy.
College Freshman,2,"Im not really sure about this topic, i know that the buildings here are dry buildings (no alcohol allowed). I see a lot of people who go to parties but have no idea what its like."
College Freshman,2,"Maybe it is just the people I hang out with, but I don't hear about a lot of parties that are going to happen but I do know they happen often. The school does some cool late night programs such as movies and speakers."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty much average tasting food, with little variety. It's very easy to get tired of the food here."
College Junior,2,"Students do not really know how to drive, so it can get bad. "
College Sophomore,2,"Campus dining gets old really fast. There are only a handful of places a student can go. If a student is not living on campus it is expensive. The variety is not so great, and the food quality is not the best."
College Sophomore,2,"Ellensburg, being a small town, there isn't a lot to do at night. Most places are within walking distances from campus. I am not old enough to drink so I don't not know how the Bars/Clubs are. Most students have cars or have friends with vehicles. There is a transit that goes around so students can use that."
College Junior,2,Expensive unless you buy one of their meal plans. Asian food tends to be too salty and too sugary. 
College Junior,2,Ellensburg is a small town and everything is moderately within close walking distance. 
College Sophomore,2,"Ellensburg is typical small town, there just happens to be one of the largest interstates in the country and a relatively large university to take over the small town feel. If you are looking for regular weekend events, you are probably going to have to travel out a little ways. The nice part about the Central Campus is the proximity to the rest of the state because of its central location. "
College Freshman,2,"It's ok but the town is kind of in the middle of nowhere which sucks, also the town is really small and pretty boring. "
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of cute people around but they aren't really that friendly. People aren't mean but compared to other schools they keep to themselves more.
College Freshman,2,The food is ok. It tastes pretty good but there is not very much that is healthy besides the salad bar. On the weekends there is almost nothing open which sucks
College Freshman,2,"Facilities are pretty good, the student union building is nice with lots of space and places to hang out. "
College Junior,2,"Ellensburg is windy and sometimes you have to fight the wind while walking uphill to get to class. However, the weather can be very nice some days, in the fall it has been cold in the morning but warmed up by the afternoon."
College Junior,2,Policies are very strict regarding underage drinking and drug use; however people have found ways around them. Visitations are allowed in dorm but the visitors have to stay with the person their visiting to make it safer for everyone. Attendance is not very strict as most believe that if you don't want to attend class they're not going to force you and you will have to deal with any consequences.
College Junior,2,The dining charges for students living off campus is about 25& over the on-campus student charges amounts. The food options are not many with little healthy options as well. Not very good food overall.
College Junior,2,"There definitely are not enough parking spaces to go around at CWU. I have been late to class on several occasions for this reason. Permits cost $200. Off campus parking is sparse. As for lots in front of residence halls/student apartments, they are pretty good and you can always find a space to park that's good for as long as you have it."
College Junior,2,I am still waiting on the award and the school staff has different answers of the next step each time I check in. It's very frustrating.
College Junior,2,"Summer is beautiful, but fall gets chilly and breezy. Winter is cold and white. Spring is wet and windy...very windy."
College Junior,2,"There is a lot of unused land on campus that could be used for additional parking, even for reduced fees (far corners of campus), but these spots lie unused. There are only a few lots close to classrooms, and everything else is off campus, or on the edges. It seems that the prices for far parking is too high, considering the time needed to get to class."
College Freshman,2,people are not accepting here. its vary click-ish just like high school. there should be more clubs and activity's for student to be more involved in.
College Freshman,2,"There is some variety in Ellensburg, but not everything is good and things can be expensive which doesnt make sense in a college town."
College Freshman,2,The police find almost every party and they will catch you.  But for acadermics i dont think the teachers are ever unreasonable.
College Freshman,2,There is hardly any diversity at Central. I do like the fact that we get the Japanese exchange students every year so it's nice to have them. But there are a few Hispanics and a few African Americans. I'm Hispanic and have received so much discrimination and racism it's hard for me to fit in and make friends. Sometimes it was so bad I contemplated on dropping out.
College Freshman,2,No one goes to the games really. I mean the basketball season is pretty popular but the attendance and fan support at football games was pathetic.
College Freshman,2,"I don't really know much about it, I know there is a general scholarship but I didn't find out about it until after the deadline had passed."
College Freshman,2,It's a small town and there isn't as many things to do such as you would find in a larger city.
College Senior,2,I have mostly not had to use financial aid to pay for my education at Central.from what I have seen or heard the scholarships that Central offers are pretty good. Their seem to be a rather large variety of scholarships.
College Senior,2,There are very few restaurants around the campus mostly they are all chain restaurants.
College Senior,2,There are a few restaurants and coffee shops around the campus. However other than that there isn't too much to do.
College Freshman,2,There is a bus that runs from campus into town to stores such as Fred Meyer. I have not taken the bus but i would imagine a few people do use it. This is the only transportation CWU offers and it is only to town and back during the day.
Alum,1,"I did not use on-line learning while a student, but prefer face to face, classroom  learning.  My proficiency with computers is poor and I do not have typing, keyboard training and lack speed."
Freshman,1,Professors were rude and not helpful. Zoom is such a hard way to learn and teachers still give us the same amount of HW as if we were still in class.
Freshman,1,Very boring. It’s in a bad location so there is never anything to do. The food is horrible. Dorms are ok but nothing special. My teachers have been very average and not very supportive.
Freshman,1,Terrible. Professors do not care about student's safety and health. Student Success did not care that I was harassed and bullied. It drove to the point I had to withdrawal from school. Waste of money.
Freshman,1,"53% overall graduation rate - but much lower for those with learning disabilities.  Other state schools in Washington have great programs for those with learning disabilities such as ADHD. Disability services at CWU is extremely limited. They are quite reassuring during a campus visit, but once enrolled you will find limited accessibility to advisers, very limited services, and 100 level classes with no accommodations.  Try History 103 with 3 absences before a 'F' with no consideration for disabilities. If you have a disability, do yourself and your family a favor and enroll elsewhere."
Freshman,1,"This school is terrible to attend, they will mess up your money and blame you for it. The main person for the housing should be fired"
Junior,1,"CWU has this tendency to preach ""student safety first"" but almost never practices the school's main slogan. During the snowy months, our sidewalks slippery and icy even though I have seen them use the salter on campus before. There was once a point where my dorm ran out of hot water and heating in the midst of winter for about a month, they didn't have the money for quicker solutions or even to prevent this from happening but they have the money to build a new stadium, sports complex, dorm, and a dining hall?? The food they serve in the cafeteria is absolutely horrendous. My friend once found a cockroach in her sandwich and there are no fresh veggies available for students to enjoy a healthy meal. I lost an average of 15lbs a month because of the awful food they serve which is a problem since I have a serious medical condition. I would transfer but CWU makes it hard."
Senior,1,"I am an online student in CWU's IT and Administration Management Program with 18cr left in the degree.  Coming from North Seattle College with a two year degree and A+, Security+, and CCNA I was expecting the BAS program to pick up where a 2 year degree leaves off. This degree is just a piece of paper, I have not gained any practical IT skills AT ALL from the year and a half taking classes at CWU."
Niche User,1,"Had some really good professors, but the school admin is terrible! I was one of many transfer students who was promised that their credits would transfer only to get there and then be told I had to re-enroll in classes I'd already taken."
Recent Alumnus,1,The housing department is extremely uncooperative
College Freshman,1,I feel like a Greek system would help this school out a lot and make it much more popular
College Sophomore,1,"It is hard to have a good Greek life if there isn't really one to begin with. Yes there is some groups that pass as frats, but they are not really true frats. There is a few super serious business frats that accepts anyone with a 3.5+ gpa and a a religious group that is non exclusionary, but there isn't really a rush or anything Frat like about them other than the name."
College Freshman,1,Central doesn't have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek life. I mean we have a christian brotherhood and a couple business frats, but no houses or parties. We have Living Learning Communities, which are supposed to be similar, but they really aren't and they are boring."
College Sophomore,1,"Having to do the check for 1 out of 4 students to file for financial aid is HORRIBLE! I got very little help because I had to wait past the due date because my parents didn't file their taxes yet. So because it was past the deadline, CWU screwed me with financial aid and I barley get by each month!!"
College Junior,1,My finical aid is always getting rejected .
College Freshman,1,"There are about 3 different ""greek"" houses; religion and business-based. They're not a huge deal unless you are interested in them. All members I have met are very welcoming and giving to everyone."
College Freshman,1,Everything about our dining system is bad!
Recent Alumnus,1,We don't have a greek system and I LOVE it.
College Sophomore,1,they don't really have any
College Junior,1,"There are rarely ever parking spots available if you get to school late. You have to pay one dollar and fifty cents to park, and there is never open spots. "
College Junior,1,"There is a taco bell and a taco time close to the campus. The campus has a Chinese restaurant on the side, but there really is not an option, and most do not acknowledge student discounts. "
College Junior,1,"Not an option available, there are no restaurants on campus."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is very expensive, my on campus apartment comes with free parking, only good in one parking spot. "
College Junior,1,"Ellensburg is extremely cold. It is located at the foothills of the mountains, two hours away from Seattle. Very Chilly. "
College Junior,1,"There are bars, but I don't drinks. Other than parties harboring drunks, there is nothing really to do in Ellensburg. "
College Freshman,1,There is a bus but the times are weird and it doesn't run very much on weekends which is when I actually want to go out and do stuff. There is a shuttle to Seattle which is $35 that runs a few times a day.
College Freshman,1,Campus scrictness isn't too bad but the cops always break up parties in the town
College Freshman,1,"parking on the street is a pain, and the parking passes are too much money for a student who is unemployed."
College Freshman,1,my program is not fun or satisfying at all. i want to change majors
College Freshman,1,"I do not think the food on this campus is good, compared to other colleges there is not as many places to eat or a good variety.  It is also very hard to eat there if you cant have gluten or dairy."
College Junior,1,The campus parking people suck. I had somebody steal my pass and my car was parked on campus for a month. The university charged me over 300$ in fees even though I had paid for a pass.
College Senior,1,There are two shuttles that circle parts of ellensburg. Luckily it's a small town because it is the worst public transportation system I've seen and is never used.
College Freshman,1,"The drug scene at Central isn't very big. You can be sure that there are students who do drugs and drink alcohol, but it is very rare that you will see and drug related activity on campus such as peer pressure or public usage."
College Freshman,1,There aren't really any good places to meet people here. Especially for the LGBT crowd.
College Junior,1,Not Enough – There aren't enough scholarships for the average student. Only ones for the extremely unfortunate and the over achiever.
College Freshman,1,Non Existent – There is Greek life here at Central but not many people participate in it. I haven't heard of any sororities or fraternities and Greek life isn't a big part of Central.
College Junior,1,Permit costs are around $200 for a year and the availability of parking after 10AM is poor - better to just walk to campus as the town is small and the bus is free.
College Student,1,"Diffictult to Get Transfered! If you send your financial aid to one school but end up going to another, you will lose just about all of it.  so be careful with the schools you choose!"
College Junior,1,"If you know enough people you will know about the parties around campus, but other than that its relatively quiet campus where most go to bars or clubs, but you have to be 21 or older for those."

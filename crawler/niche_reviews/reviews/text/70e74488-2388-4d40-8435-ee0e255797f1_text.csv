Sophomore,5,I was a running start student and it was nice. The campus is pretty good and I like the courses they offer.
Sophomore,5,"Before COVID, I actually took a quarter of all online classes and I did well because you work on your own time and it was super flexible."
Sophomore,5,I love Columbia Basin College because everyone is so outgoing and caring towards students and education.
Freshman,5,"Yes, all my classes are online. Columbia Basin College uses canvas and zoom for their academics. The teachers are well organized in teaching students in the best possible way as possible."
Freshman,5,I like sports and fitness center. I like that they have running start so that you can pursue your career while you are still in highschool.
Freshman,5,As of right now I’m having to do all my classes online in 2020 for fall quarter. And it’s kinda nice because we can just email our professors or staff if we need any help. But it’s also a pain sometimes cuz we can’t go onto campus if they don’t get back to us on time.
Alum,5,Had to take online classes because of COVID-19 at CBC and they were good classes for how little time many professors had to completely change their curriculum to an online method. Some classes were tricky because some students simply don't grasp methods as well as if they were in-person classes but overall the professors did the best they could with the services that the school offered them.
Freshman,5,I am currently taking 3 courses online and my instructors have clearly labeled out the course path and are quick to respond to any questions or emails sent. I am a person who learns the best with visuals and hands on examples but the online courses have been presented clearly enough so that it was easy enough for me to learn the material i am learning.
Freshman,5,"Starting college during quarantine because of a pandemic has been different but from what I've seen around the campus before it closed and what I've heard from fellow classmates, the campus is wonderful. There isn't much housing but there is more being built."
Freshman,5,My overall experience with attending Columbia Basin College has been amazing. I started in high school as a dual enrollment student. The staff has been nothing but incredibly helpful and caring. Nearly every professor and staff member I have had the chance to meet has been genuinely interested in their students education and goals. The courses and programs provided are great for students who want to enter the workforce during or directly after college.
Freshman,5,"Because of COVID-19, Columbia Basin College has reverted spring and summer 2020 quarter to online classes. I was initially worried about taking my classes online at home as I didn't have the technology resources to do so. Thankfully, CBC has set everyone up with the necessary technology to ensure that they finish their classes. The staff has been there to answer any questions I have and helped me with any arising problems caused by lack of physical communication."
Freshman,5,"The campus is a very calm place to be in. It’s a safe environment and the instructors and staff are very nice and attentive. The classes are not that packed with people and you can actually learn. Most professors want you to succeed in your classes and would do the best they Can to help the students out in their classes. The clubs are pretty fun. I was in PTK and there was a lot of volunteering for many things. Things that would help out the community, and I thought that was really nice and thoughtful."
Freshman,5,My online experience is very good. I’m taking all my classes online this quarter. Some professors make zoom meeting for any students that have any question. Even though classes are online professors still make the effort to explain the work. They also make sure the answer anything the student is co fused about or need help on.
Niche User,5,"I like that everything is new in that college and also that there is Starbucks. Also, there are really good teachers"
Freshman,5,"I am a current student at CBC and when first applying I wasn't sure this was the college I was going to attend. However, I'm glad I attended. in my first quarter here I already had professors who truly cared for my success and would continue to let us know they were available if we needed help. I was brought out of my comfort zone and its something that has helped me moving forward. Because of all the kind professors I have found my voice. I'm not afraid of asking for help. or raising my hand to ask questions. I've been more involved in the school life and I count be happier."
Freshman,5,"I love that the instructors, professors, whatever they prefer to be called, want to be there, and care. There are  a bunch of events to increase student morale, and I love that they are doing the PB&J sandwich thing weekly. There is a diversity that is awesome, I see different groups of people that I normally do not."
Freshman,5,Columbia Basin College is such a diverse college! There are many resources for students and their staff is always ready to help! I wouldn't change anything about Columbia Basin College.
Niche User,5,I liked the school because they would help you if you need help in different ways. If you want to Columbia Basin College it is a medium-sized school. If lost they would help you with posters/banners to help go to your class.
Freshman,5,"I am a first year student at Columbia basin college and the teachers are very accepting with my hard schedule. It is easy to get to other classes and I feel right at home. I find it easy to contact teachers and they are very helpful. This is a very diversed college but also accepting, we are all different but we all come to learn and the teachers are so helpful. I will hopefully do another 5 years after my AA because I have grown comfort with this college."
Niche User,5,"I really like this college. The people are nice and the professors are easy to get along with. My favorite part of the college is when they do the CBC festival for band. My high school has went multiple times and we have won 2 years in a row now. The college in general is just a great place to be at, no problems there."
Alum,5,"It was local, easy to sign up for classes. Parking was convenient. Local transit takes you to the school."
Sophomore,5,Columbia basin college is home to diverse students with pride for their individuality and pursuit of education and overall fulfillment in happiness and over all goal.
Sophomore,5,"I love the location, the professors, the student life. It’s all local and everyone wants you to succeed. They are working on adding dorms and make it more efficient for students. It’s a great school and very affordable for people who want to continue their education but are on a budget or have real life responsibilities."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Columbia Basin College has been great. This is because I was accepted into the College Assistance Migrant Program (CAMP) which helps migrant students get settled into their first year of college. CAMP offers many great benefits such as campus visits to other universities, book assistance and free tutoring are just a few of the many things that are offered by the program. Overall my CBC experience has been excellent due in large part to the CAMP program I do not know what I would have done without their support."
Sophomore,5,"My experience so far has been pretty good, when I got down here in September I already met a ton of people and I'm really glad that I chose to go to CBC."
Freshman,5,Columbia Basin College or CBC is an awesome college experience in that it is a good start for any body looking to enhance his/her life through education. Also i think it is a great place to meet awesome people. Next it offers amazing and eye opening programs like C.A.M.P and Trios. Through these programs Ive gotten a broader perspective on people that are of similar backgrounds. Not only are the programs amazing but the staff at CBC is very helpful. Moreover they are very helpful because it made me not feel confused about college right where it is at its most confusing stage. That stage is in the very beginning which is transitioning from a high school student. CBC in my opinion does a superb job at this. Also they offer many certificates that will aid anybody in their life with good jobs.
Sophomore,5,"The campus has great diversity and a good energy! Instructors really care about the students and give 100 percent to ensuring their academic success. The campus is easy to navigate, and they have an excellent resource center. They have just added super cute dorms that I would have lived in last year had that been an option.  They have a pretty broad catalog of courses and they try to match what the local area is in need of so getting placed after graduation, locally is easy. The planetarium and observatory are super pleasant surprises and they are free to the students."
Sophomore,5,This is my second year going to CBC. My over all experience has been really good. One more year and I could finish my AA. Which is a year in advance. You have a question and they are always there to help. The professors are really there for you when needed. I would recommend this college to others.
Freshman,5,"My experience with Columbia Basin College is great the staff is helping me get started with my admission process and guide me in the right direction. I highly recommend Columbia Basin College. Something I would like to see change about Columbia Basin College is the school expenses! although , I know College and further education will never be free. Columbia Basin College is the way to go to commence your degrees!"
Senior,5,Columbia Basin College is a great starter school and they are even getting into 4 year degrees as well. It is a good option if you are wanting to go to school for less money than 4 year universities.
Junior,5,CBC is the perfect size and the teachers there really want to see you succeed! I commute to CBC and it has been a wonderful experience. Anyone who is on the fence about where to go should definitely consider going to Columbia Basin. You won't regret it!
Sophomore,5,"Love Everything about it, but i would change the parking situation, NEEDS MORE PARKING. The professors are nice and always available, the campus has lots of diversity, there are a lot of class options and programs you can go into. They have a lot of clubs you can join, they have a student government and they always have outside activities for their students, like rollerskating, or a dance. They even have student jobs for students at the institution to apply for, you can be making money while going to school and they work around you schedule, its awesome."
Niche User,5,"Love the experience there, teachers are very helpful, personalized experience in rewarding career fields."
Freshman,5,I have been going to Columbia Basin College mostly online for three quarters and have really enjoyed it! The professors are awesome as long as you utilize ratemyprofessor.com!
Freshman,5,Columbia Basin College offers multiple opportunities and they even have programs after accomplishing your AA.
Freshman,5,CBC has the unknown stigma of being the school kids who can't afford college go to but honestly it's great. The staff at this school make sure there students are cared for. I'm glad I started my college experience here I wouldn't trade it for the world. As cheesy as that sounds
Freshman,5,"I have enjoyed this school! Teachers are helpful, nice atmosphere. Its been almost 10 years since I've been to school since high school and this has eased my mind completely. Im working and going to school full time but school has been less stressful than I planned. Teachers push you to your fullest which has been a great feeling and left me ending the quarter with a 3.89 GPA. Im happy that I get to continue my education with this school."
Sophomore,5,"This is my second year at Columbia Basin College, and I have thoroughly enjoyed attending.  Not only is the price great and affordable, but I have learned valuable information in each and every class, and I can apply this information in and out of the classroom.  This is due to the professors at CBC.  They are passionate about what they teach, and are willing to help you in any way that they can! The students at CBC are friendly as well.  There are a lot of various clubs that give you the opportunity to meet students who have similar interests as you.  I love the layout of the CBC campus; it is easy to get to and from each of your classes.  I also like that it is not too far from restaurants and you can grab a bite to eat, if you have a break in between classes.  It is also nice that there is a gas station and a coffee shop right across the street. The ONLY complaint that I have regarding CBC is the parking.  They desperately need to add more parking lots and/or a parking garage!!!"
Freshman,5,Starting out at CBC was nerve racking to be sure. I quickly got into the flow of things with the constant help from my instructors. Whatever isn't covered in class I can contact them on canvas or during their office hours. Plus Counselors welcome my questions and help me pave my career path and goals by showing me ways I can learn more about my major and what colleges provide the best education for it.
Freshman,5,Columbia Basin College (CBC) is a small college with an excellent student body. The annual cost is quite cheap compared to large 4 year colleges.
Freshman,5,"Columbia Basin College has a very clean and pretty  campus, great facilities, a very kind and friendly student body, and group of professors that are dedicated to the students learning. The facilities here at Columbia Basin College are magnificent, they have a gym the has a plethora of cardio machines and weight lifting equipment, and their student building (AKA Hawk Central) is a warm and friendly environment that not only gives students an area to study but to also meet and make new friends. The professors here at Columbia Basin College are unique in the fact that they are so dedicated and invested in the students learning. Each one of my professors has made it very easy to communicate with and understand the material. In fact the only down sides about Columbia Basin College is the parking, which is not big enough for the entire student body. Other than that Columbia Basin College is an extraordinary college that has left a positive impact on my college experience."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Columbia Basin College was amazing. I am still attending CBC  and it is great being on campus. What I like about CBC is that everyone is friendly to you, if you ever need help finding a class or get lost, there is always people around who you you may ask for help or automatically they help you if they notice you are in need of help. The campus is amazing. In the Hub building they have a room with intertaining games, they have a Starbucks where you can buy coffee if your still asleep. I would say there’s nothing that could be change at CBC everything is amazing just how it is."
Freshman,5,"There's a lot of help here if, you just search for it! It's more than just attending school, it's about participating in a lot of different things this school has to offer!"
Freshman,5,Wonderful first year college student experience very easy to navigate. There are so many different resources for information. The online courses are amazing and the professors who run the online classes make themselves very accessable.
Alum,5,"Going here was a blast! The professors were extremely helpful and provided resources upon resources. There is a wide selection of classes offered, and tons of different times as well. There are sports and clubs for just about everything too!"
Junior,5,"I love how small the campus is compared to a big university. The professors are great and the class size is small which allows for more 1 on 1 attention when in the classroom setting. The material taught is at a high level and the college is challenging. Overall its a wonderful, clean, and beautiful campus."
Freshman,5,"Currently enrolled for my first year at CBC. Excellent help with the enrollment process, wish me luck with my first year. ~"
Sophomore,5,"Columbia Basin College is inclusive, helpful, and not at all intimidating. I was in their running start program and I'm about to graduate with an AA degree and a high school diploma! The running start program allowed me to attend 2 years of college and my only expenses were fees and textbooks. I was able to save thousands of dollars. I truly enjoyed my time there."
Sophomore,5,"Columbia Basin has not only been an amazing school to attend, but has become an influential part in aiding me to choose an accurate career path for myself. The professors as well as other members of staff have been incredibly supportive and helpful."
Alum,5,"The advisers at Columbia Basin College helped direct me to the correct degree and appropriate courses based on my career goals. Signing up for classes was simple and opportunities for study assistance were offered as needed. The campus is easy to navigate and the instructors are engaging. Overall, I had a good experience at CBC."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently attending Columbia Basin College. It is a community college in Pasco, WA. One thing that I love about CBC is the CAMP program, its a migrant assistant program that helps students out financially and academically. I am proud to say that I am a CAMP graduate. CAMP gives students money for their progress reports and takes students on trips to see other universities of their choice. The professors at CBC are nice, but can be strict at times. The good thing is that the classrooms are averaged of 30 students per class. It gives a chance for the students to talk one on one with their professor. Another thing about CBC is that it's cheap to attend, it's fun, close to the mall and a lot of restaurants and they finally made dorms on campus for the students at Columbia Basin College."
College Senior,5,this is basically a school to just get your AA or transfer degree so they help you so much with those processes there are sites on their websites specifically for this.
College Sophomore,5,I like online courses so that way I don't have to in physically in class everyday I can be home with my kids and study when its convenient for me. Most of the professors who teach online classes are very good at it.
College Sophomore,5,They offer job fairs for up in coming graduates. They have a list of jobs currently in circulation in our area.
College Sophomore,5,Every class that I have attended at CBC has been very diverse. The professors make going to class fun and entertaining toward what we would be learning in class that week or day. I have not taken a class that was not worth my time. They all seem to be filled appropriately for the course.
College Sophomore,5,"One of things  I like best is the fact that CBC has a job fair every couple of months. For those individuals that do not have the means to buy interview clothes they have a free ""closet"" for those people needing items. They have several employers there to help with students needing jobs in their relating field, as well as campus jobs."
College Sophomore,5,"Going to school in general is a lot of course work. I feel like the program that I am in is a lot of work but its structured toward my future career which I love. I'm not learning bogus knowledge that wont have anything to do with real life. everything on campus is easy to find, and everyone is very helpful."
College Sophomore,5,"I love going to Columbia Basin College. They seem to want to help you succeed in school, They want to help you get the career you want. They show you what resources they have available and will pass you around so that way you get the most and best possible help you need to attend successfully. I would choose CBC again."
College Sophomore,5,It was the best experience yet and can't wait for years to come
College Freshman,5,"The Tri Cities is full of job opportunities, so after getting an AA degree there are infinite places to apply."
Freshman,4,It is kind of sad to do online classes because you do not experience the real life teaching. I have been doing good on the online learning. My grades are good and as long you complete your assignments on time the class will be a breeze.
Freshman,4,I loved the school. Mostly all the teachers are nice and the classes are educational. The school is filled with friendly people. The campus was clean and it was easy to get around.
Sophomore,4,"Some professor made you teach yourself just because it was online, but the classes were not difficult."
Sophomore,4,"I've had some really excellent Professors here. I've enjoyed my time here at CBC. It has it's short comings (like parking, adjusting to online learning, counseling/hawk central communication) but overall I really can't complain. There are lots of activities and groups you can be a part of here, I've met some great people."
Junior,4,"As a transfer student to Columbia Basin College, it is a great school and good start for those students who want to finish there prerequisites first and have a see on how college classes are compared to a University."
Junior,4,"The online learning at CBC for me was easy. You get to connect with your instructors in Zoom which is free! And get to turn in all your work in Canvas. Although, if you need to get a hold of your instructors you will have to email them but due to getting email from many students, you’ll have to wait at least 1-2 days for a response."
Freshman,4,The staff is very helpful and when u send an email they get back to within the next day. Something I would want to change is the money payment plans because they divide payments into 3 but are still a lot of money to be paying at once so it doesn’t help much.
Alum,4,"Transferred from another community college to CBC and thoroughly enjoyed my time here. The professors are always willing to help their students, so PLEASE make sure if you don't understand what a professor is teaching that you ask questions! I was only here for one year before I graduated with my AAST and transferred to a 4 year state school. But the resources offered to students is great, especially since majority of them are already paid for within your tuition! The only negative I had with the school is how spread out the campus is, having a class in the Business building and then trotting to the opposite side of campus for a class in the SWL building was a journey in itself. As well as the parking situation - with as big as the campus is, they should reduce the grass areas and add in more parking spaces."
Sophomore,4,"Columbia Basin is a great college, there is great variety in classes and student resources all around. There is a wide range of available study help that they provide, and generally professors work to the best of there ability to help their students pass and understand in class material."
Sophomore,4,"I have taken a few classes online before the pandemic, and all of my classes are online. The professors do a good job of teaching using programs like zoom to get in touch with students. The professors are readily available for questions through emails."
Freshman,4,"My online experience has been a little hard because I personally learn better when a professor is in front of me teaching and I can be able to ask questions. With online classes, I don’t think I show the same effort as with face to face classes because like many others, there’s stuff at home that happen and I’m not always able to fully focus on what I’m trying to learn, but I try to get the things done as much as I can. Online classes are somewhat challenging, but they’re available to us on these hard times so we can proceed with getting our degrees on time."
Junior,4,"I absolutely love the faculty at this college. From the student services desk in person to phone conversation they are happy to talk to you and eager to help. However I think the career counseling/guidance was falling short my first 18 months. It changed after 18 months because I enrolled in TRIO, which had me kicking myself for not having been involved with them since the beginning. These ladies are amazing and very encouraging. 
I would like to take a moment to include that I believe the math not only at this school but all colleges is in need of altering. It's ridiculous that I have to take 3 remedial math classes before I can take the 1 class nessessary for my degree, which also is less difficult math than the prerequisites."
Freshman,4,I like the Tutoring center that the college has to offer. You get more one of one experience and help. The teachers are really there to help and answer any question you have. One thing that could change is I’m pretty sure everyone hears it all the time is that parking spaces.
Freshman,4,Online schooling isn’t as bad as I imagined it. I thought it would have been a bit more difficult but not at all what I expected. My professors reached out with very clear instructions along with due dates!
Freshman,4,"I love the campus ! When first attending CBC I wasn’t sure how I was going to like it but the professors are very friendly and always open to questions. Not to mention, I love the clubs CBC offer along with sports! They’re very welcoming and open about what they offer."
Niche User,4,Columbia Basin College was a great place for my education and needs to become a dental hygienist. I love how caring the professors were. In times of need they were there. There is a variety of different people that you will meet. It gives people a chance to meet new people and create close friendships. This is a great place to attend!
Niche User,4,"Communication was very thought out. When classes were canceled or I needed more time on an assignment, I was able to reach out to my professors to let them know. Canvas is a great way to check grades and have a list of assignments and due dates!"
Freshman,4,"The staff is very friendly and always wants to help their students do well in school. If I ever have any questions about where to go for financial help, tutoring, or setting up an academic plan then they would help me straight away. I am currently doing online school and they still continue to be a great help by replying to my questions via email and answering promptly with useful information."
Freshman,4,"Columbia Basin College has a nice campus. Many of my math and science professors are researchers/scientists/engineers at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, so the quality of STEM education is excellent."
Sophomore,4,"I have been a student at Columbia Basin College for about two years. I am enrolled through the college's thriving Running Start Program, and I am very pleased with the education I've been able to receive through the program. Thanks to Columbia Basin College's participation in the Running Start Program, I will be graduating from High School with an Associate's Degree this year."
Sophomore,4,The thing that I loved the most about Columbia Basin College is that it felt welcoming to be there. I did not feel out of place and i enjoyed the diversity that there is.
Sophomore,4,"CBC has a beautiful campus and is very affordable. Sometimes their student workers don't know all the answers, and it's hard to get your admissions details straightened out. Student life has a lot of fun things! I wish they had better options for food and housing. Overall a good experience!"
Freshman,4,"For the most part as a running start student, the college has been pretty good. Most professors are pretty understanding."
Sophomore,4,"Small college in a rural area. The tri-cities area is growing. Very good college for the hard sciences with some of the best professors and courses in the state. Large lab spaces that rival large universities. Research opportunities. Only small amount of student housing. No meal plans. Close to PNNL, Hanford,  and other companies that offer internships."
Freshman,4,everyone is very kind and the teachers are helpful with homework and any questions you have about a subject.
Freshman,4,"I am currently enrolled at Columbia Basin College and very much enjoying it.  The college experience with the students and staff so far have been wonderful. The staff for the most part really seems like they want to make sure you have the resources to succeed. Three things I would like to see change about the college would be: More classes for computer science on campus, an instructor and class rating system to see instructor reviews and difficulty level of classes, and more parking."
Niche User,4,It has a great campus  not only it has a great campus it has a great amount of things to do similair to a larger collage
Sophomore,4,"Despite the circumstances of my lengthy travel to the college, I feel that the lectures provided by the professors are very valuable and applicable to what my future career is. Columbia Basin College offers many means of coping with the pressures of academics, as they have a quite spacious hub along with a game room in its interior."
Senior,4,"I like the professors for the most part, many I've had have been helpful and offered support like office hour help and are always on their email to answer questions. I wish the parking was better. A new building was constructed and the volume of students wasn't taken into account so no parking to meet the demand was constructed. Another change I'd hope to see in the near future is windows in classrooms in the math and science building. I took a math class there and when the doors are shut it gets stuffy and the lighting made it hard to focus. The last thing I'd say could have a little help is the online classes offered to CBC students. Although I'm not a distance learner, it'd be nice if CBC offered more online classes to their students."
Freshman,4,"What I like about CBC (Columbia basin college), is that there is always some type of event going on throughout the campus. At CBC there are people who are available to help in any way that you need."
Sophomore,4,Solid small community college. Columbia Basin College is an excellent choice that isn't too pricey. Close proximity to PNNL and Hanford makes for internships and job opportunities as well as professors from unique fields hard to find elsewhere in the country. Advisors are very helpful and excited to see your success.
Sophomore,4,"If you are a first-generation, low-income student there is a pretty good amount of support services available such as; TRIOs, the Resource Center has a lot resources such as travel assistance, book assistance, accommodations for illness(including mental health). Issues everyone else seems to encounter at CBC is finding parking, ridiculously high prices of textbooks and unavailability of certain classes (Graphic design, Medical) that would be good for transferring to 4- year universities."
Sophomore,4,Very good college to go to! Always helps you find the right classes to take and is very helpful with any questions you may have.
Niche User,4,It was a very friendly environment and the professors are very helpful and they want to see you succeed.
Alum,4,"A great college whether your looking to gain certifications or a degree,  CBC is also very affordable and the campus is relatively small with good class sizes."
Senior,4,My favorite this about this school is the teachers and when they see you deciated to something they tend to help you more. They also wanna see their students succeed and do something with themselves
Alum,4,It has a really nice campus and facilities. Very nice and friendly staff that care about the students success. Would highly recommend you check it out.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoyed having been a running start student at this college. It was my first impression about college and I really liked it. There are resources available on campus, like tutoring, that helped me out."
Sophomore,4,It’s a good school for people who don’t want to leave home or travel far. They are super nice and there are some amazing teachers/professors. My only issue i have is the tutoring center there. Sometimes it’s hard to get help with question students have on homework. But other then that it’s a great school
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Columbia Basin College is a great community college. I love that there are many online courses available, it makes it easy when you have a busy life outside of going to class. Online classes are very organized and you are aware of what needs to be turned in so you are able to work at your own pace. I have attended some classes on campus and they tend to move forward at a slow rate. One thing I would like to see changed about Columbia Basin College is the coordination between workers throughout the school. Sometimes you don’t get direct answers, along with incorrect information."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy how helpful and kind all the staff members are with helping incoming freshmen. The campus is pretty big and can get kinda confusing but you get use to it after a while. I also enjoy the athletes at CBC.
Freshman,4,"CBC's a good College, they have many resources available to one. The cost isn't very expensive, the food is good (for example I diggg the Grolled Cheese Sandwhiches they sell, it comes with a side, I usually order fries. The fries are pretty good as well tbh. Oh & for my StarBucks fans, they have a stand there as well... Anywaysss I'm getting off topic. Lmao Sooo the campus is diverse, the professors want you to succeed for the most part, overall, CBC is a great College."
Freshman,4,"I like CBC because it is affordable, close to home, and offers various ways to pay for tuition for books."
Freshman,4,"Eastern Washington University because it is the perfect fit for me. EWU is in a city where I was looking for; it also offers great financial help and services that will help me get through college. It has an outstanding undergraduate education program that I know will prepare me good enough for my teaching career. When I graduate from EWU with my teaching degree in elementary education, I’m looking forward to the possibility of being able to teach at Rowena Chess Elementary, where I can give back to my community, by motivating and inspiring to work hard and do well in school."
Senior,4,"Columbia Basin College is a very beautiful unique school that is located in Pasco Washington. I loved the environment, the student life is very friendly and the teachers are there to assist students. I just got my acceptance letter into their Dental Hygiene Program and I am even more excited to continue working and learning under great teachers and real hygienist."
Sophomore,4,CBC has a great Running Start program. I love how the teachers care about your grades. The only thing I would change is the availability of class times.
Sophomore,4,"I greatly enjoyed the atmosphere. They offered many opportunities to get involved and made it easy to make a difference as an individual. Being a community college I had the opportunity to be in a class room with people of all sorts of walks in life. This made me appreciate school more than before, especially when elderly people or middle aged adults would be in my class. I had excellent experiences with the professors and felt like I was being taught by very well educated and passionate professors. The only thing was the offices of CBC often were hard to get help from right away. But as an over all of the college as a whole I had a pleasant experience in my two years receiving an AA transfer degree."
Niche User,4,This collage is really helpful with plenty of resources to help many low income students achieve their career. They are very close to the community helping each other for example they let high schools borrow their campus for an event that  they do every year.
Freshman,4,The professors are good as well as understanding. The school itself is well maintained and easy to navigate. There is a vast range of classes and degrees available and it is close to home. I very much enjoyed my time there
Junior,4,"I have had a good experience with Columbia Basin College but I do wish they had more parking, it's hard to find any parking."
Freshman,4,"Columbia Basin College has an amazing staff. The staff cares for the students and wants everyone to succeed. Their facilities are amazing. They always want to improve, so they send out surveys to ask what the students think about the school and want to see in the school. Overall, I would say Columbia Basin does a fantastic job tending to students needs and helping them do their best."
Graduate Student,4,I loved going to Columbia Basin. The campus was very nice. It has good places to just relax after or in between classes.
Graduate Student,4,"I'm taking science pre-reqs to fill in my Art Degree so I can apply for med school.  CBC's science labs are spacious, clean and include high grade research tech unavailable at some larger 4 year schools in the area.  The professors are very knowledgeable and most have related experience from working at Hanford or PNNL."
Freshman,4,"SO far as a college freshmen inst at all to bad, Getting started  at CBC is a breeze with hawk central.  The entrance exam is the starting point, from there hawk central, they get your class's for you and help with scholarship opportunists. From there its a easy as going to class, professors are all cool the environment is friendly and opening."
Freshman,4,"Columbia Basin College is always there for you, they help you on tutoring, computer access, and many programs to join! All for the students to be successful."
Freshman,4,"This college is very affordable and has a a foundation that gives out a lot of money every year. So far its been a good experience, great students and teachers on the campus."
Freshman,4,"Columbia Basin College is a great community college to attain a transfer degree or a bachelors (if you plan to major in Cyber Security or Computer Science). Most professors I had were quite good, and were really open to helping their students out. It is fun to attend activities around campus giving your college experience a much better feeling. There is great diversity among races at CBC. What this college seems to lack is sufficient parking lot space (since most students that attend drive from out of town)."
Sophomore,4,They are very helpful they help you in everything that you need. They have excellent programs they have( CAMP) college asistents migrant program they have TRIo also and MESA program they help out a lot during your first year some program help untile you are done with college and transfer to an university.
Senior,4,"I've been going to CBC for about a year and a half now, and its one of the best communuty colleges in the area.  Theres a lot of different options for classes and majors, and theres always something going on. One thing i wish they would do more of is some events over at the richland campus. Its a small portion of CBC, but with all the health sciences over there, it would be nice if there were some activities over there."
Freshman,4,"I like this college because unlike my elementary school, middle school, and high school, Columbia Basin college doesn't make me feel uncomfortable all the time like my previous schools did. This school isn't the best it the world but its good enough for me until I go on to a new school. The classes are great at this school because you can take some online which is great for people who cant make it to campus. The housing area that they have for students is ridiculous in pricing and not worth it to me at least."
Junior,2,So many of the professors there have no idea how to teach and both advisement and testing center have done me dirty.
College Senior,2,"I've taken one online course, which had a decent layout on canvas, but my professor was awful. None of her assignments made any sense, and everything was done in a group discussion. Additionally, she taught no applicable class material and awarded higher grades to students who shared her political beliefs. During this American government class, all I learned was how to make it seem like I agreed with this particular professor."
College Student,2,Some of the professors are bias towards students and aren't the best at caring whether their students succeed.
Recent Alumnus,2,There's professor that have been there for years. They have an old mentality. There knowledge are not so ispiering (some). Some are incredibly rude.
College Senior,2,We do not get to interact with any students. The teachers answers questions but does not teach. They only assign homework. It is hard to know what is expected.
College Senior,2,The career center does not help. The college provides some basic jobs but nothing amazing.
College Sophomore,2,There does not seem like there is many job opportunities at my school.
Recent Alumnus,2,The facilities are kept clean and neat. There are many places a person can go to study to relax. 
College Senior,2,Very hard to understand sometimes and usually not enough help.
College Junior,2,"The network speed is fair, but I wish it were faster. My laptop I bring to school sometimes is not that fast, and so using the internet there isn't very useful for me, because I feel like I'm waiting too long for pages to load for it to be productive for me. I'd much rather use a computer the school has, although the computer labs are sparse (maybe three or four on campus) and they often have a class occurring in them throughout the daytime. Only certain teachers will allow someone outside of the class to use a computer in the same room."
College Junior,2,"The facilities at my school is fine. The library, computer labs aren't amazing but they are fairly reliable. Our resources are average. The gym is fairly good, but I don't use the school for its gym so that has little bearing on me."
College Junior,2,"There isn't much really that sets apart my junior college from any other school. The one thing we have is the Bechtel Planetarium, but that's all. This place is only open at certain times at night, so students don't really get to see it during school hours anyway. The facilities and social scene are rather average here."
College Junior,2,"I feel like the fees, tuition and the cost for books is pretty high. I always find it a struggle when at the beginning of the quarter I don't have enough money to complete the registration for all the classes I had planned to take."
College Sophomore,2,there are so many things to pay and you sit for a long time
College Student,2,"I have actually not even heard anything about the career services. I'm sure that they would be far more helpful to students entering dental hygiene and teaching, for example.The art community at CBC is rather small, however, and there aren't many career opportunities nearby that I am aware of."
College Junior,2,"Could Be Better – Personally I believe that the cost of tuition is very high for being a community college. The education is good, but not for the cost I'm paying. The financial aid office is very nice but the service could me better. A little smile from the clerks could make it that much better. Also, recieveing financial aid is a process that i had not experienced before. I thought I was set to go however that was not the case. I did not recieve an notification from them stating I was missing paperwork; notifications for students, although extra work, could be EXTREMELY useful."
College Senior,2,"Sometimes a Regret – I'm halfway through my time here at CBC. And unfortunately I have to say I'm counting down the days until graduation. I've had a poor experience with most of my prof's; poor communication, unreasonable grading, and some have just been flat out bad at teaching. I'm bored and tired of it."
College Senior,2,Where Are They? I don't even know where to find them. To be honest I am really involved in school but to be an advocate for the rest of CBC students there is not that much help out there. I find myself coming back to my CAMP adviser instead.
College Senior,2,"Since CBC is a Community College, resources are limited. However, if you are motivated to look for available resources there are some very helpful programs that allow you to plan your degree especially if you are planning to transfer."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I moved to Washington and attended cbc for 3 quarters. Transferring in was a bit of a hassle ( but when is it not). I didn't find the councilmen helpful at all. Once I got into classes the professors were very helpful when seeking them out. Although I didn't find the academics to be very challenging. (I worked full-time taking 2-3 classes and aced all of them) and  The student body was friendly and there we lots of clubs available to join. Overall a pleasant school fine for getting an AA, but nothing outstanding or cutting edge about it."
Works Here,1,Faculty driven by their devotion to their labor union and not the students. Leadership has zero diversity and are out of touch with the needs of the college. VP for HR is a miserable control freak and dreaded by every employee on campus.
Sophomore,1,"Dismissive and unhelpful staff.  More resources put into High School students sent to college than the actual college courses themselves.  The only choice for a growing metropolitan area and they take every advantage of that.  Unclear degree requirements that tell you to ask professors what classes you should take and professors who wrote the requirements chastising you and telling you to find the information online which is simply ""Ask head of department for requirements"".  Expensive.  Even if you understand course material they will force you to take per-requisites that don't count for your degree if you didn't attend running start.  Basically, it's only meant for a certain type of person to succeed and for the rest to fail.  Last time I checked the graduation rate was around 20%.  Great place to check out the entitled, exclusionary nepotism the inland Northwest is so great at."
Recent Alumnus,1,Work load is rediculouse. A university is way easier. In the job industry I don't feel competitive at all.
College Sophomore,1,There is not many campus resources for the students to use.
College Freshman,1,"I took ONE online course, and never will again! We were given no deadlines, the syllabus was written with confusing paradigm, and all of a sudden about a third of the class and I had not even half of our assignments complete because we were told we had another week to work on them when in fact that wasn't the case. The lack of communication and seemingly lack of understand of the Canvas software makes online courses impossible, and I don't trust the school with it anymore. "
College Student,1,"Overall, I am not very impressed with the Student Body at CBC.  The ""kids"" are often rude, disrespectful, and lazy, because they are living at home on their parents' charity, and they have no clue about the real world."
College Junior,1,"I feel like I'm taking a lot of classes that I don't really need, or classes I wouldn't really use in a graphic arts career. Financial aid doesn't cover students if they aren't dirt poor or if they are younger than 23, because they expect parents to pay everything for their kid's schooling, as if they don't already have enough to pay for. Classes are way overpriced to attend anyway and are not worth the extreme costs that they are at now."
Recent Alumnus,1,There isn't really much help here from CBC in this department. The school does have career days and things but they are pretty week. I felt like CBC wasn't there to help me be successful but it felt like the school was more of a challenge itself. The only redeeming quality isn't so much for the school but for the area over in Tri-cities.
College Junior,1,"Class Schedule – The class schedules are ridiculous. Lecture for one hour/ lab for one hour 4 days a week. The problem being that there isn't enough material to cover for an hour a day in lecture and many science classes don't do hands on labs, just more lecture during ""Lab"" time. So, on multiple occasions after completing the lecture many times only lasting 20 minutes and then released early, waiting 30 or so minutes until lab starts, then being released 10 minutes after lab starts because the lecture was already done and their are planned labs. Waste of time."

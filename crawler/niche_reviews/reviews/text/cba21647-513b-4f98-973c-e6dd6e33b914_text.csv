Niche User,5,very diverse and great teachers who begin to know you well. small classes that allow teachers to actually work with you rather then at a big college.  campus is small and it is very easy to find your way around fast. maps all around if you get lost though. great study rooms and doors are a little outdated but still very nice.

Freshman,5,Midland college has been an amazing school to me. There are so many ways to be helped on the campus as well as online.
Freshman,5,"So far wonderful college, very helpful staff and wonderful community that is built around this area."
Sophomore,5,It was a really great and fun experience with great people. I was able to succeed with a great staff and teachers who want to make you smarter n help you learn. Midland it self is a great place with great people in the community. Midland college really helped me grow as a person and helped me achieve what I wanted to achieve
Sophomore,5,"This is a very good community college, that works very well in conjunction with Early College High School.  There are very good teachers here, and although the campus is pretty small, it also looks very good. There are also a lot of resources for students to use if they need help."
Niche User,5,This was a very personable experience. Professors here are really concerned with the well-being and academics of their classes. Classes are smaller and the campus is beautiful. I have greatly enjoyed my time here.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Midland College was definitely one that I was very honored to have taken and chosen. Midland College gave me the opportunity and chance to do something exquisite with my time. All the possible resources that are needed in order to achieve something great with your time are available to you.  My professors, I don't know where to even begin ! When it came to not understanding the topic or a lecture, they never failed me and were always very helpful. I highly appreciated the time and effort that was spent on me. The faculty were the people that made it all happen! Without their astonishing help, I would have not felt so welcomed and comfortable with the school."
Sophomore,5,I have loved every minute of being a part of the MC student body. I have gained friends for a lifetime! I think the teachers were great and really want their students to succeed and they are also very understanding when we have to miss class for athletics. I have really enjoyed being an athlete at MC as well because it has prepared me to move into the next level of athletics.
Sophomore,5,Midland College has been an absolutely wonderful experience! There are numerous opportunities for the students to become involved in the school and the faculty is top notch. The professors have been one of the highlights of my experience at the school and many professors will use a mixture of teaching methods to ensure students learn the materials without becoming bored.
Freshman,5,What i like about Midland College is itâ€™s a good place to start out at for academic reasons and even if youâ€™re an athlete. The people are always so nice & the campus is nice & has a pretty simple layout.
Freshman,5,I absolutely love this college I am so happy I chose midland college as a school. Midland college is so much cheaper then any other school.
Freshman,5,Midland college is a great school. I'm a transfer student and when I walked in they made me feel like I was already part of their team which is an awesome feeling. they have a pretty good size campus and their is always police present so you know safety is their main priority. all in all midland college is a great school for you!
Freshman,5,"I have had a great experience with Midland College so far. My advisor, Isabel, is so wonderful and helpful. She even offered to come in after she was off work to sign me up for classes. My professors have helped me so much."
Alum,5,"I was an A&M student and I had to take 15 hours of Spanish classes. I took half of these classes at Midland and did very well becuase I followed the rubric! My professors were very helpful! I only took online 
Spanish classes but I loved them."
Freshman,5,Midland College is small but it feels like home. I live close to my family and I get to meet people from all over the world! I wouldn't change a thing about MC.
Freshman,5,"Midland College has been a wonderful experience for me. All of my professors have been very fun to learn from and very eager for their students to succeed. There is plenty of room to get around and it is a very clean and well maintained campus, which was very important to me. I look forward to continuing my schooling there."
Recent Alumnus,5,I've been able to participate in scholarship internships and have been considered for job opportunities based on my interest in the certain fields I've experienced. My impression is that there is job opportunity everywhere if interested in a certain career aspect.
Recent Alumnus,5,"In my experience, every professor I've had was either helpful or really cared about my success in my educational journey."
College Junior,5,At first i was a little ify on taking online but it wasnt as bad as i thought it was my instructor  was excellent about explain  things we ddnt understanding
Sophomore,4,I honestly enjoyed my online classes during the pandemic due to the planning I could do except for one professor who was COMPLETELY unorganized (but I won't get into that).
Sophomore,4,It's a small school that helps get the basics of college out of the way before transferring. I didn't mind going there.
Freshman,4,"Midland College is more a community college. majority of its students are high school graduates raised here in midland. Its nothing crazy here either. Midland doesn't have that many things to do here so its pretty much school work and whatever else you can get into. the staff, however, go above and beyond to really help. although like most colleges there are certain teachers that could acre less for ya. I would recommend if you are good with a calm college life."
Freshman,4,"They are always concerned over the students future to succeed into greatness. The campus sends out weekly emails that explain the weeks agenda. Since, COVID-19 has occurred our emails have been over how to contact our resources and guidance for online excellence. The college has used every ounce of their resources to ensure the kids end off the school year successfully."
Niche User,4,"I love how open the campus is. It's also very easy to see where you are and where you need to go. Midland College has always been a great college to attend with a wide variety of options. Midland College was my first choice and I'm super excited to attend! It's also super close to home. That way, I will always be able to see friends and family."
Sophomore,4,"There are very interesting teachers, yet some take their job as if they are teaching at a four year university."
Junior,4,Really Love  the professors ! The town has very high rent. Super cute safe town and people are nice ðŸ˜ƒThe college faculty are very helpful
Niche User,4,"I'm applying there this year because  I am a senior in high school, but I have been on there campus before. It is clean it is big and the counselors there are really helpful."
Freshman,4,I really love Midland College! My first year here was wonderful! I learned so many things I never thought I would learn. They actually taught me how to write an essay the correct way! This is hands down a really great community college and I would recommend it to anyone.
Sophomore,4,The professors at Midland College are motivated in their jobs and very passionate about the subject they teach.
Sophomore,4,"The professors and students are always communicating in order for everyone to be successful. The student center is a good place to hang out, study, and eat. There is a game room that has a variety of games that any student can access to relax a bit. The student center also has a food place where you can order almost anything. The library on campus has a variety of sources that can help students with homework, including research papers. The honors program in this college is really helpful and successful in my opinion. The various facilities make this campus a great one to attend."
Sophomore,4,"Midland College- a 2-year program transitioning to a 4 yr program via Sul Ross University. The small classes really do make a difference. The instructors are passionate about ensuring that the students are learning hands-on, real world applications. Focus is not so much on your grades, but how well you learn. First class services and resources. I'm 55 yrs old and was impressed with the welcome among the diversity in cultures and ages of all who attended."
Sophomore,4,I like that Midland College has multiple classes for each subject to need for your major. It makes it very easy to work around my schedule for work and home life. There are classes on campus and online for whatever class I want. The campus is easy to get around and they have so many books about my major in the library so it is easy to get that extra knowledge. The food served on campus is good and prepared quickly so I could always have breakfast before my morning classes.
Sophomore,4,"Midland College has been a pleasant experience for me. My advisor is extremely helpful and responds quickly when I reach out to her. The professors have been the best part. Each one that I have taken classes from, even online classes, have proved to be an invaluable asset to Midland College. They all really care if the student is learning the information. The campus is clean, and parking is always available. There is an on-site police station that gives an added sense of security. The only issue that I have had with Midland College is that many of the classes that are listed in the catalog are not actually available for students to take. This has resulted in having to take classes that I wasn't as interested in because what I really wanted to take didn't have a professor to teach the course."
Sophomore,4,"Midland College is a diverse 4 year school. It offers great professors and academics. The tuition is low and definitely worth your money. Although there is not much to do in Midland, the college offers various student activities and programs. There are tons of classes and electives to choose from some. So far I haven't had a 'bad' professor. everyone at Midland College tries there hardest to work with you."
Niche User,4,"I enjoy the Midland College, because it's close to home and small-based college where everybody knows everybody. They treat me well when they help me apply for classes and scholarships."
Freshman,4,What I really like about Midland College is that the professors and your classmates really want to see you achieve your goal.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently pursuing a degree in marketing before I transfer (because Midland College is really a 2-year college, not a 4-year as is listed above), and as of now my education is absolutely FREE. There are so many scholarship opportunities and connections that it makes living in the middle of nowhere worth it."
Freshman,4,I really like the size of the college. The teachers seem to want the students to succeed. They have all been very helpful. Some of the courses that the college provide are not available much of the time.
Freshman,4,"I like how the campus is not as big and is easy to get to one building to another. I got to meet new people from all over the world. The dorms are not so bad, they are actually pretty nice and roomy. I would definitely like to change the dining halls food and their cleanliness. My friends and I keep finding hair in our foods and sometimes the food under-cooked."
Freshman,4,Midland College is a great community college with reasonable prices and great instructors. There are many scholarship opportunities and they will always work with the needs you have.
Niche User,4,"Midland Community College has a large amount of staff that is willing to help in any aspect possible, but they have a small amount that kind of blows you off and doesn't really help you much. Even though you are paying for them to teach you they don't really care if they can help you."
Senior,4,"Love the school.  Not crazy about the wasted space on the campus - long walk every where you want to go. 

Instructors are great.  Classwork is reasonable.  Good cafeteria and snackbar.  Great location."
Freshman,4,"While I have enjoyed my time at Midland College, I feel there is room for improvement. The price of classes for a community college seems a bit unreachable, especially considering the price of living in the area. While they have some clubs, I haven't really seen a lot in way of events or mixers. The professors from my experience have been great. "
Freshman,4,Midland college is a pretty good college for the money. All the professors I have had were really good. You could tell that they loved teaching. 
College Junior,4,It was of ease to get my classes together when I need them and easy to transfer all of my credits that I had and will have when I transfer again to go to ATM. The advisors were nice and very helpful.
College Junior,4,My credits from high school were easy to transfer and the flexibility of schedules were great. I was able to pick when I had my classes and what teacher I preferred. I took all morning classes so I could go to work in the afternoon and I was out by one everyday to help with more time to study.
College Junior,4,The only courses flow easily and do not have a lot of technical difficulties. The relationship with the professor can some times be a little weak but it is not to bad. The peer-to-peer interaction is great when they are close to your same location.
College Junior,4,Midland College helps you get your associates degree and transfer to a different school of a higher major. They have many programs to help and choose from depending on what your major will be.
College Junior,4,There are many classes you can take and a wide variety of different professors and quality. The professors kind of affect how the quality of the class is but they are very friendly and love helping out students. Other students are also very helpful and do not see this college as a race or competition.
College Junior,4,"This school is not really for completing a degree, it is more of a push to helping you get into the ""college experience"" and getting an associates degree before you go off to a major college."
College Junior,4,I love that my school does activities for younger kids and families in Midland. They are very outgoing and put a great name to the school. I love seeing the kids learn new things and enjoy having fun especially with the science projects.
College Sophomore,4,I'm just enrolled this semester. I have not starting attending classes as of yet. It is impossible to accurately rate based on this.
Recent Alumnus,4,I think almost all of my credits transferred  and counted towards my bachelor's degree.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Online courses were straight forward and easy to access. There was plenty of peer-to-peer interaction as well as teacher imput. The workload was reasonable, and heavy as any college class would be expected to have, but we're also manageable. I feel that online courses keep me on my toes and on top of my assignments."
Recent Alumnus,4,"After receiving my first associates degree, I was offered opportunities to be a scholarship internships at various churches but I continued on with my same internship because of the great amount of help and motivation I've received while working there."
Recent Alumnus,4,"My school is small, and there is tons of one on one access to professors. I've been lucky to have extra help from professors when I've needed it because most have open door policies, making it easier to seek help."
Recent Alumnus,4,"As I am seeking teacher certification, there are plenty of opportunities for working in the public school system and getting early hands on experience, which I think is awesome."
Recent Alumnus,4,My classes during my time in the college had been very flexible and I was able to manage my class schedules and not feel bombarded by the workload I was receiving.
Recent Alumnus,4,The career services in my school have been very helpful in giving me insight to what I really want for myself in the future.
Recent Alumnus,4,Professors were very helpful in my path towards my economics degree.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Very hard-fought, but worth it in the end."
Recent Alumnus,4,The college had been very welcoming.
College Junior,4,I think that the advisor  need a little more training i believe whn you have new students coming into college fir the first time the advisor  need to great a plan and set a couple goals
College Senior,4,"The over all experience was great, smaller class sizes with professors that invest in their students."
College Senior,4,The advising center could still use a bit of work so do your research about your major and degree plan before you sign up for classes.
College Junior,4,"My overall experience at school so far was great, my teachers were very considerate and helpful. They never discouraged any questions i had when i was confused on a certain topic"
College Junior,4,My overall experience at Midland College is wonderful. The teachers are kind and try their best to work with the students. The environment is friendly and helpful.
College Sophomore,4,"It's a very good school, the teachers are willing to work with you to get you where you need to be."
College Junior,4,Very helpful with my current situation.
College Junior,4,Love the hands on part of my aviation major!
College Junior,4,Very helpful with me and my needs as a veteran.
College Sophomore,4,They care about the student. They are enthusiastic and not so filtered as opposed to high school.
College Sophomore,4,"It's very affordable and financial advisers are incredible. However, there are many hidden and forced fees for inferior products and services."
College Senior,4,They provide plenty of financial aid and the financial aid adviser has provided me with many scholarship opportunities.
College Senior,4,"The resources available here are impeccable, the academic adviser and counselor are always willing to help students pursue  a career with the tools learned here at Midland College."
College Senior,4,"At Midland College, for my current major here the classes are pretty easy, the workload is not bad at all, and coming to Midland College has educated me in regards to the opportunities there are outside of school."
College Senior,4,"The professors here are very educated at what they do, and they usually provide many resources in order to help their students succeed. Their doors are always open so the students can come in and talk to them if they need help, they also have study sessions which really helps our grade."
College Senior,4,"In the student center, there is a friendly, multicultural atmosphere filled with lovely students, great conversation, friendly staff, and not to mention the food is amazing!"
College Senior,4,Most students will help but then again i guess it depends on who you ask
Alum,2,"My online experience was awful. 2 out 4 of my online professors did not do very well. They were math classes and I was thinking I was going to get a lot more help than I did. But there were very few examples, and rarely anwsered their email. I had one professor tell me to google the information. I just think that if a professor is to teach an online class that they really need to help their students and try to teach. Not just throw us to the wolves. We pay lots of money for a good education and I donâ€™t think they succeeded."
Freshman,2,midland college is great. extremely overpriced and terrible professor choice. as an example ms. meredith martin has been the most uptight rude and condescending teacher i have ever had and i wouldn't recommend her class to anyone online or in class. she doesnt care about her students just that she does as little as possible so she can focus on things that are important to her which clearly isnt fostering relationships with her students. i will never take a class from her again.
Freshman,2,"I Paid full in scholarships. Went to classes I asked to be in another class but they told me it was full. The day they dropped people for no payment was the day they added me into the class .  And did not inform me. So my classes were dropped. Once I finally got into my classes again , I was behind. My professor didn't like to be seen on the screen, so when he did something on screen he forgot to show my class. once test came the whole class failed. Many dropped out. I applied my pell grant months before school. Everyday I asked for it. I had no money at home and couldn't pay for my books. So they told me to drop out and try again next semester. So I decided that I should. Once I did they told me my pell grant has been there for almost 3 months."
Sophomore,2,"My third time trying to meet with an advisor, I was finally told I would have to reapply. The girl told me that I needed to put that I was a transient student. I didn't know what that was, but I did what she said. Find out two weeks later that transient students can't receive Financial Aid, so I spent two more weeks trying to sort that out. Then I filled out a loan application that would cover the cost until my financial aid was received. I see that a drop date is nearing, so I call to ensure that I will not be dropped from my classes since my Financial Aid was still pending from the problems they caused in the first place. I was assured that I wouldn't, then dropped anyway. To top it off, since I have only lived in Midland for 5 months instead of 6, they have me listed as an out-of-district student, which has doubled my tuition. The professors have all been great, and it is a beautiful campus; but the staff needs to get it together."
College Sophomore,2,"People, faculty, and staff are great. Housing, dining hall, and the gym are awful. School is cost efficient however, many products and services are inferior."
College Sophomore,2,Not really any student career prospects. There is not a career center to the best of my knowledge.
College Sophomore,2,"On campus housing is terrible. The rooms are very small and windows do not open.  Dorm rules are VERY strict. You are forced to purchase a meal plan that is absolutely inferior. Quality of food in the dining hall is TERRIBLE and consists of mostly processed carbohydrates even though there is supposed to be two protein choices. Serving portions are VERY small. The dining hall staff are very rude. The dishes are not cleaned well at all. The Dining hall is closed for breakfast on weekends and throughout holidays. The rest of the time it is packed because early college high school students and senior citizens swarm it.  Gym hours are awful and is usually closed because ""athletes have gym priority"". The registrar's office refuses to get anything done in a timely manner and are extremely rude. Campus PD can be decent however, there are a few of them who creep around the dorm parking lots as well as interrogate and search students vehicles without cause. Faculty and staff are awesome with the small exception of a few. Definitely a glorified high school AT BEST."
Niche User,1,This college does not care about their students. All they want is your money. The dorms are a health hazard and should be torn down. It was absolutely awful.
College Senior,1,Their internet is really bad.  Most of the time when I need to do homework I am not allowed to access it because we have to go through some check with a company called geek squad to make sure there are no viruses on our laptops. It takes forever to do this then Finally we get yhe pass code to the internet. Once it ee get it doesn't work.. we are only allowed 20 pages to print at school which is ridiculous. Communication to teachers is impossible as well because either their school email has a virus or its just not working.

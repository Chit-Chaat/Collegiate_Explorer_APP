Alum,5,"Wofford is precisely what it advertises itself to be: a small school where everyone knows everyone and the students are encouraged to pursue anything they want to do as long as they are willing to use the resources at their disposal and put in the work. The professors are top notch: they care about the students' experiences, both inside the classroom and out. They are communicative, approachable, and available. The dorms are spacious and, compared to many others I have seen, clean. The grounds are immaculately landscaped. The food is thoughtfully prepared by kind food service employees who know the students by name. Interim is a good enough reason in and of itself to go - who wouldn't want the freedom to devote a month to studying golf or Jane Austen, visit a country with some friends, or create an independent study on basically anything? And the study abroad opportunity cannot be overlooked - it is the best possible way to be challenged, to learn, to fulfill potential. 10/10."
Alum,5,"I only briefly had online courses through Zoom because of COVID-19, but the professors handled it well for having never done it before."
Sophomore,5,"Wofford is a home away from home. You walk down the sidewalks and say hello/how are you to everyone in passing or at least send a smile their way. The sense of community is overwhelming. The professors get to know the students personally and make an effort to accommodate one's needs- something that is hard to find at a big, state school. Many renovations and additions have and are currently being made to improve the school's infrastructure."
Junior,5,"Wofford was the BEST choice for me and I am thrilled to be a student here. The atmosphere, student life and academics are like no other. I would not want to be anywhere else for my college experience."
Sophomore,5,"The small community of students are accepting to a variety of lifestyles and cultures. Anyone can find a group of people that like doing the same things as them whether it be fly-fishing, photography, Greek life, or dancing."
Alum,5,Really and truly one of the best colleges and values around. Great college atmosphere.. lots to do socially. Greek life is incredible for the size.  Everyone is included. If you want to be involved it isn’t difficult. I found there to be plenty of diversity. Classes are tough but you won’t even believe how prepared you are for working when you graduate. Completely worth the price tag. Actually it’s a bargain for all that you get
Alum,5,"Best little liberal arts college in the south. Beautiful campus, dedicated professors. My sorority was involved in local community service projects and gave me friendships that are still going strong after 35+ years."
Junior,5,"The Wofford College campus is beautiful.  The academics at Wofford College are superior with the small class size, professors that take the time to know their students both in and out of the classroom, and a large variety of majors to choose from.  Wofford is a safe campus and has worked hard to show its diversity in the students that go there as well as the staff working there.  The dorms are above average for a school their size and the food is good.  Student life"
Sophomore,5,"Wofford has a wonderful community of staff and students. I love the close-knit bonds that are created on the small campus. One of my favorite things is running into my friends on my short walk to class. You will rarely walk somewhere and not see someone you know. Everyone is always willing to help with academics or extracurriculars. There are so many opportunities to study abroad, whether it is during interim, the summer, or a semester."
Sophomore,5,"I love Wofford. I am a student-athlete, and my coaches know that school is the number one priority. I have met so many great, like-minded people, and it is definitely easy to find your place at Wofford and feel included."
Senior,5,"My overall experience at Wofford has been amazing. They truly prepare you for life after college, and are an amazing pre-medical school (along with pre-law and finance, among other areas). Wofford College has a strong alumni base that is useful when searching for jobs after college, or even finding internships during your time as a student."
Freshman,5,"Wofford is small and close knit. Knowing professors personally gives you lots of amazing opportunities, and the campus is cute and convenient."
Freshman,5,I love everything about Wofford. Classes are small and professors are the best. Everyone is so friendly and no one is ever bored here.
Sophomore,5,"I love the small feel of Wofford, and especially how all of your professors know your name. The professors and the college make it easy to succeed, while still challenging your learning abilities, and they want to help you."
College Freshman,5,"Wofford is a very special school. It is prestigious without bringing about an air of arrogance. Students are extremely intelligent, work hard, and do great things. I would choose this school over ANY of the ivy league options and I know many who have."
College Freshman,5,I have not yet graduated but I have heard that graduates go on to do wonderful things and I know that over 90% of students find employment or are in higher education within 6 months of graduation
College Freshman,5,"We have excellent officers here at Wofford and as well in the Spartanburg community. I know many Spartanburg officers personally and they are extremely qualified, extremely fair people and I have no doubt that they protect the community to the best degree"
College Freshman,5,"Marsh is the only residence hall that is not the best but it is still clean and bright. All residence halls are always clean, safe, and relatively quiet. the senior housing is AMAZING"
College Freshman,5,Greek life is big on campus but you are not ostracized if you choose to not participate
College Freshman,5,"profs and staff are always there to provide assistance, yet expect the performance and degree of high accountability that has become standard with the intelligent and enterprising students of the school"
College Sophomore,5,The course quality is excellent. Professors care about me as a person and want me to achieve my goals.
College Sophomore,5,I feel I will be able to get into a great graduate program and utilize the knowledge I learn at Wofford.
College Sophomore,5,I always feel safe on campus.
College Sophomore,5,For a small school we have excellent facilities.
College Sophomore,5,"I am so glad I chose Wofford College! The class sizes are perfect, the instructors are super helpful and patient. The course work is manageable and relevant. Wofford is a small school with large school resources."
College Junior,5,"Greek life at Wofford is definitely huge and can be a big part of deciding to go to school here. A large percentage of the student body is greek. While I highly recommend joining, wofford is sadly going through a transitional period that is tightening the reins of greek life. A new row (frat and sorority houses) has just been built and there is a power play going on between the greeks and administration as they hammer out the new rules and regulations of the houses. But overall really great experience, theres four sororities (KD, ZTA, Theta, and DDD). Each sorority is different but its pretty easy to tell which one makes you feel most at home. I think there are 7 fraternities... Also wofford just changed to spring rush"
College Junior,5,"Wofford is a great tight knit community. Its very easy to get to know or at least recognize everyone on campus. The school has a work hard/play hard environment. All the students are dedicated to academics in the week but know how to have a good time on the weekends or wednesday nights for the bars. Greek life is important at wofford, its currently in an awkward stage as the old fraternity houses were torn down and are just now being finished. There is currently a little bit of a power struggle between the administration and greek life students as new rules for the houses are trying to be put in place. But overall, great college, if I could go back I would still do it all the same."
College Sophomore,5,"Freshman year is tough if you are in Marsh, but the senior village is what every Wofford student looks forward to."
College Freshman,5,"I've loved all of my classes so far, apart from the freshman class FYI. My professors have been awesome, accomodating, and extremely helpful. I love interim! It's a great chance to try something new during January, as well as being a nice ease-in back to ""real"" classes."
College Freshman,5,"A degree from Wofford goes a long way, especially in the South; Wofford is a greatly respected school in the Southeast. The alumni network is extremely useful - so many opportunities for internships and jobs! The Space (career center) is helpful too. They're always willing to help students with anything from creating a resume to finding job opportunities after college."
College Freshman,5,"I live in Carlisle, which is a freshman and sophomore dorm. It is definitely the best option for freshman: suite-style with each of the two suite rooms having their own living room and an individual cube bedroom for each roommate. My hall is great socially as well. Senior housing at Wofford is amazing - apartment-style, on-campus housing in large, colorful, almost Charleston-style houses."
College Sophomore,5,"Wofford does a wonderful job at making students feel safe on campus. They have extremely accesible security officers on duty, safety lights, and video cameras everywhere."
College Sophomore,5,"The alumni here jump at the chance to help a Wofford Graduate, they feel a strong sense of responsibility in helping ""one of their own"" succeed. Wofford also does a great job of helping its students find job and internship opportunities."
College Sophomore,5,"With the exception of one freshman housing option, Marsh Hall, Wofford housing is amazing! All of the buildings have been either recently built or recently renovated! The village  (Senior Housing) is gorgeous! That is what everyone looks forward to!"
College Sophomore,5,"Wofford Greek Life is the best! Over 50% of the community is greek. No matter what sorority or fraternity you join, you are sure to find amazing people all around!"
College Sophomore,5,"I love Wofford College! It is so easy to become involved and make friends that last a lifetime! It really is a tight-knit community full of wonderful people! As soon as you step on the beautiful campus, it is clear that Wofford is a special place!"
College Junior,5,"The athletic facilities are clean and proficient. The team performance in sports, such as basketball and baseball, are improving astronomically. There is a lot of school spirit and many students go across the country to support Wofford sports."
College Freshman,5,"They require a lot from you as a student, but if you put in effort, it'll work out. Professors are able to get to know you more than they would at larger colleges/universities, and they will work with you."
College Sophomore,5,"Cribbs, Willy Taco, Taco Dog, Limeleaf, Wild Wings, Deli Korner, Monamie - all are great"
College Freshman,5,"The officers are very strict, but always polite and respectful! I think they are great considering what they have to go through everyday."
College Freshman,5,"The application process was somewhat stressful, but you have to take it one day at a time."
College Freshman,5,I love being in a sorority! It was a great way to meet some new people and form great lifetime friendships!
College Freshman,5,Everyone I talked to was very helpful and it went very smoothly.
College Junior,5,The professors are always there to help you out no matter how much of a stickler they are because they know how hard the course are and they do everything they can to help you.
College Junior,5,"To be in my major is definitely challenging and requires a lot of your time. Any major at Wofford it like that, but thats exactly the reason why I love it."
College Junior,5,I have had the most amazing two years meeting new people and learning so many new things.
College Junior,5,Campus is always a welcoming place and the professors and other faculty really help the students out in any way they can.
College Sophomore,5,Received a lot of financial aid
College Sophomore,5,It changed my life for the better!
College Freshman,5,"The professors here are top notch and take an interest in the students. In my department, the teachers really help the student rather than only focusing on the department and I always feel like I am working with a professor and not for one."
College Sophomore,5,Wofford is known for its prestige in academics. The graduate school acceptance is top notch. The professors really know what they are talking about and want the students to succeed.
College Senior,5,The psychology major has the best faculty and the most interesting faculty in my opinion. 
College Sophomore,5,"Wofford College has excellent academics.  Although classes are rigorous, I truly believe Wofford will help you excel in all areas of life after graduation. Because it is a Liberal Arts College, you make many connections across studies that would not otherwise be noted at larger colleges or universities.  Professors know each student by name in class, and are willing to invest time in and outside of class with them.  I'm highly impressed with the travel abroad program at Wofford, as well as the special Interim (January Term) experience that allows students to learn about things they otherwise would never be able to learn about.  I love Wofford and all that it has to offer!"
College Sophomore,5,"Computers are always there with people always willing to help you. Printing is free, well included in your tuition, so you don't really have to pay and in a sense have unlimited copies. You have the choice of wifi or ethernet. I prefer ethernet when I'm in my dorm."
College Sophomore,5,My financial aid process was the best ever. Everything was fast and smooth.
College Sophomore,5,"Having your own car at Wofford is fantastic, and easy. Parking is completely free, and convenient no matter where you are on campus. Local transportation isn't as easy, but as long as you or a friend has a car, it really is easy to get around."
College Junior,5,"The physics program at Wofford is tough, but the resources and help are there if it is needed.  The physics department is less lab-intensive, and more classroom intensive.  We have less labs than the other sciences at Wofford, but that is slowly changing as we get more labs for the classes.

The professors are always there and have very open office hours to be able to help with something you don't understand, and if you can't catch one of them, you can easily find a TA to help you.

The department also meets frequently with the students to discuss opportunities that may be coming up for the students to participate in."
College Junior,5,"The Row – On a non-dry weekend the fraternity row goes off. Many underage students do not drink, but if one is looking, it can be found. Transportation is not a problem, since all parties are within walking distance of the dorms. The fraternities love to have bands come and play at the frat houses and compete for the most people that come party in their houses."
College Junior,5,"Hey There Good Looking! Most of the students here are very attractive, boys and girls. The dress here is casual, to nice casual. Many students enjoy dressing up for class and football games. For boys the typical dress is a polo t-shirt, kaki shorts/pants, and either Sperry's or flip flops. For girls, nice shirt and shorts, or a dress, pearls, and nice shoes. Every one here is very nice and friendly, and it is not hard to find your dream woman or man."
College Junior,5,"Spartanburg is a small city with several colleges, for this reason we have quite a few restaurants (way more than average) and much diversity in the types of restaurants as well. There are many restaurants that also allow discounts to college students, specifically Wofford."
Junior,4,"Wofford has been a wonderful home away from home! I have entered into a community at Wofford that has embraced me and treated me like family. Many of the facutly and staff, students and all other employees will help you out any way they can, support you and encourage you to be your best in and out of the classroom. Wofford has given me so many experiences and opportunities that I doubt I would have found anywhere else. No college will ever be perfect, but Wofford is definitely up there."
Junior,4,"I am a current Junior at Wofford and I have loved my time here. The campus is beautiful and there are so many wonderful ways to enjoy your college experience be it study abroad, on campus job, athletics, greek life, or something entirely different. While college classes are difficult, Wofford pays for tutors and other resources to make their education accessible to all students."
Junior,4,The change to online was difficult at first because I lived in a different time zone than South Carolina but all my professors were really accommodating and did their best to be there and do whatever their students needed them to do.
Sophomore,4,"Wofford College is a great place to get an education. The small class sizes allow students to actually make connections with professors. Also, the professors at Wofford really do want their students to succeed. I have never had a teacher not want to help me. The atmosphere of the school is overall pretty positive and you can always find new friends where ever you go on campus. The close-knit community is something special Wofford has that many other colleges don't."
Sophomore,4,"Wofford is half online and half in person. Though confusing at first, I am now used to it and it is not so bad. The teachers are really understanding about internet problems."
Junior,4,"Wofford provides students with a supportive community and the tools needed to be prepared for entering the ""real world."" Small class sizes provide opportunities to create strong relationships with professors and classmates, as well as a greater sense of responsibility and dedication to academics. The sense of community is unmatched."
Junior,4,"Professors were flexible and understanding, and always made an attempt to make sure that students were still receiving the typical Wofford education through online!"
Sophomore,4,"Spring 2020 was my first spring in college, so while it was an adjustment to make, I only had the fall semester to compare it to. The professors went through the change with the students. They struggled with us, planned with us, and sympathized with us. Considering the circumstances, I think professors handled the change and altered their instruction methods to the best of their ability."
Junior,4,"Spring 2020 was like no other at all Colleges. Wofford was no different and with the COVID-19 pandemic, all classes were online for the 2nd half of the semester. This was a challenge, but through effort of the faculty, staff and students, we made online learning a success."
Niche User,4,I loved that the campus was not like in the middle of a city and that it had gates for the outside. I also like that freshman can park on campus unlike other colleges I have been looking at.
Alum,4,"Wofford was a great school academically. However, diversity lacked as well as poor housing for freshmen. I think Wofford would greatly benefit from making a more inclusive environment especially when it comes to diversity. Also, food could be a lot better looking at the cost of attendance."
Freshman,4,It felt like home as soon as I took a tour. The fact that its so small allows me to feel at home and prevents the feeling of being lost in the crowd.
Sophomore,4,"I love Wofford because it is a beautiful campus, everyone around is super friendly, and the class sizes are small and makes it easy to be well known by your professors."
Junior,4,"I greatly enjoy the small class sizes, the availability of professors outside of class, and the community of students."
Freshman,4,"Wofford College is a great school. We are a small school of about 1600 students so the relationships between students and staff are very real. We are a Division I school as well so our athletics are a big deal. We have tons of clubs, organizations, and Greek Life to get involved in. The administration can be overbearing at times and the tuition is very steep, but all in all it is a great school."
Alum,4,"Wofford College is a great academic institution, the class size is small,  taught by faculty members who are cutting edge in their fields. Because it is so small, it can get boring. You see the same people all the time, but it also brings people closer together."
College Freshman,4,"One of the reasons I chose Wofford was the class sizes. Typically there are no more than 20 in a class, and sometimes much less! That is a big bonus for me. I also love the Interim term they have every January where they encourage you to step out of your box and take 4 credit hours that can be completely unrelated to your major.... just any off the wall, interesting, exciting, adventurous, artsy, crazy thing that strikes your fancy, to broaden your horizons or just fulfill some deep rooted fantasy or try something you never thought possible..... through school."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't gotten to the point where I am looking for jobs for post college, but a big draw to Wofford for me was the way they help you find internships, and later jobs. Not just jobs, though, careers that were meant for you, individually. They also seem to be excellent at helping you further your educational career if you plan to go on to grad school or beyond, which is a big consideration for me."
College Freshman,4,"I know there are many policies in place for safety. I personally have never felt unsafe on campus, however, I haven't been here long. I have no problem calling campus security for an escort if I can't find a friend to walk with at night and I don't take stupid chances."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life is pretty big on campus, with about 50% student involvement. There doesn't seem to be any weird separation between Greeks and non-Greeks though, everyone just melds smoothly in that aspect. The Greeks seem to do a lot of great community service projects which seem to make them seem more down to earth than snotty."
College Freshman,4,"We have an excellent football and basketball team, as well as many other male and female sports. They recently added girls Lacrosse. Our facilities are top notch and are they are currently adding a new indoor football training facility. The Carolina Panthers even use our campus for their training camps!"
College Freshman,4,very safe and students are smart enough to know how drugs effect their progress and lives
College Freshman,4,sporting events are fun and highly attended!!! yet the emphasis obviously goes to the academics and arts
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy the atmosphere of the Wofford Community. Everyone here is dedicated in what they want to do and all want the same goal, to be successful. I would chose Wofford over and over again because of the diversity and small but big community that it holds."
College Sophomore,4,I would rate it 5/5 if administration wasn't trying to mold greek life into what they believe it should be like.  In the past year it seems that they have put all focus into suppressing greek life's presence on campus.  Regulations that have been/are in the process of being enforced are solely aimed at greek life.
College Freshman,4,Almost everyone live on campus for 4 years and enjoy it. You get bigger and nicer room for each year
College Freshman,4,"I am not a part of it here, but most people are and it seems like they enjoy it"
College Freshman,4,"Its been really good. The teachers are very helpful and there are many opportunities for help, if you need it. So far, I have enjoyed all of my classes"
College Freshman,4,Campo is the best. I know I can always count on them
College Freshman,4,Wofford is very connected with the community and offers many great opportunities for students.
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy being a student at Wofford College. Although the course work is quite difficult, I feel that I have learned so much."
College Sophomore,4,I have never really felt unsafe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,I've had great professors and that's overshadowed the things I don't like about the school
College Sophomore,4,The Space is very good at connecting with you with who you need to speak to in order to get ahead after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,"We have above average housing. The worst housing is freshmen housing, but even that is better than most housing at other schools."
College Sophomore,4,I have really enjoyed this school. This is mostly due to the psychology department being very research oriented and willing to bring in students often. They do a very good job at making sure you have a strong scientific background.
College Freshman,4,You do not have to lock your doors in your dorms. Myself and my belongings are safe. The one thing I would improve is more lighting at night on campus.
College Freshman,4,Large variety of courses. Courses are challenging. Small class sizes are great!
College Freshman,4,Wofford has a strong and supportive alumni network.
College Freshman,4,"At my school we live on campus for all 4 years. The freshman dorm Iive in is not good. It is old, moldy, and awkwardly spaced. The other freshman dorm has been completely updated and is nice. The upperclassmen live in apartment style housing that is also very nice."
College Freshman,4,My school feels like a community. The education is tops. The faculty and staff are approachable. The students are friendly.
College Freshman,4,"I feel extremely safe on Wofford's campus. Trust is high here at Wofford - I know I can leave my belongings in the library for over an hour and nobody will touch them. If I lose something, I know somebody will turn it in to lost and found. Campus safety is always accessible and students can even call to request a ride back to their dorm if they feel unsafe walking across campus for any reason."
College Freshman,4,"Greek life may seem overwhelming at first, but with such a small campus, it's impossible for Greek organizations to be exclusive. Functions and formals are obviously limited to Greek members and their dates, but that's about it. When the new Row is built, all students will be welcome to attend parties, as long as they're on an approved list (for safety reasons). Greek life brings a lot of energy to campus at Wofford."
College Freshman,4,"I'm not yet in love with Wofford because I'm still settling into college life, but I have enjoyed my time here so far. Students are friendly, professors are knowledgable and helpful, and staff are eager to see students succeed. I really like the small size of Wofford - it's certainly easier to make friends and connections with only 1600-1700 students than at a large public school. My only complaints are the food services (which have improved in the two weeks we've been back at school this semester) and the lack of a Greek Row. The new row is in progress but the lack of one causes issues with social activities, especially for parties that involve drinking. The construction can also be irritating - several new buildings and facilites are being built so I ocassionally wake up to construction outside."
College Senior,4,"football is life here. baseball is second then tennis, track. sports are well attended"
College Senior,4,"good overall experience. good approachable professors. no TAs. good housing. good student life, lots of clichés. legacy students stay to themselves."
College Sophomore,4,Football and basketball are really important to Wofford. We are Division 1 and our basketball program wins the Southern Conference championship almost every year. The basketball team has also been invited to the NCAA March Madness Tournament for the past 13 years.
College Freshman,4,"As a member of the greek life community, I have no complaints. 51% of Wofford students are involved in Greek life. All of the greeks and non greeks are friends and get along fairly well. People from different greek organizations get along well, too."
College Freshman,4,"I throughly enjoy my school. Wofford College is a prestigious school. The professors are extremely knowledgable and very personable. They genuinely want to help each student learn and succeed. The small class sizes help in this. Not only is it incredible academically, but also student activities are top notch. I am extremely happy with my decision to attend Wofford College."
College Freshman,4,"The community and environment are very nice.  I wish there were more people that attended but the name ""Wofford"" carries a lot of weight for graduate school."
College Sophomore,4,Wofford is my happy place. I love walking to class everyday and the teachers are awesome and always willing to help.
College Junior,4,"The guys are very nice. A portion of them can be very snobbish, but mostly the guys are friendly and willing to help if you ask. They are very well-mannered and have that ""Southern Gentleman"" style."
College Junior,4,"The cost of off campus housing is relatively low. Landlords are nice and willing to solve situations. However, some of the nice apartments are further away from campus. The nice apartments are not in walking distance, so a car would be essential. The areas are relatively safe and high quality."
College Junior,4,"The best parties are at the Row. However, it will be relocated since the new arts center is being built in that location."
College Junior,4,"The campus is strict on violations such as drug violations and underage drinking. Also, violations in the honor code are not tolerated and are easily punished by the student judicial commission."
College Junior,4,"It is a nice and quiet environment. The housing process usually goes quickly and efficiently. Some of the dorms need to be renovated, however most dorms are very nice. The cost for housing is relatively cheap. The social atmosphere is excellent with everyone willing to help each other. Students contribute to help freshmen move in to their dorms, and ensure they are transitioning well into the new atmosphere."
College Freshman,4,"Being a chemistry major means a lot of time in the lab. There is a study room specifically for chemistry majors. You get a cubby in the room. The professors are advisors for specific career paths (i.e. pre-med, pre-dentistry, etc.) There is also a lunch once a month for all chemistry majors and professors to get together."
College Freshman,4,They spend a lot of time on the landscape
College Freshman,4,"At first I was hesitant about Wofford, but I have grown to love it!"
College Freshman,4,"I love the small school atmosphere. The academics are rigorous, but the professors really care about you, and they will take the time to help you. There are small class sizes, so you have a better relationship with the professor. I'm not crazy about the liberal arts curriculum, but it allows students to explore different areas of study. The interim courses are a great opportunity to go beyond the typical major classes."
College Freshman,2,"Living on campus is a double edged sword. Of course I wanted to live in a dorm an experience ""real college life"" at least my first year. The dorms at Wofford are horrendous, Especially Marsh. Luckily I got into Greene which was renovated last year, if you want to call it that. I'm afraid with my allergies, I would literally have died in Marsh! For the price of tuition/room/board at Wofford, I can see NO REASON that their dorms are in the shape they are I! I understand wanting to keep the original exterior look of the buildings, to keep the traditional feel campus in tact, but the interior of those dorms should have long since been gutted and been redone!"
College Junior,2,"It is difficult to obtain the financial aid you need. Wofford College does not ensure that their students are able to pay for their tuition to return for another year. Tuition increases every year by a large percentage, while the merit scholarships provided by the college remains the same amount. I am attempting to save enough money to be able to graduate."
College Senior,2,"I think times are changing, but when I rushed the selection was very picky and people were dropped for no reason. I do not care for Sororities at Wofford College."
College Sophomore,2,Lots of racism towards minorities
College Sophomore,2,"The campus is so small that there is no need for campus shuttles, but taxis are always available to call."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is big. It dominates. And if you're someone who is not into it, dealing with the annoyances of Greeks will be a constant struggle."
College Junior,2,"""A"" for Campus Safety, ""F"" to Health Services... Campus Safety does a great job of keeping its students safe and also develop personal relationships with many of the students, which further strengthens the motivation to protect us. However, if you are sick, you will probably not be excused from class because Health Services ONLY gives excuses if you have a fever of over 100 on the examination table. You can puke on the NURSE (not even a Doctor) and because you do not have a fever, you will not be excused. They will, however, write you antibiotics prescription for anything and everything, which is also bad because nurses should not be diagnosing and prescribing like doctors."
College Freshman,2,In order to receive any real scholarships from Wofford that isn't a loan you have to have pretty much perfect grades and SAT/ACT scores.
College Freshman,2,"I have lived here basically all of my life, it is not easy to find nice off campus housing at a good price."
College Sophomore,2,"Getting into the Chinese Major was really easy, all I did was fill out one form and have it signed by my advisor and the head of the Chinese department."
College Sophomore,2,Box of Chocolates – The main dining hall is for the most part not too great and daily bathroom breaks are needed. But it does surprise us sometimes with great meals. The secondary dining hall is always sufficient and always has something for everyone.
College Sophomore,2,"Not Too Many ""Me's&quot – Wofford College is primarily a white school, which I have no problem with seeing as how I'm a military dependent. It does cause a weird interaction of blacks coagulating together almost unconsciously. Everyone on campus though regardless of background finds ways to interact almost seamlessly."
College Freshman,2,"The Apartments Are King – The Senior Aprtments where all Seniors live, excluding a few unlucky ones, are fantastic. However, anything below senior housing is mold-infested, built with shoddy workmanship, and plagued by poor air-handling systems.  the Apartments are veritable tinder boxes, estimated to be utterly consumed by flames in a mere ten minutes should a fire break out."
College Freshman,2,"The one dining hall ""Burwell"" is hit or miss.  Zach's in the student life center offers a decent variety including: Chick-fil-a, sushi, hummus, a variety of sandwiches, and pretty good cheeseburgers and fries."
Sophomore,1,Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful. Awful.
College Sophomore,1,There are never parking spots available. You have to leave early during the day and come back early otherwise you'll never get a spot. Even then sometimes you still can't find one.
College Sophomore,1,They promote like they are diverse but give minorities a hard time.
College Sophomore,1,Getting into Spanish was horrible. I had to make numerous appointments.
College Freshman,1,I have Celiac disease and there are few options or me
College Freshman,1,"So many students can't find spots. Especially in the freshman dorms, people park other cars in just because the situation is so bad. Definitely the worst part of the experience."
College Sophomore,1,"If you are actually interested in a normal college experience, do not come to Wofford. Wofford students are all the same, fake and rich. If you want to meet different kinds of people and experience new things this is not the place for you. Even though college is supposed to be a time to discover yourself, people are more interested in trying to impress one another and hiding who they truly are. "
College Sophomore,1,"Cell Sized School – Wofford College is so small that news travels fast. This can be a problem for those who want to have secrets or for those who don't care to hear all the noise of the social scene constantly. Either way, it does get annoying to always be immersed in others business."
College Sophomore,1,"Most people here are the same type of person. White, come from well off families, like to drink on the weekends, southern, and preppy. Most are nice enough, but not a lot of diversity at all!"
College Freshman,1,"Don't Walk of Campus.. Not Even Across the Street. Wofford is in the worst parts of town, surrounded by areas with shockingly high crime rates; however, the drive to the sanctity of downtown is short."
College Freshman,1,"Where Can I Find It? If you don't own a car or can't rely on a friend to drive you somewhere, you are hard pressed to find transportation.  There are a few taxi sevrices, but there is virtually no public transportation."
College Freshman,1,Wofford College consists mostly of white middle to upper class students with a few students of other ethnicities sprinkled in.

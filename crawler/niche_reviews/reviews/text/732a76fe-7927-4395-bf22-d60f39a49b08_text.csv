Alum,5,I loved my time at Clarkson! Every school has its fault but Clarkson was always great about getting students involved and listening to their feedback on issues. The Shipley Center for Innovation helped me start my own business and I couldn't have done it without Clarkson's help and resources.
Sophomore,5,"I have just completed my first year at Clarkson University, and it was one of the most memorable years of my life. I know I wanted to attend a college in upstate New York, but I did not anticipate this far upstate. But, I am an Environmental Engineer, and Clarkson is well-known for having a good Environmental Engineering Program. Clarkson also gave me the opportunity to attend the ADK Semester this fall at Paul Smith's College! With COVID-19, I miss my college friends greatly and I miss attending class in person. Clarkson, I hope to see you soon!"
Senior,5,"I really enjoyed the academic environment at Clarkson University. As a senior, I can gladly say that everyone is here to help you and you are not competing against one another in your courses. The staff/ professors are helpful and want you to succeed! There are plenty of opportunities to step out of your comfort zone and meet new people whether it’s joining a club, joining a SPEED team, doing research with a professor, studying abroad, or attending the fun on-campus activities. Clarkson University enables their students to push themselves to grow. It is challenging yet undoubtedly rewarding!"
Senior,5,I liked that it is a close knit community with plenty of oppurtunities in regards to the workforce as well as extracurriculars.
Freshman,5,"What I enjoy most about Clarkson are the people. The professors are always willingly to stay late, or come in early to align with your schedule and to assist you in reaching your academic goals. The courses are challenging and involved, and always include lab experiments and real-life projects."
Alum,5,"It's a small campus in a small town, but I loved this aspect. I got to know people in my program and other programs very well through classes and extracurricular activities. Smaller class sizes also allows students to develop strong connections to professors which helped me immensely when trying to determine small things like classes to take to bigger issues like post-graduation plans. For a small school, a lot of different clubs and entertainment activities were offered, and the close proximity to the Adirondacks ensured there were never any dull moments."
Alum,5,Loved it. It may be a small town but the professors care about your education and your future which I find is very rare. The people are amazing too
Sophomore,5,I love the community at Clarkson. The whole college feels like a family. It’s always so welcoming and warm to new students and current students. Clarkson also has an amazing career center which allowed for its really high job placement percentage.
Sophomore,5,"Clarkson has so many clubs and organizations that utilize the outdoors. If you join the ski club, you have access to free ski and boot rentals, and you can purchase ski passes from nearby ski mountains at a discounted price."
Sophomore,5,Clarkson is a challenging university but offers so many resources and clubs for students to enjoy their time in school. The only downside is the cold winter but that isn't really their fault.
Graduate Student,5,"I love that Clarkson University has great research facilities, competent and well experienced faculty who care about the students' well-being and are willing to help them fulfill their goals."
Graduate Student,5,"Clarkson is a relatively small University, but as a result it is a close-knit community. The majority of the faculty and students here are friendly and helpful, truly wanting to see you succeed. Students are encouraged to help each other and work together as if they were in the real world. Clarkson does a very good job preparing its students for life after attending the university."
Graduate Student,5,"I’m a 3rd year PhD international student; I have been amazed how the community is friendly both on & off-campus. My research adviser is a member of the $ million club, and not only able to get good funding, but also available, competitive, ambitious, and inspiring. Travelling to conferences is very often, so far I have participated in 10 of off-campus ones. Both RA &TA stipend are enough to cover expenses. From my personal experience, Clarkson atmosphere is very supportive. You bring your ideas (academic or even social) and for sure you will find someone to support (President, Faculty, and Administrative staff) e.g IGNITE. Transportation is challenging, but once you get a car it’s perfect. Interestingly, you can drive to a different country and enjoy the city life e.g Ottawa. Outdoor activities are great in summer e.g canoeing. I would recommend building a lot of connections, engaging with fellows and getting involved in GSA and D&I. Hope to have memorable times here."
Alum,5,"I went to Clarkson for its top tier academics with incredible job placement services. I graduated May 2019 and had a job lined up upon graduation in November 2018. Everything that the school does is to help you prepare for the future. The community at the school was like a family, filled with friendly, outgoing people. The investment in a degree from Clarkson University will be returned tenfold. Best decision I could have made."
Junior,5,"Clarkson University has an aptitude for the education of students. An aspect that allows Clarkson this aptitude is the student to teacher ratio. In most classes (disregarding core classes i.e. Physics and Chemistry), there are around 20-60 students to 1 teacher. I've found this ratio to be a tremendous advantage in the growth of my knowledge. 
Furthermore, there are numerous clubs and Greek organizations on campus with many opportunities to develop technical skills, soft skills and be a resume builder. 
I've taken an active role in clubs and a Greek organization on campus which has allowed me to grow immensely as an individual. Clarkson fosters all of these experiences and offers a decent bang for the buck. Especially, with having a 97% job placement on graduation. 
One downside is the food, at first, it seems good. After 2 years, the food provided by Aramark gets repetitive and doesn't seem that good."
Junior,5,"Great school for business and engineering, and mixing the two up. A huge innovation, and research school. Tons of amazing professors around campus, and you have a really high chance of graduating with a job which makes it great for the return on investment."
Freshman,5,I like the academic integrity in Clarkson University. The outreach to companies and sponsors is excellent. I would like to see a more diverse campus.
Junior,5,"I like Clarkson University because it is a private, small and valuable college. For there, I can join the Asian Club, which organizes the Asian students together and has fun with some events. I like sports here, I go to watch the super bowl as long as there is a competition event. However, I do not like the food, because the food is too sample and bad. All the students are kind and smart, and we are proud to be a student in Clarkson."
Sophomore,5,"The academics are rigorous. There is a myriad of opportunities for professional development through internships, research, and professional clubs. The professors really try to make themselves available and understandable to the students."
Sophomore,5,"The level of academics is about what I was expecting, but I was pleasantly surprised by the wide variety of extracurricular clubs available, especially those related to engineering. I personally joined the Clarkson Formula SAE team and had a blast while also gaining great, hands-on engineering experience that I can apply to my future career field. 

If I had to choose one thing to improve it would be the dated buildings/dorms. They’re perfectly functional, but that’s about it. I’d love to see a more beautiful and academically flexible campus rather than the stark, strictly functional one we have now."
Freshman,5,"If you are interested in studying engineering or business, and you like skiing, snowboarding, and being outdoors, Clarkson is a great option for you!"
Sophomore,5,"Clarkson is a great school not only if your into engineering but also business and pre-med. The student body is more friendly and open then any other school I have visited. You are guaranteed to find lifelong friends. The academics are not easy but there are resources to help you succeed. The cold winters are also tough but there is still plenty to do especially if you like winter sports. You will not regret choosing Clarkson as your college and with an 90 something freshmen retention rate, many people feel the same way."
Niche User,5,"Best STEM university! Clarkson is a wonderful university with excellent academics, they set you up for success and are guaranteed a job usually before you even graduate. They could have better food and a more diverse population of students."
Freshman,5,"I love how connected Clarkson University is with all of its alumni. I also love how Clarkson has really good connections with companies and such a high job acceptance rate, the faculty cares about the students. I do wish that students cared more to make changes on campus, however."
Freshman,5,"I love Clarkson!! It is such a unique place because so many students are presented with research opportunities, so rare for undergraduates to find. You get real, hands-on experience as early as freshman year. The early college program they offer is also an amazing thing, as it gives younger students a chance to get a head start on their higher education."
Alum,5,"Clarkson University is an outstanding school for Engineering, Science, Business, and the Humanities/Social Sciences. They consider themselves an A+ school for B+ students or a mini-MIT. In other words, you will get a great education at a private and highly accredited institution for less money then you would pay at an Ivy league school. Nestled in Northern New York State Clarkson has a simply beautiful campus and surrounded by a very safe and supportive community. The professors genuinely care about their students and you are an individual at Clarkson, not a number. Highly recommended."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed being a member of a sorority on campus. I was involved in a SPEED team while on campus that one regionally and went on to compete nationally. As a recent alum, I enjoy coming back to visit and staying connected to the campus. The alumni community is a great resource both while a student as well as post grad. I picked Clarkson because of the family atmosphere and I couldn't be happier to have attended school here."
Alum,5,I spent the best 4 years of my life at Clarkson. The campus is full of wonderful people who are genuinely concerned about student success and well-being. The academic rigor is top notch and every student graduates fully prepared for a demanding career. I cannot recommend Clarkson enough and I credit my time and connections with the institution to much of the success I have achieved since graduating.
Freshman,5,I like how I go here for free  because of ROTC. I would recommend finding a way to make college cheaper since it is so expensive. The people here are really nice and so are the teachers and advisers. I like how easy it is to contact people when you need help also.
Junior,5,"Clarkson is by far the best. The best professors, learning environment, life outside of the classroom, and activities than any other college i went to. Clarkson makes me feel at home and couldn't make me happier."
Freshman,5,"I love Clarkson and all the opportunities that it offers students. Traveling is very important for me, so the wide variety of places to go with service clubs and study aboard are great. Also, their career fair is the best."
Freshman,5,"As a first year student, I quickly started feeling that I want to continue to finish my university journey there. Also, most professors are nice and ready to help and a lot of research opportunities."
Senior,5,"Clarkson is a great school but it's not for everyone. It is extremely challenging but I have never had a professor that was not willing to help you. My last 2 years at school all of my professors knew my name. My professor also cared deeply about my education and many of them helped me find internships, CO-OPs, and Full-Time jobs. The biggest selling point of Clarkson is the community, everybody helps everyone. This has proven to be successful based on job placement rates and success of alumni."
Sophomore,5,"Academically and Socially, Clarkson is a great school. It is located in a small town with three other colleges close nearby. Food options are not the best (try to get in a fraternity house, townhouse, or Woodstock so you can cook for yourself). Facilities employees tend to be lazy and don't complete work orders on time (it has been seven weeks since we put in a work order to fix our house's washing machine). But that is only minor details, as I still love attending this school."
Freshman,5,"Small school, cute campus, friendly staff, ease you into college life well, help you with your career path early on, comfortable, safe, fairly close to town, greater variety of food than was expected"
Freshman,5,"My experience at Clarkson is much better than I could've imagined. The small campus size and little amount of stuff to do for fun around campus make it seem like the school is not as competitive as a choice as others, however Clarkson excels at so many things. The teachers for all freshman classes show a huge amount of care and passion for their teaching subjects and everything is set up for you to learn and pass. From what I've seen, these professors are some of the best in helping their students. Outside of professors, the resources here are very easy to get your hands on and if you're in the mindset of setting yourself up for a successful and hardworking career, then Clarkson will not slow you down. If you're dead set on mechanical engineering, you're looking in the right place. The speed teams and shop equipment can prepare you for the industry you have in mind from the beginning of freshman year, which is the difference Clarkson has from other schools."
Senior,5,"The community at Clarkson is one of my favorite things at this school. All the students are more than willing to help you out, and there's an overall sense of collaboration both in and out of the classroom. Despite being in a small town, Clarkson offers so many clubs and activities that there's always something to do."
Freshman,5,"It's a great school located in a nice small scenic town! The professors are excellent and are always ready to help if you need it, I would recommend it to anyone!"
Freshman,5,The experience had been great. It’s a great school with greats teachers and students. There are lots of things to do around campus and lots of resources to help you be successful.
Freshman,5,Not much to do on campus or around the town. Student activities have limited hours. Not much to do on campus or around the town. Student activities have limited hours.
Freshman,5,"Clarkson is a good school with a good history and educational standing. it has a lot of history. The staff is very friendly, and most of the student body is also."
Senior,5,"I really like the academics and the ratio of professors and students. It makes it a lot easier to approach professors and get help and the teachers try to get to know as many students as possible. I am also a huge fan of the Outing Club there and everything they have to offer. Other than Aramark, usually every staff/faculty member and office tries to get to know the students and accommodate the needs and even the wants of the students."
Freshman,5,"I adore the school. It's a small campus but it's very pretty. The people are quite friendly and downtown Potsdam is very nice. Academics are tough, but they have to be in order to keep the competitive environment alive."
Freshman,5,"Something I loved about Clarkson is what a tight knit community it is. Figures being small and all but it is also one heck of a friendly community. That's something I really liked and ultimately drove me to choose Clarkson. There is also so much things to do in Clarkson as well. I always receive emails of new things to do whether it be for entertainment, sports, academic purposes etc."
Freshman,5,"I'm still in my first semester here at Clarkson and I have to say that I'm glad I choose this school. Senior year in high school filled me with doubts about being able to live on my own, if I could succeed in college or even make any friends. I can easily say I'm glad I took that leap and committed to Clarkson! I'm learning, living, and mingling like never before which is new for me. I used to be very shy but Clarkson has brought me out of my shell. Clarkson has probably been the best thing that could happen to me personally."
Sophomore,5,"Clarkson is primarily an academic school.  The professors, classes, and salary boost you get from attending Clarkson are excellent.  However, food and housing could certainly be better; although the university has been improving in these fields.  The party scene is OK; and can be improved by making a few contacts with people attending nearby SLU or SUNY Potsdam.  Local area is relatively boring by itself, but it's only about an hour to Lake Placid and the Adirondack high peaks."
Freshman,5,"I love this university, and the friends have made at it.  The academics; although, challenging, are engaging and fun.  The dorms are always a lively place, there is always something going on that can interest anyone.  I am more than happy to consider this my home, although the food sucks."
Freshman,5,I definitely would visit the college and get a tour from one of the amazing tour guides we have on campus to get the full feel of Clarkson itself. The best thing about my experience of Clarkson is that everyone here wants to be your friend or wants to include everyone in the activies going on campus. People at Clarkson want to see you succeed! Hence why the job success rate is through the roof ! The skills you learn at Clarkson will help you through your next chapter in life whatever or wherever you want to be. Remember Clarkson is basically ivy.
Freshman,5,I like the student organizations and that there are tons of fun things to do such as open skate. Hockey games are fun to go to as well because the student section and the pep band makes the games much more fun.
Freshman,5,I love the environment and how helpful the staff is. Clarkson provides a lot of on campus activities that help introduce students to new opportunities.
Sophomore,5,"If you’re looking for a college experience which fosters a cohesive student body where a familiar face is never too far away, Clarkson is definitely the college for you. As a political science major, even I can attest to the climate of personal responsibility and the value placed on hard work by the professors at this university, despite my department being considerably smaller than the engineering and business schools. Despite any differences in expertise the students at Clarkson might have, all are motivated by the thought that they will be able to improve the lives of those in the world around them."
Freshman,5,Everyone at Clarkson University is always willing to help which creates a welcoming atmosphere. The academics and professors prepare you for life outside of college. Also the athetics and wide varaty of clubs insure everyone can find something to do outside of classes.
Freshman,5,I love it here! Everyone here is so welcoming and willing to help because they want to see you succeed.
Freshman,5,"Once you get past the entry level classes, Clarkson is a great school. Those looking to pursue engineering paths fit in great here."
Freshman,5,Everyone in the community is kind and welcoming. My first couple weeks when not knowing where to go anyone will help. The various clubs help you get used to life away from home.
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love my school. It’s a great area to be and the people are amazing. Don’t get me wrong, this place is tough. But it’s called Harvard on the Hill for a reason. You have to work for your grades but it’s worth it because you’ll be graduating from Clarkson. Best decision of my life."
Freshman,5,"Clarkson is an awesome school. It’s relatively small, but I find that better because you get to know everyone, including the faculty, very well. The campus is really easy to navigate and everything is in pretty close walking distance. Classes are a little more on the difficult side, but it’s definitely worth it in the end."
Sophomore,5,"The community type feeling is amazing. There is not one moment that I have been on this campus and felt alone, Clarkson values teamwork and since day 1 I have always felt as a part of their team."
Freshman,5,Clarkson University has been amazing so far! I have been able to create many enjoyable memories and I have been able to take advantage of many opportunities that I wouldn't have found anywhere else.
Sophomore,5,"If you want to do anything in the STEM field, Clarkson can make it happen. Getting involved in clubs and activities isn't a burden and is fun and professors have generous office hours, if you need help you need only ask"
Sophomore,4,I am currently online for the fall semester of 2020 because of corona and I like the structure of being able to attend my classes at a normal time it helps hold me accountable. The professors  do their best to make sure everything is available online for assignments and projects so everyone can contribute on it and earn credit in the class. The only issue I have is it feels like there is a lot more assignments and expectations of students having more available  time. When every class is doing this there is constantly a pile of work and more and more gets assigned and it’s pretty stressful. Especially since the semester is shorter than a normal fall semester. There’s a lot less time to complete work and stuff for exams that come up very quickly.
Sophomore,4,"I had a really great first experience at Clarkson. The freshman are all housed in 4 forms all connected by a common space to study, the laundry room and a dining hall. The location was a little down hill away from the academic buildings but the walk was nice for the most part except during a middle of a snow storm then it’s just cold. The dorms for freshman are nice. There’s lots of space to hold all of your stuff and you can lift your bed to put your desk underneath or just to have it up enough to house a fridge or more storage. The people there are very friendly and if you get lost you can easily find someone to point you in the right direction. The gym is nice but kinda small but they just made a brand new gym that’s multiple floors and has everything you would need. The school also has an indoor track for running in the winter and open swim pool hours as well. There a handful of places to grab food in the academic buildings making it easy to grab food while heading to class."
Sophomore,4,It's odd how housing is required on campus for all 4 years but the academics are amazing. The food in some of the dinning halls is questionable but overall it's not terrible. The clubs and activities are amazing and very diverse.
Graduate Student,4,There is an online system called Moodle. All the home works and even some of the classes are uploaded and can be accessed later.
Junior,4,"Clarkson is known for it's excellent engineering school, which prepares students for real-world jobs or other post-graduate opportunities. The professor to student ratio is very good, professors give students lots of individual attention. At Clarkson there are many extracurricular opportunities to become involved with. Clarkson is a very diverse and inclusive college. Also, there is the opportunity to support Clarkson's NCAA division 1 hockey teams."
Freshman,4,"Great school for high-level education. The best ""bang for the buck"" in terms of getting a job right out of college. Also easy to find a good time with a very active student community."
Junior,4,"Clarkson University is a great university for students from all backgrounds. The courses are very challenging but also rewarding. The ability for students to gain access to the professional world is outstanding. With a very high job placement rate post graduation, Clarkson is not only a University to earn a degree, it's an investment for the rest of your life, and a good one at that."
Freshman,4,Clarkson University has always been a college that I wanted to attend. I went to all three years of Horizons III and I still love being here
Freshman,4,Clarkson is a wonderful University. I have found all the professors helpful and the strive to help you the best they can. This school has many wonderful resources to help the students. There is a sense of community in the school and has a wonderful atmosphere.
Senior,4,"Clarkson University is a great community with outstanding academics, wonderful peers, and an overall amazing college experience."
Senior,4,"Clarkson prides itself on being rigorous. As such, the work load can be intimidating at times. But once you learn good time management skills everything becomes easier. All in all, don't expect things to be easy; no matter what major you attend Clarkson for, you will be ready for what life can throw at you."
Junior,4,I loved the culture here but I would like there to be more opportunities for involvement. There is also a lot of room for improvement in the housing areas and in the athletics facilities. It WOUKD ge great of we could have more activities going on on campus.
Junior,4,"I love Clarkson's small community feel. You walk class to class, seeing plenty of familiar faces and everyone is happy to help with anything you need. The teachers are committed and there are plenty of academic support systems if you find yourself struggling. Overall I love the school, however I believe their housing and food could be upgraded."
Sophomore,4,"Clarkson offers a diverse way of approaching each subject that meet the criteria of Ivy League schools such as Dartmouth. The staff if extremely knowledgeable and able to help in almost every scenario. The winters are brutal, sometimes reaching a shivering -48°F. The food is less than appetizing but that is the popular opinion and Clarkson understood this problem and signed contracts with a new food provider showing that they are listening to student outreach and are allocating funds efficiently and humbly. I feel as though Clarkson offers severe readiness as far as employment and academics. The architecture has flaws but changes are also steadily happening to improve the quality of the campus as well."
Sophomore,4,I loved my first year at Clarkson University. The professors were great and were always there to support you through the way. The small campus gives you a very home like feel that is unmatched.
Graduate Student,4,"The best thing about Clarkson in my opinion is the academic atmosphere.  Everyone is there to help others as well as themselves to learn and to succeed.  Some colleges (especially larger universities) seem to care less about their students' success,  the mentality being that there are so many students going through only some of them need success stories, but Clarkson is determined to make every student a success story.  This is more common in small liberal arts colleges but for a very engineering and science driven university this seems uncommon."
Graduate Student,4,I recently join Clarkson as a graduate student and found it excellent choice for my Ph.D studies. the environment here is highly professional and one can have alot of opportunities to grow up in their field of studies.
Senior,4,"Clarkson is located in a beautiful, safe little town.  The athletic program is great and my overall experience has been positive."
Sophomore,4,The small class are both positives and negatives for me personally. If you understand a topic fairly well and have to listen to every classmate ask their questions it can become quite tedious and consume a lot of unnecessary time. On the other hand it is nice to be able to be part of such a small community and make great connections.
Sophomore,4,"If you can handle the workload and the freezing cold, Clarkson is definitely a good place to study, especially for the price and when compared to schools such as RPI or WPI it’s a deal. The campus is not very beautiful but it’s functional. If you like to watch D1 hockey and study engineering I cannot think of a better school."
Junior,4,"I’d like Clarkson to invest more in the diversity and inclusion initiative. Other than that, Clarkson provides a great academic foundation for students to go off into the world with."
Junior,4,"I've had a great experience with Clarkson so far, but I probably speak for the majority of the people here when I say that the food needs to change. The food being served now isn't the greatest. Other than that, I think Clarkson is a great school to attend."
Senior,4,"I really liked the atmosphere at Clarkson and the involvement there.

The buildings (especially the science center) need some serious updating"
Freshman,4,"Being in a small college town is nice if you're not coming from a big city. There's not really much to do in the local area and weather often prevents many days out, but the club's and campus events make up for this well enough. There's a great selection of clubs, and other events on campus. Many of the teachers are great, and many of the teachers are terrible; make sure you check the reviews first before choosing classes. The dorms are decent for what they are, and the food is mediocre. There's always something reliable as the dishes are always repeated. However, the food staff is wonderful! Make sure to be nice and respectful, it'll come back around in extras."
Freshman,4,Clarkson is overall a great school. The academics are challenging but they offer many ways to get extra help when needed. They are very focused on helping students learn what they need to know and pushing them to get real world experiences. This constant support makes it easier for Clarkson students to get jobs immediately after graduating. The students on campus all support one another rather than compete with one another. If there was one thing I could change about Clarkson I would say it would be the location. Clarkson is in a bit of a remote area but with that said there are plenty of clubs you can get involved in on campus to keep you busy. Plus the hockey is great!
Sophomore,4,The friends and experiences I have made at Clarkson are unreal. The friendships will last a lifetime and the memories for even longer. Great people.
Senior,4,"Overall  I have been very satisfied with my undergraduate career. If there was one thing I had to change about Clarkson, it would be the food services (which they are already changing) and the amount of diversity on campus and the recruitment of Students of color."
Sophomore,4,The Outing club has become a family to me. The school promotes my outside academic interests as much as my academic interests. Always keeps me excited
Senior,4,"Clarkson is very challenging , and the people you meet are game changers because of that. Also, the campus is close and the people are nice compared to being in other states where the people are not as friendly"
Freshman,4,"Classrooms are small, which by all means is very nice, but the furniture and flooring in the Science Center is incredibly old and a little gross..."
Freshman,4,Even though its a small school there are many clubs and events that happen throughout the year. The professors are kind and are more than willing to help their students if they ask for it.
Freshman,4,"I really like the school overall, I came through the Clarkson School program (early college program) and it was the best decision I ever made."
Freshman,4,"I believe that Clarkson University has the potential to be a fantastic fit for many people, but it is absolutely not for everyone. Clarkson's diversity, in regards to gender and race, is lackluster. If you are not a white male, then you stand out. However, the professors are top-notch and many of the courses are very interesting (but many of the courses are STEM related). Many of the people there are also very down-to-earth, which makes for pleasant interactions all around. Additionally, the career center and international center have great connections, especially considering the size and location of Clarkson."
Freshman,4,Clarkson University is a great STEM school. Its an academic rigorous college so just be ready for the amount of work and stress you'll be in. Campus food could be better. Diversity is rare on campus.
Alum,4,My time at Clarkson was definitely memorable. I left my alma mater with an education that I feel is marketable in quality. Clarkson is a tight knit family. There is a social group for everyone there.
Freshman,4,"I've had a very good experience at Clarkson so far. I've been challenged academically and definitely feel like it's the right fit for me. One thing I love about Clarkson is the return on your investment and how you're essentially guaranteed a job paying over $60,000 when you graduate. One thing that could be improved is the food because the options are rather limited."
Junior,4,"The academics is what you come here for, Clarkson has great connections and can lead you to companies. The career fair is a great place to connect to employers. I am not picky, so the food doesn't bother me but I know a lot of students do not like it. The professors range just as in any college, from being really good to terrible. The campus layout involves walking through parking lots, and in the winter the snow removal is not super quick. It is stunning here weather wise in the fall, but in the second semester its is cold and snowy."
Senior,4,"I transferred to Clarkson into the Mechanical Engineering program from a two-year SUNY community college.  I was very pleased to find that I was prepared for Clarkson, and was able to find success at such a highly regarded engineering school.  The career fairs and career center have helped me find summer internships and will hopefully soon find me a full- time position after graduation.  When considering the cost of tuition, I would fully recommend transferring in later on.  So far, this is the only downside I have seen of this school."
Freshman,4,I love the Clarkson university because of the opportunities that it offers to its student. Here at Clarkson we receive a very good education. We are academically challenged everyday and there are many resources on campus to help every student seeking help.  I will highly recommend this University to anyone seeking a very good education.
Freshman,4,"The academics as well as the variety of clubs/sports Clarkson provides are great! There are lots of parties and fun that goes on around campus. The teachers and TA's are very willing to help students out. The only problems with Clarkson is that the dorms/campus itself is not too pretty, the diversity is lacking and the local area can be boring sometimes."
Freshman,4,"Clarkson University has a very good atmosphere, not only on campus, but also in the surrounding area. More could be done to increase diversity on campus, but there are currently great strides towards at least making the campus more inclusive to those whom are diverse. As for teachers, here you will find the majority of the professors are caring and genuinely invested in their students academics, so long as you put in the work, they will help you see good results."
Freshman,4,"Clarkson University, located in the city of Potsdam in upstate New York, is a college that will guarantee students a career post-graduation due to the critical skills that students will learn inside and out of classes."
Freshman,4,"Overall the experience you would receive at this university is good. I could say the work load may be a bit too much, but it’s college. The food can also be improved...HIGHLY"
Freshman,4,"The education is great. The location may take some getting used to, but since most people stay on campus there is a great community feel."
Freshman,4,"It feels like home when you are on campus despite the cold weather. It was the main reason why I decided to attend Clarkson. On top of that, the professors are great and are always willing to devote their time to help you understand the material. There ia also a lot of activities and clubs the university has for us. Everyone has a club for them and if not the university we be willing to help you ceate your. All in all Clarkson is a great universit!"
Sophomore,4,"Overall Clarkson has giving me the tools needed in the real world to be successful . The campus could use a complete makeover, many of the building are very outdated. The food service is even worse. Do not expect to eat well coming to Clarkson. The Party scene is sub par."
Sophomore,4,"The school itself is great, the professor are generally really good, and the academics are top notch. The dorms are not very good, however they do the job. The campus food is also not very good. The town is very small and offers minimal value. If you’re looking for an engineering school in which you’ll receive a great education, with a very high placement rate and return on investment, then Clarkson is the way to go."
Freshman,4,I felt welcomed as soon as I walked on campus. Everyone wants you to succeed and is more than happy to help you if you need it. It’s a challenging school but after graduation it’s all worth it. Leaving Clarkson you will be successful and can walk out with a job if you work for it. The opportunities as amazing.
Freshman,4,Clarkson is a good academic school however the social life on campus is poor. 70/30 male to female ratio. Also the food service on campus is poor and needs to be improved. Facilities are clean and comfortable. On campus gym is a decent size. Dorms are bigger than other colleges. All the academic buildings are connected which is great for the winter (which is most of the year here).
Freshman,4,"Clarkson is a great school academically with great professors that care about their students. The classes are pretty small even freshman year which is useful for when you need help in on whatever your learning. Students take academics seriously here, but fridays and the weekends are fun and offer many options to students such as parties, sports, and club outings."
Freshman,4,"Clarkson is a great school with great classes and academic opportunities. There are plenty of clubs so everyone can find something for them. The only negative is the food because it gets repetitive since there are only so many options, and it's hard to eat healthy. Other than that, Clarkson is a wonderful school."
Freshman,4,"The Clarkson University is a great school. The academics are alright. Clarkson is lacking in diversity being mostly white males. The athletics are okay. After graduating you are almost guaranteed a job so return on investment is excellent. The campus is alright. The party scene is pretty good but can be difficult to get into at times. The food isn't very good, it gets old fast. Professors are hit or miss. Dorms are pretty big for freshman dorms."
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at Clarkson has been surprisingly eventful and fun. The best things about clarkson are it’s campus, academics, and party life. The campus is stunning during the summer and fall and turns into a winter wonderland in the winter. Clarkson is a hard school academically but is well worth the stress and struggle for a Clarkson degree. If you put the time and effort in it will be rewarded. Finally the party life at clarkson is surprisingly fun and active. There’s almost always multiple different parties to go to on the weekends. Whether it be a small get together if friends or a huge frat party"
Freshman,4,The atmosphere is very welcoming and as a freshman it was very easy to make friends. The many clubs and activities available to the students allows you to do what you like to do and when you want to.
Junior,4,I transferred into Clarkson University as a Junior so I’m pretty new to the scene. What I doo know is that graduating from Clarkson is very good for your future salary/job placement.
Freshman,4,I love the small community that makes Clarkson feel like home. The academics are challenging but there is always lots of tutoring help! One thing I would like Clarkson to improve is the quality of the food.
Sophomore,4,"While some things are harder than others, it's typically a good school with many friendly people. The classes aren't to hard but they are still challenging. It's a small campus so it isn't hard to find your way around."
Freshman,4,"Clarkson focuses on its students and you can really tell that the University cares about you and wants you to succeed. The only downside, its kind of in the middle of nowhere but if you enjoy the Adirondacks thats just another benifit."
Sophomore,4,"Clarkson offers a lot of extracurricular activities. The classes are of reasonable difficulty with professors who are usually eager to help. However, the rooming is very small and outdated, and the bathrooms often get really messy. Also, the food plan offers some diversity but not very much."
Freshman,4,The dorm rooms are great. There is always an activity or something almost everyday.  Every Friday they show a movie that came out recently.  Every subject the teachers have office hours for when you need help and some classes have TA's that can help you to Mon through Fri every week.
Senior,2,"The way they have been handling COVID19 does not indicate that the University as a whole cares for their students. Although they state they are doing all they can many of their responses and actions have been delayed and illogical. For example, they are providing a pass/fail option this semester where you can choose which classes you would like to keep the letter grade for. However, when taking the pass/fail option if the grade you received is a C- or D you will not receive credit and must retake the course to get credit. To receive credit for a course you received a C- or D on you must keep the letter grade and let it impact your GPA.  The whole point of the pass/fail option was to try to prevent COVID19 from impacting our GPAs yet to get credit in a class that you did poorly in you have to let it impact your GPA. How does this make sense?"
Graduate Student,2,"Classes are hard to come by for graduate students. There aren't many offered, every year the only consistent class is biochem 2. Other than that you will end up taking quite a few irrelevant classes to fill requirements."
Junior,2,"If your depressed you will feel at home here. The academics here are tough but they will give you a lot of work in order to prepare you for real life. The food is crap and run by a monopoly who overprices it so clubs can never have events. The dorms I was put in was nicknamed the pit due to it looking like a prison cell and being away from everything. The professors do not work with you, there are some exceptions but your pretty much on you own. I wouldn't come."
Freshman,2,"Clarkson University is good to challenge yourself, but there is not a lot of diversity on campus. It is predominantly male campus."
College Freshman,2,"Improvements on staff, security to student relationship should be established, high levels of untrust between the groups"
College Freshman,2,Maintenance should be done in order to gain higher appeal on campus. More machines and updated technology.
College Freshman,2,"70:30 Male to Female ratio, very little ethnic/racial diversity, many students form New York and Vermont."
College Junior,2,"The quality of the food from The Servery and Ro-Bro is just terrible.  Nearly every time I got a meal from there during my freshman and sophomore years (before I started living in Woodstock), I was unsatisfied with it.  The cooks are generally terrible because they are mostly students and Aramark (the food service) is disgusting.  Most of the time I ate at Subway because I knew what I was getting, but Smokehouse and Mainstream Grill also offer good variety."
College Sophomore,2,"Not too much off campus activities to do. There are a few places with close-enough access, and both Lake Placid and Montreal are not significantly far off campus - but for the immediate area, there is not too much."
College Freshman,2,Well the town is small. It's Potsdam so I don't expect too much. There are very few places but my meal plan is okay so I don't need to go out often or if at all.
College Freshman,2,If there was a way they could rearrange the lots that would be better.
College Sophomore,2,Nightlife is limited to the Frat houses and a few bars in town.
College Sophomore,2,The school has very few girls and you don't seem to see many on-campus relationships.
College Junior,2,Campus dining is overpriced and not very good.
College Junior,2,"Off-campus dining is lacking.  There's about 6 restaurants and then a couple of pizzerias and some fast food places, but, that's about it.  Might not seem lacking to someone from a small town, but, if you're from a city, you'll miss certain foods pretty quick."
College Junior,2,"Being up in the Adirondack region, the winter weather is pretty intense.  If you're not used to it, it can seem pretty harsh, and school is not cancelled for it."
College Freshman,2,You either need to walk or drive yourself.
College Freshman,2,We need better off-campus options! It's all the same
College Freshman,2,Kids in Greek Life are weird. Not a cool thing
College Freshman,2,Definitely a safe place but there is nothing to do
College Freshman,2,Zip-cars are really the only consistent form of campus transportation which is a bit of an issue for people who do not have a driver's license. At the beginning and end of breaks a local charter bus company comes by as well.
College Freshman,2,"It's cold. No, it's worse than that. Cold is 13 degrees. This is below zero with high wind speeds. The campus itself is basically a wind tunnel. Don't come here if you can't handle the cold and/or do not have a good winter coat and some long underwear."
College Freshman,2,"Most folks are respectful enough, but there really isn't much diversity on campus at all. For example, in my psychology class of roughly 60 people, there are about 8 POC. The GSA has about 15 members, only 8 or so of whom are active."
College Freshman,2,"You definitely need your own computer, and I'd recommend your own router as well. Campus wifi is average at best and unusable at worst. During the weeks before final exams, even using a router often isn't enough to get decent internet speed."
College Freshman,2,"Weather is very scary sometimes, but doesn't affect whether you can get to class."
College Freshman,2,Not very many places to get off-campus housing - not worth it.
College Freshman,2,"Very few off-campus dining places, mostly fast food and other poor quality restaurants."
College Freshman,2,"Very few students of color or of liberal views, though there are societies for minority students."
College Freshman,2,Not very many buses and very hard to get out of town if you don't have a car.
College Freshman,2,"There are very few classes in the psychology field. Very hard to graduate because of lack of classes, but it is an engineering school."
College Freshman,2,The internet really sucks. Get a computer with an internet port or at least your own router. 
College Junior,2,Not the best tasting food and not a lot to choose.
College Junior,2,Only bars in town and some frats.
College Junior,2,Not many places to eat. About five around campus.
College Senior,2,"There are not many different races or religions, and they generally stay to themselves in cliques."
College Senior,2,The process is moderately miserable and extremely expensive.
College Junior,2,"Honestly there are hardly any girls at Clarkson too begin with. Then of the few girls that are here, not even half of them are social and most aren't very attractive. There are some diamonds in the rough and there is also nearby SUNY Potsdam which is full of girls."
College Freshman,2,"The local town has 3 other surrounding colleges so there are many other students to meet. However, it is a small town with very little to do off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The computer lab's computers take forever to load up. the printing is very inconsistent in certain places and wifi is horrible in places like the library and dorms. The WiFi runs  about 54 Mbps and it is so slow. It takes about 20-60 seconds to load up pages sometime and just like the printing, the WiFi is unreliable. Bring your own router for optimal performance or your own Ethernet cord. The dorms usually have two slots too, that's why it is better to have a router in case you have friends over and they want a direct connection. You don't need your own personal computer because Clarkson has ample computer's in computer labs, but sometimes, labs can become crowded so if you want space or to be alone, having a personal computer can be very helpful and efficient, but not necessary."
College Sophomore,2,"It may look like there are many options to choose from, but after awhile it gets boring eating the same old thing. They do have a couple dining halls so wherever you are on campus, you can grab some grub fast!"
Sophomore,1,"Attending Clarkson University is a very stressful experience. You are forced to be on a meal plan (which is ridiculously overpriced), and the food is terrible. Worst of all, Clarkson will sell you a great deal of whatever program you are applying to when it's not true at all. If you are Pre-Med, do not come here. There is not enough space for you to take the classes you'll need for the MCAT on time, so you have to fill your schedule with electives you don't want. They also schedule classes that students of the same major and year need to take at the same time, so you are never able to take the classes you need (e.g., they'll schedule a Chemistry and Physics course T Thu 2-3pm, and you need to take both). Lastly, a lot of the professors here can't teach properly. For $50k+ yearly tuition, you'd think they'd hire people who have adequate teaching methods. I wouldn't recommend anyone come here."
Sophomore,1,The WiFi is horrible so doing work on your computer is a hassle. I've never been able to watch a lecture without running into a problem with the internet.
Senior,1,"There is a lot of not so trustworthy reviews on here. I'm in my senior year. I am a Computer Science major. Let me be the first to tell you that THIS IS NOT A COMPUTER SCIENCE UNIVERSITY. If you are looking to attend here for CS, I encourage you to look directly past this school. It is not for teaching, it is for taking your money and making you feel like you've just been taught secrets of the universe, that you come to realize was absolutely useless and you posses no skills of the jobs demanding.

This school is not worth any money, let alone the ridiculous amount they charge you. You will regret coming here, I tell you as a patient senior, awaiting a time where i feel my money was well spent, there will never be such a time. I hope to save a student out there somewhere who was excited for this university."
Graduate Student,1,"Prospective Graduate Students (PhD or Master):  do not enroll here.  They will use you as a technician, courses are undergraduate level at best (in fact you take many of the courses with the undergrads).  Not useful mentoring (one exception but she's leaving b/c denied of tenure).  Most tenured profs are incompetent and do unimpressive research that cannot get funded.  You end up working on troubleshooting protocols for your thesis (AKA ""special project"").  The stipend is less than minimal wage.  Accommodations in the area are poor.  No culture, no night life, no outlet venues to decompress (most turn to alcohol or drugs to cope with the depressing environment)."
Senior,1,"Worst dorms ever!   Mine had mold everywhere and I went into an anaphylactic shock.  There is a leak in the ceiling that has not being fixed in months.  We put the work order and it goes to a black hole.  All over campus things aren't fixed.  it is an engineering school with the worst construction.  Labs are poorly laid out.  The eye wash pipe has a hole in the middle so if you need to flush your eyes, you'll flood the room.  I pay too much for this.  I did not make a good choice.  Too late, unfortunately."
College Freshman,1,the campus is too far out and unknown for minorities to find out about it
College Sophomore,1,"Since Clarkson is primarily a engineering school, there are very few girls to go around. The guys on campus can range from the W.O.W nerd to buff jocks. You will never know who you will run into at Clarkson."
College Sophomore,1,There is absolutely no transportation at Clarkson University. It is in the middle of upstate NY so having a car is pretty much useless unless you want to go to Canada.
College Sophomore,1,The Iceberg Campus – Campus often reaches temperatures in the -20s and -30s in the prime of winter. Classes cancelled because of weather? Never heard of it at this school. Sidewalks are often covered in ice and I have witnessed many people fall.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Buy a Car or Walk – There is zero public transportation.  Despite there being 3 other colleges within 10 miles and the option to cross-enroll, there is no shuttle service between schools."
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is not just. There are a lot of freshman with cars, and many parking lots are taken up and some people need to park too far when there a parking lot closer but not available for those students. I think everyone should be able to park in which ever parking lot they like. It's easier, especially if people are visiting others and the temperature is below 0. Walking is awful."
College Junior,1,"I'd estimate that their is three times as many students with cars then parking spots. If you live off campus it's a nightmare finding a place to park, so get to class early. If you park anywhere outside of the student lots you'll get a ticket. Clarkson's parking is terrible."

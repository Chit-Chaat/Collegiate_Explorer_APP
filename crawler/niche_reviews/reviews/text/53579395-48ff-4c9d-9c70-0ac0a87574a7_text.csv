Alum,5,"My online classes were just as meaningful and fulfilling as my in person classes. Each professor made sure to give each individual more than enough resources, and opportunities to learn more about the topic via online than I ever expected. I was very pleased with each of my online classes."
Alum,5,"University of Georgia creates an environment that challenges each individual to strive in their academics, but more importantly to make meaningful change in their communities. I would not trade my college experience for anything, and I believe that the experience I had was cultivated by the amazing professors, staff, and students. Each member of the bulldawg nation plays an integral part in making this community, and college one like no other."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Georgia did an excellent job adjusting to online learning due to the corona virus. I still felt very connected to my professors, and I feel like it has been a lot easier to keep up with all of my classes this way. The only downside to online learning is that it is harder to find students in your classes to study with since it is not in person."
Junior,5,"UGA is a great school with a high quality of education! The only department that brings the school down is Chemistry. This department is constantly failing students instead of changing their teaching styles/techniques. There are only 50 Chemistry graduates from UGA each year for a reason. Other than that, I love going to UGA! Campus food is great. Tutoring centers are a blessing. When I was a freshman I enjoyed living on campus and taking advantage of the many quads."
Sophomore,5,I think that the University of Georgia is an amazing institution with a lot to offer its students. I have been able to get involved with many of their organizations and meet amazing people.
Sophomore,5,"Before the pandemic, I never took any online courses at UGA, but from what I have heard from my peers, the professors do an amazing job and they learn a lot from these courses."
Freshman,5,"UGA is a great school with good amounts of diversity in all kinds, from political to extracurricular and everything in between. Athens is an incredible college town. The campus is beautiful, very walkable for the most part, and super livable. The students here are very smart and every professor I've ever had is great and super helpful. Facilities for the business school and most student life in general are great, dorms are nice, and everything is kept up super well. Only thing I don't love is how big of a presence greek life has on the campus, but still it doesn't control all aspects of student life just more than I would like. UGA is a great school and I am so happy I chose to come here."
Freshman,5,"The online experience at UGA is great. The UGA elc is super easy to use and navigate, and overall online learning has been a good experience for me."
Freshman,5,"I did not take any online classes at UGA, so I cannot give a first-hand account, but my friends rate online learning at UGA very well."
Freshman,5,UGA is an awesome school. The staff is very friendly and the energy on the campus is electrifying!!!
Freshman,5,"Love UGA. Overall great experience and culture. I especially love cheering on the dawgs, and meeting people of all different backgrounds."
Freshman,5,"Did not sign up for any online classes, although COVID has influenced the transition of big lecture halls into online platforms like zoom."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing school, awesome staff. My advisor and professors have been great at helping me figure out the path I want to take in my career."
Sophomore,5,All of my professors have adjusted very well to the online transition and are understanding. They have been flexible and accommodating at all times
Alum,5,"I give UGA 5 stars. It provides a lot of support for it's students, and offers a great college experience!"
Alum,5,"I took a few hybrid classes at UGA.  Overall, they were all very easy to follow and keep up with, and communication with the professor was very clear."
Sophomore,5,"I am shy. I have never been one to really go out of my way when I feel uncomfortable. The University of Georgia, however, made me comfortable enough to do the uncomfortable. I talked with people I have never met. I met my friends and future roommates for this coming year. I experienced classes that I loved, and classes that I strongly disliked. I was able to feel independent in an environment that inspires higher learning and greatness. The hustle and bustle of the campus, walking across years of history and learning, makes the university a living and breathing place. There are so many people, yet somehow I found myself seeing the same handful of faces every day. After a while, you really feel at home."
Junior,5,The University of Georgia is an exceptional university! You won't regret your decision to attend this phenomenal university!
Junior,5,"Yes, I recently took classes online Spring 2020 semester post-COVID outbreak. The professors were very understanding, and extended deadlines, when necessary, to accommodate those in need of extensions. Being online showed another example of how exceptional this university is."
Freshman,5,"I love being a part of this student body, it's extremely academic based, but still provides students a whirlwind of opportunities to get involved in their community and meet new people. Plus football games, go dawgs !"
Freshman,5,"Is it a difficult transition as an incoming freshman, but as you long attend office hours for difficult concepts, the professors will try there best to help you. They do not want to see you fail, but remember that you have to put in your own effort."
Alum,5,"I loved my experience there. Campus life was amazing and the community was amazing as well. There were plenty of campus organizations so you really could find your niche. If you felt something was missing, it was easy to find a supportive adult to sponsor your organization. It was truly an amazing experience!"
Alum,5,"Many of my classes had online components but from my memory, there was no requirement to take any online classes at that time."
Junior,5,"I absolutely love UGA. It is amazing and better than any other school out there except parking is extremely terrible and needs to be improved greatly. Also, the dorms can be gross but some of them are good."
Freshman,5,"Did online classes during COVID-19, very professional and didn't take anything away from the quality of the lectures and labs I had to complete."
Freshman,5,"Very good housing in various locations for everyone'e needs. East campus housing has the gym right across from it and is the most modern. Very good for students that have a lot of STEM classes or art/music because east campus is the closest to those buildings. UGA has plenty of fun things to do on campus and Athens hosts tons of events. LGBTQ+ friendly (there are a couple of drag queens performing in some of the venues downtown), and they have Athens pride weekend and great university resources. We have an on campus movie theatre that shows 2 different movies every weekend (completely free!) and are sometimes privy to early viewings and arthouse films (such as as A24 studios). Great dining halls with various specialities depending on diets. UGA also has a hotel on campus with the 24 hr dining hall right across it and an airport shuttle bus. Makes it easy for students to catch a plane or go back home on breaks. UGA also has 2 public transportation systems making it easy to get around."
Sophomore,5,"UGA is one of the few universities that makes you feel at home. You get to experience the warm welcome that each dawg alum gives, become immersed in a culture like no other, and receive the knowledge to take you further to your goal."
Sophomore,5,"After COVID, all classes obviously transitioned to online. I prefer face to face instruction, as I find it very hard to stay focused online, but the teachers were very accommodating and invested in our mental and physical health. They were very willing to work with us on both our grades and understanding of the material."
Sophomore,5,"I love attending UGA. I came from a small private school, and really wanted to attend a large, diverse university. I am extremely pleased with my choice to go here. I have found an awesome group of friends, and I have found the academics to be challenging enough to avoid being boring, and the teachers to be very engaging and concerned with students' welfare. It's also pretty affordable with in-state tuition and scholarships."
Alum,5,"During COVID-19 my classes were moved to an online format. Using Zoom was easy and made it possible to interact face to face with my professors and peers. I prefer in-person classes, but due to the pandemic, we had no other choice."
Alum,5,I loved my time at UGA. I studied advertising and had some amazing experiences and professors. I took part in many clubs and organizations. I also really enjoyed attending football games and tailgates as well as the surrounding downtown area with many shops and restaurants.
Senior,5,UGA professors do a great job teaching classes online. There are a number of different online platforms that are used to help the course content be delivered easily and efficiently.
Senior,5,Tons of on-campus opportunities and ways to get involved beyond just going to class. Very educated professors who care to develop a relationship with their students.
Junior,5,The professors really did their best to switch the curriculum over to online wit minimal notice.  They were willing to help in any way they could and even held online office hours every weekday.
Junior,5,I absolutely love the University of Georgia.  There is a place for everyone with hundreds of different ways to get involved.  I don't know why I ever grew up a tech fan.
Senior,5,"Georgia is honestly the best school I could ask for. I am an in-state student so all of my scholarships make my education student loan free. I would have chosen UGA even if I was out-of-state though because it is the best mix of campus culture and resources. UGA has houses abroad such as in Cortona, Italy and Oxford, UK. I lived in the one at Oxford and took classes with University of Oxford tutors. They also have a house in Washington, D.C. where you can live on capital hill, intern, and take UGA classes all at the same time. Opportunities are abundant at UGA and so easy to access. They have informational sessions and fairs all the time so you can speak one-on-one to the directors of programs to see if they would be a good fit (and you can ask they for application tips!!). UGA is getting more and more prestigious so I am thankful I will be called a UGA alum soon."
Senior,5,Online classes (especially during the summer) have (in my opinion) almost been easier than in-person but that varies a lot by the subject of the class and the professor.
Graduate Student,5,The transition to online learning was easy because the teachers adjusted to make sure students were clear of the expectations and changes.
Graduate Student,5,UGA is an amazing school. The faculty is committed to making sure students get the most out of their experience. The school spirit is also unlike any other school. I would not have wanted to go anywhere else.
Alum,5,I went here for undergrad and for my Master's Degree and I loved it.  Best time of my life.  Go dawgs!
Junior,5,"The University of Georgia is a place where everyone can find a group of people they fit in with. The student population is extremely diverse and will help broaden your horizons to the type of people you are around and can learn from. There is a club for everyone and allows everyone to feel included. From football games to musical performances to listening to a variety of people defend their dissertations, there is always something to do that you will enjoy. The University of Georgia has top academic programs and strive to best prepare their students for the real world. There is many opportunities for hands on experience in your field and events like Employer of the Day or Career Fairs that can get you in contact with future employers. There are many resources to help students through their classes and get the most out of their degree at the university. I would recommend the University of Georgia to anyone considering a four year college degree. The atmosphere is unlike any other."
Freshman,5,The professors are very considerate that you are taking online classes which is very nice. along with very efficient and all details of the class are laid out well.
Freshman,5,I started off with taking a tour of the college before hand. The first interactions with any staff or people affiliated with the school was kind and helpful in every way. The next few years were brought with a lot of joy. The students at this school are all around diverse and willing to connect to anyone .
Freshman,5,"The online learning experience has been good. Obviously, it has not been as wonderful as the in-person learning experience, but considering the circumstances it was great."
Freshman,5,The University of Georgia was amazing during my freshmen year. The professors were so detailed oriented and truly strived to help students succeed. The facilities are amazing. The dorm experience was awesome. The sense of community is second to none and the sports are fantastic.
Sophomore,5,"My favorite place on earth, this is truly a home to me and I could not be happier about my college choice."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Georgia is a great place to spend your college years! There are so many great people, places, and events everywhere you go. You won't regret choosing this school!"
Freshman,5,"Haven’t actually gone yet, seems great, writing this for the scholarship sorry. ( I need to get to 100 characters) seems like a school with plenty of opportunities and good balance of social and academics"
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved every bit of Georgia. I was a Management Information Systems major who firmly believed that my degree was worth every penny. The Terry College of Business placed a lot of emphasis on my education and allowed me to grow as an individual and professional. At this university, I was also able to continuously participate on campus through Greek Life, UGA Housing, and multiple student business associations. 

In addition to great academics and a well-knit campus life, UGA has also encouraged me to connect with people from different backgrounds. The university encourages and pushed for diversity amongst its students and it is evident on campus."
Alum,5,"It's true when they say UGA is the greatest in the land. It's a big school, which means theres something for everyone. While it may feel too big at times, there's so many organizations to be a part of where you will find your small niche."
Freshman,5,"I'm currently a freshman at UGA, and I love it a lot! The environment is very comforting and everyone is very friendly."
Freshman,5,This is an amazing university that has changed my life in the best ways. The professors truly care for the students and seek to help them learn any way they can. The student life has so much to offer. I couldn't imagine going anywhere else.
Freshman,5,I love the opportunities given to meet new people. As the campus is always growing there is always an opportunity to find where you belong and life long friends that also belong. The entire UGA campus is one big family and this is especially proven on game days. If you show up to any UGA sporting event you will be welcomed by the Bulldog Nation and there is no feeling like it. It is one of my favorite things when all of the UGA community is chanting or cheering together because you get taken over in goosebumps and a wave of excitement!
Senior,5,"The University of Georgia provides so many resources and outlets for students to grow their identity and passions. I love the atmosphere it provides for students to transition into the next stage of life with the tailgates, the athletics, the traditions, and the activities. Downtown Athens is a special place to many in the community, and it truly is like no other. This place draws the attention of those who enjoy food, sightseeing, and having fun. UGA is an incredible school with so many opportunities and genuine people. I have met some of my closest friends here, and I have also been able to challenge myself. The College of Education has pushed me to think beyond my comfort zone, and I am so thankful for the professors and experiences, especially study abroads! Something that I would love to see change is the diversity and integration of the Athens community with UGA students. It would be incredibly powerful for this community to unite and grow together while supporting one another!"
Alum,5,"UGA was an amazing school. When I was applying, it was honestly my last choice, but I'm so glad I ended up there. I met so many good friends and had so many great professors that helped shape who I am today."
Freshman,5,The University of Georgia is truly a great four-year university. All the professors I have had so far put their students above all else. Dedication like that can make or break your grade at the end of the semester. It really influences your mindset as well as your knowledge on the subject.
Alum,5,"UGA is a huge campus with over 30,000 students so as a new freshman or even a transfer student it can feel overwhelming at times, but the university does an amazing job at helping you get plugged in and finding a core group. There is always something going on that you get to enjoy socially, and academically I had some of the best professors who really cared about me. And a bonus, I met my lifelong friends here!"
Alum,5,"The environment in Athens was spectacular. As an alumni, I feel proud to say that I graduated from there but it is not a conceited pride. Georgia students are helpful and kind and love their university and all its students. We call it ""the finest institution in the land""."
Sophomore,5,The absolute best school ever! Has the best of both worlds when looking at academics while also having a fun social life.
Niche User,5,"The University of Georgia is a great place. When visiting, I have had wonderful times, and met a plethora of great people. Not only is the campus beautiful, but the city of Athens is as well. The social scenes are fantastic, and matched equally by the academic facilities."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Georgia is the perfect place for someone who enjoys beautiful views, diversity, and a great education. Even though the school's population is pretty large, it is very easy to make it feel smaller by joining a club or an intramural sport. The weekends can be very fun with all of the tasty restaurants that can be found downtown. The only thing that might be an issue is that Athens can be dangerous at times."
Alum,4,"I did not personally take online courses however UGA's online platform for practice tests, quizzes, and homework was easy to use and understand."
Alum,4,"UGA offers a variety of choices in terms of majors as well as student organization. Because the campus is very big, it might take some research on the student to find the right organization for him/her. 
UGA's experience is mainly based on what you make it. You can study abroad, join their massive Greek life, participate in their many student events, meet international students, or navigate college life by yourself. The choice is yours to make. This can also be quite overwhelming for some. So if you're looking for options, UGA has it."
Alum,4,"Overall, my experience at UGA was great. Although I was not part of the typical Athens ""scene,"" (downtown, football games, etc) I will still able to meet tons of people and make lifelong friends, while also enjoying my overall college experience. Be sure to appreciate the town of Athens as a whole and to not take for granted your time here as a student because it flys by FAST. In my experience, both the professors and student body are what make UGA so great. Go Dawgs!"
Sophomore,4,Great Community and campus life. I have made many friends and the football games are so fun! Would definitely recommend.
Sophomore,4,All my classes this year have been online. My professors have done a great job adjusting their teaching and lectures.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, as a transfer student, it was a big change since I came fem. a small college with a max of like 20 students per class. the campus is very overwhelming but its really beautiful and fast paced."
Alum,4,"UGA is a beautiful school located in a beautiful city not to far from larger cities. All colleges at this school are recognized as some of the best in the country. The campus life and student life is phenomenal and the party is scene is not bad either. Academics absolutely come first, but professors are very willing to work with students and deadlines."
Freshman,4,I loved the sense of community at UGA. The town is amazing and the love that the town has for the college is even better.
Freshman,4,"I'd like to see them care more about the safety of the students more, and not just about their money."
Freshman,4,"I'm taking two classes online as of right now, and one of them is a hybrid between online and in person. I don't really know how to rate it because classes haven't actually started yet so."
Junior,4,"Although the University of Georgia is centered around football and greek life, those not involved with these two categories can still make the most of college life by attending this school. Overall my academics here have taught me so much more than what I have learned in high school, and I continue to use the knowledge from my previous classes in the real world. I have come to love this campus and some of the professors I have had the privilege to learn from."
Junior,4,"So far the online experience has not been too harsh. It is harder for me to learn online because I, personally, like to be present in a face to face lecture because I retain more information. However, the professors that I have had online go above and beyond to make sure the students know what is expected of them."
Senior,4,"My online experience as a fine arts/graphic design and religious studies major worked out quite well. The professors put in a lot of time and energy to plan how the class will be set up. Students who had online/internet difficulties were paid close attention to and were given extra help. Zoom meetings are structured and organized, and online classes ran smoothly."
Junior,4,"UGA changed my life for the better. I worked so hard to get in coming from another university in the state, and it was easy to get the information I needed. I’m antisocial, so it sometimes gets extremely lonely, but there is ample opportunity for those who seek it. I only give 4 stars because in my college experience, no university is 5 star."
Freshman,4,"I didn’t take any class on line but my overall orientation was online and I had a good experience. I had the opportunity to meet with others Freshman students and my advisor. Due to the Pandemic, virtual tour of the Campus was done online as well. I got a chance to see the Campus online and I am glad to go through this online experience."
Freshman,4,University of Georgia is very organized. The nation is going to a very difficult time with this Pandemic but UGA made it possible to go online and get any information  that students may need. All questions are also answers online. UGA needs to work on telling students about scholarships deadlines. I am a good student with a GPA of 3.94 but I missed the deadline to apply for scholarships. I don’t have enough money to cover all my school tuitions.
Sophomore,4,"It was definitely an interesting time to say the least with the arrival COVID-19. Switching online was tough but most of the professors did the best they could to keep the curriculum from being too taxing. I was able to work at my own pace outside of exams and the grading fair for the most part all things considered. I definitely prefer on campus learning, but online learning wasn’t as dreadful as I thought it would be."
Sophomore,4,"UGA has always been my dream school, and it did not disappoint. It is a huge campus with a lot to offer. With sports, a wide range of clubs and activities, as well as top notch academics. If you’re looking for big university environment then UGA is the place the for you."
Junior,4,"Due to COVID, I did take online classes. I did prefer classes in person as I like the connection of working with students and professors."
Junior,4,"Due to COVID, I did take online classes. I did prefer classes in person as I like the connection of working with students and professors."
Junior,4,I think UGA has a lot of great characteristics that make it a great public university. My one complaint regards to how the President and other people of higher position at UGA have handled things like COVID along with other complaints from students.
Sophomore,4,"I'm not a fan of online learning. It is not easy to commit extra time to learn the material that isn't being taught like it is while on campus. The university does a great job on providing the means to learn. Some professors are incredible at teaching the material online, while some were not as great. Overall, I still sort of learned the material I needed to and it wasn't horrible."
Sophomore,4,The University of Georgia is a great school to go to. It has a beautiful campus with lots of majors/ minors for everyone to chose. I love the student life and especially the pride that is ongoing from every student.
Senior,4,"The University of Georgia is a fantastic higher education establishment; the classes are generally well-organized and helpful for the majority of students, the campus embodies a pleasant juxtaposition of historical and modern aesthetics, and the student body is progressive and diverse. The professors at the school are generally good teachers, however, the more students progress into higher-level courses, the more likely it becomes to have a below average professor who considers themselves safe from petty course evaluators and department discipline. The university requires first-year students to live on campus, however, student dorms are incredibly overpriced and uncomfortable to live in. The town of Athens helps the environment of the university gain a much more enjoyable atmosphere overall. Downtown Athens is right next to campus and offers a wide range of activities, such as attending local concerts, visiting various bars, and trying new foods at locally-owned restaurants."
Junior,4,I love going to school here. The overall spirit if UGA is so upbeat and lively that its intoxicating. The professors and overall academic programs are amazing and they support their students through everything.
Junior,4,The online experience was actually very smooth and there was less problems than I anticipated. The professors and classes are just as interesting and supportive as they are in person.
Sophomore,4,My professors were still very involved in the online platform. A few of my smaller classes would have virtual discussions and lessons on a video conference platform. My other classes would send prerecorded lectures with either just note taking or and additional practice worksheet to submit. All of my online STEM classes included additional practice problems during the live or prerecorded sessions.
Alum,4,I had a hybrid of in person and online classes.  The online learning experience was easy to navigate.
Junior,4,"During the pandemic, I had five classes go from face-to-face instruction to online instruction. Even though this was uncharted territory for most professors, Zoom meetings allowed for my classes to continue smoothly as if I never left. Many of my final exams turned into more detailed final projects to ensure that everyone was on even playing fields when using notes and outside resources. In past semesters, I have taken two normal online courses. In these course, I was instructed to watch online lectures and keep up with assignment deadlines on my own. Typically assignments were due each week, but you could work ahead as much as you'd like. This was nice because I could typically sit down and knock out my online courses in a few weeks as opposed to being in the course the full 18 weeks."
Sophomore,4,"They were decent, not great or ideal, but they got the job done.  I definitely would have done better if it were in person, but I did okay in the end."
Freshman,4,It is great. You can meet a lot of new people and make a lot of important contacts. I would like to see the physics and chemistry departments to improve and the college of engineering is amazing.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Georgia is a school held in high regard by those comparing. UGA has an expansive campus, covering not only the walkways to class but also the interior or some buildings with beautiful plants and decor. 

Academically the school is amazing, each class posing some form of a challenge to the students. The thing that I'd say needs the most improvement would be the evaluation/maintenance of professors. Some professors just aren't cut out for what they do, and even sometimes it may feel like they're purposefully making the class more difficult than it needs to be.

The campus population is very diverse, UGA being a mixing pot of many different cultures. And while we're on the topic of peers, the student life around campus is amazing. Almost everyone respecting each other as a dawg equally."
Alum,4,"UGA creates an excellent sense of community among its students. There is something for everyone, whether it be clubs, intramural sports, Greek life, or football. While the chemistry department leaves students struggling, most other areas of study are fully supportive of students and facilitate success."
Senior,4,"I really liked attending the University of Georgia. Once you're able to find your crowd, there's a real sense of community, and I've made a lot of meaningful relationships during my time here. I've also fallen in love with my college and its curriculum. My professors are all amazing, and they really look out for their students and help them as much as they can. The campus is beautiful, and students have access to so many great resources. I will add, however, that there does need to be more diversity on campus and more representation of these minority groups around campus."
Sophomore,4,I wish UGA made it easier for people to find parking. Parking is more stressful than school itself. The campus is great but can be hard to get to places on time.
Alum,4,"The University of Georgia is wonderful in the aspect that it offers a wide diversity of degrees if you are are still trying to figure out what you would like to major in. However, because it is such a large college, it is hard to get paired with an adequate advisor if you haven't made up your mind. General education classes are large, your professor probably won't know your name, and there are classes known as 'weed out' classes that are notoriously difficult to crush people's dreams of become a doctor, scientist, etc. However, this is a well known University, so your connections are endless after you graduate. If you become part of a smaller school, class sizes go down and relationships with your professor go up. There are hundreds of organizations to join, and there is nothing like the feeling of solidarity that comes with thousands of people on a game day in Athens. The campus is beautiful, the town of Athens is awesome, and the University is a great entity to be a part of."
Junior,4,My overall experience has been fine. I like the teachers and some of classmates/friends. I am a transfer student. The small town is ok thought. I graduate next year. The Public Health department is helpful.
Junior,4,"The University of Georgia advanced me as a student and as a young adult. Prior to coming to the university, I was a pretty average student and did not care too much about my work. Once I started attending the university, I was consistently surrounded by people who had great career aspirations and continuously pushed themselves in their work; I couldn't help but desire to take after them, and push myself to become a better student, and a more well-rounded individual. The culture at UGA does push you to your limits, but I am thankful for the opportunities an the support that comes with that push."
Freshman,4,"So far I have enjoyed my time at the University of Georgia. It has been difficult finding new friends, being far away from home, but the university makes a great effort to help new students get involved around the campus and give new opportunities."
Senior,4,"I'm happy that I choose to go to UGA. The friends I've made here and the experiences I've had will stick with me for all my life. Classes are rigorous but not impossible, and the Athens area is wonderful. The only way it could improve is more funding for smaller departments like Engineering and German studies and by sprucing up the green spaces on campus."
Senior,4,The University of Georgia is a great school to attend. There is always something to get involved in. It is super easy to meet and connect with fellow classmates. Most professors are super helpful and just want to see you achieve so they always invite students to office hours if they are struggling with anything at all. The atmosphere in Athens is one that never gets old. It is a beautiful city to live in and there's always something to do. But the best thing about this school is definitely FOOTBALL. There is nothing better than experiencing a Georgia Bulldogs football game at Sanford Stadium.
Junior,4,"I enjoy attending UGA because of the diverse opportunities it provides. From challenging academic curriculum and standards to various clubs and organizations, I am not just going to college but I am able build experience that I can transfer outside of college. UGA has provided a safe environment for me commute and has provided an overall a friendly atmosphere. I think that UGA can better help students that has transferred feel more welcome and the parking spot availability for students should increase. Parking for students has been a big challenge which needs addressed. I also believe the intramural sports website needs to be better improved. We pay up to $50 a semester to play and it is a hassle to wait 30 minutes just to get a team prepared for an enjoyable activity."
Sophomore,4,"I am in my second year of undergrad a the University of Georgia. I am from out-of-state so I was nervous about choosing this school, but excited nonetheless. UGA has offered me an incredible education and a community of intelligent, capable and driven young people striving towards excellence. I cannot say enough good things about my university."
Niche User,4,"Great education and campus. The dorms are very very small, but the classes are well tailored. The student life is nice and they get freshmen involved in programs and keep them active and engaged."
Senior,4,"The campus is overwhelmingly large; however, once you find your niche here, you quickly come to see it as home. It is my fourth college that I have attended and it is my favorite by far. The facilities are amazing and the dedication to student success just doesn't stop. The dean of students and all of the administrative staff are easy to contact and have a deep love for UGA."
Senior,4,"I love the campus and the bus system that gets us all around campus. All professors in my major (Exercise and Sport Science) are incredible! If I could change one thing about UGA, it would be to have extra time in between class periods. It is very difficult to get from one side of campus to the other in 15 minutes, regardless of the accuracy of the bus systems. Changing the schedules to having 20 minutes instead of 15 would make getting to class significantly easier."
Alum,4,UGA offers a very challenging curriculum in an interesting but quite the safest town. Student life is good and the school offers many opportunities to get involved. The caliber of student is high so it is more difficult than other schools. The college experience is on full display there.
Freshman,4,"UGA is a fun, extremely spirited school. Athens is an amazing college town and there is always something to do. The academics are strong, as well, and most of the professors are great. There are a lot of opportunities for students and a lot of things to get involved in. It is a huge party school, which is definitely part of the culture. However, people are passionate and get things done, too."
Sophomore,4,"UGA provides a rigorous curriculum and a rich campus life simultaneously. Whether you are interested in ID based orgs, athletics, career-focused groups, volunteer opportunities, or anything in between there is a place for you! There are so many majors to choose from, the professors are quite qualified, and there are several opportunities for academic help. Athens is really cheap to live in and revolves around the school."
Senior,4,The architecture is beautiful and the environment and atmosphere is great. There are a lot of activities to do on and around campus. Would like to see some improvements to my major department and to see better general advisers be hired.
Alum,4,"UGA is a big hitter for Georgia schools. It has a huge campus, which can have its ups and downs. Learning the bus system can take some time, but it's a help for getting around campus. Don't make the mistake of planning only 15 minutes between your classes. 

Staying in the dorms for freshman year is the quintessential college experience that everyone kind of pictures when you think about college life. All the freshman are gathered in one place and there's a ""you're in this together"" kind of attitude that makes it easier to bond with the people around you. That being said, there are hassles for sharing a room and a bathroom.

Athens is a great city. Off campus, everything is kept a little bit cheaper because everyone keeps broke college students in mind. The Downtown scene is rich with great food.  Football games are fun and cause the whole city to beef up in pride (or a state wide depression). All in all, this a great place to go to for college. Go Dawgs."
Graduate Student,4,"As a graduate student I have been at UGA for 5 years. I’ve found that the level of education, faculty and program is strong and expects graduate students to develop and apply their knowledge from day one. There are many opportunities for funding as well."
Freshman,4,"It feels homey; campus scenery, good people go there that I have met and can call friend. The professors that I have had are extremely helpful and want me to succeed."
Freshman,4,"Teachers are great, love the campus and town!! I have learned so much this first semester. The only think I would like to improve is the diversity on campus."
Freshman,4,"The University of Georgia has a commitment to excellence as the first institution of public higher education and a top 20 rated (public) university, and it shows. The academics are top-rated and the dining halls are note-worthy. The football team is also amazing, so school spirit and game days are memorable. However, some of the freshman dorms are in grave need of renovating."
Freshman,4,"I love everything. The student life, the sports, and all of the clubs make everything a very enjoyable experience for every student to walk onto this campus."
Junior,4,"The University of Georgia is an inspiring place, but being one student on a large campus can make you feel disconnected at times. I hope to see improvement in the community aspect here at the University as time passes. Also, infrastructure aspects like parking here are absolutely terrible. The University does not seem to be keeping up with their expansion & the needs of their students in this regard."
Niche User,4,"The people at the university are very helpful and resourceful, the campus is beautiful and student-friendly. There are millions of opportunities provided by UGA such as research experience, extracurricular activities and sports to choose from."
Niche User,4,Visiting Athens was very exciting and overwhelming as a potential student. Athens is a unique college town with lots of activities and social life. The academic style is rigorous making UGA a prestigious institution of the South. The one thing I would change about UGA would be more emphasis on transitioning freshmen on campus and educating students on ethnic diversity and acceptance.
Senior,2,"University of Georgia has a large diversity of students. However, many needs of minority students are often ignored. UGA is a football-party school. Priorities are going to students who are in the Greek life and business majors get the most say. The school had a very slow and poor execution of actions when it comes to social issues and injustice. The police department of UGA are also targeting minority students. Despite the huge population of students, there is a separation of diversities. Many programs and events are mainly targets towards certain groups of students. Money is being used to build/expand new dorms and the football stadium instead of funding academic departments that are suffering due to their low budget."
Alum,2,"This university is a good fit for those majoring in the humanities. However, the science department was terrible. For organic chemistry, the only resources provided were questions that did not help prepare for the exams. Many students failed and were not assisted. Professors in the biology and chemistry departments were often not helpful. I would not recommend UGA for premed students."
Senior,2,"The University of Georgia does not have a good history with online classes, and the university-wide switch to online classes during the recent pandemic was a horror show. The professors tend to assign a heavier amount of coursework to the students because they assume their students automatically have more time to study and complete the workload due to the course being online. Some professors use around 2-3 different websites to teach their online courses, which most students find confusing. It's not uncommon for some professors to simply drop off the radar for some time during online classes, appearing to expect students to keep themselves informed and taught. The university's website, Athena, that's used for registration for classes, checking class schedules, and paying student fess,  is constantly crashing. Many students find online classes inconvenient, difficult, stressful, confusing, and more trouble than they're worth."
Junior,2,"Most of the classes only cover what you could learn in random books, but they'll charge extortionate tuition fees and then have you still teach yourself. The faculty is underpaid and having to work at other institutions in town, while the top management makes loads of money. Tuition increases every year since we have a football team, and while that shouldn't increase prices in tuition, it does because we want to make our campus more recruit-friendly. Overall, over-priced for a sub-par value."
College Sophomore,2,Payne Hall needs to be either renovated or torn down. It is too old to be a living establishment and is disgusting.
College Junior,2,"The dorms suck. UGA is a high profile school, so they can get away with having crappy dorms. They are small, loud, and just overall annoying. The bathroom was impossible to clean. I tried everything to get the grim out of the shower to no avail. RA's are almost useless. Busses come by all night, making noise. Reed Hall is one of the better dorms, but I still definitely prefer off campus housing."
College Junior,2,"If you do not like sport, you will be very annoyed every football season. You can't drive anywhere, busses only go to the stadium, restaurants and bars are overcrowded, and it's REALLY loud. Luckily, there are only 6 home games a season, so it's bearable. If you don't go to games, you better be able to entertain yourself for the day because literally everyone you know will be at the game/tailgating."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I lived in Russell Hall my freshman year. Living in the high rise is extremely stuffy. The room is SO tiny! You better get along with your roommate because you are in each others' space ALL THE TIME. You also have to use community bathrooms, and you have to pay to do your laundry."
College Freshman,2,"this school doesn't promote major programs until you get into that major, currently I want to be a business major, but I have to wait till I get into terry to get any of my major's courses. it is just inconvenient"
College Freshman,2,It is bad because the regular students are penalized for the drunken actions of the few.
College Sophomore,2,Out-dated and crowded. I lived in Russell Hall and they had people living in study rooms.
Recent Alumnus,2,Very expensive for a tiny room.
College Junior,2,"I do not participate in Greek life, and have no interest in doing so."
College Junior,2,"It's not the worst, but hey its your freshman year. You'll survive. Get used to sharing a lot of personal space. However, it is college and its absolutely what you make of it. If you are social and enjoy meeting new people, pick a high rise. Creswell (the best), Russell (close second) and Brumby (crumby and definitely the worst option). 

If you want to veg out and study most of the day, something like Boggs or O-House may be more of your speed!"
College Junior,2,Do not take into account that there are several other children in family who are in college.  Tried to take out private loan to help pay for expenses and would not approve amount needed.
College Freshman,2,With their tuition prices going up all the time it's hard for me and my family to afford this school at times because even though I have the Zell Miller Scholarship the rest of the fees cost so much.
College Freshman,2,The administrators are extremely lenient because it's a party school.
College Freshman,2,"The sanity of my dormitory was awful. That said, it was a social and friendly environment."
College Freshman,2,"Nobody wants to mess with financial aid, the process will always suck."
College Freshman,2,"I live in Brumby. The community is great but the rooms are very small, and you can't control your own air conditioning. The bathrooms are community, thus pretty nasty. It is pretty cheap though. Housing process was reletively easy. Brumby is not very close to alot of classes. There is a big hill to walk up to Brumby."
College Freshman,2,The RA is not very involved or attentive. I don't feel that the residential community is a community at all.
College Junior,2,If you are a non-traditional student there aren't many options for aid.
College Freshman,2,"It's rare for a non-Greek to hang out with a Greek, even though a lot of Greeks admit they prefer their non-Greek friends. Being Greek is like being trapped in a cult that no one actually wants to be in."
College Senior,2,Greek life is extremely annoying at our school. Greeks tend to be snobbish and privileged. The girls in particular are pretty awful.
College Freshman,2,The dorms need to be updated. They are old and small for the price paid.
College Sophomore,2,"Yes, partying is a part of college life, and I have been out twice in two years at the University of Georgia. However, if it becomes overly obsessive to an extent where the school is known for its parties, it can have a negative impact on student experience. At UGA, the parties usually take place on Thursdays as many students go out, and most commonly to downtown Athens."
College Freshman,2,"the dorms are really old. UGA, PLEASE build some new ones"
College Freshman,2,"The high rises are too old and are falling apart. The housing priority system is faulty. I was supposed to have a higher priority than others, but was put into a dorm that was not one of my top choices."
College Freshman,2,It is not strick at all with the exception of tickets
College Sophomore,2,"Probably one of my only complaints about UGA...I came from a really diverse high school and UGA is definitely not up to par. However, I also don't think that diversity should be forced...college applications should be based on academics and activities, not race, in my opinion. Panhellenic Greek Life is also extremely non diverse (simply because the majority who rush are white upper middle class), so it is possible that UGA is more diverse than it appears to me."
College Junior,2,Athenes is in the middle of nowhere!
College Junior,2,"Athens is in the middle of nowhere in UGA's defense. Most places are only driving distance, really far!"
College Junior,2,"Compared to my first institution, Georgia State University, there is barely any diversity. Every religious, ethnic/race, sexual orientation, etc is represented I think, but definitely not in large numbers."
College Senior,2,There are a several break ins that happen every semester.
College Sophomore,2,"I personally feel Athens, outside of the UGA perimeter, is just another world. There is a reason so many student organizations don't go far in order to try and make a difference in a community"". The reason is that our locals need help! Literally, you see government housing across the street from dorms and other facilites. Parked down the local streets, are student cars whose expensive monthly payments could pay the cost of living for a local's home. I had a conversation with a 10th grade local girl when i was volunteering at a local high school and she said ""you spend all your life here, knowing that you'll never make it across the street"""
College Sophomore,2,"When it comes to financial aid, I feel that the process is something that only gets easier the more times you do it. The reason why I say it's bad is because I have only gone through the full process once and it was extremely hectic. This year is take two, and it's already begining a bit shakily so I'm a bit wary of the process. Also, I feel that attaining financial aid in the form of university-wide scholarships, is really difficult if you aren't a STEM major!"
College Sophomore,2,There are so many bars right near our school they just cant keep up with everyone. I think they do a good job keeping it out of dorms but thats about it
Recent Alumnus,2,"As a vegetarian, there are not enough choices offered."
College Junior,2,pass assignment system is very unfair
College Sophomore,2,I always have to get my FAFSA verified and don't get my aid until the very last minute.
College Freshman,2,You hve to have a permit to park pretty much anywhere during the day on campus. In most places weekends are free but otherwise you have to pay to park in a deck.
College Freshman,2,"When people have free time on the weekends or just during the week, they go downtown to the many bars that are in athens. ""Dt"" is a common vocab term for people that partake in this. Alcohol is pretty accessible."
College Freshman,2,The biggest stress of college
College Junior,2,"The school need to do something to control the use of drug better. Students, being away from home and under peer pressures, can easily get access to drugs without being caught."
College Junior,2,The workload is bad especially if you take online classes. They pack on the assignments.
College Junior,2,It's a lot of busy work! It will consume your life.
College Junior,2,It is good to network but there are so many sexual crimes toward female students
College Senior,2,Nothing to eat and the price is overpriced.
College Senior,2,"Although I was qualified for additional scholarship, I couldn't get it, just because of my credits (above credit limit).  It was really unlucky for me."
College Freshman,2,It was a difficult process but it all worked out in the end.
Recent Alumnus,2,There isn't that big of a drug scene in Athens. Plenty of people get healthy and make good choices.
College Sophomore,2,Rainy weather/ bad weather in general means more people trying to cram onto an overpacked bus.   This can make you late for class if you have to wait for another one.
College Junior,2,There is a seriously lack of all kinds of diversity on campus.
College Freshman,2,"It's pretty bad. They are ridiculously high prices (higher than some beautiful off-campus apartment complexes), and are half as nice/spacious. They are not very clean, but I guess that's what one would expect as a freshman. I would definitely not live on campus my later years, besides ECV, which are the best dorms on campus, but the ability of getting in there is slim. The environment of the dorms is nice though, it's nice to meet other people so easily."
College Freshman,2,"The on-sight police don't do s***. They don't care about anything, as long as they get paid. The only university authority you really see at anytime you shouldn't be doing something you're doing are the people at the dorm desks, who could not care less about what you do, as long as you flash them your UGA ID. Policy says you can't have any non-residents in past 2am on Sun-Thurs, but I've seen plenty of people get passed considering the people at the desks are around your age and really don't care to stop you besides yelling. If you have someone in and it ends up past 2, you're totally in the clear because it's not like they search rooms. Also, drinking in the dorms is unbelievably easy if you have the right RA (a chill one), and if you keep it low-key. Don't be blasting music with the door open and shot glasses out. The only police you have to worry about are the UGA police/Athens-Clarke county police downtown. If you're at all obviously drunk downtown, (such as j-walking across a 4 foot road), you're in deep shit. Same thing as dorms, keep it low-key and you're good."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is probably awesome if you are Greek, but being one with no involvement with it, I dislike it. The frat guys and sorority girls alike come off as narcissistic, conceited, and self-centered. They are arrogant and act like anyone not Greek is unimportant, when in reality they are the ones who paid to make friends. The Greek houses seem nice and if you do join a nice frat and make good friends, that's awesome, but most of them are just assholes/bitches who only care about their fake relationships with their brothers/sisters."
College Senior,2,"Parking on campus is expensive and spots are limited. Applying for a parking pass is a hassle and very expensive. Parking off campus is cheaper, but cannot get you close to campus (you'll still have a 15-20 minute walk to class, generally). Parking fines are expensive too- more expensive than the city of Athens parking fines."
College Senior,2,"Campus buses are generally late and are known to be involved in several accidents throughout the school year. Drivers are usually students who will not even wait .5 seconds for someone who is obviously running to catch their bus (then that person is stuck to wait for the next bus which will arrive 20 minutes later and probably late). The drivers that aren't students are the only nice ones! If you don't live on-campus or downtown, the bus system won't work for you. You'll have to drive to campus or drive to a campus bus stop."
College Sophomore,2,"Not a very diverse campus, and I would not want to go here if I was black. UGA is getting a lot better about this, but still racism persists."
College Sophomore,2,"I mentioned this a few sections ago, but the police suck so much ass its unbelievable. For some absolutely inexplicable reason, the University's campus is surrounded by public housing. There is a massive complex right next to the Freshmen dorms. These housing areas are known incubators of drugs and violent crime, yet there they are, and you rarely see policemen in these dangerous areas. There are no blue lights to press on campus. The cops could give a s*** if you get mugged. They want money for their department, and the easy way to accomplish this is to hand out copious liquor licences and then rampantly arrest the students. For example, I know one person who parked his car on a side street near downtown. Turns out his car was broken into, and his laptop and several books were stollen. He had a six pack in his back seat though, so when he came back a cop was waiting for him, charged with underage possession, and took him to jail. The robbery was never followed up on. 

Whenever someone gets severely injured on campus by an assailant, the cops send out some bullshit email doing this whole victim blame thing about how you shouldn't walk alone, wear skimpy clothes, or drink alcohol, so it makes seem as though they are not going to change their ways.

All in all, the immediate campus of UGA may be safe, but the surrounding areas where students live absolutely are not. The cops are awful and counter to everyones safety."
Alum,1,"Did not take any online classes at the university, only in person classes as upper level science classes are not offered online and none of the other classes I planned to take for my majors had online classes."
Niche User,1,"I did not like the University of Georgia for many reasons. Its a very expensive school for what you get in return. The campus is lackluster with the exception of North Campus. All the buildings are outdated, from the 1960s-80s and desperately need rennovation. The dorms are just terrible, very very low quality compared to price, dorms at other institutions are insanely better. The only way to get a nice dorm is to be an athlete (who are treated like kings) or rich. The dining halls are decent at first but once you have it over and over again, you will realize it is subpar. My girlfriend went to KSU and after eating their dining hall food, I realized UGA could be doing a lot better. Lastly, the student life isnt that great they dont have as many events for students as other colleges did. I always saw my friends colleges having awesome events, but UGA rarely had anything close."
Freshman,1,"It's only a good school if you're an athlete or a socialite. Nothing matters here except football. The academics are terrible and so are the facilities unless you're a business major. No one tells you any pertinent information about your degree or class registration, so you have to figure everything out yourself- which can be difficult when you're a first year. Honestly, don't come here if you're looking to have stimulating classes or a degree that you actually had to work for."
Niche User,1,"Completely over rated for how difficult it is to get in.  Grades more dependent on getting the ""easy"" professor.  Research focus = professors who can't or aren't interested in teaching.  There are better options.  Find a school that will value you, not your wallet."
Freshman,1,Most people here are more concerned about partying and football than about education. The school is too big to make any real connections.
College Sophomore,1,"If you have been sexually assaulted, UGA will side with your attacker over fear of your attacker suing them. unfortunate."
College Sophomore,1,Housing is aweful and a difficult department to deal with. they are very crooked and will not resolve conflict.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Greek life is irritating to me. I can see how great it is for making connections for the future, and I love the philanthropy they do for the community. However, I hate to see people lose their sense of individuality in order to belong to a group!"
College Freshman,1,Don't live in freshman dorms unless you have to
College Freshman,1,"It's either Hope or Zell. UGA is horrible at giving scholarships to its students. Do not get wrong I did receive a scholarship from UGA, however most students were not as lucky. They could definitely do better in this area"
College Freshman,1,This school gives out NO money
College Senior,1,I wish we have plenty of free parking spot on the campus.
College Senior,1,R1 Institue = professors only care about their research
College Freshman,1,The weather is all over the place in Georgia.  When it is hot walking around campus is not fun.
College Senior,1,"The financial office will always have you on hold (once I was on hold for 35 minutes before finally hanging up), never answer the phone, and will take at least 5 days to respond to any email you send. You almost have to go in their office to get anything out of them, and even then it's not a guarantee."
College Sophomore,1,"UGA doesn't have a whole lot of internship programs that they offer.  Sometimes you can receive class credit from an internship, but that involves a lot of work on the student's part to get permission of the department for it to count as academic credit, and you have to go out and find those opportunities."
College Freshman,1,"Honestly, it's snowing white people up in here. We need diversity. Bad. "
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is overwhelming.  Though they do some have some great philanthropies, i've found most of them to be really cliquey.  They all dress the same and the stereotypes are very true here. "
College Junior,1,I can only speak for my program and there is not a lot of diversity. My program is made up of primarily white women. There are very few women of other races and even fewer men.
College Sophomore,1,"You literally can get drugs anywhere if you want. It's ridiculous, underage drinking at UGA is one of the biggest problems because it is so easy to gain access to liquor. Also, recreational drugs are common but for some reason aren't as addressed as alcohol use; however that is eventually going to have to change because so many students are experimenting with cocaine, marijuana, and other harmful substances. If there is one thing UGA  has to try to fix is the ease of accessibility to drugs students here have."
College Freshman,1,Scholarships other then HOPE and Zel Miller were few and hard to get.
College Sophomore,1,"way too strict, especially in dorms. given I probably got the worst of it living in brumby, it was still pretty strict."
College Sophomore,1,Parking tickets are very expensive but so are parking passes! It's definitely a nightmare. The worst part is when you apply for a lot you really need and never get approved for it.
College Sophomore,1,"Not a lot of parking spaces around campus, make sure to get to campus at least 30 minutes early if you want to secure a spot."
College Junior,1,Parking at UGA is very expensive and very limited.  We do have on campus transit with our UGA bus system but I suggest getting to that bus stop early because they fill up very quickly. I find that using my car to travel around campus takes less time but you are only able to park where you have an assigned permit.
College Freshman,1,"Even though the stats show that the majority of people aren't in frats or sororities, they have a strong presence on campus. Most of them are just excuses to party. Greek life is kind of looked down upon by non-Greeks because it's viewed as a way of buying your friends and are mostly made up of typical white southerners. But since both of these types of people rarely associate with each other, it's not that big of a deal."
College Freshman,1,It's unfortunate that UGA makes all first year students live on campus in the dorms. You don't get to choose who your hall mates are and they can be very loud and annoying. They are usually disruptive during quiet hours and RA's don't really do anything.
College Sophomore,1,never got any financial aid; had to take out private loans
College Junior,1,Parking services are horrible people and should not exists.
College Sophomore,1,"As a Journalism major at UGA, the availability and selection of scholarships are slim. The money offered rom them are low also. I haven't seen one at $1000. Financial aid works with you though, so visit them as often as necessary. What is frustrating to me, however, is that they use your loans first and then use scholarship money - you can see which  funds they pull from for tuition and fees in your student account profile."
College Freshman,1,"I was not shocked to see that UGA was mostly white because I knew that coming in however, I was really hurt to see that everyone pretty much sticks to their own. So, in my opinion if you are a minority coming here looking for acceptance look elsewhere."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Permits are SO expensive and they are SUPER strict. I had a car on campus, not because I needed one to get around campus, but because it's a little intimidating to ride a bike around Athens if you're not used to it. I also lived far from campus, but once I was on campus, you can get anywhere within 15 minutes by either taking a bus or walking."
College Junior,1,White Majority – There are many people of different races however the number is low. Also they are not represented fairly amongst the student body.
College Sophomore,1,"Do Not Bring a Car – The University of Georgia does not allow students to park on campus during the school hours and parking is very limited when available. You will be better off just walking, taking a bike, or using the shuttle system to get around on campus."
College Sophomore,1,"While Greek Life at UGA can likely be a great experience for someone born and raised in Georgia, it is not very welcoming for students from other parts of the country.  Basically, for guys, if you do not live close enough to Athens to hang out with the frats over the summer, you miss out on a lot of bonding and learning about which Frat might be the best fit for you.  When you arrive in the fall, many of the Frats already know who they want and those guys are almost always from Georgia.  The problem really seems to lie in the fact that rush is done in the fall.  I think it would help with diversity if rush was held in the spring only.  That way you could get to know the Frats and they could get to know you over the fall.  The couple of fraternities who seem to be open to out of staters are pretty weak.  One of them is currently on suspension, really out of control, and probably headed for being kicked off campus at least for a few years.  So, for those non-Georgian guys, I say, find another way to connect to a community.  There are lots of other groups and clubs to join that will be less exclusive and you will meet a more diverse group of other students."
College Freshman,1,"Party College – Because of the proximity of the downtown athens scene and the university, drinking and drug use is a major problem especially on weekends although most of the viewable use is limited to the downtown area and geek houses."
College Freshman,1,Even Appearing Like You're Cheating Will Get You in Trouble – I had a student tell on me for cheating last semester which is only what he thought he saw. I looked at my cell phone but the kid was just an ass hole. I was also arrested by campus police for having a fake id sooo watch your butt.
College Freshman,1,"Very Frustrating. I went to the financial department and all the scholarships do not apply to me since I am not African American, Hispanic, or a pregnant mother. It's very frustrating and difficult to learn of scholarships, and this school is pretty expensive. My advice is to really look into financial aid for yourself."
College Sophomore,1,"Watch Out for the Popo's – The main area of strictness are the police. They are extremely strict in the downtown area. Over half of my friends have either had an encounter with the police or been arrested in Athens, so its definitely scary sometimes. Its frustrating as well because sometimes the punishments are way too severe, but then sometimes kids get off that should have been arrested. 
But in the school setting, I guess Ive never really had to deal with certain rules so Id say the University itself is pretty laid back, but well organized."
College Sophomore,1,Classic South – Very southern influence- white and black...with a handful of international students.

Sophomore,5,"My online learning was a great experience, because I had teachers who cared, and wanted me to succeeded. They were available when I needed them. I could use there help outside of school hours."
Sophomore,5,"LOC as we call it, is by far he greatest experience I have had in school. I've learned so much about my black culture, and my people that I have a new feel of myself, and I will always speak positive about my HBCU. It was by far one of the greatest choices I made in my life."
Freshman,5,"Great Historically Black College located in Memphis, Tennessee. I Would recommend this institution to everyone. There are recently  added new dorms that are really nice."
Junior,5,Let me start with saying that I have been going to LeMoyne for a very long time. I went to the High School that was located on the campus. I was prepped to take college classes in High School and I must say that was a great experience. When I transitioned to LeMoyne I was already a first semester sophmore which was also pretty great. My first semester of being at LeMoyne I was inducted into the STEM program which was also pretty awesome. I did not stay on campus the first semester because it was my first year of college. But I moved on campus the next semester and it was pretty cool and I had a lot of fun and the food was pretty good.
Freshman,5,I have not been going to lemoyne school but i feel that every student and staff are more like family rather than students and teachers i get  a more one on one experience with my professors
Freshman,5,"My experience at Lemoyne-Owen has been a great experience. The whole HBCU thing is amazing, learning the history of my school was fascinating,"
Freshman,5,I Like The Diversity And Academics At Lemoyne-Owen. I Love How Professor Actually Take Time To Work With Students.
Senior,5,"I am overjoyed about my experience at LOC . From the time I enrolled into LeMoyne-Owen College has been great. People say I'm a walking billboard for the school, because I always have some apparel with LOC on it. I love my school, it has molded me to become a better woman in today's society.  From school organizations to school sports has been a joy"
Senior,5,Students who share the same major learn from one another. The classrooms are small depending on the major. Ratio is 20:1 . Professors try their upmost to make you succeed. Students on campus have chances every week to join in campus events. I am so glad that security has been upgraded. They are in their own security trucks and they drive around the whole campus and on the lots. There are security guards on foot now also.  I was a little surprised that LOC was named the top ten most affordable school in the U.S. especially being a private school.
Senior,5,I love that the class size is small. It's easy to get to class. The Professors are very helpful. I would love to see the college allow other organizations to be on campus. Give the students a choice of what they want to be a part of.
College Student,5,I love everything about this college. There is nothing to dislike.
College Sophomore,5,The one thing that makes LeMoyne Owen College so unique is it being an HBCU. The school is history itself. There are also historical spots surrounding the college.

College Sophomore,5,My major is Criminal Justice. I love the professors and the programs they have setup in that field. I have not had an internship yet but i have spoken with people who have already done their internship and they say that they get good interships.
College Junior,5,The unique aspects of being in the Early Childhood Education program is that it includes teacher/assistant internships in order to train you on sharpening your skills and preparing you for the career world. They also have workshops to help you for your board test in order to be licensed. All of my professors and counselors have many years of experience teaching. They break down their curriculum and take the time out of their schedule to give you the extra help you need.
College Freshman,5,"LeMoyne-Owen is the perfect college. It's a rather small HBCU, all the professors and administrators are nice and welcoming. It's like a big family. The facilities are nice and everyone from the faculty to the students are willing to help."

Niche User,4,I have been living in Memphis for 21 years. I know almost everything about this nice college. Two former Memphis mayors are alumni of the college.  Best college among HBCU. I have seen falling high school students whose life were totally changed after receiving their bachelor degree from LeMoyne-owen college. Education is the  Best investment for your money.
Freshman,4,It's an HBCU college dedicated to educating students. This is a college where people learn to be independent and successful. People are helpful. The teachers are not difficult. My professors call me by my name instead of a number. It is better because i have one on one support. It is a small college. There are a lot of scholarship opportunities.
Freshman,4,I like this school. Its close to my mom. I can get to where i need to go if needed. Its different but i like the change. Its helping me become a better student and person over all.
Senior,4,They offer amazing opportunities for students but a lot of students aren’t aware of these opportunities.
Sophomore,4,Lemoyne Owen is a very good college to is because you have a lot help on people showing you around the campus on each individual building to go to everybody is friendly so I say lemoyne is a good college to get your education and campus safety it is good but also need on improving things but every thing else is fine to so really nothing to complain about LOC I like and I hope that the upcoming freshman this year like it to.

College Senior,4,The city that my school is located in is a very diverse city. It displayes all origins and ethnicities. Everyone is freindly and doesn't mind giving a helping hand.
College Sophomore,4,"The diverse is great because even though it's an HBCU there's still diversity within the African-American students. We have students that are black that came from other countries such as the Bahamas, Africa, etc. Now we have Caucasian or white students that's attending our school now and it's good to see some diversity because that's what I'm used to back at home."
College Sophomore,4,"I am happy with the biology program at The Lemoyne Owen College. It is very challenging, on the other hand it can be done. I would do it all over again just so I can fly right through the program without any problems. My career goal is to become a Pediatric Nurse."
College Freshman,4,"LeMoyne-Owen is a HBC school. We have mostly African Americans that attend the college. I have seen many different religions like Muslims, Christians, Catholic, and more. It is very easy to get along with my peers on campus.The acceptance rates are scorching high, it is almost impossible to not get accepted into LOC."
College Sophomore,4,I chose to go to LeMoyne Owen College because I love its Mission. Professors are always there to help you. Some even goes out their way to assist you. I love going to classes because everything is broken down piece by piece.
College Sophomore,2,"Our college institution gains more and more students every year.  With that being stated, the classrooms, dormitories, and the overall activity around the campus has become heavily populated and over crowded.  Also, the security, organizations, and the attentiveness of the college's faculty and leadership are not catering to the student's needs."
College Freshman,2,This area is a good area except most people look at it as a bad area
College Freshman,2,Could Use Work – The dorms are a little run down. They could definately use some work. The carpet is stained and the walls look a little beat up.
College Freshman,2,It's So-So – The Greek scene is pretty low-key. At an HBCU I expected more people to be Greek. The good thing is the few Greeks that are there are easy to talk to and are willing to tell you about their organization.
College Freshman,1,If you don't have a car to get off campus you will live in boredom.

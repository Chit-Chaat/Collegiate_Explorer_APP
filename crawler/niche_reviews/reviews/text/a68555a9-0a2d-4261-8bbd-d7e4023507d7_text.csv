Freshman,5,University of Arkansas at Monticello has been great to me so far. I love all of my professors so far. They are very kind and caring. I live in campus and that's my absolute favorite about this campus because the dorms are clean and huge. I feel like I'm at home. I will be trying out for cheer for my sophomore year and the cheer coach is so sweet. There are so many majors and opportunities at UAM. There are so many different routes to go and you have so many people helping you along the way.
Freshman,5,I have had wonderful professors and instruction. Staff in all offices have been extremely patient and helpful. I can't wait to earn my degree here!
Graduate Student,5,"I like the fact that school is small but has competitive class and research in Forestry, Wildlife and Agriculture. The place is safe than other school."
Alum,5,I played volleyball at UAM and enjoyed the people and the small town! Most people there are genuinely nice.
Junior,5,"Small quiet and safe campus, Having attended bigger schools in the past the first thing I noticed about UAM is how the small town community feeling transitions from the local area to the campus. Being a commuter student at this point parking is not nearly as bad here as I've seen on other campuses."
Niche User,5,Every year in high school i would come to this College to experience all type of learning in the medical field.
Niche User,5,the university of arkansas at monticello  as an execlent class and great staff. the staff here will help you in every way . also they have great toudring place and tours of the shool is the best. they make you fell at home.
Niche User,5,Monticello is a brilliant place full of life. Adventure all around and endless things to do with friends.
Sophomore,5,The University of Arkansas at Monticello provides an amazing experience. The academic counselors who work hand and hand with you to help guide you into the future. The professors are very knowledgeable and welcoming. I recommend this school to anyone looking to experience a great campus. The school is also great for those who need a more flexible schedule because it offers a full online bachelors degree.
Freshman,5,"I love UAM , it feels quite like home , but it’s a chance to let new people into my life ! It’s a chance to find myself while still being reminded who I am and where I came from ! Go Weevils !!"
Sophomore,5,What I like about UAM is that you can make plenty of friends in a short time. It is small but fits just right when you get use to it. Athletics are good at UAM and it a lot of things you can do after class.
Sophomore,5,I like how thorough the school is and the professors are good. The advisors listen to what you have to say and work around everything accordingly. The classes aren't too hard but you learn a great deal of information with each class.
Niche User,5,"My experience when I went to the visit the University of Arkansas at Monticello, I felt right at home they treated me with so much respect. I would love to continue my path at this college."
Freshman,5,It is my first semester of online classes and so far everyone has been very helpful and it is going great.
Alum,5,I believe UAM is going to become better since I graduated. They are working on renovating the dorms and creating more resources for students. The main problem I had was not enough help with courses when needed.
Freshman,5,"I have really fallen in love with the University of Arkansas at Monticello (UAM). I really, really, really enjoy how the instructors engage with there students."
Junior,5,"The teachers care about you and want you to graduate. They get to know you by name and try to help in anyway that they can. The campus is beautiful, the student activities are fun and just the way that everyone is so accepting. It is a small town as well."
Sophomore,5,"I haven't had any problems with ""horrible"" professors and staff is pretty nice. It's really peaceful and quiet!"
Niche User,5,I am a distance learner and I am thankful for the opportunity to complete my college degree ad a fair price with a good college.
Sophomore,5,University of Arkansas at Monticello is an awesome school to go! The staff is great and very friendly. All the faculty is so willing to help others when needed. They make you feel so at home!
Freshman,5,"This college is a great college to attend , the people there are willing to help you success , but we need more places to study ,"
Sophomore,5,The only thing I would like to see change at the University of Arkansas at Monticello is more campus food options instead of just cafeteria food Java City (sandwich and coffee shop combined) so people don't have to drive so much to get other food varieties. More campus apartments since there aren't many food options and it'd better living space. Other than that UAM is a good school that host many different culture activities so that everyone can get a good vibe and home feel while there.
Freshman,5,My experience as a student here has been wonderful. The teachers here really do care about the students and want each and every student to be successful .
Niche User,5,UAM has a very welcoming campus and student body. The classes are small and the professors connect with students on a personal level.
Sophomore,5,"My overall experience at the University of Arkansas at Monticello has been great these last two years. I have enjoyed the teachers that teach in the field that I am majoring in. I have met new people in all of the new classes I have to take for my major and they have all the same hobbies and goals in life as I do. The classes that I do take are very interesting and keep me wide awake. Our men's basketball the Weevils, are (20-4), and have just two more games left to decide if they win the GAC conference. The campus life is small and makes it feel like home if you are from a small city."
Niche User,5,"I have not yet started college here, but I have visited this college. The scenery around the college is beautiful. All the buildings have such abstract architectures. Inside the buildings the staff and students are helpful and friendly. I have heard that the food there is good , yet I have never been able to try it. In UAM there is a variety of diversity. You see many, Caucasians, African Americans, Hispanics, Asians and more. Everyone I saw had a different race walking to classes with them which is great! The dorms are very clean and neat according to who stays in them. Monticello is ""a great place to raise a family"". Many restaurants and jobs are available for college students in the Monticello area. They have a campus cop who patrols the whole area. He does his job accordingly by helping students who are endangering themselves and others. Overall, this school would be great!!!!!!"
College Freshman,5,"the class sizes are normally pretty small. during your freshman year there might be a few large classes, but other than that they're not big. almost all of the teachers enjoy what they are teaching and are good at explaining concepts to you. even if you need extra explaining the teachers are happy to summarize it again."
College Sophomore,5,I was able to transfer all my credits. The application process was easy. Moving in was pretty easy. A small campus makes it easy to get to class on time. Professors make class fun.
College Sophomore,5,"Courses were manageable and professors always welcomed questions and had great office hours. I feel that I learned a lot in every class I took, even classes that didn't apply to my major. Professors are strict but also very understanding. There aren't many languages offered or a lot of electives, but we do have a few. Sometimes they're only offered in one semester or at odd times. Class sizes at the beginning of the semester ranges anywhere between 15 to 60 students. I feel that this gives the opportunity for more individual attention."
College Sophomore,5,"At my school many science majors double major in biology and bio-chemistry, which makes up look better than just having one major, especially since it's only a few more classes. Professors are there for you and they truly care about your success. For my first year the workload wasn't insane but it as time consuming."
College Sophomore,5,"The school has small classes, which allows professors to get to know students easily. All my professors know my name and major. The school provides many opportunities to for competition."
College Sophomore,5,They offer most classes multiple times therefore allowing you to choose that class so it fits best into your schedule. It gives you the ability to take most of the classes you need/want without stressing over it.
College Sophomore,5,The alumni is always looking for graduates to hire where they work
College Sophomore,5,Al of my professors over the past year and a half have been great. They all try and help you the best they can. There are tons of courses offered the choices are endless. The classes are between 20 and 50 people so it's very easy to pay attention and also the professors usually know everyone's name!
College Sophomore,5,There are always job application and intern applications in the front offices. My advisor is always contacting me about internships and future job opportunities. Many of the ag alumni come back and give speeches to students and for me this helps me get an idea of what I would like to do.
College Sophomore,5,"I plan on getting a degree in general agriculture along with minors in ag business, plant and soil science, and animal science. My advisor is always looking for internship opportunities for me. He also helps me in figuring out where I would like to work and what I'd like to do."
College Sophomore,5,All of the staff are extremely friendly and willing to help any student any way they can!
College Sophomore,5,The teachers really know a lot about Music Education
College Sophomore,5,"Everything is super convenient. If there aren't night classes, there are plenty of online classes that you can work your schedule with."
College Sophomore,5,"I love everything about UAM. Most of all, I like that it feels a lot like home to me: small town, lots of trees, cows, and flatland as far as you can see. I would definitely choose UAM if I had to choose all over again because of the great experience I've had with the staff and students. They are wonderful people and are great at all they do."
College Sophomore,5,The professors at UAM are easy to get ahold and provide and a valuable education and life skills. The courses are always educational and fun! The class sizes are small for the most part which provides for better learning environment in my opinion.
College Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the college experience here at UAM. The recruiters are always really pumped about getting students to come!
College Sophomore,5,"I definitely think that the education I'm receiving is worth the tuition. I personal would attend even if the tuition had been higher. UAM is one of, if not the, cheapest 4-year university in the state, and the value of the education received is top of the line. For the most part, the financial aid office is easy to access, there's just this one lady that is always really rude. Doing well in high school helped me out a lot with financial aid. Also continuing to get good grades while attending the university makes it a lot easier."
College Sophomore,5,"Other than the campus website, every possible thing you might could say good about you can say so about UAM. The professors are top notch. There is always study groups/sessions available and also workshops for things like note-taking or studying."
College Sophomore,5,Known as the Boil Weevil
College Sophomore,5,Very helpful and willing to reach out to students
College Sophomore,5,Lots of stuff to do on campus and very interactive
College Sophomore,5,"I love my major and I have recently joined an organization within my major to become not only more involved on campus, but to also get the feel of what I will be doing with my life. I have been very busy with school and trying to make sure that everything in class stays well. I always have to study but I know that it wil all be worth it in the end."
College Freshman,5,"My advisor will be my teacher for like 5 more classes that I need and he is so passionate for the subjects that his classes are not boring at all.

The school has a reputation for getting manny students into medical school with flying colors. The teachers really push you and give you encouragement. Most of them make their class very fun."
College Student,5,The academics at my school are outstanding. The professors and the curriculum are great.
College Sophomore,5,All of these areas are fine.
College Freshman,5,The tuition is a great price and the financial aid is very good as well.
College Freshman,5,Every question I have had about any career field I have been given an adequate amount of information and even new things about that field.
College Sophomore,5,I love online classes! I like being independent and not having to work at the same pace as other students. 
College Sophomore,5,"It is very diverse and from where I stand, everyone is accepted as their own unique person."
College Junior,5,"They are wonderful, and have helped me out tremendously with my current resume. Since I already have a Bachelor's degree, they are using that to help me find work while I go to school for my nursing major. I still have not found a job, but it is still nice to know that the support is there when I need it."
College Junior,5,"I have been to 3 different colleges, and this one seems to have their stuff together. I have not had to pick up the phone, or send an email to the financial aid office to determine where my financial aid was. This is awesome in my book. The less time that I have to bother them gives them more time to work on other stuff. This was not the case at my other two colleges, as I was constantly on the phone or sending emails to the financial aid office."
Sophomore,4,"They have made it very affordable to get my bachelors online while working full time. Even though I have been attending classes online, I am always able to get help or resources through my academic/financial aid advisors."
Senior,4,"UAM is a very down to earth college, its campus is spread out and not to large, for those worried about being stuck in a place with thousands of other students this is a good deal, its a smaller campus that feels very communal and the teachers there are all wonderful, my teachers in particular helped me create my resume and apply for jobs."
Junior,4,"I attended UAM for three years and a half. It was an amazing experience because you have some faculty members who actually want to see you succeed. You were assigned advisors to help guide you in your major and mine was a big help. There was a lot of extracurricular activities that you could do as well. When I attended my freshman year, it was honestly my best year because everything was so fresh to me. If you put your mind to anything at the school, I'm sure you will succeed. I plan to come back to UAM after I get my associates degree."
Senior,4,"Overall, great college. There are some things that need help, like with organization and communication, but other than that, great."
Junior,4,"It’s a good college for the most part. You’ll make a lot of friends, however the campus life/party scene are almost non existent which sucks."
Freshman,4,What my experience has been at this college so far has been wonderful. Everyone has been so friendly and helpful towards me. The teachers are also helpful and they make it easier to understand the lectures.
Junior,4,"I'm a part of the eversity online program and the only complaint is that I am unable to pursue a minor with my degree. I have a lot of problems paying on their website and usually just have to call the cashier. Other than that, it's a great program"
Freshman,4,The overall experience here is good I've gain more knowledge in the academics than I did throughout high school.
Freshman,4,I like the coffee shop and that getting a Chick fa lay on campus. There is a nice library with extra study rooms. Most teachers seem to care about the students.
Freshman,4,University of Arkansas at Monticello is a nice small town college. They are filled with many activities for the student body to engage in. I’ve enjoyed being able to use the newest and latest resources that the university has to offer. The professors are all very nice and willing to help you in any way possible and want to see the very best in you.
Freshman,4,"When I visited the University of Arkansas at Monticello , I liked the fact that the staff had an good attitude and was willing to work with you . They are in need of more programs ."
Junior,4,The staff I came in contact with were all very nice and did their best to help you not just pass the class but understand the material.
Junior,4,"UAM is a wonderful school with a lot of one on one time with all of your professors. I am an organismal biology major and the amount of effort and passion that my professors put into teaching is what keeps me at this university. UAM is cheap, yes, but it has a really high success rate for their undergraduates getting into Med, Pharmacy, and Vet school. This university has a lot of opportunities and is very affordable."
Sophomore,4,"I love most of the professors I had or have, they are very straight forward and helpful. The campus is very functional for the most part, except the cafeteria is on the opposite side of the campus for some dorms. The library is very quiet and functional for individuals  or groups to study. The Babin Business building really need to be remodeled and updated with an elevator."
College Freshman,4,"You'll find at most colleges that teachers don't care whether you show up or not. at UAM its pretty much the same way. every once in a while youll find a teacher who really cares if your there, but the rest of them are pretty chill and understandable about obligations."
College Freshman,4,I took an online art class and it was only 15 quizes with no end of course test and the teacher opened all of the tests up at the same time so i finished the entire semester class in just two weeks.
College Freshman,4,The teachers here do a great job of talking around to people and seeing if they have job opening for students who are about to graduate. nearly everyone who graduates gets a job not long after.
College Freshman,4,"If your going here for an ag or science degree then yes its good because the school is known for those things, but for any other degree its not as known. But the last american idol winner did come from here so thats a plus lol."
College Freshman,4,"I'm a pre-vet major and for the most part everything about it is great. the vet/animal science teacher, Dr. Cater, is amazing and very helpful and friendly. the ag department is really the only reason why ive decided to stay at this school. everyone in the department is awesome and fun to be around. the only negative things i could say is theres no parking around the building so you have to walk. also, the school is actually suppose to be centered around the ag program since it was previous called Arkansas A&M, but because of recent faculty members who are higher up in the food chain the ag department has kind of been pushed to the side so that the school could focus more on sports, which honestly in my opinion is stupid since a very small percentage of all college players ever make it past the college level, and the school's wasting their time on that rather than on the people who want real jobs that do stuff like feed the world."
College Sophomore,4,I actually havent got that far yet
College Sophomore,4,Many students who recently graduated earned music education degrees and quickly found jobs in Arkansas.
College Freshman,4,I had wonderful professors this year
College Sophomore,4,With the online classes they allow you to work around you other classes allowing you to manage your time better. Most of the professors who teach online courses also teach classes on campus therefore if you need to talk to them in person you can.
College Sophomore,4,They really like to help students.
College Freshman,4,College has been great so far the teachers are great and the campus is even better
College Sophomore,4,"At UAM, the student body communicates and gets a long fairly well. We all have a variety of people we know and consider friends. The music majors associate with the chemistry majors and so on and so forth."
College Sophomore,4,"There is always something to do on campus, it's just up to the students to go out and participate. I love it t UAM."
College Freshman,4,people are very nice. everyone gets along with each other
College Sophomore,4,Class rooms are not to large and mean more help
College Sophomore,4,Great people all around and great activity at night
College Sophomore,4,Lots of spaces for studying playing relaxing
College Sophomore,4,Always encouraged students to participate
College Sophomore,4,Willing to help out when you are in need
College Sophomore,4,I am still currently taking all my general Ed class's but I'm almost done to. I can't wait to be done with my general classes because then I will be admitted into my program and I will then receive my Associates degree.
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience at this school has been great. I have had teachers believe in me when I was ready to give up.
College Sophomore,4,"The workload here isn't bad, most professors understand that most students have more than just his/her class to study for. Every professor has their office hours listed in case a student needs help."
College Sophomore,4,"My specific major is education & it can be very expensive. You have to get background checks done, you have to pass the praxis tests also. As for internship, that part is great."
College Sophomore,4,"Most of my classes are near each other so it's not so bad, but it really sucks when it's raining & you have to walk across campus to get to your other class. I really don't know about transferring any credits."
College Sophomore,4,This college has a career day where many business people come to speak to the students & give them info. about different career option.
College Sophomore,4,"Online courses aren't bad, but I really prefer to be in class so if I have a question about something I can ask right then because some teachers don't check their email everyday."
College Sophomore,4,There is many different students from other states at this college. Students range from ages 19-70's. No matter their age or ethnic background everyone is treated equal here.
College Sophomore,4,"This college has many resources for their students. There is an athletic center for students to work out, a wonderful library to go study or just relax, & so many campus activities it's hard to keep up with them all."
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy college for the most part. Most teachers there do whatever it takes to help their students graduate.
College Sophomore,4,This college has many career services of different kinds. They always have a career day where students can go to talk & find out info. about certain jobs.
College Sophomore,4,My overall experience is beyond what I thought it would be.
College Freshman,4,The tuition here is the lowest in the state and for what you get it is worth it.
College Freshman,4,The Library is very nice but it needs more study rooms because we only have 3 and you have to “fight” to get one. The activities are fun.
College Freshman,4,I do spend a lot of time at the Math and Science Center. Teachers are very helpful.
College Freshman,4,We have really weird people here but they are weird in a good way. Here you can meet everybody on campus and it feels like a family.
College Freshman,4,"So far my school is very peaceful and the professors are great. You have the opportunity to get really close to them. I wish we did have more restaurants on campus like other schools and a Starbucks since we are getting in the habitat if drinking coffee.

They do try to make the students socialize with each other as much as possible by hosting events and special events. One event,I  know for a fact no other school probably has, is an annual crawfish broil where they buy pounds and pounds of crawfish and they just feed them to all the students. They campus if very green with more grass than cement. The students here are very divorced and most are very friendly."
College Student,4,"Sometimes, I don't feel as if I'm getting my money's worth."
College Student,4,"So far, my pre-requisites are going good. I have been learning a lot."
College Student,4,The faculty at the school are very friendly and inviting. I dont feel like I have to be scared to ask someone for help. The campus is great and the school is very nice.
College Sophomore,4,We are just getting wifi.
College Freshman,4,Coming to my school was a much another and easier process than I would have ever thought. I stressed about it all day before I finally got my classes registered. I learned that it is a lot easier than what everyone makes it out to be.
College Freshman,4,I favorite part of college is being in a band with people who are all serious about music.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is cool. I haven't had any problems. I like college.
College Sophomore,4,The computers on campus are very reliable along with all the other technology. 
College Sophomore,4,At University of Arkansas at Monticello I feel that it is different from most schools. I feel like I get more one on one attention and help from my teachers. 
College Freshman,4,They do a lot of things to involve students. There has been concerts and things of that sort. 
Senior,2,"Buildings are falling apart and the admin are horrible. There are black mood growing from the buildings, most of the buildings are leaky, some rooms are condemned, and shortcuts are made when it comes to cleaning mood of the ceilings in dorm rooms ie Maxwell. Sometimes it’s just painted over. The art programs are underfunded and we’re almost cut. The football team struggles year after year. And Greek life sucks."
College Sophomore,2,"I have had a terrible experience with the online classes as opposed to the in-class experience. The system fails a lot, and the teacher failed to provide the necessary books so I had to buy them online. I didn't like the idea that I couldn't just go to that teacher and find out my grades or talk about the issues I had since she happened to live out of state."
College Freshman,2,"I wouldn't choose UAM again. I would choose a college farther away where I could get the real college experience. Living only 45 minutes away there is no reason, I'm my opinion, in living on campus. "
College Freshman,2,My education is going to give me the ability to fulfill my dreams of becoming a 1st grade teacher.  The financial aid office has been willing to help me any way they can.  UAM is a small college and more affordable than the larger schools in Arkansas.  The education that I am receiving is great!
College Senior,2,"There aren't many activities to do on campus. Registration isn't bad, sometimes the advisors won't let you in a particular class you would like to be in. Overall the school isn't so bad."
College Sophomore,2,Too Much Paper Work – The System of check and balances are completely messed up. If you are from out of state you had better read your paper work really carefully especially if you have a vocational rehab that is going to be paying for your tuition and fees. You literally have to walk the campus to get everything done. Employees don't know most of the departments exist and the head person of financial aid is a bitch.
College Freshman,2,"Diffuicult to Deal With – In my personal experience I have had no issues, but a lot of people I kno whave had technology issues."
College Freshman,2,Job Are Minimal – Theres not many job options and employment opportunities. Post-grad job options are not so good since the location is not so convinient.
College Senior,2,"Don't Bite Off More Than You Can Chew! My schedule can be pretty hectic, but that's probably because I'm a science major and I'm in band. Labs and band conflict sometimes, so it's hard for me to work. One thing I don't like is that many of my more difficult classes are early in the morning, which is very inconvenient for busy students. I'm not sure about transferring credits (I've only attended one college), but I guess it could be a hassle if credits don't transfer. I also think that they should emphasize more to new students the fact that bad grades in completed courses are permanent on your transcript even if you do better the second time."
Graduate Student,1,"The school is run down. The faculty, like the town, does not want to work hard to change any issues they might have. The athletics are horrible. The football team is horrible. The only two good coaches Kyle Shipp and Darren Drago we’re fired because the head coach was worried they would take his job. Baseball is good. Student life is a joke. No advertising or participation. The rec center is tiny and it is clear why nobody goes there."
Senior,1,"UAM is a terrible university! I am dual in enrolled through a Flag ship program, Eversity ( Which is nice, but also has room for improvement!) The Finanical Aid office is a the worst part of the whole instiution. Due to their error, I have to pay pell grant 3,000 dollars, I did not find out about this midway through the semester, and to top it all off phone calls and emails are ignored  or not returned for months. I plan on filing a complaint with the Department of Education."
College Sophomore,1,The Wifi at UAM is terrible. There are so many security walls that you cannot access the wifi or internet without being on a computer. This makes checking grades ridiculous!!
College Student,1,"What Aid? Fisrt of all i was sent three different placed to be told each time that well i dont understnad why they sent you here, do you know, well of course i dont thats why im here!! UGh! Yeah im fed up!!!!"

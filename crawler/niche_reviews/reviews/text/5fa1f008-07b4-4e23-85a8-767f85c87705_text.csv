Senior,5,I love that there is online courses offered. I am so glad that my current program is completely online. The teachers all have different formats but they are easily learned and they are more than willing to help. The D2L format is easy to learn and there is an online learning course to get your familiar with online classes that you are able to access throughout the entire semester in case you have additional questions.
Senior,5,Southwest Minnesota State University is a large scale school with a small-town feel. The school has lots of great employees. The school offers student employment. It has affordable learning!
Junior,5,"The student:teacher ratio is great! The weather can be brutal at times, but the campus itself is all interconnected."
Freshman,5,I like the community that is on this campus. There are lots of people to whom to make friends with. There are some tight close people you are opening to invite people into their circle if you know where to look. Most of the teachers are understanding and willing to help you to the best they can to help you reach the goal you are trying to achieve.
Freshman,5,"The atmosphere here is amazing! Everyone is super friendly! The small campus really makes it feel homey and the professors are pretty awesome. You can always expect to leave campus with a smile on your face, no matter the mood you were in when you got there!"
Niche User,5,"The atmosphere of SMSU is very homely. Even though it is a relatively small campus, it feels as though there are many different people to meet. The set up of campus is very convenient, especially in the cold winter months, and very easy to get the hang of. Marshall is a moderately sized city, which gives it just enough new things to explore and experience, but still embodies a welcoming town."
Junior,5,"I came from a small town of 1300 people, and I wanted to stick with a smaller town aspect, while still going farther away from my hometown. SMSU was the perfect fit for that (they have 14000 people). The teachers get to know you on a personal level, and really try to ensure you have a job after college. I do wish that they had more opportunities for intramurals and fraternities/sororities, but they include almost everything else."
Alum,5,I graduated from SMSU and my adviser still keeps in touch with me to see how my job is going. The people here are friendly and want you to be successful.
Sophomore,5,The professors truly care about our education and success. Everyone is so nice here and the campus is beautiful. The food/dining hall changed for the better. The dorms are nice.
Sophomore,5,I like the small class size in getting to know the professors and the professors getting to know me.
Freshman,5,This school is so welcoming and you feel like there are so many people behind you wanting to succeed
College Sophomore,5,Health on safety on this campus is not a issue besides some rare cases.
College Junior,5,Here at SMSU staff go above and beyond the expectation when setting up students for future employment and it makes me feel confident about placement someday.
College Junior,5,There are far too many positive things to say about my experience here at SMSU! It has been such a welcoming experience and I truly believe that I am in the right place.
College Junior,5,Very helpful and provides great information for students.
College Sophomore,5,"I feel it is great, the alumni office is very helpful/outgoing, the career service office is willing to talk and help out as much as possible."
College Sophomore,5,I do not mind it! I have been a resident and a Resident Assistant and have had no problems or concerns.
College Sophomore,5,It has been a lot of fun and I have had a lot of experiences that I am very thankful for. I really could not have wished for a better experience.
College Freshman,5,"I love the school, the staff is friendly and helpful"
College Freshman,5,always there to help with whatever you need
Senior,4,The classes are really small so it is easy to connect and ask questions when needed. The professors are very flexible and available almost all of the time for additional questions and support.
Senior,4,"Online classes contain a lot of work, but it was nice making my own schedule and completing assignments when I had time, considering I am working as well."
Freshman,4,The area is very welcoming to students. The college staff is very helpful when it comes to answering questions or getting information. The campus is very easy to navigate. The one thing I don't care for is the meal program.
Senior,4,"Southwest Minnesota State University has a very ""at home"" feel to it's campus. One of the main reasons I chose this school was because it felt like such an inclusive environment. Every professor is here to help, and push you to do better in and out of the classroom."
Senior,4,"The professors get to know their students and want them to succeed.  The class sizes, especially for upper division classes are small so you aren't just a number.
Some upper division classes are only offered every other year, so you have to plan carefully."
Sophomore,4,It is a smaller school in an average sized town. Not much to do within the city itself unfortunately.
Sophomore,4,What I like about Southwest Minnesota State University is the small community that is built here over time. It's the same workers in the cafeteria so they become a friend from concessions onto serving food all day. It is small enough for others to recognize that you're an athlete or you are in their class. It really is a great community built here at Southwest Minnesota State University. What I would like to change about Southwest Minnesota State University would be to open more to other colleges. It would be nice to have other college students come and tour or spend an overnight in the dorms because it's not well known in the cities and it's such a small town where there isn't much to do. Getting the school more open to other areas would be nice for the schools' reputation and for the student's sake of meeting others beyond the small town.
Alum,4,"This public school has a lot going for it, if you are looking for a solid education, good facilities, and smaller size to create student connections.  Like many schools, the quality of education is what you put into it and very affordable.  There are some top notch professors here, authors, scientists, etc. and they will spend to help you learn.  The facilities for students are very nice and connected to shield students from the weather in the winter.   There are a number of non-traditional students at the campus.  The school has a nice planetarium, a beautiful performance theater, quality athletic facilities, a nice education center, library, dorms and good science labs.  Because it is a state school in a rural area with not as much to do, there is some college partying and some people may not like the location.  These were not disappointing or disruptive factors for me."
Sophomore,4,I like the fact that it’s a small school and I have access to my professors office and my any time. I’d want more residence life scholarships so people can apply to live on campus with the scholarships they get
Graduate Student,4,"This year, I will be starting the Educational Leadership Graduate program at Southwest Minnesota State University.   Since the program does not officially start until September 8th, I can only give my first impressions.  Upon hearing about the program from my administrator, I was very intrigued. I was not interested in doing an online program and this appeared to be a fabulous fit.  It is a cohort that meets closer to my home, we will be meeting on a monthly basis and a few of my coworkers have joined the program.  Two professors from the university came to the location and met with potential students, where they outlined the program, offered incentives for early admissions and took the time to hear and answer questions.   The only thing that I wish were different was the timeliness of communication about the first class.  All in all, I am very anxious to start this journey and look forward to what Southwest has to offer me as I work towards my Master's."
Senior,4,Southwest Minnesota State brings a great environment to all students. Staff is very welcoming as well as all the students attending there. This school provides great opportunities for foreign students and is a multicultural school. Advisors are constantly keeping in touch which helps students stay on track and complete their defree. I would not suggest any changes to thinamazing university.
Junior,4,"Going to SMSU was not my original plan, but now that I have been attending for a couple years, I love it! There is new additions all the time. The amount of international students is actually very helpful I think. It is also a very small campus, and feels very home-like."
Sophomore,4,"small enough, but not too small
cheap, but high quality
great on campus culture
great professors and on-campus resources
many different programs
diverse population"
Freshman,4,I love the awesome advisers! The staff is always there to help you out and they are interested in your success.
Sophomore,4,"Other all a good school, a lot of diversity which is kind of a downfall for some of the other students. Students and staff are nice and willing to help others."
Sophomore,4,"Southwest Minnesota State University is a really great school. There is a good ratio of professors to students, so you feel like you can get some extra help from the professors if you need it. The professors are very nice as well (at least the ones I've had). They welcome questions, and help you to the best of their ability. The layout of the school is really nice and simple, as there are multiple ways to get to most places. It was a bit intimidating at first, but I quickly got used to the way the school is laid out. As for the classes, they are pretty good. There is a wide range of subjects that are offered, so odds are that you will find the types of classes you are looking for. During the time between classes, you can sit in one of the many comfortable couches and chairs in various parts of the school. The food is good too, if you're wondering about that. Just beware of the Freshman 15 if you eat from the buffet!"
Niche User,4,"I don't go here but my older sister did. She really liked the programs, student life, and the campus.  She said it was a great place to meet new people and work towards a rewarding career."
Sophomore,4,"A nice, tight-knit school great for students who want to go to a cheap, school with good professors, athletics, and campus activities."
Sophomore,4,"I love the education department here at SMSU.  The professors are extremely passionate about teaching and are always eager to help anyone!  Additionally, we have an EMSP club (Education Minnesota Student Program) that helps prepare you for teaching.  Classes are never taught by teacher aids and the professors are very willing to help outside of class times.  SMSU is a reasonable cost as well.  You get the proper resources that you pay for.  If you like smaller class sizes (20 to 40 students) and knowing almost everyone on campus, this would be the college for you.  "
College Sophomore,4,"I wouldn't choose another school if I could do it over again.  Almost all the professors are super helpful when you ask questions.  They are all passionate about their field of study.  My favorite classes are with the English or Education professors.  SMSU is known for their Education field and for a good reason.  The professors are extremely excited about teaching and are always there to support the students.  Additionally, the English professors are also friendly and several of them have had their work published into various books and articles.  The only downside is some of the professors for your general classes (specifically science) are not as eager to help you or seem as concerned about you as a student individually.  Otherwise most of the professors and classes are caring and interesting."
College Sophomore,4,As said before SMSU does an amazing job at making the most of what its got. It has a great amount of class choices great professors and small class sizes that help students learn.
College Sophomore,4,The on campus housing is great especially Sweetland Hall which is better than dorms at the big schools the only problem is cost/value the cost of on campus is extremely expensive opposed to off.
College Sophomore,4,SMSU does an extraordinary job at making the most of its resources. It is not the largest school but the professors are very educated and willing to help and provide a friendly atmosphere which is unique because at a lot of schools professors are hard to reach. The campus has everything a college student would need and is fun to be around.
College Junior,4,I haven't had any experiences feeling unsafe or in danger while attending SMSU.
College Junior,4,"It is clear that there is a massive student following behind varsity sports at Southwest Minnesota State University (SMSU), and in addition to this there is a great deal of support from the community. Because Marshall, MN is a relatively small town the students who attend SMSU immediately become part of the city as the city takes interest in what is going on at the University. Attendance at games is high and the crowd is very active and positive. There are a wide variety of sports offered here so everyone can find something they enjoy watching!"
College Junior,4,"I have transferred schools twice now and between all three post secondary institutions Southwest Minnesota State University takes the cake. They went out of their way to be helpful in the process of transferring and they were quick to respond to any questions I may have had. The advisor I was assigned to was truly an advocate for my admission, acceptance into the teacher education program and now success as a student at Southwest Minnesota State University. I would highly recommend this institution to all students looking to pursue a degree in Education!"
Recent Alumnus,4,At every athletic event students are so involved and supportive of the athletes. The athletic facilities could be better but over all you get a great outcome.
Recent Alumnus,4,"It is a complete different environment than my home state California, but over all so far it has been a wonderful experience"
College Junior,4,I really like my school and the program I'm currently in. My schools location is very convenient and I enjoy the classes I'm taking. I think most of the professors are good at their job and make learning interesting.
College Junior,4,Career services is awesome at helping build resumes!
College Junior,4,Variety of classes were offered! Classes are unique to the major!
College Junior,4,The university has great residential life workers ! Very helpful and nice!
College Junior,4,"Athletic are great, however sometimes those of us who do not play sports feel that the university is centered around them."
College Junior,4,"SMSU feels like home. Students are put into a classroom setting where professors know all their students name and care about their students. Like most schools, there is a bit of updating that could be done with their technology, but a great overall experience to be a part of the SMSU family. GO MUSTANGS!"
College Freshman,4,SMSU has public safety on campus 24/7.  If anything goes wrong we can call them and they will be there to help.
College Freshman,4,My advisor sends me emails almost three times about summer internships and they are always looking to help us find a career that we can succeed in.
College Freshman,4,I love the courses and the professors.  They are really approachable and good at what they do.
College Freshman,4,I really like SMSU! It has small class sized and all the professors know your name.
College Freshman,4,I think that this university takes the students' health and safety seriously.
College Freshman,4,The alumni network is quite important around here since it's a pretty small univeristy.
College Freshman,4,The alumni network is quite important around here since it's a pretty small univeristy.
College Freshman,4,"Because I commute, I don't really know the campus housing, but I do know that it is pretty good. I know people who lives int he campus housing and it's not too shabby!"
College Freshman,4,The school is very friendly and comfortable!
College Sophomore,4,I never really feel threatened on campus; I can walk alone and feel safe 99% of the time.
College Sophomore,4,The professors do a good job of assisting students in their search for internship opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the Exercise Science program and the professors, but my favorite Ex Sci Professor is leaving and another one is taking a sabbatical next semester, so I am indifferent about the replacements coming in."
College Sophomore,4,"It is a great experience if you are living in Sweetland Hall, otherwise the traditional dorms could be refurbished."
College Freshman,4,I have yet to feel unsafe or that something will be stolen from me.
College Freshman,4,It is good place to study and has lots of opportunities for students to be involved.
College Freshman,4,"Great, there is always a large crowd and a fun place to spend the night."
College Freshman,4,The teachers are caring and friendly and want success from their students
College Junior,4,There's a lot of diversity here.  Generally well received
College Junior,4,Class sizes are small and professors genuinely care about students and are experts in their fields.
College Student,4,"There is a low crime rate at SMSU. Earlier this year their were a couple of incidents of cars being broken into though. Overall, I feel safe here."
College Student,4,SMSU is fairly good at encouraging students to do their best in order to succeed once they've graduated. The career center is helpful only if you seek them.
College Sophomore,4,There has been some small crime but it usually always get solved.
College Sophomore,4,I have had one bad experience but after talking with the professor there was a mutual understanding and it worked itself out.
College Sophomore,4,I am not a huge sports person but I love the facilities they are kept up to date and have all been renovated in the last 5 or so years.
College Junior,4,I think our class sizes are the best! Our professors know us by name and not just a number in their classroom. We have many different majors that are very competitive and diverse.
College Junior,4,Many majors have classes that require you to get a summer internship so that you know what your getting into. Alumni are very present on campus and willing to connect and talk about experiences they have had. We have multiple opportunities for career fairs during the year to attend.
Freshman,2,They don't have very good teachers. If you are going to become a teacher this a great college for you.
College Freshman,2,Campus security consists of students on campus. I feel like there should be people with more training on the job. It would make people on campus feel more safe. There is a lot of stealing on campus.
College Freshman,2,I think there needs to be more variety to courses. There are no interesting classes. Most of the classes fill quickly and they need to have more to pick from.
College Freshman,2,The coaches are not very good here. There is no communication between coaching staff and athletes. Events are last minute and not consistent. There is not a lot of support for athletics. There is also no money for the program. Teams have to share facilities or go to a different field.
College Sophomore,2,"The main football/soccer stadium is great, as is the new track facility. However, the indoor facilities are lacking...there is hardly any space indoors for most athletics to get in their proper workouts. Also, the indoor track facility could be updated."
College Junior,2,It's all over the place and little is done about it.
College Junior,2,The school has few options for what I want to pursue.
College Student,2,"Southwest Minnesota State University is not the school for me. Although I like being able to communicate efficiently with the professors, the school is very small and offers little to nothing besides a lacking education. The facility is not up to date either."
College Freshman,2,There is no Greek life really at this college.
College Freshman,2,"The staff have shown that they are qualified and care, but as for the campus as a whole, it's not somewhere that I feel like I belong."
College Freshman,2,I don't live on campus so i would not know. But from what I've heard the night activities are mainly restricted to those 21 and older.
College Freshman,2,"Most of the people seem to be in the same type of people group. A lot of the people that come here are also interested in the same types of careers, so there's not too much diversity."
College Freshman,2,"There is a lot of off campus housing very close to campus, ive never personally lived there but they are close and seen relatively affordable."
College Freshman,2,"There is an average amount of underage drinking that goes on here at SMSU. But for people that are 21 and above people may go out with their friends usually, otherwise only specific events bring out the partiers of the school."
College Freshman,2,"The transportation for SMSU is not the greatest because all they have is the Marshall, MN public bus for transportation and it only goes until a certain time. However, the one good thing about it is that the route buses that go to the same place every hour or half hour are free with a student ID. But if its after 6pm you can't really get anywhere unless you or a friend has a car."
College Freshman,2,The food is the same old most days. Nothing special or different.
College Junior,2,Have to Have Your Car – Buses don't pick up that often so if you need to be somewhere you have to bring your own car. Walking to most places could be quite a hike
College Sophomore,2,"The Food – There isn't much variety in the dining at our school. Also the food is not the greatest quality, although we do have a culinary major with many great chefs at the school. It just needs to step up a bit and become a little cheaper. Most students don't eat the dining hall foods because of the taste and quality."
College Junior,2,"During the fall term, the weather is really nice. The different colors of the leaves is beautiful. I don't like the winters though. They can be brutal with a lot of snow and very cold weather. It can seem bipolar at times but it's okay I think."
Recent Alumnus,2,Fun to Watch – I have only gone to the Men's Basketball games and some football games. They were very fun to attend the team worked very hard. I know the teams at SMSU did not win a lot but they tried hard.
Sophomore,1,"Completely unhelpful with planning classes, general academic advising, & no career advice. There is no pride in academics/no academic culture. Very few opportunities for internships & nothing to do in this small town. Diversity is not welcomed--the campus climate is overwhelming close-minded. Transferred to the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities & it's the best choice I ever made."
College Sophomore,1,"We do not have ""Greek Life"""
College Freshman,1,We do not have a Greek life.
College Senior,1,"Due do lack of professors, classes are only offered either in the spring or the fall and because of this, I can't graduate on time. The students are close-minded and very small town, so if you like farming, it's the perfect place. While the staff is friendly, it has that high school feel when they speak to you. I am a transfer student and they did not accept all my transcripts from Mankato State so I had to make up some classes. I regret my decision to transfer."
College Freshman,1,"When I lived on campus I hated it, I was not associated with or welcomed by my RA or roomate"
College Freshman,1,I'm pretty sure there is no campus transportation.
College Freshman,1,"The weather in this area has been absolutely terrible this year. It was just 67 degrees Fahrenheit yesterday and now it's around 20. Also, it's April and there's snow on the ground. I hate it."
College Freshman,1,"I absolutely hate the weather here.  It's always windy regardless of the season so that, even when you think it should be warm, the wind comes in and freezes the place."
College Freshman,1,"Our campus is suppose to be tobacco free, but i see people smoking outside of the school building on campus. No one does anything about it."
College Junior,1,"Very Limited – Due to budget cuts they are cutting back on scholarships, because they would rather fund pointless things than help students out."
College Junior,1,"Extremes of the Temperatures – Gets very hot in the summer and when school is starting, but once winter comes it gets very, very cold and windy. Sucks to have to walk to class"
College Junior,1,Nothing to Do Unless You Can Drink – There is nothing in the town to do but get wasted. The only thing to do is go to the crappy bowling alley or go to the overpriced movie theater.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The financial aid office workers do not want to work, and if you come in totally new to the process you will leave more frustrated and confused then when you went in. You have to fill out forms before they will even talk to you.  There are usually student workers there who know just enough to tell you to fill out a form or come back because people are on break. If you don't know the right words to say you will get nowhere. If you are a transfer student you are expected to know everything.  A new student who comes in and has a tour of the campus has better chances of receiving some worth while information.
Advice- get a FAFSA form, and any other forms that are avaliable near the Fin. Aid office. Fill everything possible out, go into the Fin. Aid office with the filled out forms (as filled out as you can) and simply say ""Can I get some help?"" Another thing you can do is go to the Business Office because they know more and will direct you better. Alot of times the people who have the best advice are the people who don't work in Financial Aid!"

Sophomore,5,Penn State Beaver is great. Can't beat the value and the quality of the education. It's by no means the best campus but if your're looking for a great deal or a stepping stone campus I highly recommend it

Freshman,5,"Penn State Beaver has a small campus with every building a 5 minute walk! Each time I go outside, I am in awe of the view we have. It is so beautiful. The bistro has a variety of delicious foods. The professors here are so helpful and understanding. They are willing to help when you need it and will explain the problems step by step. There is security always going around the campus to make sure everything is okay and that there are no problems. The amount of of financial aid I received from Penn State Beaver is so generous and I am so thankful to be a part of this program. There is always something to do here to joining clubs, going to parties, participate in sports, or going to the surrounding shopping centers to splurge !!"

He explained the great aspects of the campus and even let us tour some of the buildings. The campus is small, yet homely. It makes you feel like you belong. "

College Junior,5,There are no party on campus it is a dry campus.
College Junior,5,The professors are very knowledgeable!
College Sophomore,5,"There is no off campus parking.  On campus parking includes three large parking lots just for students.  There are always spots open.  Having a car would be more convenient than not because there is a highways close by which you need to take in order to get to restaurants, mall, movies etc.  There may be a bus stop in front of the residence hall for those who do not have a car."
College Sophomore,5,There are many computer labs that are available to students as long as a class is not using it.  There is also a library filled with computers which are also available to students.  In the library there is also a quiet study area that is secluded from the library so students can concentrate.  Speed of internet is fast and you can use the printer as much as you need to for free.  A big plus.

College Senior,5,"Cheating, honor, and integrity are treated very seriously.  You will never get a pass on stealing someones work."
College Senior,5,You can always find an open computer on campus.  All of the computer labds have at least 30 computers in them and they are never all occupied at the same time.
College Senior,5,I am a business major at PSU- Beaver and I love it.  I learn something new every day and the teachers all care so much about your success.
Sophomore,4,"My transition to Penn State Beaver was the hardest part to the college. I wasn't used to being away from home and the campus wasn't what I expected since I saw Penn State as being a single big campus. After sometime you get used to it, it just depends on how you're used to living life back home."
Freshman,4,"So far my experience at penn state beaver university has been great. I loved my first and second semester there, while it was challenging adjusting to the regular struggles of a college schedule at penn state beaver your teachers understand you and your able to adjust a lot easier than I heard at other colleges."
Junior,4,"Penn State Beaver is good for academics. The professors here are really great at their jobs. If a student needs help, they are wiling to provide extra aid. The one thing I dislike with the campus is their food selections. It is very limited and very repetitive."
Freshman,4,The staff and faculty were mostly very friendly and any student on campus was willing to help another along the way.
Freshman,4,"Most teachers are amazing, however you’re always going to have those few that you either don’t click with or just overall don’t like."
Senior,4,"Penn State Beaver is a great campus to attend, especially if you are interested in Information Technology. The professors are well spoken, and it is a more affordable option than the main campus. Especially since  you're able to finish a four year degree without having to transfer!"
College Freshman,4,Penn state takes the health and safety of the students very seriously.
College Freshman,4,"Nothing wrong with Penn State Beavers sports, all seem fun interactive and have great team members."
College Freshman,4,Penn State is a very exceptional and interactive learning institution.
College Student,4,We had a talk with the one cop on campus and he told us to call if we needed walked back to our dorms and that they just overall want us to be safe.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy most of my classes but some are boring to me.
College Freshman,4,"It's a small school where it's easy to know everybody, and of course, it's Penn State"
College Junior,4,I currently go to Penn State Beaver. Choosing Penn State might be one of the best decisions I've ever made.I only completed one year of school and yet
College Freshman,4,"Its a nice small campus, its a short walk to classes and everything is close by."
College Sophomore,4,My campus does a great job on safety and security.
College Sophomore,4,The campus strictness at my school is appropriate.
College Freshman,4,Penn State Beaver is very strict about the use of drugs and alcohol on campus. It is very easy to get caught drinking in the dorms. The Resident Assistance are very good about being concerned with everyone's safety.
College Junior,4,The professors are always willing to help you out.
College Freshman,4,Its fun when it comes to both varsity and JV sports events
College Freshman,4,if u don't have a computer u can rent from library
Freshman,2,"I've struggled a lot with being at this campus. I have a hard time making friends because of the school being more for commuters, and being one its hard to want to stay here."
College Student,2,Some people mostly watch movies and the people that smoke pot will run up and down the hall knocking on everyones door at three A.M.
College Student,2,My roommate sleeps all the time and she has a glass of milk that had been here for two weeks now. It is smelly and molding.
College Junior,2,"There are few options, many commute."
College Freshman,2,"There is rarely ever any drinking. Most of the people who drink are of age and are not abusing the alcoholic beverages. There is one club in Pittsburgh, which is about 45 minutes away, that is 18 and older. At the club the security is very, very strict. Your best bet to find a party is either finding a High School Party or another college that is somewhat close to campus."
College Freshman,2,You Will Get Tired of the Food – At Penn State Beaver the food is very perdictable.We have the same meals for seven days a week. People get very tired of eating the same things. Once in a while we would have something different.
College Freshman,2,"Many students that attend Penn State Beaver, especially those that live in the dorms, like to get themselves drunk as a recreational activity. They do this under the excuse that there isn't anything ales better to do. I myseforgo not for take in any of these activities. On campus, many students use this trail that leads to Walmart to get all their needs. This has also became a popular place for these such activities. Many students are good about keeping it to themselves though."
College Freshman,2,"the school is not very good at giving you notices on things through the school they seem that you are aware of everything, and the only notices that you get for anytype of financial is when you are late on things"
College Freshman,2,"our campus is a small branch of penn state, so our campus has athletics but its not as important as the class work"
College Sophomore,2,"Off-Campus Food – The food off-campus is the typical fast food restaurants. Although some are cheap, they are not great restaurants."
College Senior,2,Not Very Strict – Penn State Beaver is not very strict. Commuters come and go as they please and its very lineant. Parking and speeding are about the strictest the school gets.
College Student,1,In the girls dorm it always smells of weed. It is kinda annoying and I hate it with a passion.
College Freshman,1,its snows way to much up here first day of spring snow
College Freshman,1,nothing to do if you don't have a car
College Freshman,1,Unfortunately we don't have any greek life. I wish we did.
College Freshman,1,Not Much Around – Not much to do around here. Some activities are fun. The mall is slightly too far of a walk so you'll need a car. Walmart is 5 minutes over the hill. There is no real safety if you live on campus. Anyone can come in and out of the building because people let them in not knowing if they're students or not. We need our IDs to swipe in. But if someone walks in behind us no one would know the difference. The opposite sex RAs are allowed in your room whenever they want even if it's the middle of the night to unlock your door if your roommate has a problem with you. I think it's absolutely ridiculous the way they run things here.
College Freshman,1,"Wouldn't Go Here – It's hard to receive help from anyone on this campus. If there is an incident where you'd like your name to be kept a secret to another student you're having a problem with they put your full name in the report and give it to that student anyway. They don't let you switch rooms to be with someone you want to be with. It's a terrible fight and battle you have to go through just to be with someone you're comfortable with. There is no one here that'll truly help you when you ask for it as far as residence life goes. They basically think they can do whatever they want here. I had a male RA unlock my door at 3AM to kick me out because of my roommate complaining about me. First I'm a female so a male RA shouldn't be allowed in my room especially at that time of night, without even knocking. I was in the middle of sleeping when he walked in. Second, he gave me the options of going to a hotel room or going home. When I pay so much to live here. Living on campus is a terrible idea."
College Freshman,1,"Policies Are Terrible. If you walk too loud on your floor you can get written up for it. If there is any type of toilet paper in the bathroom it can go as high as $60 to pay for something on the floor. They don't let you switch rooms to be with someone you want to be with. It's a terrible fight and battle you have to go through just to be with someone you're comfortable with. There is no one here that'll truly help you when you ask for it as far as residence life goes.

College Freshman,1,Terrible Enforcement – Everyone here smokes weed. There is a ton of drinking. Some people get let go when they get caught with it and have way over the legal limit. While others may only have two drinks and get their license taken away and have to go to court. Peer pressure is unbelievable here. If the RAs like you or if residence life knows you then you get away with anything. This school is in line for a lawsuit if they ever get caught with how they run things.

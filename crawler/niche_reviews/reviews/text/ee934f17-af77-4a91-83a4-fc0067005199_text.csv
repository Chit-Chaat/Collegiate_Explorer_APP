Junior,5,"I took a couple of ""hybrid"" classes and they were super easy. They require a lot of time management, you do tests and homework on your own time, but professors are always just an Email away. Never too hard. And, every building has school computers so you can hop on one and do some homework ANYWHERE on campus."
Freshman,5,I have not yet taken any online classes from this school. But i have done the online orientation and the professors were very helpful.
Freshman,5,"Georgia Gwinnett College is very diverse in race and equality, i tend to work better in a diverse environment with lots of peer communication."

Sophomore,5,"I'm currently taking two online classes, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Considering the fact that these weren't *supposed* to be online courses, I would say my professors have done extremely well with presenting and teaching the material. Dr. Laura Young in particular has been amazing and I've loved her American Government class."
Sophomore,5,This college is so good for people who do not want a college with a lot of people. The classes are small and all of the professors are of high quality.
Sophomore,5,"I actually really enjoy having online class, I was able to see my teacher screen really clear and ask question as soon as possible."
Sophomore,5,"I like my college a lot, for example, the small class is my favorite. Because I can ask question and professor will answer my question right away."

Freshman,5,georgia Gwinnett college in my opinion is a very interesting school. It has a great acceptance rate and can be a very enlightening experience for me in the near future
Sophomore,5,The college has a nice campus and people are very friendly at the school. The gym has a lot of different equipment. The classes are smaller so its easy to get feedback from a professor. The walking distance is shorter compared to some colleges. There is a lot of fun and interesting activities offered at the school. The library has many great spaces to study.
Sophomore,5,I love the simply fact the class rooms are not crowded and your able to get that one on one with the professors
Senior,5,"I loved and enjoyed my years at Georgia Gwinnett College. I was lucky enough to get accepted and pursue a degree in Biology. While my years as an undergraduate, I was able to be part of the Tri-Beta Biological Honor Society and the Golden Key Honor Society. Participating in these clubs taught me leadership skills, commitment and helped built me into the person I am today. GGC's student involvement is greater than I have ever seen; it has a variety of different clubs and activities for students to participate and find new passions. I am truly sad my journey at GGC is over, but I am excited to pursue my next goal and implement all this journey taught me."
Sophomore,5,"I love this college, the people and staff and students are all super friendly and always willing to help to strive for better"

Freshman,5,"Everyone is really understanding, and always trying to make sure you succeed. The peers are amazing, and the most helpful professors I have ever had."

Freshman,5,Georgia Gwinnett College is very affordable for those that want to further their education but are not able to pay thousands and thousands of dollars in universities. Professors are super helpful and friendly.
Junior,5,Straight forward school. Easy courses. Would be better if the grades would be put in on time. Classes are easy to focus on since there isn't much going on around the campus. It's a fairly newer school so I will give it time to grow. There also aren't any Greek organizations allowed.
Sophomore,5,Small and beautiful campus. I have been able to make friends easily and stay well connected to my professors during my time here. The small campus makes everything very accessible and easy to get to with little confusion. I praise the environment for this being the best that I have ever done in school.
Sophomore,5,"I love Georgia Gwinnett College because it is a small campus, close to home, and affordable. The staff is all very friendly and are also very helpful. The professors are very professional and love to see their students learn and help them when necessary. I brag to my parents about GGC all the time and even convinced my mother to go here as well."
Freshman,5,When I went on my first visit to Georgia Gwinnett College they gave us a tour and the tour guide was very nice and the campus facilities were all wonderful. I fell in love the first time I visited so I decided to go back and then I knew for sure that Georgia Gwinnett College was the school for me to continue my education.
Senior,5,"Great cost of attendance! The tuition cost is by far the lowest of most surrounding colleges, and the campus is beautiful. The parking situation could be made much better, as it is often very difficult to find park, or there is no parking available. The variety of foods on campus could also be much better. The eCore online classes offered are definitely very limited, which is a big issue on a campus that is primarily made up of commuters. The classes offered on campus are also quite limited, especially considering the amount the amount has grown over the years, and the availability for upper level classes in most majors."
Junior,5,Welcoming community with small class sizes and helpful teachers. Closed campus with many areas to study or grab a bite to eat.
Freshman,5,Georgia Gwinnett College is amazing. Is actually a school where the teachers actually care about the students well being and doing
Freshman,5,I love how friendly any helpful the staff is. I love the proud atmosphere of the school. They are always willing to help with any questions or concerns I have. They have never been rude nor blew me off. They are fast and efficient and right there. I’m
Junior,5,"I have attended two other colleges and GGC is the best hands down. The campus is new and pretty. The professors care about each student, the class sizes are low, and schedules are possible for any student. There is no party scene or Greek Life. It is mainly a commuter school. For the money, there is no better place to go."
Freshman,5,"I had a very good experience at Georgia gwinnett college, the students are very friendly and the professor's too. It's an excellent school with many opportunities for many. They provide you with all the necessary help you need in order to advance."
Freshman,5,I love the academic environment and the student diversity. The campus is very resourceful and adapted to the betterment of each student's path to a great education. Anything that a student needs for the comfort of their learning is easily provided by this school along with amazing staff and peers.
Senior,5,"Georgia Gwinnett College recently became an accredited university, making it a very nice local and cheap school to go to compared to other accredited universities. I find that most of the professors are knowledgeable, however I take mostly evening classes. The bad thing about evening classes is that sometimes they have professors with thick accents teaching them, which may make it hard for some people to learn. They have a nice cafeteria with Chick-fil-a, Panda Express, and Moe's. Their equipment to teach with is updated and therefore makes a fun learning environment."
Freshman,5,"The entire school is very accepting of everyone's differences, and in general just very nice. There's several clubs for people who identify as different things (races, sexualities, religions, majors). The one thing I'd like to change is the advertising for those clubs, since it can be sort of difficult to find out when and where they meet."
Alum,5,"GGC provided me with a great education, new friends, and many new connections. The teachers were always so helpful and friendly. They also provided many tools to help you succeed such as the AEC."
Niche User,5,"This is one of the best colleges, that I have ever been to. The atmosphere here is truly welcoming, and it's busniess program is just second to known!"
Junior,5,"I love this school. I love the calm environment, and the professors I have had have been incredible and very wise. All the courses I have taken have aided me in one way or another. I was hesitant to attend this school at first, but I am glad I made the decision to do so. It is also not too far away from home, and, although I have to pay out of state, it is not unimaginably expensive for a great education."
Junior,5,I love this school !! The environment is very calm and it’s a safe area. It is very diverse and the individuals that are there are helpful and willing to help. The professors put the needs of students ahead of themselves to make sure you are very successful.
Freshman,5,"The college offers you great source, like tutors. The class are small and not that big, resources are everywhere for you to use and it's a very fun and friendly college."
Sophomore,5,Great School . Very diverse and culturally accepting. The class sizes are great for gaining better quality time with your professor. Many campus events and opportunities for growth via clubs and organizations.

Sophomore,5,Georgia Gwinnett College has small classes so you really get to know your professors. They care about making sure you learn and help you enter your career field.
Niche User,5,I love it so much. This is my first and only choice. This school is HUGE. The library is amazing. I can’t wait to get accepted to this college. The campus is outstanding all of the food is delicious. It’s like a on campus buffet. I love it.
Alum,5,"Probably one of the most beautiful community college campuses I have ever seen. When I went on a tour of Georgia Gwinnett College; I was astonished. The campus is in a big, open area, and truly has the ""i'm in a movie"" feel to it. I've  been a Bear since middle school, and can proudly say that i want to continue being a grizzly. I'm extremely excited and hopeful to attend GGC. Go Bears!"
Freshman,5,The campus is very nice and the food is good and the campus keeps up with a lot activities so you're never bored and always have something to do
Senior,5,"Georgia Gwinnett College is a great school, with very helpful professors. It is a very diverse school, that also gives us many opportunities to get involved. The Campus is always clean and they have many events, clubs, and its is a very calm environment. Georgia Gwinnett College is growing more and more everyday, and I would most definitely recommend it to anyone who is looking into colleges, to give Georgia Gwinnett College a chance! They allow you to grow as a person and learn so much throughout the experiences there."
Niche User,5,"I like how they have tutors for every class in case you need a bit of extra help on some things. The dorms are nice, so is the food"
Sophomore,5,"GGC is a great school! The teacher here are amazing and are always willing to help and answer your questions. The community is close as we have several opportunities each week to connect and reach out. I love the environment, because you feel safe and you feel surrounded by friends and colleagues that are there to support you and push you towards your goals. the advisement and staff are dedicated to ensuring you pursue your passions and guide you in the right direction. The fitness center and the on campus restaurants are so convenient for the commuters like me. I love being  GGC Grizzly."
Sophomore,5,The Campus is very new. Class size ranges from 15-25 students. Your teachers are your mentors. Students are very nice and friendly. The cafeteria is very spacious and has many variety of foods.
Junior,5,Great school for students interested in creating a personal connection with their professors. Class sizes are small and professors are caring and accessible.
Sophomore,4,"Transitioning was a little difficult, but my professors made sure they provided me with all the resources I needed to finish off the semester with a good grade."
Sophomore,4,"The professors are very helpful, they want to see you succeed and will do anything they can to help you achieve your goals. Many students will start conversation with you and are very friendly."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Georgia Gwinnett College is an excellent facility to study at. The main pull factor of this college is its tuition. Along with that, the professors tend to teach very well, due to the small class size."
Junior,4,Online was weird because some of my professors haven’t done it before. But they tried their best. Online did help me to work more often while still getting my education
Junior,4,I really enjoy the campus. It isn’t a large campus but it isn’t small one as well. I like being able to stay close to home but feel as if I’m independent. The classes so far have bebe great. There are a lot of professors that care and are helpful but there are some that aren’t the greatest. But overall I love it
Junior,4,"GGC has massive school spirit. It really does feel like a University at times. The students have A LOT of say of what goes on on and off campus. Everyone is so friendly, there's great communication, haven't had a bad professor yet, and the campus is new, beautiful, and huge. I wish there was more opportunities and say for students who live on dorms though. They have really strict rules that don't make sense, such as curfews for guests.."
Senior,4,Online instruction has been an excellent experience. My professors are tailoring them to fit our busy lifestyles. There are online class sessions that we may attend but are optional and are recorded so students who must work are able to come back later.
Senior,4,"GGC is a great school if you want to avoid the giant and hectic classes typically seen at large universities or colleges. This allows you to really connect with your professors and engage in class in ways that aren't possible at other schools. The campus is clean, new, and pleasant to be at."
Sophomore,4,Professors did a lot to help and prepare us for online education. It is mostly up to individual professors on how they would conduct their online teachings. You can borrow laptops and other necessities form the school.
Sophomore,4,"The campus was beautiful, and all the buildings were new and super accessible - which was great because I used a wheelchair to get to and from my classes. My professors were all awesome, and my advisor has been really helpful with getting my classes and accomodations set up."
Sophomore,4,"Online experience has been wonderful. Access is easy, teachers respond in a timely fashion, and overall usage of their online system is well structured. I have be more than happy with their online set up."
Sophomore,4,"The online experience was quite enjoyable. It does require a lot of time and effort, but it is not hard to pass the class unless you don't put effort."
Sophomore,4,My experience at Georgia Gwinnett College has been phenomenal for it to be my first year! This is a school I highly recommend to other students who are looking to discover their passion and I am sure that they will absolutely love it!
Sophomore,4,My online experience with Georgia Gwinnett College has been great! Each of my professors clearly laid out the expectations for my assignments and it was very organized and structured.
Freshman,4,My overall experience with GGC has been good and was a nice experience. I got to meet a lot of new people and got to experience a great first year. I learned from my courses and my mistakes from this year which i will use in my future courses.
Sophomore,4,"Online learning was difficult of course, but the professors at GGC really care for their students and did everything they could to make things semi normal."
Freshman,4,Im here to get prerequisites out of the way. its a great school for that cause you can live at home  to keep it cheap.
Sophomore,4,Georgia Gwinnett College is a great place to attend. The campus is easy to learn and isn't extremely large. My only thing is that sometimes depending on who's working in the financial aid/student account center aren't very helpful unfortunately it's been like that the past two years when I've needed assistance.
Niche User,4,"This college campus is absolutely beautiful. The workers who go to high schools and help students who are undecided. The online team has helped me out a whole lot when i was applying. They answered me questions fast, clearly, and throughly."
Graduate Student,4,I love this school! So many opportunities and the staff and faculty here are amazing. They genuinely care about the success of the students. I am a proud alumni and plan on returning here for my science classes.
Niche User,4,I love the whole community and I am a huge fan of the resources available to all students  such as psychological help and academic help. The campus is beautiful and the college is super diverse. Overall i love it!
Niche User,4,"Campus is great and extremely clean. Most of the professors I've had were very professional yet held up a light or somewhat bubbly personality. So far, my experience with math teachers are not completely superb, but I still love math :)"
Freshman,4,I never thought I had what it took to go to college. Georgia Gwinnett College showed me I was wrong and I did have what it takes to become successful. The professors really got behind me and showed me I really was able to be successful in life and school. This is a really tight nit community of people. I’m beyond grateful.
Senior,4,"the faculty and staff here are great, but your not really going to receive the real college experience, since the college is still developing and expanding. In addition, this is a great place to be at, if your an individual that spends their time studying. Also, the classrooms aren’t large and you have easy access with your professors."
Freshman,4,What I like about GGC is that it's very close to where I live. Many of the teachers are very considerate and want you to do your best to succeed. One thing I would change is maybe more parking space.
Freshman,4,Georgia Gwinnett College is a great college. It provides opportunities at a low cost which is great.
Sophomore,4,During orientation the president made it very clear about his mission on making college life easy and he was very welcoming and overall it was just a feeling of readiness and was prepared to start my education here.
Freshman,4,The school is on the smaller side which I personally like. The facilities are top notch and so is the education.
Freshman,4,"Honestly, I originally thought it was a community college. But when I got there the campus was pretty big and I realized that it was a University, which was pretty cool.  I might be a bit bias with this being my first time going to college, but I firmly believe that this school is a pretty amazing place. All of my professors seem open and helpful, not nearly as antagonistic I have seen them as on the movies. Though if there was anything that I could change about the school it would be the food. Though I might be a bit spoiled (my Mom has always made the best food), but the food isn't really up to my standard. My mother spoiled me, I suppose. But despite that, the food is still..bearable? Yup, bearable. I can totally stand eating it for four years. Definitely."
Niche User,4,"If you enjoy a smaller campus, this college may be a good match for you. Since this college is not on the bigger side, the professors are more personal. For example, if you have a question for your professor, you can easily email them with your GGC email address, and they respond in a timely manner."
Freshman,4,"When I went to the orientation for GGC, I was quite fascinated by how much technology and how up to date it was. This college is very large and seems extremely secure to what I was observing. It had many new computers, building structures, and the food seemed excellent. I was very surprised at how orderly everything seemed to be and play out. I was very fond of how the instructors were doing everything and how well thoroughly were answering every important question headed their way. Finally, this college seemed to be the perfect college to learn and excell to higher lengths."
Freshman,4,"This is a very quiet college, but the campus is beautiful and peaceful. the work there is guided to shift the new age of college students and I truly believe this is a 21st century campus. I recommend this to everyone"
Freshman,4,"My first year at Georgia Gwinnett College was was amazing. I had easy commute to the school and easy learning enviornent to really try and succeed at the higher level of learning. This school is also well equipped with a diverse scene and having a part of experinceing diffrent paths of life within each student who walks through the campus. I have yet to expreince the extracurricular and sporting events since it is still my first year here. However, this school is still keeps suprising me with how much ease it is to go to a 4 year level school with easy acces and none of the finacial burden other schools with throw at you."
Junior,4,Georgia Gwinnett College is a wonderful institution. It is run like a well oiled machine. The students and staff alike are very friendly and make for a safe and effective learning environment.
Freshman,4,"A place where you can be yourself. A place where tutoring is available. A place where it's safe.  A place where the food is great. A place where attending is cost friendly. The classroom sizes are extremely low, your student-teacher ratio is about 20/1 which is perfect for a college. The dorms are magnificent you’re subjected to your own individual room among other roommates where you’ll share a bathroom depending on your room size."
Freshman,4,"GGC is a great affordable college. Most students are commuters with responsibilities outside of school, so there isn’t much to do on campus. It’s also a very small campus."
Sophomore,4,"I have  attended Georgia Gwinnett College, after transferring there from Valdosta State University. I love Georgia Gwinnett College because of the teachers, the students,  and how amazing they work together to have success"
Freshman,4,"Overall, Georgia Gwinnett College is a wonderful place . It is not as big a other colleges so you can get to your classes faster . The classes are very small so you have a better chance with talking with your teacher one on one. The students and the staff are very friendly. Lastly , the college is inexpensive as compared to other colleges."
Niche User,4,"As a dual enrollment student, I was not able to have the full college experience here but the professors are wonderful, very understanding and diverse. The counselors work with you and help you get adjusted."
Freshman,4,Georgia Gwinnett College has a very nice  campus in terms of the buildings and space around to hang out
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the class sizes at GGC. On average the class sizes do not exceed 29 students meaning there is time for one on one with professors. Professors also have to have a Ph.D. to work at GGC meaning you are receiving professors who really know what they are talking about. The downfall, in my opinion, is due to the school trying to help the students so much with jobs, that they hire the wrong individuals who slack and cause chaos for other students."
Sophomore,4,Tuition is not as expensive as other schools. Allows me to take a variety of online courses. Has a great faculty and staff that are very helpful in stressful situations.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the grand list of programs the school provides, and I love the learning environment the school creates for it's students. Overall, I can't wait to join the school this summer!"
Freshman,4,"Georgia Gwinnett college is a great college from what I can tell as a freshman , some professors weren’t that great but that’s with any school you go to , there are definitely great professors at GGC"
Freshman,4,"As a non-traditional student, I have found it easy to adapt to this institution.  Thus far, the instructors are fair and approachable. The college is a nice diverse and eclectic mix of staff, faculty and employees."
Senior,4,"Overall this is a very good school. They currently boast a national award winning nursing program. I have heard computer science students complain about the level of instruction they receive, but overall student satisfaction seems high. 
As with all colleges the administrative offices have their flaws. Information is not always given to students in a timely manner."
Senior,4,"One word: Affordable. If you are the type of student that needs personal attention, this school has it covered. Every class is set up to be small scaled purposely to aid each student. Every thing is up close that your classes are a five minute walk from each other. Coming from a big university, this school has helped me tremendously with adapting its culture and to maintain financial stability. Not only that, there are many clubs to join and events to attend."
Sophomore,4,I love the diversity. There are so many resources for mental health ON CAMPUS. The faculty isn’t intimidating and they are very intelligent therefore talking to them is easy. I would like the school to branch out further in college activities such as sororities and fraternities.  I’m so excited to see what Georgia Gwinnett College brings to the table in the future.
Senior,4,"I have had a great time at GGC. I enjoy the academics and the overall atmosphere. I am especially satisfied with the diversity at the school; everyone is different and you can find a crowd you can relate to. The diversity is not restricted to race alone. In addition to this, they have a great Chick-fil-a staff that  gets me coming back to get more everytime I go there to eat. The nature of the building is pleasing to my eye as I am a visual person. I like going to school for this reason. I love GGC!"
Junior,4,"Very crowded, not enough parking spaces. Teachers are alright. Food is good, definitely  a lot of diversity on the menu."
Sophomore,4,"Amazing school to receive one-on-one study time with professors. Along with the dedication each professor provides towards the personal learning experiences, the school is very affordable."
Sophomore,4,The college is extremely diverse and has well taken care of facilities. It is continuing to expand. It has only been around for about 13 years and due to that it feels modern and has constant internet access across the facility. There is a bit of a problem with parking since the school has very many commuters (including myself). Unfortunately does not have many sports programs but has many other interest groups and clubs. Many events are often held around campus.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at Georgia Gwinnett college. My experience so far has been amazing, it gave me a chance to get a sense of the college lifestyle and got a chance to meet new people in a such diverse campus. The college faculty and professors are really helpful in regards to any question or concerns you might have. In class, I have met professors that are so good at what they do but I have met professors who shouldn’t even be teaching. One thing I would like for the school to improve on is parking. Anytime of the day there is always a struggle to look for a parking spot and that has impacted me getting to class on time. Personally, they really need to construct more parking lots to comply with the vastly large number of students that attend this school. Overall,it has been a pleasantly fun experience and do recommend this school."
Sophomore,4,I really liked how the professors are willing to help the students. I remember my first day of class where I was afraid of meeting new teachers and students but the professors I took tried to make the class more engaging and how they where willing to help me improve in my studies. There are also tutoring services that helps the student when he/she doesn't understand something in class. Some of the  things that I think needs to improve is their parking services as you need to come to school early to get a parking space which ends up taking most of my time. The school also needs to create more scholarships for students based on their merit in order to give them a boost to learn harder.
Freshman,4,"As an upcoming freshmen, I want to feel welcomed and safe at my college. Georgia Gwinnett college  provides an environment with positivty and diversity. There are various clubs and opportunities for students to socialize and learn."
Sophomore,4,"It is a great school to attend very fine tuned small classes but I believe it has room to grow. The campus sort of reminds me of a glorified high school which is not a bad thing because it seems familiar in a sense. With that being said, I think they should expand the school by adding more teachers and adding activities along with that they could acquire the open land around them even if it is for a green space and not to put buildings. Georgia Gwinnett is a very young school opening its doors in only 2012, its student population has grown larger than the campus itself. I think thats the only problem the school has which that the faculty doesn't realize the school is bigger than what it really is. I think it was maybe a bit unexpected to grow at such an alarming rate, so the school itself needs to grow to accommodate the student body with more facilities and grow from a big high school to an actual college campus."
Freshman,4,This coming up fall will be my second semester at GGC.  I love the school its a fairly new school founded in 2006 has very updated to technology very efficient. I also stayed in housing very nice sized rooms compared to other universities it is decently priced. Students especially residents tend to be very involved I will love to continue to grow and learn at this school. Academically its exceptional as well just wish there was an expansion of some majors and academic programs that are provided.
Freshman,4,This college is very diverse. One thing I would change would be offering more scholarships and help to students who are not in state tuition so they feel more welcomed.
Niche User,4,I am a parent of a student that attended the college and i like the environment because it was safe as well as the academics.  Very good school
Sophomore,4,"I started going to GGC 2 years ago and I'm very well pleased with it! The small classroom sizes and simple type of feel the campus is good! The school food isn't the best but it's still improving as well as the parking and school atmosphere! But, most of all the tuition is cheap and affordable to anyone who's starting to try to get into college."
Niche User,2,"I did dual enrollment here. I will have to say, the office staff is absolutely horrible. I'd recommend applying as early as possible. If you call them you will be put on hold with awful music for about 30-45 minutes, and the rude staff will tell you ""we'll get to it"" and they never do. You almost have to be a Karen to get them to do things. Academics were ok. Campus sucked, but it's a commuter campus so you know what you're getting in to. Do dual enrollment or stay a year or 2 but don't stay all 4 years. Campus is put on lockdown a couple of times a semester when there's an armed robbery at the Walmart. Traffic is terrible in the mornings. You'll leave very early and sit in your car in the parking lot for 30 minutes before your class. Parking is terrible, nobody knows how to park, and some of the lots are dirt. The lots are also kind of far away from classrooms."
Freshman,2,Housing is full of students that use drugs . The academics are great but are negatively effected by the students lack of class .
Freshman,2,The internet at this college is by far some of the worst internet i have ever experienced. Everyday they’re issues with connecting and loading web pages. It’s even worse in the dorm houses!!! I have to wait till the weekend just to get decent quality. Very frustrating and would not recommend this college to anyone who’s a gamer or content streamer.
Niche User,2,"The majority of the faculty held contempt for the students and never wanted to help when students asked.  Once I asked my teacher if she could go over a quiz with me and she responded that she had a second job and she didn't have time for me.  Also, most of the online resources and books malfunction on a weekly basis, making it difficult to complete my homework."
Senior,2,"First two years attending this college was amazing as a college student experience the college life. However as I attended for 3 more years, the college campus became overcrowded and the college system such as paying for its listed fees were unnecessary and unhelpful in pursuing my college degree. Parking is a nightmare. The infrastructure is always under construction since its next to a main highway. There is a scarcity in professors that actually have time to teach the material and to provide effective feedback. There are not even enough electives or courses to provide to the students. Although this college has its negatives, its best features are: its small class count for professors to engage with the students more effectively than a huge auditorium; its diversity in the students and professors; and the local area of the city for socializing."
College Sophomore,2,We really don't have this at my campus so it's kind of hard to decipher
College Sophomore,2,"It is very difficult to try to get all the necessary classes, specially for freshmen and sophomores. The registration process is fairly easy. The downside of the study areas is that people will take up the rooms to watch Netflix or play games on their electronics."
College Sophomore,2,There is not a greek life on campus yet since the school started only 10 years ago. I wish they had it because I think it is a great way to be involved with the school and meet new people.
College Sophomore,2,My college doesn't have them.
College Freshman,2,"they take forever to do things and the processes wasn't very clear, they have terrible communication"
College Sophomore,2,"It is pretty dry, but there are some occasionally."
College Student,2,you can get in trouble for listenng to music
College Student,2,It was confusing children work on the phones and give out wrong info
College Student,2,there arent alot of choices limited menu
College Student,2,there is nothing to do but stay in your room or go home for the weekends
Recent Alumnus,2,"The campus is strict if you don't know who to know. I would suggest getting friendly with SGA members and finding out information if possible. As a fairly upright student, didn't effect me but I know a lot of people got busted for doing really dumb things."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Good luck! The communication is atrocious and after you graduate, you still receive mail about signing up for the next year."
College Freshman,2,No party scene in the suburbs. Security is super strict.
College Sophomore,2,The food is only worth eating if you are extremely hungry.
College Sophomore,2,Most students here are older or are planning on transferring so there is low school spirit but you can see many wearing the logo.
College Junior,2,I'm not really familiar about it.l
College Freshman,2,you dont really see parties in campuss.
College Junior,2,"The financial aid process is painstaking and tests patience. Advice is to go early; at around 7:30a to 12p, usually before the most busy hours. Also, do your part so you don't have to wait a long period of time there."
College Junior,2,"I am a mathematics major with a concentration in applied math. It had an intense and somewhat tedious workload. There are plenty of organizations that cater to math majors, such as the Math and Engineering Club."
College Freshman,2,GGC is a new school and no one really supports our varsity teams because everyone is either transferring out to another college or they just don't care.
College Freshman,2,The party are more like gatherings. Free snacks and low attendance when hosted by clubs. There's music though. There are no real parties.
College Freshman,2,"I don't see much athletes around. They probably practice in areas were classes are not being taught such as the athletic facilities. Games are hosted, attendances are maybe okay (haven't been to one). School spirit for the athletics - people go to the gym to work out, but cheering for the athletics - I don't see that."
College Student,2,"No alcohol, even if you are over the age of 21. The school is pretty strict about everything."
College Student,2,"Not that many majors compared to other schools, but it's alright."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There's not many parties on campus, everything is either off campus or in Athens/Atlanta."
College Junior,2,"As long as you get everything turned in before the deadlines, you will have absolutely no problems obtaining financial aid."
College Junior,2,Nobody really parties around here. People will either go to Atlanta for a party or to Athens.
College Sophomore,2,never been in the gym
College Sophomore,2,"financial aid workers are not friendly, rude, do not answer the questions asked"
College Senior,2,The student account  office told me that i had enough financial aid for Fall 2014 but they dropped my classes. I had to pay out of pocket at last minute.
College Sophomore,2,"I am not getting a ""true"" college experience, I plan to transfer in one years time."
College Sophomore,2,A dining plan is required even though most students commute. The dining hall is not open past 8
College Freshman,2,Not much school spirit and not too many choices or attendance.
College Freshman,2,The housing expenses are half of my loan paired with the meal plan and there are really strict rules inside dorms like no removing furniture along with it being a dry campus.
College Junior,2,we are not near many things to have in atlanta thats more GA STATE
College Junior,2,There are majority blacks on campus and they are not a good representation of that community. A lot of them are ignorant in more ways than one and its so annoying to pass them on my way to check in the residence building. We need more diversity on campus.
College Junior,2,GGC used to be a place where I felt at ease towards college life. There wasn't many parties or kickbacks in the past so it wasn't wild and crazy like most colleges but this past year they've become ridiculously strict. Because of how strict they've become I now feel as if I'm a prisoner and hate staying on campus there. Visitation rules are ridiculous and they treat us as if were still in high school and not up and coming adults. The rules are way too strict and most residents would agree.
College Freshman,2,The process to have visitors is tiresome and annoying. I am an adult and I do not feel like going through the process.
College Freshman,2,"Certain buildings are really far from the dorms, and it can get really cold. Also walking in pouring rain is annoying."
College Sophomore,2,No real clubs or bars anywhere near the campus.
College Sophomore,2,It's not enough student discount like other colleges.
College Junior,2,Since it is a community college there are no shuttles or trains or buses for school.
College Junior,2,There is not much greek life since the school is still growing and getting a good student base.
College Sophomore,2,"There are a couple gas stations, McDonalds, a Chick-fil-a, and a few other places that serve fast food."
College Sophomore,2,"I have not heard of anyone talking about games on campus. I don't know any athletes, and I have never seen anyone playing these sports."
College Junior,2,The only way you can get to campus is commuting or living in dorms.
College Junior,2,"There are many locations on campus where the sewage isn't good, so if it rains, there are lots of puddles and cloggage all around campus"
College Junior,2,Financial aid does not support my tuition.
College Junior,2,"There is no sufficient transportation. 
"
College Senior,2,"Options if you drive. If not, long walks to find."
College Senior,2,Doesn't always work (tech or net). 10/pg to print.
College Senior,2,Not for nontraditional students. No classes.
College Student,2,I always had something missing from financial aid and they wouldn't let me know so trying to find out why I couldn't get my reward was annoying. 
College Sophomore,2,there are no close clubs.
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid office always seems swamped, short-handed, and horrible customer service."
Freshman,1,"My son attended the school for one semester and dropped out.  The professors are subpar, I wouldn't send my kids here is my honest opinion.  Graduation rate is 17% that speaks volumes.  The other issue we have is he dropped out without notifying anyone and he now owes 1060.00 dollars.  I called them to arrange a one time payment deal and they denied my offer, saying we don't negotiate payments.  They also have this in collections already and they use mob style  pretend to be lawyers to scare you!  BAD SHOOL OVERALL !!!  But then again you get what you pay for!"
Graduate Student,1,"I took all my classes on campus because there wasn't any classes offered online. Georgia Gwinnett College is fairly new so they are a little behind compared to most schools. However, I enjoyed attending the school because it was local. I did not have to commute very far and I completed the program."
Sophomore,1,A lot of professors do not inform first year students that attendance contributes to your grade. There is not enough student activities on campus. This school is basically trial and error college.
Niche User,1,"When I went to their preview day, their sales pitch to come to their school, they waited until after the event started about 30 or 45 minutes and then one of their police officers  ran a police canine dog through everyone in the crowd.  I’d be willing to bet their “diversity” drops after you’re accepted."
Niche User,1,"Georgia Gwinnett College is very misleading. Business Majors beware of accreditation. Though the school as a whole is accredited, their business program is NOT !! Google and go on to the schools website and type in Business Program Accreditation. You will see that the program is not accredited, nor has it ever been. I caught it early and I'm glad that I did . I wanted to write this post so that more students are aware and don't waste their time and money. The campus is new and fresh and beautiful but don't let that blind you from doing your research ."
Freshman,1,"This school was horribly disorganized, they do absolutely NOTHING to help you out with any problems you may have."
Niche User,1,"The faculty lack the credentials to match their arrogance. I felt the teachers, for the most part, spoke down to the students as if they didn't belong in college. The classes are filled with busy work. The teachers lack the academic and professional experience to add anything to the lectures. I transferred to a major university and life become much more enjoyable. Learning become the focus instead of submission to ego."
Recent Alumnus,1,"In the one semester I attended at GGC, I had more problems than the 2+ years that I spent at my previous college. I was promised a wonderful school with great curriculum and everything. What I got was a school that is incredibly disorganized and way too many charges. This school doesn't care about its students, only the money that comes out of their pockets."
College Freshman,1,We do not have Greek life at our school. Georgia Gwinnett College is very boring.
College Freshman,1,There is no campus life. Therefore there is no Greek Life. Overall the campus is not very social at all. There are barley ever any parties and such things going on.
College Freshman,1,I have yet to hear about any sports games. There is no school spirit.
College Sophomore,1,"Their is no greek life here, I wish there was because I would love to join a sorority"
College Sophomore,1,"I contact the financial aid office and no one gets back with me, and I even go in and no one can give straight answers."
College Student,1,Georgia Gwinnett is a dry campus and doesn't even allow tobacco.
College Student,1,My brother can't spend a night because he is the opposite sex from me
College Freshman,1,"Since it's a small school, you have to travel far!"
College Freshman,1,Cops here really go out of their way to give as many tickets as they can.
College Sophomore,1,no parties that are legitimate parties except for on-capmus events through clubs.
College Freshman,1,we don't have a greek life.
College Freshman,1,"there are no parties, and if there were a party on campus it would get shut own in 3.1 seconds"
College Freshman,1,we really dont have greek life at GGC which is sad
College Senior,1,I cannot speak to this question as I am a 37 years mother who does not attend parties on campus.
College Student,1,"Nothing really happens here, it's a strictly dry campus and very boring."
College Junior,1,I found it difficult to answer these questions as there is no Greek Life on campus.
College Sophomore,1,only one sorority. Members are kind of looked down upon compared to other schools.
College Sophomore,1,There are no varsity sports on campus. Soccer and softball are the only popular sports. The gym is small
College Freshman,1,"GGC IS EXTREMELY STRICT. DO NOT, I REPEAT, DO NOT DRINK OR SMOKE ANYTHING, ANYWHERE AROUND THIS PLACE. It's an earful if you do."
College Junior,1,The financial aid office is the absolute worse process new students often have to face upon entering this school. I remember I waited 5+ hours to be seen because they are so unorganized and low staff to help the excess amount of people that have to deal with these problems. My advice would be to check your banner account and contact the finical aid office ASAP in the summer time or with a lot of time in advance to get any necessary documents in so you can avoid the stress.
College Freshman,1,extremely boring and very strict security no one trusts the residents and there is nothing to do at night here.
College Freshman,1,they don't provide you wiht much options and they barely give you any money.
College Freshman,1,the strictness is ridiculous in the dorms the security guards do not and probably will never trust us. They have locked several doors to enter the 1000 building to keep out potential threats when they should just hire more security. the walls are very thin so there are many noise violations.
College Senior,1,Everyone commutes mostly in their own cars.
College Sophomore,1,"10,000 students and about 2,500 parking spaces for students"
College Sophomore,1,"This is a commuter school, but there are no shuttles or anything to get there if you do not own a car."
College Freshman,1,"Parking is really bad here. There are a lot of commuters making finding a parking space difficult. GGC is growing with over 10,000 students and parking spaces are becoming harder to find. Campus police are quick to write citations to someone who parks in a restricted spot, but who really has a choice when your about to be late to class. Get on campus way before your class starts to avoid this situation."
College Freshman,1,No night life. The campus becomes a ghost town.
College Sophomore,1,I do not know of any bars in the area.
College Junior,1,"There are never enough parking spots. You usually are required to get to campus before school starts. The school is adding on buildings, therefore taking away the little parking spaces we had to begin with."
Recent Alumnus,1,"The athletics program has taken over GGC. Although they have a state-of-the-art facility since they only recently finished building it, our teams are awful. Also, the athletics program has proven to me that GGC has officially shifted its focus from academics to sports. I had several baseball players in one of my classes in Spring 2013, and they were absent from 95% of the sessions because of practice or games. Needless to say, they didn't perform well in the class (or any of their other classes) and were at risk of being put on probation from playing because their grades were too low even by GGC standards. It's a shame that GGC has placed so much emphasis on sports in recent years because they want to make themselves more ""competitive"" against GSU, Georgia Tech, and UGA, but in the process have let academics fall by the wayside."
College Sophomore,1,They are so slow on getting students their scholarships and they still haven't updated my HOPE GPA status from spring semester so now I have to wait for the next semester to get my scholarship.
College Junior,1,There really is no off-campus housing. I am fairly certain there is only one apartment complex within a 3 mile radius of campus.
College Freshman,1,Majors are diverse. But the programs are not challenging.
College Freshman,1,Facilities are sub par. The technology is outdated.
College Freshman,1,Poor class atmosphere. Unenthusiastic professors. Disengaged students. Discussion is not encouraged. Academics are not challenging.
College Sophomore,1,"My experience didn't go as smoothly as I'd hoped for lack of information on their part, especially during my very first year of school. I had absolutely no idea what to do."
College Sophomore,1,"No transportation at all, if you come to this school have a car."
College Freshman,1,"Lawrenceville is a horrible town, there is nothing interesting to do and it is a really small with nothing going on."
College Sophomore,1,Transportation at Georgia Gwinnett College is not available students pay a hundred dollars for parking and transportation even if we don't have cars. theirs no bus or any form of transportation giving and the local stores in the area are not walking distances because of heavy traffic.
College Freshman,1,Parking really sucks. You have to get here by seven if you want to be closer to your classes.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is an extreme nightmare. If you have morning class around 8am, you won't have a problem, but any later then that, you might have to ride around the parking areas for 30 minutes just to find a spot. GGC took alot of our parking lot with construction of their new building. I suggest you to come early that way your not late to class."
College Sophomore,1,"The only parking that has guaranteed availability is the parking garage. It is a 15 minute walk from most class buildings. If you park in visitor or staff parking out of haste, you'll be ticketed $50 an offense. You won't be able to register for classes or anything until tickets are paid."
College Freshman,1,Parking at GGC is horrible. There's not enough parking!
College Freshman,1,"GGC currently does not have any type of transportation options yet, so its just basic commute from home to school, which is a big hassle since we have very limited parking spaces now."
College Freshman,1,The drug scene is pretty much all the students talk about. If you do not smoke weed be prepared to be left out of certain social activities.
College Junior,1,Parking is a NIGHTMARE! If you have to get to class and you park in visitor parking even if you are a student be prepared to pay a $35.00 fine that they put on your record and you can not pick classes until you pay the fee.
College Junior,1,There is always traffic and they don't provide some sort of shuttle or local transit that goes there.
College Freshman,1,They don't have an art major which is kind of where since there logo states creativity in it.
College Freshman,1,There isn't supposed to be any greek life for fear of hazing yet there are still people who hand out flyers for sororities. Definitely not the best school if you want to be involved in greek life.
College Sophomore,1,If you don't have an early morning class be prepared to park in the back of the dorms and have to walk to your classes. There's not enough parking spaces for how many students attend this school it may take you 20 mins to find a spot
College Freshman,1,"the parking lot is only vacant in the early morning, in the night, and on the weekends. You would have to circle the parking lot for like 25 mins just to find 1 spot near any of the buildings. Especially on Mondays in the afternoon."

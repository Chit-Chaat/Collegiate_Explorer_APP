Sophomore,5,"Professors are very easy with online learning, as they are struggling as well. But they will set strict due dates so it is good to keep a calendar!"
Sophomore,5,"Canisius College has a very beautiful campus, except for the parking ramp. The ramp is legal and able to stand said by professionals, but sometimes it crumbles and it makes me afraid my car will get crushed. The professors are really nice if you get on their good side, which isn't hard. The students are very nice as well!"
Graduate Student,5,Online courses were amazing. Great professors. Quick response times  to questions. Professors really know content and care for students.
Freshman,5,"The professors are awesome and very helpful!
Its a perfect size (small) but also requires some walking. So many resources and everyone wants you to do your best."
Sophomore,5,"I love Canisius College, it was everything I have expected it to be. I have made wonderful friends here, the atmosphere is not really diverse, but it is what you make it. College have allowed me to be more open things that I was scared of doing before, and even just going out more in general. I love how many club they have here, I personally enjoyed the Afro club and Colleges Against Caner Club. The campus is very safe, so you do not having nothing worry about.
I would totally recommend students to attend a Kairos Retreat, it is so refreshing especially if you are going to be a incoming freshman."
Junior,5,"Canisius college is great on all terms when we look at education; athletics, small class sizes and the professors are so close to work with.  If I have to rate 1 through 10 then, I would rate 10 out of 10 because everything is great and it's easy to get involved with others. My experience so far on Canisius college was great because I was accepted in HEOP program (Higher education programs) also the staffs and professors were nice to get involved with."
Niche User,5,"When I went on my tour, I had a very kind, funny, informational tour guide. I felt very welcomed by the other students who attend Canisius College. I also liked how small the campus was. It was very easy to get around. At the end of the tour, they gave me a free t-shirt!"
Freshman,5,"Visited once along with many other colleges in the area, can’t wait to start here in the fall of 2019"
Niche User,5,"As a new student being welcomed onto campus for the first time, I was immediately greeted by faculty and current students. they asked me if I knew where I was going and if I needed help."
Senior,5,Canisius is a very student friendly school. Administrators are very helpful to the students and are very knowledgeable
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy the help i have gotten from all of canisius staff. They are extremely understanding and very friendly. I would choose canisius over and over again.
Freshman,5,"Canisius College is a great college. If you’re looking for a small school then Canisius is the right one. Being at Canisius has been a great first year experience as a college student, not what I expected my first year to be. Canisius has many great opportunities for students as well as resources to help you succeed."
Sophomore,5,"I love the close knit feel, and community style learning.  I wish we had more opportunities to work with the community than just service learning, and that more on campus jobs were available to students who do not qualify for work study.   I would also love to see housing that allows for pets on campus without the need for emotional support animal paperwork to be filled out."
Sophomore,5,Canisius has brought me out of my shell. There's constant opportunities to join various clubs and teams. Everyone is inviting. The work is hard but its worth it in the long run.
Sophomore,5,"The campus atmosphere is 1 in a million, everyone is extremely friendly and trustworthy, the professors are amazing, the academics are engaging and interesting. Not to mention the variety of things offered to do on campus or through the clubs and programs the college offers. Truly an all around great college, it offers a little of everything to everyone and does it all so well"
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere at Canisius. At the start of the year you see people running all over the place to hug their friends. This never stops all school year. It truly feels like home.
Freshman,5,"Canisius College is a great place to attend college. The professors and advisors truly show that they care about you. It is a small environment where you have the opportunity to know and get close to a lot of students, professors and advisors. It is located in a great area that is close to downtown Buffalo but far enough away where you are safe."
Freshman,5,"Canisius College is the most caring and most social college one can come to. If one is shy then don't worry the college helps you break out of the shell with how social everyone is here. There is never a time that there is nothing to do, there is always events to attend and clubs to join. Professors are amazing they really give you the attention you need, and they actually hear you if you approach them."
College Freshman,5,Small class sizes. Lots of course options
College Senior,5,"The qualities of the courses are challenging. In my part, all my professors have PhD degree, so all my classes are very challenging. Overall, I like my classes and professors."
College Senior,5,"I never had a problem with the college on this matter. Public Safety have shuttles running until 2:00am on campus, and they go around campus 24-7. I feel very safe around campus."
College Sophomore,5,Positive impacted parties on student experience.
College Sophomore,5,I am very happy to be at Canisius College and it has helped me grow as a person and academically.
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is accepting and open to each other
College Sophomore,5,Everyone on campus is aware of the consequences of drugs and underage use of alcohol.
College Sophomore,5,I am not very aware of that at the moment.
College Sophomore,5,I made a great choice regardless of the distance away from home and I am very lucky to have the opportunity to be there.
College Sophomore,5,I feel as safe as I would be with my own family.
College Sophomore,5,It's my great and loving second home!
College Sophomore,5,I love watching the basketball games because they are the best.
College Freshman,5,I couldn't have asked for better courses or professors. I have been very welcomed and a professor even asked for me to be in work study.
College Freshman,5,"We have visitors from businesses all the time and when the time comes for me, I have the student center and  job center to go to for help."
College Freshman,5,"Dorming is extraordinary to me. I was leary at first, but I am safe, its fun. I have quiet when I need it and I got lucky with a great room mate."
College Freshman,5,I don't partake but some of my friends do and they say they are very welcoming. Non clicky.
College Freshman,5,Its homey and sporty at the same time !
College Freshman,5,Canisus is the perfect fit for me. I take my studies very seriously and I am doing very well. My professors are the best and I made the Deans list so I am proud of my accomplishments.
College Freshman,5,"Canisius College is one of the best choices that I have made in my life. I have had nothing but good experiences, from friends I've made, professors I have had, and school events that I have attended. The school has a strong Jesuit foundation that shapes the way the student learns and how everyone interacts with each other. They let each person grow on their own, whether it be with in the Catholic faith or not, and always offer support. If I could do it all over, I would definitely choose Canisius College again. The ""homey"" atmosphere that the campus and people provide for the individual make Canisius the most unique college that I applied to a year ago."
Recent Alumnus,5,"I absolutely love this school and the department (Anthrozoology). The entire staff is helpful, friendly, and supportive."
Recent Alumnus,5,This was my dream school and I was overwhelmed when I learned I got in. The staff and professors have been very professional and friendly. I feel cared about on an individual level and have the support of the entire department.
College Freshman,5,I've never really felt like I've ever been around anyone who cares about their education as much as I do.
College Freshman,5,I'm a minority and I've never felt out of place
College Freshman,5,"For computer science, if you do the work and make the connections, you are pretty much guaranteed a job"
College Freshman,5,"Professors, unlike common belief, are actually here to help you master your skills that you will be using when you one day get a job"
College Freshman,5,"Canisius is a great school for students who want to get one on one with faculty and staff to get the most out of their education. Although it may seem like the general Ed requirements may seem a little bit annoying, they are helpful in the long run"
Recent Alumnus,5,Everyone is welcoming and really enjoys going there. Go Canisius!
Recent Alumnus,5,most majors require an internship and many have a 99-100% job placement rate
Recent Alumnus,5,The sport teams have a large fan base and many people attend games.
Recent Alumnus,5,Canisius is all about reaching your full potential and making your dreams come true. The staff are all wonderful and there is a wide variety of courses to take.
College Senior,5,"Canisius College is a wonderful academic institution. The program I am in is called Animal Behavior, Ecology, and Conservation (ABEC), and it is the most thorough and impressive animal behavior program in the country. I feel that I will be very prepared for the real world upon graduation. The campus is small, which makes getting around very easy. There are also a ton of things to do on and off campus. The professors and faculty at the college are very knowledgable and very friendly; in three years I have never had a bad experience."
College Sophomore,5,Always a clean place can be found.
College Sophomore,5,"Western New York is known for its food quality, quantity, and variety."
College Sophomore,5,Strong leadership with vision for the future of education in a global economy.
College Sophomore,5,Most undergrads receive some type of monetary award that lowers costs.
College Sophomore,5,LOVE IT! I never even want to live off of campus.
College Sophomore,5,I feel safe and the rules are not overbearing. Public Safety is very accessible and reliable. Buffalo isn't the safest neighborhood so practice caution.
College Sophomore,5,"I love living on campus. Coming from NYC, you dream of having a traditional experience of any kind and Canisius really gives its residence the traditional on-campus experience. I love it!"
College Freshman,5,Canisius was the first college in NY to get public safety. They have full police power and have even been praised by the FBI and the government. They are very kind and are always there to protect you. Sure there are some instances of break ins or violence but we are all notified in a timely manner and we are not shielded from any events that occur.
College Freshman,5,"My major, ABEC, is the best in the nation. I am learning a ton and it's an extremely fantastic program with very established, funny and charismatic professors. The ABEC major means you are part of the ABEC family and it's awesome."
College Senior,5,The alumni are really interested in helping students find jobs. 90% of students applying to medical and law schools get in. Something like 89% of students find full-time jobs or go to grad schools upon graduation.
College Senior,5,I haven't left Canisius for more than a month since I matriculated. That should speak for itself.
Senior,4,"I took a few classes online, and each time they went well. Professors do their best at communicating expectations clearly and are always available to answer questions if need be. Resources are easily accessible online, making it easy to go through course materials and complete assignments. Exams are open book for the most part, making it easy to do well in the courses."
Senior,4,"Canisius is a small school that has a great campus community. Class sizes are small, professors truly care and want to get to know you, and everyone here does their best to help you succeed. There are student activities every week and the student body is always involved and makes the events fun!"
Sophomore,4,"COVID19 forced online learning. Although it was not an ideal circumstance, the professors adapted very quickly and made online learning as painless as possible."
Sophomore,4,"Canisius College is a fantastic, small liberal arts school. The class sizes are great and there are lots of opportunities for collaboration with faculty. If anything, the only downfall to being a small school is the lack of student engagement in programing and school spirit."
Freshman,4,I like the small campus. I see familiar faces every day. There are a ton of events to attend and the food is pretty good. There are lots of choices. The professors also care about the students and their participation. Overall I have had a very pleasant experience during my first year here.
Freshman,4,The teachers and the staff are fantastic. They are patient and willing to work with the students. I love being at Canisius and I know that my future is in good hands.
Freshman,4,The math department is very good. The orchestra is fun to be part of. And the music minor is fun. The college is great in general.
Freshman,4,"I love the campus, there is so much to do and explore. I also love the students and faculty, they are like family. One change I would like to see is no rats in the dorms."
Sophomore,4,"I love the academic programs at Canisius as well as the professors' passion for not only the things they teach but teaching in general. The food is not great and there is certainly a lack of diversity on campus, but I think the diversity issue is something that the school has been working really hard to change. Canisius is small which allows every student to receive the attention that they need and makes every student feel important. The small class sizes are probably my favorite thing about Canisius. Additionally, there are quite a few clubs to join on campus and it is super fun to get involved and make friends that way."
Sophomore,4,"Really amazing opportunities in the Animal Behavior Ecology and Conservation program. Pretty good professors who care about their students! The dining hall is pretty bad. Overall I've had awesome experiences here, but I feel as if they're pretty isolated to the ABEC program. The classes aren't always very challenging, in my opinion, but I am learning things."
Junior,4,Canisius is a good school. I love the small environment. The teachers work well with the students and they are very helpful.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus and the professors. It is a small school, so you can connect with people on a very personal level. There is not a lot of parties on campus, but the school is very close to party schools, which is better because you can come home to a peaceful dorm room."
Sophomore,4,"I love Canisius, it's a nice little school with a lot of opportunities offered to the students. I feel like I am able to take advantage of all they have to offer."
Junior,4,"It's a nice, small campus located in the heart of Buffalo (and just a subway ride from Downtown) where there is plenty to do during your free time."
Junior,4,"Canisius College is a good school academically. The honors program there is challenging but rewarding because you can take various classes on topics that are not typically available to students. There is a diverse culture at the college, as there are clubs for different ethnic groups. The area surrounding the college is not very safe, which is why the college only gets four stars. There are shootings every year that occur very close to the campus. The public safety officers are always around the campus, and they carry guns, but it still does not feel like a safe environment. Overall I am happy with my time at Canisius."
Graduate Student,4,"The program I am involved in at Canisius is an amazing program that I would recommend to anyone. However, as a graduate student I feel very disconnected from the whole college/college scene. As well, it can often be challenging to get in contact with important people about major, scheduling, and many other important decisions."
Alum,4,"This school is so small that students get the attention they need from professors. The library is the best library a college student could ask for. There is very little parking for commuters and the location is not the safest. However, my overall experience with Canisius College was fantastic. This college makes it easy to learn and succeed with the amazing staff that they have hired."
Alum,4,"I loved getting to know my community and make the friends and experience that I did. The classes were engaging and made it easy to get help if needed. The food was sub par, but there are a BUNCH of local restaurants near by! Party life is pretty dull if that's something you're super into I may reconsider your school choice."
Freshman,4,"Smaller class sizes, you get to know you're teachers and the students around you, always lots of club meetings and events, lots of tutoring and advisement available to help you out."
Freshman,4,"Overall I have enjoyed my time at Canisius. I live being in the city and having lots around us to explore/visit. He campus holds a lot of fun events and gives away free stuff often. The food is not great at all- I wish there was more healthy options. Otherwise, I’ve found my time at Canisius to be enjoyable."
Alum,4,Great campus with great faculty and staff.  Professors who genuinely want students to succeed.  Manageable class sizes.
Freshman,4,Canisius is a great school if you’re looking for small class sizes and a tight knit community. It is very easy here to make connections and get to know professors and faculty. The city of Buffalo is a great college city where you can find lots to do and many places to eat and drink. Overall it is a fun place to be and I know I’m getting a great education.
Niche User,4,"Canisius has a beautiful campus, a good academic programs, great dorms, and all the people are very nice!"
Works Here,4,"Canisius College has a beautiful campus nestled into a busy section of Main St. in North Buffalo. While this is a private school so tuition is expensive, the school has been committed to lowering costs and providing financial aid and scholarship opportunities. Canisius faculty and staff truly care about the well being and safety of the students here. Canisius has great campus security that works tirelessly to keep the community safe."
Sophomore,4,I like that Canisius is a very small college. There is always a familiar face around the corner. I also like the small class sizes that allow for me to ay better attention.
Sophomore,4,"My only complaint with the school is the price tag. I feel it is an amazing school that offers great majors, just it is limited by financials. Some majors have it better off than others. The student population is amazing, the professors are so wonderful, and the city of Buffalo is so easy to fall in love with!"
Senior,4,I love Canisius because it's comfortable for me. It has small classes and you are able to connect with your professors. They are very inviting and friendly. Each professor is different and you can learn so much from them. The campus is beautiful especially the Quad during the winter. The underground tunnels help during the winter if you don't like the cold. There is something for everyone and a variety of clubs for everyone even if you commute.
College Freshman,4,They have lots of different opportunities
College Freshman,4,They have lots of security measures in place
College Freshman,4,I love living on the honors floor
College Freshman,4,What makes my school unique is the small class sizes
Recent Alumnus,4,"A degree is a degree no matter where you get it from but, in the real world its just an added bounus and it gives you great pride to say you graduated from Canisius."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I havent been attending Canisius long but so far I feel very good about my safety and security. The students, for the most part, take these things seriously but drinking is an issue."
College Senior,4,"Based on my major, I was not able to get information about jobs. On the other hand, I have seen the college organizing job fair every semester in which students have the opportunities to have more information from employers. That's what I call a win-win situation."
College Senior,4,"I live in an apartment with 4 bed/2 baths. It is very cozy, but I wish there was an opportunity for adult students to have 1/1 apartments available. They have them, but only for RAs...not fair."
College Senior,4,"I was able to support the athletes; however, with many homework and a job, I was not able to appreciate to see many sports. Besides, my favorite sports are played during the summer when I'm not in town."
College Senior,4,"The college is a magnificent place. Every single professor has a PhD degree in which the classes are very challenging. However, that will help every student to succeed in the field of study. I'm very satisfy and happy with the college."
College Sophomore,4,they are always on their stuff sometimes
College Sophomore,4,"I have heard great things, but it is not something that I am interested in."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school and even though I am very far from home, I am glad that I found my second home which is my college."
College Freshman,4,I feel safe but of course since our school is in the City we have the general public to worry about. Not the students that go here.
College Freshman,4,"School spirit at Canisius is high, especially when versing the rival school, Niagara University."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Although the field is relatively new in the US, it is growing and I have no doubt that I will have the assistance of professors and my peers when applying for jobs following graduation."
College Senior,4,"I strongly believe that Canisius has a strong reputation in WNY, so I think we can find a job after graduation easily."
College Senior,4,"Fortunately I did not have any issues with health and safety, so far so good."
College Senior,4,"I used to live on campus, but it was way too expensive. Thus, I liked it pretty much."
College Senior,4,"The Athletic Center is good, but the equipment is a bit old."
Recent Alumnus,4,Canisius offers a large array of internship and research opportunities.  Many professors are looking for help in lower level classes or research labs that can help in your education.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Professors want you to succeed in their classes and want to hear what you have to say about ideas or topics.  However, at a college level course if you do not show effort in class or on class work professors aren't going to hod your hand and make you learn the material.  To get their help on something it is as easy as simply asking for assistance and they will often clear large amounts of their time to help you as much as you need as long as you are willing to put forth the effort so are they."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Safety is great, the small campus and tunnel system allows for a very safe environment however if you leave campus and stray to the outside limits closer to outside of Canisus' boundaries it is less than desired.  Often it is unsafe to be outside the boundaries however students are aware of this fact and will walk in groups or ensure girls have a safe walk with partners.  When walking around from house to house students make sure they walk in groups although this is only really an issue after dark.  During the day safety is not normally an issue."
Recent Alumnus,4,Living on campus is great and makes library late nights and getting to and from classes easy however it greatly raises tuition.
Recent Alumnus,4,Only a few fraternities and sororities exist at Canisius but that only makes them closer.  Both Greek students and sports team students both try to participate in as many community events including Canisius' Community Days.  Greek students tend to have more opportunities for community service and require a higher GPA to be Greek than is required by sports teams.  Greek students have better networking opportunities than Non-Greek students.  Greek students also have a larger academic support system than Non-Greek students.  Greeks are closer to other Greeks however Greeks often have close Non-Greek friends or friends who decided the Greek life wasn't a good fit for them and have left.
Recent Alumnus,4,the school and education was great however the tuition was hard to manage
College Freshman,4,I've never been pressured to do drugs
College Freshman,4,"Since its in buffalo, there are going to be occasional crimes, but nothing serious"
College Junior,4,"When students are robbed or feel unsafe, our public safety is on it immediately. They take their job very seriously and patrol the campus very closely. They never want students to feel unsafe, so they do whatever they need to to make sure all students are refrained from harms way."
College Junior,4,"Each major has a variety of internships which typically offer graduates jobs after they graduate because of how great they were at their internship. We now have this new thing called handshake which automatically connects students to employers and their companies. It allows the employers to look directly at student profiles, which make the job process much easier and less of a hassle."
College Junior,4,"The courses have been very interesting. We have to take a lot of core curriculum classes which can be a pain because it can be hard to focus on those classes and my majors classes. For the most part, the professors I had were really great. I do believe that they should get rid of some of the older professors because their teaching styles are out of date and some of them lack the communication skills needed to work with students."
College Junior,4,"I am not an athlete and I do not participate in intramurals or club sports, but I do attend the basketball games. Men basketball games are more important than women basketball games, but both teams work really hard. Every sports team at my college has practice almost everyday, sometimes at 5am in the morning and they all travel to other places for games, tournaments, etc. We have a club called C-block which goes to games and take up entire sections wearing Canisius gear and screaming out rants and chants. They make signs and get people to come out and support our athletes. Our athletic facilities are great in quality and we can take the shuttle vans to and from the facilities at any time."
College Student,4,Health and safety plays a big role when picking a school.
Junior,2,I loved the campus and the tour I attended in May but I am disappointed with the admissions office and the lack of help they gave me with my transfer process and I reached out multiple times.
Sophomore,2,"If you come w/ extremely high expectations you will likely be disappointed. Others agree, 6 of my friends are transferring and I am Fall 2018. Food is good at first, but the menu never changes so it gets old, open hours are bad. Its finals week and I have 100+ meal swipes left ( waste $). Elevators in the dorms broke 8 times this semester, sirens go off constantly at night. Tunnels only go to old main. So it's a 15min walk to HS in the sweltering sun or snow. Freshman who come in w/ transfer credits are screwed if they want to get into any classes other than their foundations ( ENG 101, RST 101, etc). If you get bored there's not a lot to do unless you have $ to spend. They also truly did not lower tuition, they cut hundreds of thousands of dollars in scholarships and your financial aid will now lower now too. However, each year I got around 5 ""free"" shirts and a pair of sweatpants!"
Freshman,2,"I personally was not happy with this school at all. The only thing that got me through it was an old friend from high school to be honest. After my first year, I just had to transfer. There wasn't enough to offer for what I wanted to do and the campus is felt so....depressing to me. There was only about 3 professors that I had in the whole year that I actually had felt they cared about their students. Diversity was just terrible. In every class I'd either be the only person of color or 1 of 2 in class. The amount of debt I have over tuition from that one year I attended is just sad too, I had to take out several loans because financial aid wasn't enough smh.
It's disappointing to say this because Canisius was my #1 option and I was so excited to be there when I went through the tour and orientation but as the school year went by, I just felt constant anxiety and stress and I just overall didn't feel as if I belonged there."
Freshman,2,"For the positives, the biology department is great.The honors program is also good, giving students cool options for classes and a small class size. The dorm buildings are nice for freshmen. As for the negatives, there are a lot. Student Life is horrible, I had 2 terrible roommate experiences that student life did the worst job handling and it left me depressed with no one to help me. Most of the students at this school are disrespectful and it seems that most only care about partying (which goes on every Friday and Saturday night in surrounding houses and dorm rooms). The athletes here get special treatment and it seems as though the school only cares about them. I do not feel safe at all on campus. The neighborhood is sketchy. Be very careful around here, in one year there have been 2 shootings in the area, a student getting harassed on the street nearby, and a student getting robbed on her way back to her dorm. The food is also terrible."
Freshman,2,"You can do better than this place. Most students here go to school because they have to, not because they want to. This is a safety school for better or worse. 
Financial aid is really good by private school standards. Food is hit or miss. It is a Jesuit school but all religions are accepted. Surrounding area is sketchy. Minimal school spirit, volunteerism, or extracurricular involvement. Expect to feel surrounded by Biology or ABEC (Animal Science) majors. Easy to feel isolated. Professors are great. However, you will either feel overwhelmed in work or feel that you have nothing to do; there is very little in-between. Housing options are good. 
Students here are very clique-ish. On Friday nights expect the student body to be at exclusive-feeling nearby house parties, working off-campus, or in their rooms watching Netflix. Study abroad options are poor. Wrong place to go if you wish to grow and feel intellectually stimulated. Bottom line, this place is a last resort."
College Freshman,2,"Not much around campus, everything closes at around 9-11PM. No good delivery/pick up options near campus. Best bet is to take the train to UB south and visit some of the places around there."
College Freshman,2,"Downtown can be nice, especially if you're going to a sporting event or a concert, but Buffalo in general is not a city you can just walk around and find stuff to do. You need to know the right areas to visit. Elmwood, Canal side, etc."
College Senior,2,"Main attraction is basketball and the team is not very good. Teams that are good, go unnoticed because no one seems to care about anything other than basketball."
College Senior,2,"Not much going on, usually. Unsafe area to walk around at night."
College Sophomore,2,There is not much diversity on my campus however I would love and welcome more.
College Sophomore,2,My school is not very generous with granting scholarships. I was on honor roll in high school and still did not receive the type of scholarship I believe that I truly deserved.
College Sophomore,2,It very small not many choices to choose from and the few we have aren't very popular.
College Sophomore,2,"Way too expensive for what you get, in my opinion, especially since being somewhere else, I've seen way nicer dorms for way less. They're just too expensive."
College Sophomore,2,"Since I transferred to a bigger school, with a lot more major choices even in the sciences, I feel like I would've liked more flexibility in my major choices and a lot more class options."
College Sophomore,2,"To be honest, I transferred out, and it was the best decision I ever made.  I had looked through grad school applications and always wondered why the research requirement was waived for students from smaller schools. I had been told that students have greater opportunities to get to know their faculty and especially to do research at smaller schools. It was hard at Canisius for every student who wanted to be able to do research to do it, because labs are very small.  Additionally, there were a lot of department politics that went into whether or not you could do research where you wanted. You could be as persistent and as proactive as you wanted, and it wouldn't necessarily mean that you'd get the opportunities you sought. I transferred to a bigger school and within two months, had two paying jobs in two labs.  I felt like I sort of got sold a bill of goods by Canish, and would have made a different decision had I not been so convinced that opportunities would not be available to undergrads at large research universities-that's far from the truth.  I wasted a lot of student loan money here.  If smaller class sizes and a smaller school appeal to you, then go for it. But, larger class sizes have not affected my opportunities (quite the opposite-I've had a lot more), and contrary to what I was told at Canisius, I get just as much help from my professors in a class with 300+ students as I did in a class with 30. Additionally, I'd say that because my professors have so many students, the one thing that they don't have time for is petty politics. If the school is a good fit, again, I say go for it. But, if you're hesitant, or you believe that you won't get opportunities at a bigger school that you'd get at a smaller one, I would tell you to be careful, and to go check out your local state school and talk to people that go there before making a decision.  I'm posting this because I truly wish that I'd listened when people gave me this same advice."
College Freshman,2,"Campus alerts are always being sent out about crime.

Safety is a big issue on campus, especially walking alone.

Public Safety will escort you places, if it is right on campus."
College Freshman,2,The parties here are all just average. Nothing too crazy.
College Freshman,2,"Seriously, nothing is ever opened when you have a craving for something at night."
College Freshman,2,"Starting off, I was iffy about coming here. Our school has tunnels except to Health Science or Science Hall which is where most of my classes were."
College Freshman,2,"The school is located in a rough neighborhood. Niagara Falls is far from school, and pretty much not much to do."
College Freshman,2,"If you need anything, you will need a car on campus. Having friends who have cars are the best idea. Walking anywhere is a bad idea."
College Freshman,2,Chartwells makes a fortune and the food is really unhealthy
College Junior,2,Rich suburban preppy kids from Buffalo or Rochester suburbs.
College Junior,2,Campus is about 95 percent white with the rest being mostly black.
College Junior,2,"I live in the town house that are provided my the college but they are extremely expensive. It's hard to live on campus because only so many can so either you pay more for the townhouses, commute or decide to not attend the college."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus dining is gross. They fool you at orientation, but it quickly goes downhill after that. Dhall only serve complicated dishes and  overdone tasteless vegetables. Iggy's is a grease dumpster and Subway and 2mato are never open. The only good thing is Tims."
College Senior,2,"Parking on campus is difficult to find. We had access to more parking lots, which was taken away this year. However, there is a parking ramp available."
College Freshman,2,"Parking passes cost either $70 or $120. Certain permits only allow you to park certain places. If you live in Bosch, Frisch or Dugan you will have a D permit, you must park in the ramp. C, E, and F permits are given on a first come first serve basis and allow you to park in other places. It can be a nightmare, and the City of Buffalo will not think twice to give you a ticket, nor will public safety."
College Junior,2,"It's very cold with mild snow, Buffalo doesn't get as much snow as the media portrays, however upper classman dorms are far from campus, but there are shuttles. There are heated underground tunnels that connect much of the main campus. When the weather breaks, the ""quads"" become alive!"
Recent Alumnus,2,"I lived at home since I was over 30. However I say several of the off-campus locations and yea it going to be cheaper then the on house campus but UGH on the looks of them. A lot looked like the rats were running away. College students are not clean people. I blame them more then the buildings. I was over 30 so not doing the college thing, so I found a studio apartment that was so much cheaper then anything by the school. It was only a 15-20 minute drive. Parking at the time I was there was mostly on street but you learn how to work it."
Recent Alumnus,2,"They had healthy food but it cost so much more. Why get a salad that is $5 or more and then still have to pay for the dressing when you can get a burger for and fries for $1.50.

The thing is they need to offer much healthier food and not charge so much. It's so sad that most turn to pizza and such because of the $$$ value. And the cafes are even worse then the main dinning hall. 

At lest it was like that when I was there.... I hope it has gotten better."
College Sophomore,2,"I received the amount of money that I was eligible to get but, it still was not enough. Attending a private Jesuit college is not cheap, but I do receive a good education which makes it worth it. I am being raised by a single parent who is paying two additional school tuitions. It would be nice to help out anyway I can which is why I am applying for this scholarship.. My overall experience will hopefully go a lot smoother the next few years and I will be able to apply for more scholarships and be eligible for more aid."
College Freshman,2,"The town where the school is located is terrible! There have been so many shootings and robberies by the school. You should not walk along the streets of hughes and meech late at night without a friend. However, Elmwood is just a couple of train stops away and the town is beautiful. Discover the beauty of elmwood if you ever have a chance!"
College Junior,2,Punishments Go as Fas as Getting Kicked Out of School – IF you get caught drinking or doing drugs you lose the privilege to choose your classes and go to activities and possibly lose any application or process you have applied to.  Parties are broken up by the police department and everyone that parks at a wrong parking pass without being allowed gets a city ticket and possibly your car towed.
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone Looks the Same – Just from walking to class every day or sitting in the dining room, it is blatant that the vast majority of students are all practically the same: white kids from new york. Diversity is not something that can easily be found at Canisius, which could be a good or bad thing depending on the perspective. It made for a very boring and monotonous daily life, in my opinion."
College Freshman,2,"This is Buffalo. Everyone knows the weather blows, there is nothing you can do about it.  It makes it annoying to go out on weekends and/or walk from place to place. Canisius is very convenient in providing underground tunnles tho so that helps you go outside less."
College Freshman,2,"Non-Essential, Non-Existant, Fun – Not very dominating. I don't even know any sororities or fraternities on my campus, therefore it does not play a role in my college experience"
College Sophomore,2,It's only available if you qualify.  If both of your parents have decent jobs don't expect anything.  It doesn't make sense that one has to pay so much more then others just because their parents work.
College Freshman,2,Very Average – the local area around canisius college is not very good. I wouldn't just go walking around in the area by myself outside of the school's main campus. It's not the schools fault.. just the location is bad
College Sophomore,2,"There should be more health related fields, i.e. nursing, PA, medical assisting"
Graduate Student,1,"I am enrolled in a master's program here , and I am thoroughly disappointed by nearly everything about Canisius.  The academics lack rigor and creativity.  The professors are not highly educated or advanced in their field (with a few exceptions).  My undergraduate institution was far more rigorous, but Canisius refuses to except some of my undergraduate credits.  The lack of diversity of background and thought is stark.  I expected so much more from this program."
Sophomore,1,"When I went to visit Canisius College it seemed great. I was wrong. Its very cliquey and if you don’t do sports you’re already a step behind for making friends. Some teachers are great and some are terrible. The food options are very limited and is VERY cheap. The buildings are also very old with the science hall exception. Parking is hard, debris from the parking garage falls on people’s car. The dorm rooms are okay. Some of them can be dirty. carpets are old, the paint is chipping and the stairways are never clean. Perhaps the biggest problem is the lack of safety. They have their own department but all you ever see them do is hand out parking tickets. The garage is a 10 minute walk from the closest dorm hall. Bad side of Buffalo is only a block or two away. There is also a specific crosswalk used to get to the main side of campus but cars frequently blow through it. For some reason they took out the pedestrian lights which makes it worse."
Niche User,1,"Not worth the money.  Career center doesn't help you find a job or any open opportunities. Can't get a job at your own school. Registrar office personnel are nasty and rude to parents about getting children's transcripts and diploma even with students email explaining the information to allow their parents get the info.  They have no problem taking the parents checks for tuition, but have restrictions on other things."
Sophomore,1,"Would not recommend. To anyone. Not a good school.

You can do better. Biggest complaint is it's near impossible to get involved in research because the school is so small. Second complaint is that financial aid packages are ridiculous. You get an average education for an astronomical price."
College Sophomore,1,it sucks there only like two
College Freshman,1,"The food is TERRIBLE. I play D1 athletics, still gained weight. Salad bar= nonexistent. Veggies= pure butter. Not worth 3,000. Makes me outraged."
College Freshman,1,"It's very hard to find parties, and if you do they are usually busted by public safety."
College Senior,1,"No greek life, to speak of."
College Senior,1,Located in a very unsafe and troubled neighborhood. In the middle of the city and not the good part. It is a residential area with high crime rates.
Recent Alumnus,1,There really is no Greek life. There are like 2 clubs.
College Junior,1,"Options include:

A. The dining hall which is over priced, unhealthy and will give you the runs.

B. Iggy's which is serves like sports bar type food. Also very unhealthy and will send you to the toilet.

C. Subway which is Subway prepare for ludicrous lines

D. 2mato is a pizza/ pasta place that serves what tastes like frozen pizza.

E. Tim Hortons which is Tim Hortons... once again the lines can be absurd."
College Junior,1,Student events put on by the planning board are a joke. Spring fest sucks. They entertain students like they think we are 10 years old.
College Junior,1,Varsity sports at Canisius are D1. Most varsity athletes are snobs and will not hangout or even talk to non athletes. The divide is very noticeable at Canisius. It is not uncommon to hear an athlete refer to other students as NARPs (Non athletic regular person). Due to this divide and snobbish attitude undertaken by the athletes games are poorly attended. Most teams suck anyway so the snobby attitude is completely unwarranted.
College Junior,1,Parking passes are very expensive and off campus street parking is almost non existent.
College Sophomore,1,"The food is terrible. I barely eat because it makes me sick. There is a lack of food options, and me being a selective eater makes it difficult for me to tolerate the food being served. I am allergic to many things, including tomatoes so already I am limited to the majority of the foods being served at my college. I always have to buy my food which is not cheap at all and it burns a hole in my pocket."
College Junior,1,Hard to Find – It's very hard to find a decent restaurant around campus and that really sucks. There are a few fast food places but in general it's deserted.
College Sophomore,1,"Diversity ? Not Much – The Meal plan options are many, but the variety of food is awful. The cafeteria food is not very appetizing or enjoyable. We do have Subway, Tim Horton as well as 2mato and Italian cafe, other than that the food is not very good."
College Freshman,1,"The parking is obnoxious.  You should not have to pay for a parking pass when the school costs $40,000 a year.  This is called ""nickle & diming"" and frowned apon.  Also, parking on the street is super inconvenient because you end up going in circles constantly.  The parking garage is as far as my farthest class and I frankly don't wana walk that far in the snow and rain coming home from work late at night.  Also, the lots should be for students, not faculty.  They are only there for a portion of the day and can park in the garage."
College Sophomore,1,What a Joke. Greeks are idiots. I was one and I was persecuted endlessly. One of the girls attacked me over something I disagreed with her about on FB. What a joke. They don't even do anything for the campus. They are a waste of time and of valuable club rooms space.
College Sophomore,1,The wireless still needs work. I am constantly having problems with it. I pay too much to go here to have bad wireless connections all the time.

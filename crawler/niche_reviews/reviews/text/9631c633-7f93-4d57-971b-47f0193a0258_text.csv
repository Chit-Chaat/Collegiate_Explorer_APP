Gallaudet University is the only deaf University in United States of America that is dedicated fully to deaf and hard of hearing individuals.

At my school is a large deaf community that I can be social with deaf, hard of hearing and included hearing students/teachers/employers/staffs.

College Sophomore,5,"Gallaudet is probably one of the most accepted college when it comes to students who are Gay, Lesbian, transgender, and so on. There are a lot of student here who are gay or lesbian. I think a problem is economic background. People are from all over the world and the state. Gallaudet is an expensive school.

I do not have a concern about finding a job in my field because I know I am receiving the best training available at Gallaudet."
College Sophomore,5,"I'm at Gallaudet University. It is the only Deaf College in the entire world. I am in the five percent of hearing students that attend here. I hope to enter the BAI (bachelors in interpreting) program in the spring. I enjoy the school, and it is a very unique learning environment because I am learning everything in my second language."
College Senior,5,"DC is a greatvplacebto go out with friends to eat. There are so many places to offer. I've still have many places on my ""go to"" list. I don't think I'll ever be able to go to all of them."
College Sophomore,5,"Transportation schedule is easy to read. They have buses coming at reasonable times, frequently and at different location. Weekend buses stops late which is perfect for late night plans. The drivers are always friendly."
College Sophomore,5,free shuttle to metro and union station. bus stop right in front of campus
College Junior,5,"Gallaudet is like a melting pot. There are students from all over the world that attend. As far as dressing, it is just the same as any school. Some people go all out as if they are going to a club after class and some people are still in their pjs. I give Gallaudet an A because of the variety. You never feel out of place."
College Senior,5,"I want to be a school counselor for the deaf and the department of Counseling here at Gallaudet University specializes in that. The teachers here are very supportive and I've had the opportunity to unpack my privileges as a deaf latina woman and how that can impact the relationships between my students and I. I've had the privilege of studying under Dr. Cheryl Wu, who is specialized in Multiculturalism counseling which has opened my eyes, rather than focus on the traditional school counseling. It is an intensive program with challenges and in the end it's rewarding. There is Practicum, internship I/II during the second semester of the first year through the 2nd year. Based on my personal relationships with the teachers, they have a good network and is very encouraging to the students to go out there and get a job. What a wonderful department."
College Junior,5,"Gallaudet Bus shuttle transportation always to be on time around campus. Sometime Bus shuttle is a bit late for a reason like rush hours, events and fix on the road. Gallaudet bus shuttle always ready to have a schedule and see what time if the bus shuttle will be arrive."
College Junior,5,"Washington D.C. is the best city because we have lots of events every weeks and months. For example, last weekend we went to H Street for festival that had a history about this street. We have lot of diversity foods that we can eat. Also, we have lot of good guest speaker will come to Gallaudet about their belief, science, history, and much more. There so much more that want to do everything at once."
College Freshman,5,Great Food – In union station there is great and delicious food
College Junior,5,"Several Local Places Close to Campus – Due to the small size of the campus there are not many places to hold parties on campus, however there is great night life options near campus. The proximity to campus is great, it is easily accessible, and good entertainment."
College Junior,5,Gallaudent University has ample student parking around the campus. Their parking lots and garages are easy to park in and are in great proximity to any spot on campus you could be headed towards.
College Junior,5,"Whatever You Want to Do – The Nightlife is always buzzing at Gallaudet University.  The liquor store down the street rarely asks for ID.  Many students who are below 21 can purchase drinks. Thursday to Sunday, parties are always at Gallaudet.  One can find a party in any dorm.  Otherwise, if you would like to find a club, there are many for both 18+ and 21+.  Personally, I don't think they are worth it for the price of their drinks, but definitely worth a try!  The shuttle on campus runs until after midnight, and public transportation is always available, including subways and taxis.  There's always something to do, no matter how old you are."
College Junior,5,"Best Decision – When I first entered college, I resolved to major in English.  However, I ended up changing my major to American Sign Language, and receiving a degree in that.  Following graduation, I still felt like I wanted to go back to school and major in English.  I took a Creative Writing class and rediscovered my love for writing.  I applied to Gallaudet University to be in a signing environment.  I didn't expect the English program to be so intense!  I was ignorant of what English as a major meant.  I didn't realize I would be reading so much, discussion so many things, and writing so many essays.  Even though it was a lot of hard work, at the end of the semester, I could confidently look back and realize everything I had learned.  The English program not only helps me become more knowledgeable about writing, but I've become more worldly of a person.  It was one of the best decisions I've made."
College Junior,5,"Anywhere Is Possible! All forms of transportation are accessible and cheap.  Gallaudet University provides a shuttle, free to all students and faculty.  From school, it takes us to Union Station, where I can access the train or subway station.  The Subway station is around $2 per ride.  I can buy a Smart Trip card, where I can reload money.  I can get anywhere around Washington, DC within an hour.  Furthermore, if I need to travel out of the city, I can take the subway to their airport.  Plus, because Washington, DC is a large metropolitan areas, busses and taxis are available at your convenience; the nearest bus stop is right out the front of the school!  Plus, you can travel out of Washington, DC, to VA and MD.  A car definitely isn't needed."
College Junior,5,Not Bad – The shuttle bus runs every 30-45 minutes however on Sundays the shuttle bus runs every two hours.
College Freshman,5,Gallaudet is a few short blocks from downtown Washington DC.  Metro station is .5 blocks from university.  Anything imaginable is at  your figertips!
College Sophomore,5,"Accessible Diversity – Right in middle of Washington, D.C., and within 5 minutes walk to the nearest subway station, any Gallaudet students can pick any restaurant of any type. It can be Chinese, Ethiopian, Italian, or American. The university is also less than 5 minutes walk to the revitalized H Street Downtown, where many local restaurants are beginning to open up. One of my favourites on H Street would be Matchbox, a pizza cooked to perfection in a fire-covered stove in a stunning DC Victorian building."
College Senior,5,"Summer Housing – Lived here during the summer, staff made it possible to live easy and worry-free."
College Senior,5,"Master's Program – Currently involved in the Masters in Sign Language Teaching Program. It's online, convenient, and a great way to obtain quality education. Great teachers overall, a prestigious Deaf University."
Freshman,4,"Big changes for Deaf people, who have been struggling with online courses. I have learned about remote learning, which is not easy for me to learn because I miss gestures such as American Sign Language."
Niche User,4,"I like the environment and the help it provides, the people are very nice and friendly. The food is also very good and the teachers are kind."
Junior,4,"Gallaudet University has been a vital part of my education. Coming from a mainstream environment and not having ASL knowledge, I was a good student but lacked confidence and social skills. Through my time at Gallaudet, I have learned ASL and steadily gained more confidence and even more learning about elementary and secondary topics I missed out on.

Some problems I have had, however, have been related to expectations. I have often felt that expectations for us are much lower than those for students at other universities. Just because we are Deaf, we must achieve less? I feel that we need to be pushed more and held to higher standards. At Gallaudet, we often have to find our own enrichment and our own challenges."
Freshman,4,"My experiences is about joined in the Jumpstart Program in five weeks. What did i like about Gallaudet University is American Sign Language, Deaf Community, and able to access into accessibility. I'd like to see some changes in Gallaudet University that needs to restores every building, changes the model of building."
Sophomore,4,Gallaudet is a great campus to be at and deaf-friendly. They are very eager to teach students but sometimes Gallaudet doesn't pay attention to the problems or the voices of concern students express.
Sophomore,4,I really like Gallaudet University because the school has full access for me. I don't have to worry about finding interpreters for every classes. I have full support for what I need. I wish there is more diversity. The services are great and full support.
Graduate Student,4,"As an older, continuing education student, I felt welcomed and as though the school was a good fit for me."
Junior,4,My Gallaudet experience is wonderful. There is pros and cons but every school have those. It’s wonderful experience to go school where access communication is provided 100% .
Sophomore,4,"Definitely would like the food plan improve, I can't ever eat healthy, or eat what I feel to eat, it is always the same"
Graduate Student,4,I have had a positive experience thus far. The professors and staff have been helpful and genuinely concerned about the students.
Sophomore,4,From my experience at attending Gallaudet University. My first year attending! Gallaudet has not failed to impress me when attending to get an education that is accommodated well for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing. Gallaudet University is the only university in the world that is solely a Deaf University. The education I received during my first year has been nothing short yet of rigorous. I am attending to pursue my degree in Business Administration and I am thrilled to look forward to attending as a Sophomore this year for the Fall Semester.
Graduate Student,4,"Excellent communication for Deaf and hard of hearing. Some changes are promoting more bilingual roles and hire more diverse staff. Food are awful, dorms are old and smelly."
Junior,4,"What I love about Gallaudet University is that it is unique. Gallaudet is the only university for the Deaf in the world. Gallaudet's primary goal is equal access for their students. Most of the professors, faculty, and staff use American Sign Language to communicate with Deaf students. I am Deaf and my primary language is American Sign Language.  Gallaudet is one of very few places where I am free to use my language without any language barriers. However, there are some areas I would like to see Gallaudet improve on. One issue we have been struggling with is safety for female students.  Often, female students have experienced being assaulted sexually.  We have anti-bystander training once per semester.  Another issue we have on our campus is the campus is dominated by Greeks. Ninety percent of Professors, Faculty and Staff are greeks. Favoritism occurs in classroom. We do have a few more issues but nothing we cannot handle. It is a privilege to be a student at Gallaudet University."
Freshman,4,My experiences here has been wonderful but has very lax rules in freshman building especially due to wild parties.
Sophomore,4,"I love how Deaf Culture is such an integral part of the campus life. I am able to express myself very openly, and almost everyone is extremely accepting and compassionate towards one another. My only complaints would be in regards to the cost of attending this university full time, and some issues regarding living on campus. Other than that, if you apply yourself and try your best, you will more than likely thrive at this school!"
Freshman,4,I loved  the environment and the services they provide. The counselors would do anything to try and help with anything that is needed. Students are being there for one another even though at times there may be some down time.
Graduate Student,4,"Gallaudet is the perfect place for people who want to dive into Deaf culture. Being able to use ASL all day every day will only enhance your skills. As a future interpreter, it was the best place for me and I recommend any students who want to be an interpreter, go to Gallaudet and experience it."
Senior,4,"Gallaudet University is like a Deaf mecca in the world, an only university that uses American Sign Language to communicate with each other.  Gallaudet University is an unique place for the Deaf and sign language users to get connect to each other."
Freshman,4,"I was an freshman at last semester. I had much fun at this campus. I have many new friends. They're friendly and nice people. I had four courses. I liked my professors. I've improved my grades much better than last year at community college. I had working with professors, friends, and staff everyday which helped me much improve than last year. I can tell you whoever Deaf or Hard of Hearing people plan to go to Gallaudet. You would be very successful at this school !"
Recent Alumnus,4,it's okay when students want to have experience once in their life during college years.
Recent Alumnus,4,I want to study hard and focus on school.
Recent Alumnus,4,Safety is good for people to be stay alive and stay away from bad stuff.
Recent Alumnus,4,"My Christian friends and I had a lot of get together times and had our own kind of parties, smaller group kinds."
Recent Alumnus,4,I learned more about myself and grew up a bit more while I was here at Gallaudet.
Recent Alumnus,4,"When I come back to work as a lifeguard and swim instructor, I often feel the people know me before I even know who they are. This is something that I am not used to. I used to walk through the hallways, and rarely anyone would greet me. As a staff and alumni, I feel a total different atmosphere from when I first started at Gallaudet."
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have learned a lot about myself and overcame many challenges that I never was able to do prior to Gallaudet. I felt like the faculty and staff cared enough about my learning to keep me from giving up so easily. Many of the residential staff have urged me to keep hanging in there and not give up, even during my hardest times."
College Sophomore,4,crazy and sometimes out  of control
College Sophomore,4,Their a big fence that surrounds the campus and the security that rotate around the campus just to keep us safe
College Sophomore,4,When I first applied for Gallaudet university I didn't realize that it was completely full of deaf people. Their is a full community that I didn't know about I picked up sign language the one month ive been there and it been very fun.
College Freshman,4,"My school fan supports are very well showing to the team like they wants the team to win the game. My school have an awesome school spirit. They have five different school spirit things to do. For example: stomp,clapping, cheering with your arms and hands up, then use your loud voice to yell and at last, say ""LET'S GO BISON"" in sign language."
College Sophomore,4,Love most of the professors. Hate the interpreting program (terrible professors)
College Freshman,4,We have resources here on campus
College Freshman,4,Theres one courses that recommend us to find internship before end of the semester.
College Freshman,4,Courses are GREAT! but professor- there are some professors that need to go as it doesn't fit our expectations
College Freshman,4,We always make it a memorable time at the dorm life
College Freshman,4,The athlete here are amazing but theres always room to improve.
College Sophomore,4,"I chose Gallaudet because while I was born deaf to a family with over five generations of deaf people before me, I had never gotten deeply involved in my culture as a deaf person. I never learned much American Sign Language and I never had any deaf or hard-of-hearing friends. Gallaudet University, focused on the education of deaf and hard-of-hearing students, changed that for me. I was able to immerse myself in the culture and identify parts of myself that were already culturally Deaf without my knowledge. I met people of similar backgrounds and ones vastly different from my own that helped me realize I didn't have to fit a specific model as a deaf person to be a Culturally Deaf person. If I had a chance, I would probably have gotten more involved in clubs and organizations for multiply-disabled students earlier on, rather than waiting to be approached by others with mobility aids wondering if I'd ever picked up an application."
College Freshman,4,The school spirit at Gallaudet U. is varied on the student and how involved they are.
College Freshman,4,"Barely went off campus for dining, but was excelent when done."
College Freshman,4,Campus rule violation was never a problem for me.
College Freshman,4,Living on campus was supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
College Student,4,they protect us and keep us safe

College Freshman,4,It's best if a student stays on campus as student because i'ts great way to meet people there.
College Freshman,4,"People at party are friendly and easy to social with. There's no judgement. I rarely see a ""drama"" at parties on campus of Gallaudet."
College Junior,4,none of them are perfect apartment.
College Junior,4,we can order food and it can delivery also
College Junior,4,there are many different majors in school
College Senior,4,"I did one semester of student teaching. It was a great experience. I had great support from my supervisor, my mentoring teachers, my professors, and my advisors."
College Senior,4,"I've always been able to receive financial aid based on my family's class, which is at bottom and they always helped."
College Sophomore,4,I really like the school I am going too. I made good friends that I am able to connect with and trust. I like my school a lot because it has given access to American Sign Language. It allows me to connect with students like myself who are hard of hearing. It is a great feeling to be with people who are like you and can truly relate with you.
College Sophomore,4,"Gallaudet is located in DC. I was nervous about going to the city because I am from a small town. So when I heard of Gallaudet, I wanted to check it out. When I arrived on campus I insistently felt safe. Gallaudet is guarded with security and it is fenced off so people can not just randomly enter campus. To enter campus you must enter to the main gate or the back gate."
College Sophomore,4,"Gallaudet is very focused on trying to make all cultures and people feel welcomed to Gallaudet as they enter and start their college career there. There are a few different cultural events through out the year and you can try cultural foods, clothing, and listen to their music. It is a great experience for someone like myself who is from a very small town in New Hampshire."
College Sophomore,4,"At Gallaudet, sports plays an impact on a lot of students. When you go to the football games, the bleachers are full of screaming fans. The school spirit is very strong when it comes to Football, the other sports as such baseball, soccer, and softball are not as big of a deal. Football games there are students, parents, and teachers who are ready and supporting the team."
College Sophomore,4,"I am currently working on becoming accepted in the Education department. I have worked with a lot of nice people and they have helped me a lot with the process. Getting into the department is not as easy as other majors. You need to pass the Praxis Exam. A long with doing that student needs three recommendations, resume, essay, lesson plan, and teaching philosophy. When is comes to doing internships for the Education Department at Gallaudet University, that will happen your senior year of college. I would feel better in the internship started earlier in my college career. The work load for Education classes are good, challenging, and make student improve on being better teachers for their future students."
College Sophomore,4,Yeah I love my major IT
College Sophomore,4,YES GOOD learn lot of course
College Sophomore,4,Yeah feel lot of students want to get job
College Junior,4,Many students involvement with sports

Freshman,2,"Gallaudet University is a great opportunity for deaf kids to have communication access. Everything is not great academic compare with other. For example, Gallaudet has offer courses that are pointless to required courses. General Studies capstone are courses that cant transfer to other colleges. I will over start to be freshmen if I transfer to another college."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I chose not to join the Greek organization after watching their pledges, as an outsider. I feel that the Greek organization take way too much time away from school work and jobs. They party way too much too."

College Sophomore,2,I do not know about drug use on campus. But alcohol usage on campus can be very noticeable on campus.
College Junior,2,"Dorms are lousy and students make noisy too much and fire alarm. Not good social atmosphere at Gallaudet University, expensive dorm $3500 per semester and meal plan requirement $2,900."
College Student,2,"I wished it would be easy, but you have to hustle to recieve personal aids."
College Senior,2,I can't explain it. There are so much to explain.
College Freshman,2,"needs painting, floors dirty, no color surrounding and more informative decoratings"
College Freshman,2,The local weather have very ransom event.
College Freshman,2,"DPS (Department of Safety) are always around on campus. There's always parties going on and not always does DPS walk around on campus. They can strict if they want to but most of the time, they just come out at a specific time to bust parties and people with alcohol."
College Senior,2,The weather here is very odd. It will be warm one day and freezing cold the next.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is unpredictable sometimes, and there were random snow days recently. Yesterday, it was sunny in the morning and snowing in the afternoon."
College Junior,2,The dorms are old and dirty. Rarely cleaned. Fire alarms go off frequently and they've shut the water off a few times too.
College Junior,2,"Gallaudet University is small, peaceful and safe campus. Everyday, the security and police always to be check in at different dorm by late night to make sure everyone are safe."
Recent Alumnus,2,Unreliable and Lack of Access – The computer lab lacks the staff's availability to assist the student. The computer often get down where we could not complete the assignment. Printer was limited and we hardly find place to print the paper. Limited of technology available for our research.
Recent Alumnus,2,Deaf President Now Rally/Protest – Deaf President New Protest was the BEST thing! It empowered me into achieving anything that my Deaf parents would have had. I also learned so much about the unity within the community and see how power of the unity. It is something that I learned to give back to the community. Unity means variation of individual diversity creating into ONE team for the same goal. It was awesome feeling and inspiring experience! I am very grateful for the opportunity where I can carry on to the existing Deaf school that are struggling to preserve our culture and language.
College Junior,2,"Sadly, Gallaudet University students can't think other than be part of greek life, and the topic is bought up almost daily. It is like they don't have anything better to say. Greek students provide the acitivities but they all does not work together, we can see the separated among the greek groups. i don't see any teamworks."
College Sophomore,1,"They're unkept, dirty and usually filled with moldy vents. The buildings and rooms are disgusting. I showed up in my room the first day with leftover vomit stains, pot wax stains on my dressers, my wardrobe closet smelt like urine and there were dead bugs everywhere. Huge problem with rats too."
College Sophomore,1,"This school was literally my dream school and my entire family has attended and graduated. But showing up and seeing it's true colors, I've never been more disappointed."
College Junior,1,I do not like Greek life and I am not interested in joining it.
College Senior,1,The weather is like as a bipolar because everything went warm then next day drop down cold then next day it going up warm again.
College Freshman,1,"Strangers will always in Gallaudet, gunpoint at someone and steal. Gallaudet just need to be more focus of who comes in and who comes out of the campus, just to keep us safe."
College Senior,1,"Gallaudet University is located in one of the bad areas of DC. The prices are too ridiculous! $1,750 for two tiny bedrooms (basement only). And Gallaudet University does not encourage students to live off campus. They care about profits too much!"
College Senior,1,"It's becoming harder for me to find a parking spot. Too much parking spots are reserved for Staff/faculty only and their parking spots happen to be very close to the buildings. Students should be the priority group to have parking spots, there won't be an university if no students are being enrolled. We should not look up to our professors and thank them for their PHD degree and show them a lot of respect! They should RESPECT us more because without us, they wouldn't have any jobs! This needs to change! Also I want to mention that parking lots needs to expand and the parking lot near Carlin Hall is not safe at all! There's an leak-- acidic water that seems to be corrosive-- (the painting on my car is falling off because of that!) "
College Senior,1,It is very limited and expensive. If you don't go early then the food is old and dried out.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Gallaudet is well-known for not closing on many snowy or extreme bad days as well as some holidays observed by others.  This may not pose too much of a problem for students that live on the campus, but commuting students, professors/staff/faculty’s difficulty reaching the school is not often taken into consideration."
College Junior,1,"Gallaudet Fans do not pay attention to the sport because we have the lower rank in this conference. For example, football team does not have enough good players just like other college. The only popular is the women volleyball because they have best conference and they were good team compare to football team."
College Sophomore,1,"If You Are Not Deaf, You Do Not Stand a Chance – All scholarships are specifically intended to be awarded to students who are deaf.  This means that any students who are hearing, regardless of their involvement in the Deaf community, are not considered."
College Sophomore,1,"Lots of White Kids – This campus thinks it's very diverse because it is primarily comprised of an underrepresented population, the Deaf population, but most of the students there, Deaf or hearing, are white so the diversity ends at hearing status."
College Sophomore,1,"NOT a Safe Neighborhood – This is not a safe neighborhood.  We regularly get email alerts about gunshots occurring just off campus and thefts happening on-campus at gun or knife point.  It's an awful part of the city and while the campus is gated in, security does NO check of those entering and exiting the campus so unsafe people enter campus without any hesitation.  I do not like walking alone at night on campus and avoid it at all costs."
Recent Alumnus,1,I applied tons of time and no scholarships received.
Recent Alumnus,1,"It ruins the chances of people meeting each other rather than hosting a party for frats only. Also, The university emphasizes on greek activities, not non-greek activities."
College Sophomore,1,"Eagle-Eyed Securities – We have to deal with tickets, fine, towing, full parking, and so much more to name it. Every nights, we have to parking on students parking which is too far away from our dormitories. If one of us happen to park on facilities or teacher's parking, then the towing time. We have a parking war on Galladuet University Campus. Freshmen students are not allowed to bring their own cars due to pranks by seniors."
College Freshman,1,"School Policies – School policies doesn't do well at campus, but at least they do try to stop kids to getting drinking.  However there is need to improve. Sometimes they do not really care if people are drinking even they are on the road.  They are underage."

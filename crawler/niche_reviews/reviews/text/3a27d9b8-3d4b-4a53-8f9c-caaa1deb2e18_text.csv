Senior,5,"I specifically chose Randolph because I wanted a smaller school where the community is close-knit and so I could have 1 on 1 relations with professors in small classrooms, as opposed to classrooms with 100+ students that lessen the possibilities for questions and discussions in class. Randolph has a top-notch STEM program (I am an engineering major) and the entire staff in admissions, HR, business office, and registrar are very helpful and immediately attempt to help you with any issues, where larger colleges are swamped with people that need help and any issues you have go unresolved for days. Randolph has a diverse environment and I loved every minute of it!"
Freshman,5,"Randolph college is a very good college. They provide many tools to help the students with any academic problems they may come across during their time at the college. The school is quite small so there is lots of access to help from professors and staff at the school. So far with any issue, I have been able to find the help that I need with no problems."
Sophomore,5,the staff are helpful and easy to get along with for the most part. The community is good and it sometimes can feel like home away from home.
Senior,5,Randolph College is a great school that allows a person to grow and develop in any way possible.  The only grievance that I have is with the upkeep of the dorm facilities.
Niche User,5,It is a great school and all of the things I've done with them have been really wonderful! They're very personable and know how to make anyone feel welcome!
Freshman,5,"I love the small community and the fact that every teacher here knows me personally. I believe the classrooms are different from other colleges and universities because of the connection we have with the teachers and also each other. I am guaranteed to run into a new person from one of my classes and become acquainted with them. I come from Richmond, VA which is pretty big and it is nice to be able to enjoy the rural area in which Randolph College is located. The activity council here at Randolph is quite amazing also. Recently MAC our activity council took students to Washington D.C. to visit and explore. I love our community because we trust each other and want to befriend everyone. Randolph is such a small school, everyone is open to new relationships. That is one of the reasons I enjoy being a Wildcat. I am so proud to be apart of this community that I call home."
Niche User,5,"Randolph is a great environment to further your education. The people there are very friendly and helpful. Whenever in need, someone will be there to guide you. The professor enjoy teaching the students in their specific field of study and are a great source for information. I highly recommend Randolph College."
Sophomore,5,What I love about Randolph is all the academic help they provide to each and every student. They to their very best to meet the needs of each student and ensure their students are doing their best in and out of classes.
Freshman,5,"Randolph College is a small school that offers a close community and a beautiful campus. The school offers a shuttle bus ride into the city for students who don't have a car, which is very convenient and easy to use."
Sophomore,5,Randolph is a small college so it's easy to make friends and get involved. Class size and teacher ratio is awesome. It so easy to schedule time with  my instructors. I play on the soccer team and the girls and coaches make it such a blast!
Niche User,5,"The experience was great, I really enjoyed the time that I had. The classroom setting was very nice to me because I prefer the small classroom scene, and the teachers are very engaged in the classroom so I feel as if I would do very well at Randolph. The only downside to the school in my opinion is that there is no football team and I really enjoy going to the games and showing my support and school spirit. On the other hand, the school is great in my opinion. "
Niche User,5,"I love the area of town it is placed in, it is so pretty! The drive down is a nice scenic drive, and it's just as gorgeous once you arrive on the campus. The students are all extremely friendly, and it's just a nice environment to be in."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school because it is a small liberal arts college. The classroom sizes help me to excel and to be on a first name basis with my professors. I love the student life and traditions of the college, and could not be happier here."
College Sophomore,5,Love the financial aid office!
College Sophomore,5,"They usually try to work with you, but you also need to know what you are doing. do research,fill out all necessary forms and make copies before meeting with them."
College Junior,5,I transferred here. wish i would have come here first! great great! I love sociology!
College Junior,5,just a great academic school!
College Junior,5,definitely should be national recognized WAY more than it is
College Freshman,5,"I greatly enjoy being in the student center and the view of the landscape from the windows is perfect. I love the easy access to Netflix, the library and the lounges. The scenery is amazing and beautiful and it is really nice having open spaces all over campus to lay in the grass on a nice, warm day."
College Sophomore,5,Drugs aren't used on campus by most student.
College Freshman,5,The class sizes are tiny and it makes for an excellent learning environment. The school will work with you to create your own major if the one you desire is not offered.  
College Freshman,5,Randolph attracts a variety of students from a variety of backgrounds. Almost a quarter of the student population are international students.
College Freshman,5,"Almost everyone is here on a scholarship or has a ton of financial aid, never trust the sticker price. "
College Freshman,5,"The workload is hard and the professor will know if you don't do it because the class sizes are so small. All of the work is worth it and no of it is busy work. For such a small school there is an abundance of different classes you can take. Registration is relatively easy, you will most likely get all of the classes you want because the school is so small. "
College Freshman,5,"I'm a history major and the department is the best. All of the professors are extremely passionate about their subjects and love to discuss it with you individually in great detail. The workload is somewhat large, but the education you get is unmatched. The small class sizes don't suck either. "
College Freshman,5,"When it comes to the Honor Code, Randolph is the best. Almost everyone on campus respects it. It is expected that every student and faculty member obeys it. There are no proctors during tests, because if anyone attempts to cheat, someone else will report them. 

The alcohol policy is very lenient, there is also a 'Good Samaritan' policy. The drug policy is a different story. "
College Freshman,5,"Randolph is amazing, I absolutely adore this school. I truly feel like I'm getting an excellent, well rounded education. This school is not for people who want to slack off and not try terribly hard. Randolph really does care about the quality of your education, and is willing to go the extra mile to accommodate you. The professors love their jobs and are very familiar with the student body. You will never be taught by a graduate student or someone who is under qualified. "
College Freshman,5,"The safety on campus is unbelievable, I have never once felt unsafe on this campus, even walking alone late at night. Everything is very well lit and there is constantly campus security walking around. I can't really speak the health program, seeing as how I've never used it, but I've heard it's average. "
College Senior,5,The community is great and the school has many connections throughout the community.
College Senior,5,Diversity is a huge thing on our campus. We have and action plan called Bridges Not Walls and there are tons of cross-cultural events.
College Senior,5,There is not really a long application process for my major. All you do is fill out a Major Application form and get it signed by a few people. 
College Senior,5,"Lynchburg is a pretty small city compared to my hometown, but there are so many dining options that I hardly notice."
College Freshman,5,"I feel completely safe at Randolph. The security guards are always around and are super friendly. Also, they offer you chances to walk with them or pick you up from somewhere if you don't feel safe walking by yourself. They are extremely efficient and you never hear about any incidents whatsoever."
College Freshman,5,The campus is very strict in terms of violations of the Honor Code. The school's main foundation is the Honor Code. Students are given a lot of privileges that aren't given to students at other schools because of the belief in the Honor Code and the dual responsibility of all associated with the College.
College Freshman,5,"There are 3 computer labs at Randolph College. However there is a computer in every building that students can use to access the internet or their files on the school portal. The entire school has wireless. There is an IT help desk that is very helpful if any problem arises with the network or with your personal computer or the school's computer.  Every student has a 300 printing page limit  per year, however the printers in the labs do not print in color. If you need to print in color it is best to do so on a personal printer and print the black and white assignments on the school's printer."
College Junior,5,"There are so many places to eat in Lynchburg. There are restaurants and places to dine for any kind of mood you are in. There are bars and grilles, fancy restaurants, small restaurants, chain restaurants and anything else you could want."
College Sophomore,5,Its Awesome – the weather rarely ever interfere with campus life.
College Sophomore,5,"Guys Ok Girls Hmmm – The guys on campus are really cool, you can get along with just about everyone of them. With the girls you sometime may have that high school drama but as long as you stay out of the way you would get along with just anyone"
College Freshman,5,"The financial office really take care of you at our college. They update you on your forms, send you reminders, and help you find sources of financial aid. The process is super easy too and apply early, get good grades, and have an interest to get aid and become a member of our little family here at Randolph college!"
College Junior,5,There are a number of excellent restaurants within walking distance of the campus. I recommend them all!
Senior,4,"After the COVID-19 outbreak, the students were sent back home and the rest of the semester was converted to online learning (from about mid-March to early-May). The gist for most of the classes was to do video chat lectures on Google Meet during normal class hours and the teachers were great about working around my poor WiFi connections (fewer video chats, possible audio-only chats, altered times that suited me, etc.). The only issue is that the content covered by classes after the pandemic hit was lowered, making the classes very easy and not very fulfilling. One of my classes was an electronics lab, and the professor sent every student a kit with electronic components to continue learning as if we was still in the classroom."
Freshman,4,My daughter is loving the experience.  I like that her Professors take a personal interest in each student and make time for the student as needed so that they have a successful college learning environment
Freshman,4,"Randolph College has been good to me so far. If you can manage your time well and are not an idiot, you should be fine."
Sophomore,4,"To start, the both the campus and student population are small. However, Students tend to be very friendly and non-judgmental, and because the classes are so small, teachers are direct to each and help each individual student in case they need it. The dorms aren't too bad, and since everything is really close together, it makes it easy to get around without having to really drive anywhere. The only real ""negative"" about the place, is the fact that the food is not incredibly good. The school, however, features a convenience store where students are able to go and purchase small snacks using money the school gives you ($350 your first year, and the plan is interchangeable, see the school for more details). Hours go from when they open, which varies, all the way up to 1:00 AM, which is honestly really handy when you get  hungry while you're studying. Aside from the food, the school is great, and I love going here, just wish it tasted better haha."
Alum,4,"Underappreciated by students. There are problems as with any other institution, but the attention you get from faculty and staff sets kids up for success. Very easy to get involved if your willing. Student life has changed a lot recently. Cliques are becoming less of a problem, people are branching out and becoming more accepting. I graduated with a 3.0 and have had no trouble finding a job due to the fact that Randolph provided me opportunities to get experience outside the classroom."
College Junior,4,"My school has amazing academic programs. The classes are very small which guarantees not only effective learning but also establishing connections with professor. Career Development Office make it easy to start networking and find internships. Randolph prepares well for the future, and that what I appreciate most about it."
College Sophomore,4,I I love the small class sizes and the professors are great I just wish that there was more of a variety of classes. I was not able to take many of the classes that I wanted to because they were scheduled at the same time. Likewise they often where full.
College Sophomore,4,I am going into my sophomore year. I had a great freshman year full of new opportunities and friendships. I am really glad that I chose Randolph College for my education. It was the right place for me. I was far from home and the small community really Is helping me grow into a better person. I am not sure that I will be graduating from the school due to the yearly increase of tuition but I do not regret attending.
College Junior,4,There are a lot of students that have come out with a new sexual orientation and they have become accepted. Racial diversity is a bit of a challenge because the school is predominately white but they are accepted.
College Junior,4,The academics inspire me to work harder and smarter.
College Junior,4,"Being at randolph college it has given me ample opportunity to expand my resume for life outside of the red brick wall and become the best I can be in my carrier of choice. Going to randolph college< I have been given a voice to state my opinions and then seeing my statement being put into action by administration and or the Randolph community. I have have been given the opportunity to be a better leader in more than one aspect, in the classroom and out of it."
College Freshman,4,"The college offers lots of internships on campus, as well as offering opportunities to find internships off campus."
College Freshman,4,"Professors are generally the only reason I'm still here. They're engaging, entertaining, and very knowledgeable about their subjects. However, some professors are lovely people but suck at teaching."
College Freshman,4,"Randolph has many great traditions and a beautiful campus, though it can be hard to break out of your shell if you are not social due to size of the school."
College Freshman,4,There is no campus crime that I have heard about personally. I always feel safe on campus no matter the time and Randolph have taken precautions to have emergency phones at good locations on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I have not entered the job/ internship process yet, but I have heard that our staff works with each student individually to help them receive a good job after graduation. I have also heard that our alumni connection is very strong, and all alumni take pride in their alma mater."
College Sophomore,4,It great for my major.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are passionate about their courses. It wish that there was more variety in the courses.
College Sophomore,4,The city is small but there is still a lot of good stuff to do.
College Sophomore,4,I found a place very quickly but apartments complex within my price range are limited.
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is very friendly and respectful. They reprimand when needed and they also provide a safe environment.
College Sophomore,4,PTK gave me a scholarship that has helped me a lot.
College Junior,4,Great access to school facilities and a beautiful campus with many hang out spots! LOVELY campus!
College Junior,4,"The honor code is sooo awesome!

Close community

Small Small College

GREAT academics

Social Events all the time!"
College Junior,4,Randolph is a close community! if anything does go wrong we take action VERY quickly. (thats coming from someone who has been on a larger campus)
College Junior,4,Lynchburgs a nice town. very family oriented. not much night life and big city happenings but its enough to say its a college town and you can always find somewhere to hang out. even if it is Walmart LOL :-D
College Junior,4,not too strict. good enough for us. honor code helps a lot on our campus
College Junior,4,we need more majors but the ones we have are great!
College Junior,4,i lived at home last semester. easier for me to be on campus.
College Junior,4,"good experience, i got scholarships. i just need assistance with room and board"
College Freshman,4,"The only difficulties are the time slots for the classes you want. There may be times where there are two or more class times the clash with each other and it is hard to pick which one, especially if it pertains to your major. Yet the school still provides enough variety for the courses you want to take for your major."
College Freshman,4,I enjoy it because it makes you feel like you are a part of something. There are so many choices of programs at the school and it is a great way to make friends and find yourself.
College Freshman,4,"The students on campus can be very friendly and because it is a small campus, everyone knows everyone. It is not too hard to make friends or to be yourself. Everyone expresses themselves in their own ways and because of the open environment, they are not afraid to express themselves."
College Junior,4,No splits based on ethnicity. Students are from diverse backgrounds.
College Junior,4,Students value and act accordingly to the Honor Code
College Junior,4,"I feel safe on campus.

I have not heard anything about campus crime."
College Junior,4,"There are several internship positions in Biology department (Natural History Collections Project).

Positions do not require that you have to be Biology major. Some position suitable for majors in English, Arts, Communication, Business, etc.

Internship is one credit per semester."
College Junior,4,"Many Biology majors in school intend to go to health related fields.

I am not sure I will get job if I think outside of health related fields."
College Junior,4,"You don't have to bring your own printer because there is free certain number of pages for printing. (and this is usually enough per semester) However, it is only for black and white printings.

You will get support when you have any issue with computers (campus, your own computer)

People are not crowded in computer labs. Students usually use their own computers."
College Junior,4,Winter is not that severe. Usually warm and nice.
College Junior,4,Students dressed decently (=not interfering with academic)
College Junior,4,"Popular Study Areas: Psychology, Biology, English

Professors are friendly and helpful."
College Junior,4,During orientation you take a course on the safety concerns on drugs and what to do if you see someone under the influence.
College Junior,4,Professors are very friendly and helpful. Curriculum is fairly easy to follow.
College Junior,4,Kept clean and looks nice.
College Junior,4,"Some majors no longer exist, but the ones there are great."
College Junior,4,I feel safe to walk around campus at any time.
College Sophomore,4,"There are lots of off campus dining, they close around 9pm though, 5 star also"
College Sophomore,4,The IT support at Randolph is great 
College Sophomore,4,the education here great because of the wonderful professors at Randolph with great backgrounds. I truly learnt a lot from this school.
College Freshman,4,A lot of people here have sports scholarships but athletes are expected to be excellent students as well. Soccer and lacrosse are major sports here and all the games are free. 
College Freshman,4,Virginia definitely has all four seasons. 
College Freshman,4,"The campus food is really good and they usually have a nice variety. However, it can get really repetitive and the hours of available dining aren't great.   "
College Freshman,4,"Labs usually aren't terribly crowded, but it is a lot easier to do your work on your own computer. 

Everyone in the school gets a certain quota of free paper, it increases every year. For first years its 450 sheets.

The speed of the network isn't fabulous, but wireless is available everywhere on campus.  "
College Freshman,4,"Like any college campus, there are drugs. It is very easy to find drugs (mostly marijuana or prescription drugs) if you are actively seeking them out, but there isn't a stigma to not partaking. Very few people go overboard."
College Senior,4,"Despite having some serious dislikes for my school and thinking it is extremely weird and one of a kind, I still love it because it is just that. One of a kind. You will fin similar experiences elsewhere, but this place is one you will never understand from the outside. "
College Sophomore,4,The closeness with the professors and close knit community make for a great experience.  The professors are also very intelligent and the honor code is highly regarded.
College Sophomore,4,"Randolph is a small, well-maintained campus whose population is bound by an honor code. This means that there is little to no fear of theft while on campus. Doors are not always locked and you can set something down and expect it to be there later. I have not felt unsafe while walking around campus. There are always security guards patrolling and there are blue-light emergency phones located all across campus."
College Freshman,4,"The Curricular Studies major is a highly acclaimed challenging program to be accepted into. I am only a first year and have not completed the process at this point in my education. However, I am striving to complete the course requirements for this major. The major itself is identified as an interdisciplinary studies major. This makes for an above average amount of required courses necessary in order to complete this major. The program requires a written application and resume. Like I said, I personally have not completed the process but have heard of more than one instance of an intended curricular studies major not being accepted into the rigorous program."
College Freshman,4,To be in the education program at Randolph is a great accomplishment. I am currently working towards acceptance into the program as I am a first year and submission of applications takes place your sophomore or junior year. Entrance into the program comes after submitting a formal application and resume. Those with an education track in mind following the Curricular Studies guidelines and actually apple for that major opposed to one labeled education major. Randolph is unique in the way that you can complete your graduate studies for education here and later apply to be in the highly renowned Education Master's program.
Niche User,2,"Years of enrollment shortfalls are taking a toll on student life and impacting the financial health of the college. Currently classes are online  but if everybody was back on campus there would be just under 500, full time residential students. Falling revenue prior to the pandemic weakened the college and contributed to our selling properties around campus, cutting departmental budgets, eliminating a few programs and offering our most experienced professors early retirement to reduce payroll. Now the pandemic is  making things worse and the college's endowment can only go so far to fill revenue gaps. It is a pretty place and things look good on the surface but underneath is worry and anxiety as the college struggles to attract and hold more students."
Sophomore,2,"The school is almost falling apart at this point. I work in the Res Life staff and we have gone through four bosses in the last year, and have had months with no boss at all. The Athletics Director, Dean, Student Engagement Coordinator,  all resigned this year and the replacements are either temporary or floundering.   

 If you are wanting to go here for the riding program then don't, it's being shut down. If you want to go here for a diverse education then don't, we no longer offer concentrations in any world regions besides the U.S. or Europe. If you want to come here for the sports then make sure you don't actually like to win. 

The dorms are hit or miss. I lived in Bell and had barely any complaints, but Main Hall is disgusting and the showers are cold 70% of the time.  

Cost is 50k a semester. They will throw aid at you, so it's likely you wont be paying more than 15 (more like 11-12), but even then that is not worth the experience."
College Sophomore,2,"This school specializes in liberal arts and education, that is why you should go to this school."
College Sophomore,2,"People do not know how to have fun on the weekend when there isn't an event, so they drink in their dorms. Also, I've never seen people so quick to move into each other's dorms when they start dating; its very odd and probs uncomfortable for their roommate."
College Sophomore,2,"It's pretty bad, but the school is changing the meal service provider when it's current contract is over."
College Sophomore,2,"At first the school seem accepting to everyone with smiles, but people can be very racist and ignorant unintentionally. I knew a professor that show a minor a Confederate flag."
College Sophomore,2,"You really can't live off campus, some say that the school does that to maximize profit."
College Senior,2,Alcohol and partying is always a hot topic here. The administration is constantly making tighter rules and the students are constantly pushing the envelope.
College Senior,2,"The dining hall is our major option, but it always cleans up early and the food is repetitive and not usually very good. We have only one other option and that is also extremely repetitive and has extremely long lines at times."
College Senior,2,"Guys are not hot, stuck-up and think they are the best because of the absurd male to female ratio"
College Junior,2,"There is a 'shopping shuttle' that runs to the local shopping mall and large chain stores on the weekend. Beyond that, the town is pretty spread out and public transportation is grossly inadequate. Taxis are expensive. I highly recommend having a personal vehicle."
College Freshman,1,"We may not have official greek life but we have ""secret societies"" that dedicate themselves to drinking and they can be very annoying."
College Senior,1,"There isn't greek life here. We tried to get it and we were told we were just trying to encourage rape because apparently all frats are rape dungeons. So, yea, good luck with that."
College Senior,1,Good luck finding a party that isn't 5 people smoking drugs or getting violently drunk until they feel mildly OK with their life here.
College Senior,1,There are very few parties. People mostly stick to small cliques and they get as intoxicated as possible as often as possible. But I don't consider these parties because they're literally doing it to cope.
College Senior,1,"Teachers have an agenda and an ideology. They want you to agree. If you disagree they'll grade you more harshly. Many of the professors outside of the Business/Econ departments are openly communists. They're proud of it. It doesn't matter what you feel about communism, because get ready to be forced to agree with it for the sake of a grade. And no, I don't mean socialists. We have plenty of those too, but the professors themselves prefer the label of communism. I have one teacher who unironically advocated calling people capitalist pigs."
College Senior,1,"Everyone here is on SOMETHING to cope. Most people pop addy or smoke weed. I drink as often as I can without risking any harm to myself or my grades. People here are seriously depressed and drugs are the main coping mechanism. If you're not into that be prepared to get isolated or to end up with the creepy straight-edge kids. They're all quiet, unsure how socialization works, and unwilling to stop watching anime in the study areas."
College Senior,1,"People steal things like crazy. We recently had a rash of social security numbers getting stolen. SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. I've seen people get their bank accounts cleared out like it's nothing because their roommate learned their pin and swiped their card. Do not - under any circumstance - leave your door unlocked. The honor code is a hollow shell that no one follows. Don't trust people here.

There's also a bit of a rape epidemic, and nothing gets done about it."
College Senior,1,"A degree from here is essentially worthless. Sure, the paper might get you a job, but you won't actually learn anything that can be used in a workplace. Classes are essentially busy work that don't really benefit anyone. It's a huge joke."
College Senior,1,"This place is a literal trap. PLEASE don't come here. The faculty and staff will lie to you to pull you in and once you're here it's impossibly hard to transfer out. There's a cult-like atmosphere and resisting those involved will get you harassed. The professors try to indoctrinate people into their various political ideologies. If you complain or resist your grades will be tanked. Buyer please beware, no one deserves to waste the best four years of their life here."
College Senior,1,"Everything they tell you here is false. Don't trust their claims of ""good food"" or ""high speed internet."" The food here makes about ~30% of students perpetually sick. I've eaten at a dozen other colleges and this one is by far the worst in terms of dining hall. There are only two other places on campus to get food:  the ""Skellar"" and the ""Red Door."" Both are INSANELY overpriced. And good luck keeping to dhall food. Even if it doesn't make you sick, they charge you a meal EVERY time you walk into dhall. I hope you don't need to go to the bathroom during a meal, because they'll charge you as if you ate two meals. This leads to many people running out of meals before the end of the week and that might actually be a good thing because at least they don't have to eat the trash they're serving us.

The community here is cult-like. There are ideologies that you aren't allowed to publicly disagree with without being harassed. The worst one of those:  having sex after taking a single sip of alcohol is considered rape here--I'm not even exaggerating. One sip of a beer before you have sex and you're considered a rape victim, so long as you aren't male.

The internet here is so bad that it interferes with my ability to get my work done. They insist on installing spyware onto your computer to monitor your activities. If you refuse to let them do that then you can't get online unless you're good at tricking the network's security protocols. They constantly lie to us and say we're going to get high-speed internet, but don't trust them. They've been saying that for four years now and I'm about to graduate without ever seeing this ""high-speed"" internet they claim we'll get. Oh, and if you're into video games then stay away, because all of my friends who play online find themselves lagging so hard that they might as well not play.

Oh, and the classes here are insane. The professors tend to have an ideology and you damn well better agree with it, or you'll have a bad time."
College Sophomore,1,"We have secret societies, and they're not really cool."
College Sophomore,1,"The dining hall food is very poor quality. There is the Skeller, which provides better quality food. The dining hall should stay with basic food items, instead of experimenting with exotic cuisine. I wish we had a system like flames cash which we could use for Mangia, because it is close and it has high quality, fresh food."
College Sophomore,1,Transportation around lynchburg is pretty bad
College Senior,1,"They will not allow us to live off-campus and I understand their arguments for it, but it sucks having to live on this tiny campus all four years. "
College Junior,1,This campus is extremely wet. There is an alcohol policy but it is hardly enforced and students will show up openly drunk to campus events and parties. Minors have easy access to alcohol and it is also easy to access weed and other drugs.
College Freshman,1,"Only the professors are helpful. 

I hate everything else. Stupid policies. Insanely expensive tuition fee. Hell food. on campus housing is required all 4 years. too small <500 students. like a high school, people stay in their stupid cliques."
College Freshman,1,EVERYONE LIVES ON CAMPUS. For the most part it is a requirement to live here.
College Freshman,1,"Overall Terrible School – Not only is the surrounding area of Randolph college run down, but there is absolutely NOTHING to do around campus. And for one of the most expensive campuses in the country, the students do not really see much of their money coming back into the school, or for resources to better education and learning. The showers are terrible and hardly ever get hot. To even get wet I have to completely duck down. The food is terrible and I have been relying on pizza and french fries the majority of my stay here. The one good thing about this campus is that there is a Sonic and BWW within 15 min. The mall is terrible, and so is the overall shopping. The course selection is terrible. The classes are fairly easy, but the overall atmosphere of this college feels like a high school. A high school with no hot girls."

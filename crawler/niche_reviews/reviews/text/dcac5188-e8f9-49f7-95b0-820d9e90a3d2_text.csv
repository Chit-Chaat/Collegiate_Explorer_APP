Senior,5,Auburn University feels like home right away when you step on campus. Every academic college has an inclusive environment.
Alum,5,"I attended two other colleges before coming to Auburn for my final three years of undergrad, and the difference between them was incredible. A year after graduating, I still consider Auburn home."
Alum,5,"The few online classes I took from Auburn were excellent, well-taught, and user-friendly. Nothing beats the campus, but I would recommend online learning if needed."
Freshman,5,Auburn is the university that makes you feel so welcome and at home. I love it so much because I feel that everyone wants you to succeed and graduate with a degree. War Eagle!
Alum,5,"No experience with Auburn online learning, but I would expect it to be quite adequate. All depends on the instructor and the student. Like anything else in life you get out of it what you put into it."
Alum,5,"Auburn is a GREAT place to start your college experience. It may not be the last place you obtain a university degree - a baccalaureate degree just might not be effort these days, but Auburn is it surely is one of the best places to start. A lot of fun while you're at it!"
Senior,5,I have taken 2 classes online at Auburn University and both classes were a breeze thanks to the teachers. They made everything easily accessible and they both responded to emails with questions almost immediately.
Senior,5,Auburn University has been a wonderful experience and I have been here for 5 years. The teachers are dedicated and are there to help as much as they can. The programs are incredible giving you access to connections all around the world. The thing I would like to see changed would be to shift the focus away from athletics and back onto education.
Senior,5,"Although I haven't taken online courses at Auburn myself, I have heard great things about taking them, so if it is something that you want to consider, I say go for it."
Senior,5,"A wonderful school with wonderful opportunities. I feel like apart of the family here, and everyone is always looking out for you. The amount of work is definitely dependent on your major, but don't slack off in majors like engineering, business or science."
Niche User,5,I did not take classes online because I do not attend Auburn University at this time. I have toured the campus
Niche User,5,"I haven't actually attended yet, but everyone on the tour was friendly and able to answer all of my questions. The dining hall food can be lacking but there are other great options located on or near the campus."
Sophomore,5,"My freshman year at Auburn was fun, challenging and educational (in more ways than just class). They provide every opportunity to make the experience what you want and help you get a good education at the same time. There are numerous free tutoring resources, great professors, and an atmosphere that is conducive to helping all students learn. I also learned a ton about living on my own, being responsible, and being my own advocate. If I ever had questions about anything, there was someone I could talk to if I just looked around; my advisor, the financial office, my professors. The campus environment and the older students made the hard transition of leaving home a lot easier. There were so many ways to be involved on campus too, it did not take long to feel like I was at home. Personally, I am involved in Greek life, the Marching Band, and on campus ministries. I really love Auburn and I can not wait to go back in the fall!!"
Sophomore,5,I love this university and I think there are so many great opportunities there. I would love to join more organizations in the future.
Alum,5,I only took one summer course online. Seemed fine. I enjoyed summer classes more than semester classes much more chill atmosphere on campus with less of the student population there.
Senior,5,Professors are available and ready to help. It is mostly easy to follow guidelines and peers are helpful as well.
Senior,5,The best college town ever. Wonderful campus and friendly students. Great traditions and safe environment.
Senior,5,"Everyone at Auburn is truly a family, and I couldn't love it more. There is countless extracurriculars and ways to get involved."
Senior,5,"Our professors used Zoom and Canvas for online learning, and it was a great experience. They were flexible with assignments, as well."
Alum,5,My minor was online and I found it to be an excellent learning environment for myself because I was able to do it in my own time which allowed me to be more thoughtful and engaged in class lectures and discussions.
Alum,5,"I loved being a student at Auburn. I think Auburn is a great place for all different types of people with different backgrounds, beliefs and interests. While Auburn is in East Alabama and the heart of the South, much of the Auburn student body, faculty, and community are very progressive. I found this to be a very supportive place to live and learn and I go back and visit often. I received an excellent education and know that Auburn helped prepare me for the future. War Eagle!"
Junior,5,"I love auburn and everything about it!! on my time in-between classes I can walk to the center of town and grab a sweet lemonade, or go get lunch with my friends. the location of campus is great. everyone is so nice!! my professors really care and want to see me succeed in my academics and in life."
Junior,5,"everyone is always so nice on campus, no matter who you are talking to. it could be another student or faculty member."
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus. Most of my classes are within walking distance and the campus buildings and greenery are beautiful. I would like to see improvement in the waiting periods during lunch time when trying to order food. However, I love my college."
Sophomore,5,I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at Auburn. There truly is a family atmosphere on campus as we are all united by our love for Auburn. Many professors are still very outgoing and want you to succeed. I thought that element would be lost by going to a large University but AU has proved me wrong! War Eagle!
Sophomore,5,"Auburn is by far one of the best schools to attend. It has an amazing atmosphere, filled with so many kind and welcoming people who all love their school. The campus is gorgeous and filled with amazing people. It feels like a second home. Most of the professors you have will actually care about your grade and that you are learning the material effectively. It may be an SEC school, but it is the perfect size. It's not so small where everyone knows everyone and all their drama, but it's not so big that you never see a familiar face."
Alum,5,I had the time of my life at this university! The culture that they created and built made you feel at home.
Alum,5,"Every class is subjective, but the majority of classes at this university were just the right amount of challenging. Most professors here require you to use critical thinking skills."
Sophomore,5,"Auburn is a perfect 4 year college with many degrees to choose from. Also, Auburn makes it easy to balance an academic life and a social life. There is always something going on so meeting people is an easy process and everyone is so nice. There is many ways to help enhance your academic career by starting study groups. The library is the perfect meeting place and also a perfect place to get work done independently. With sporting events also being around it helps students connect with each other and starts new friendships. Overall, the school is great and a perfect bind of an academic and social life. I would recommend that anyone attend Auburn."
Sophomore,5,"I don't take online classes at Auburn, but I have friends that do and they absolutely love it! If I had to take them I would, but I prefer in classroom interaction."
Freshman,5,Auburn has been home since the day I was born! I am so thankful I get to live there for the next 3 years!
Sophomore,5,"I LOVE Auburn University! Coming from out of state, I was a little bit nervous about my transition to Auburn. BUT, the Auburn family is extremely welcoming and helped to calm my nerves a lot. Academics here are vigorous, sports are intense, and student life is to die for. I could not imagine a better fit for myself for college."
Freshman,5,The main thing I like about Auburn is how much of a family we are. Auburn has an all-for-one and one-for-all mindset for its community and wants to make sure that everyone feels like they are included and safe.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Auburn so far has been above and beyond my expectations. Great academics, great professors. Highly recommend the French department!"
Niche User,5,This school is great! I love how everyone basically comes together to become one during football games.
Freshman,5,"I could not thing of a better place to further my education than Auburn University. It is a large college with a small college feel. Every aspect of the campus, academics, housing, and athletics is absolutely perfect. I am positive anyone who tours the campus will fall in love with it. If you are unsure on where to attend college I can be the first to tell you that choosing Auburn will not be a mistake. It is a school built on community and connectivity. I believe any student who chooses to attend Auburn University will truly thrive due to the various types of people and activities. Everyone has a place at Auburn."
Freshman,5,"Since coming to Auburn in the fall, I have seen how hard work, trust in myself, and a passion for nursing have truly paid off. Coming to Auburn from Texas was no easy task, and the first semester was quite the adjustment. However, the Auburn Family embraced me like one of their own and made me feel like I belong here. They taught me what itâ€™s truly like to care for one another, and that is a lesson I will carry with me for the rest of my life. I have worked harder this semester than ever before, in every way possible, and can wholeheartedly say that I am extremely proud of what I have accomplished, academically, and personally. Every bit of last semester was incredibly challenging, but the reward of growth and positive change has made every part of it worth it. I love Auburn, and as a second-semester freshman, I can say that it has without a doubt changed me for the better."
Freshman,5,Great and beautiful school. Has so many majors and you will definitely find what you are wanting to major in. Very inviting atmosphere and so much potential to grow and learn as a person. You get to have so many fun and new experiences.
Junior,5,A very inclusive University that prioritizes their students. Auburn instills excellence into their students and ensures that they try their hardest in all of their endeavors.
Niche User,5,Auburn University has is a large scale college with a very diverse environment. There are people from all over the world that came to Auburn to Pursue their dream career. Auburn has a very effective teaching system that has a variety of different classes with multiple great teachers.
Niche User,5,Amazing school with a great atmosphere.  Campus is beautiful and the program I am interested in is prestigious.  The professors really care for students there which contributes to excellent student life.
Freshman,5,I love the people of Auburn and I enjoy how challenging Auburn is academically. I have found a lovely group of friends in my sorority and I have so happy with my choice of picking such an amazing school.
Junior,5,"Auburn University is a beautiful school. I love the environment and pedestrian campus. All the building are postcard perfect on the campus. The professors are always very well qualified to teach and most are heavily involved in their field as well. There is always something going on on campus whether it is a Greek Life event, fundraiser, or festival. Auburn has concerts, rodeos, musical performances, and more going on year round so, there is something for everyone. There are incredible volunteering opportunities available every week. There are services open to students, faculty, and staff like tutoring, counseling, medical services, and more. They do everything in their power to ensure each one of their students has a presumable college experience and it is very refreshing. The Auburn family is so welcoming. I love Auburn!"
Alum,5,"Loved being a part of the Auburn family. Professors were always caring and Auburn is a great place to live. I had a lot of fun and gained a lot of personal and professional development, including successfully getting into my dream graduate school."
Sophomore,5,"My father went to Auburn so naturally I wanted to go to Auburn as well. However, when I got to Auburn I was many concerned with my studying instead of partying . I managed to get a 4.0GPA that semester. Needly to say I love the atmosphere and the dynamic. The professors are extremely helpful and patience. 10/10"
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Auburn. From the moment I stepped on campus for the first time, I knew it was my home. There are many majors, minors, clubs, and activities. The party scene is alright, definitely not amazing but it is slightly above average."
Alum,5,I really enjoyed the life at Auburn. Professors are generally very kind and very concerned with students.
Sophomore,5,"I love Auburn University because it has offered me a home way from home. The faculty and staff are very helpful and genuinely want to see their students succeed. I have lived on campus in the Residents Halls for two years now and have had a pleasant experience. I would like to see better dining options that are quicker and more affordable to students dining on campus. Additionally,  I would like there to be equal enforcement of rules and standards for all persons. Overall, I believe in Auburn and love it."
Freshman,5,"I love Auburn University, the faculty, resources, and students are amazing. I couldn't imagine going anywhere else. I went through a very hard time so I decided to go to the on-campus counselors since I did not have a therapist in town. They were so great and helpful, they recommended me to many longer-term counselors which is where I found my new therapist. Without their help and support, I would've dropped out of college or could've possibly ended my life to get away from being a disappointment."
Sophomore,5,I love the community here and and have friends that are involved in so many different things. There is always something to do. Walking around campus is also nice and there are quite a few food options apart of the dining plan which is nice.
Freshman,5,"It is  a great college experience, there is always something to do. Athletics are good and fun to support, and the academics are amazing as well."
Freshman,5,I recently went to tour the campus and I did not want to leave. The tour guides were very informative and were able to answer any questions needed. Housing is very nice. Probably one of the nicest housing departments I have seen. Auburn is an amazing campus. It is super family-friendly and everyone is easy to talk to.
Freshman,5,Itâ€™s a beautiful campus. Everyone is nice and itâ€™s feels like home. Itâ€™s not to big where you can get lost but just big enough where you donâ€™t feel trapped. Auburn makes me feels safe and like I am wanted.
Freshman,5,War damn eagle. Best school in the country hands down. They have programs for almost every major and itâ€™s the best school in Alabama hands down.
Sophomore,5,The people that I have met are unlike any other. Everyone is welcoming and very helpful. The professors not only want you to learn but they are willing to go the extra mile to get you the help you need.
Freshman,5,"The best college ever! The dorms could be better, but everyone is super friendly and the classes are great."
Niche User,5,"A great campus that I intend to attend this fall. The football games are awesome, and the recreational activities offered are exceptional."
Alum,5,"I loved the school. Very challenging but I've never felt more at home anywhere. Sports, night life, extracurricular activities. Library was awesome when I was a student, but I've seen it updated since then and it is BEAUTIFUL. Campus police are very helpful if you need a ride or feel unsafe."
Freshman,5,"Auburn University is a special place. The people are nice and very welcoming. The environment is unmatched, everyone is here for the same reason. You smile to random people on the concourse because Auburn's campus is considered a family. I love Auburn and all it has to offer. The professors are great and the school work is challenging but rewarding. The campus is beautiful and my favorite part is that it is very walkable campus. Overall, I believe in Auburn and love it."
Freshman,5,"It is only my second semester here at Auburn University. My first semester was one to remember. Not only have I made tons of new friends, but I have learned so much already. All of my teachers have been respectful and it is evident that they want you to succeed."
Senior,4,"I am in the College of Education at Auburn University. My experiences here at Auburn have been awesome! The teachers are very caring and knowledgeable. The campus is absolutely beautiful. Many big colleges like Auburn University place so much importance on football, but everyone needs to remember that all of these colleges are schools first and foremost. Football is amazing, but at its core, Auburn is a terrific school. I have had wonderful experiences here and enjoy my learning so much."
Senior,4,"There are such weird times now! The whole world got flipped upside down and everyone's routine and safety was changed and put in risk by the coronavirus. With all of this, classes on campus at Auburn University have been very different, especially in the education field. We cannot do our service learning or tutoring in schools. I am not at the practicum level yet, so I am unsure of what those students are doing, as well as what the internship students are doing as well. We are all living in one big dream! It is insane! One good aspect that comes with all of the craziness with the coronavirus is that the professors are more understanding, lenient, and relaxed, since the world is already so out of place. They do not feel the need to stress us out anymore. Half of my classes are online and half are on campus. I look forward to everything getting back to normal so, so soon, but until then, I think everyone is handling it with grace and poise to make everyone feel safe and secure."
Freshman,4,"The majority of my classes are online. It makes it more difficult for me to learn that way, but I just make do and apply myself. I spend countless hours on my computer, but as long as I complete each task with diligence, I have accomplished my goal."
Senior,4,"Personally a big fan of the Auburn family, although we can definitely do better in several areas, truly increasing diversity chief among them."
Sophomore,4,"I began taking online classes when quarantine began. I think my professors did a good job at making it as easy of a transition as possible and make sure we could still take away everything from the class we needed to. I personally really love school so it was a hard transition for me and I did not like it, but that was my personal preference and not anything the school did. I just wanted to be on campus and I do not like technology centered learning."
Senior,4,Classes online are organized well and the online professors are always available to assist when needed.
Sophomore,4,"When the pandemic broke out in the USA, all my classes were online. The professors were (mostly) understanding of the situation and helped us transition to online courses."
Sophomore,4,"I had to take online courses this year due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Most of my professors have never taught an online course before, so it took some time to adjust on both the student and professors side. However, once we got through the bumps in the road the online schooling went smoothly."
Sophomore,4,Many of my professors did an excellent job switching over to online classes. However at the same time a few lacked having an understanding attitude towards their students given the circumstances. They still expected 100% or more when it was truly impossible to do so.
Sophomore,4,"My experience with my online classes was overall as good as it could be given the situation. I am not good with online learning, so it was a struggle at first. However, my teachers were all very understanding and readily worked with me and all of their students because of this difficult time. Many of my teachers were understanding with technological issues and any other issue that could get in the way of online learning. I believe Auburn handled the situation very well."
Junior,4,"Auburn University offers the type of homey type of vibe while away at college. The campus is pretty and there are several good options of food. Professors are generally very helpful and passionate about their topics. The class of students tends to be homogenous and there is often much construction going on, but other than that this is a university with few complaints."
Junior,4,"Online classes included professors that were receptive to the needs of the students, especially during the time of the pandemic. Professors were accommodating and empathetic to specific problems individuals faced. They were also good about checking emails regularly and keeping communication alive which is something that is important when moving things virtual."
Freshman,4,It was definitely an adjustment for all students and professors but everyone knew that we were all having to adjust and Auburn did an amazing job helping us get through such an interesting time on such short notice. I can not wait to be back in the fall!
Sophomore,4,More cheaper on campus housing options available to upperclassman and healthier/ expanded on campus dining options.
Freshman,4,This is an amazing place for you to attend out your college years. The classes are very professional providing you with quality education to help in your career.0
Sophomore,4,"Auburn is a fine establishment that I am proud to call MY university. We have amazing professors that lookout for students and provide expert knowledge and information. Diversity is lacking at our school, but minorities on campus are making enormous strides for more inclusion."
Freshman,4,"The community is amazing with a great mix of a big city vibe but also small town at the same time. Coming to Auburn University, it was actually quite surprising to see how diverse it was and how much it tries to promote diversity. Its sports programs is also on the rise with its already renowned SEC football team. On top of this, Auburn's basketball team is also now on the rise making the sweet 16 and top 8 in March Madness the last 2 years. This upcoming year it has the number 8 nationally ranked recruiting class."
Junior,4,"I love Auburn because of the family feel that comes with being a student here. The classes are also in-depth and prepare you well. I wish Auburn had a ""build-your-own"" major path though. Sometimes they offer similar majors to what you are looking for, but not exact."
Junior,4,Auburn's campus is beautiful. The people here make a great environment for me as a student. Academics are great and the teachers really care and prepare you for a bright future. All the tools for help are also there if necessary.
Alum,4,I graduated from Auburn University with my bachelor's degree. I had family that went to Auburn University so I was familiar with the school before attending. The campus is beautiful and walkable. Food is great and most sports teams are excelling. The academics are rigorous and most professors are helpful. I enjoyed my time at Auburn University.
Junior,4,"Took a while to get adjusted, but love this school and the people I've met! Great institution, needs work some areas, but over all happy with my choice."
Niche User,4,"Auburn felt very cozy and home-like. At the same time, it had a college feel. The rec center is jaw-dropping. I would like to see more places for students to spend time outdoors."
Graduate Student,4,"I enjoy the number of opportunities that I have here, and the campus is beautiful. Still, they could fix the transportation system if you're not within walking distance to campus a car is pretty necessary."
Senior,4,"Auburn University has been a great learning opportunity for academics and life. It is certainly not a small school, but the condensed campus and the fact that it is a small town has made it a place that feels like home. Something I would change about the campus is the food options. We have added a cafeteria-like area and many people I have spoken to do not agree with the changes."
Junior,4,Auburn University has wonderful culture and tries their hardest to provide a great environment to work in. Some professors can be quite strict on students especially grading wise but overall has been a wonderful experience.
Junior,4,"I love that Auburn's classes actually challenge you and encourage you to learn the material yourself through reading as opposed to simply copying notes off the board. I would like to see more free tutoring services offered at Auburn, especially in their science and math division."
Freshman,4,Love the campus. Lots of academic resources and you can tell they drive for success. Great athletics. Big school but many ways to make friends. Lots of options for going out and food.
Freshman,4,"I have not started classes yet but I have been to orientation and tours of campus. The rec center is like no other, it is amazing. Not only the students around campus are nice but the entire city is so sweet and actually enjoy life. Which is different for me."
Junior,4,"Auburn is such a great town with great people. Sure, there are issues everywhere, but I haven't encountered any issues. You'll immediately feel at home and professors, in my opinion, are deeply invested in your future."
Senior,4,"The most beautiful university in the south. The sports are incredible, great clubs and organizations, and also the campus food is improving greatly. The university is constantly building new buildings and Auburn as a whole is getting better and better every year."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the home like atmosphere of the university. The staff is generally very helpful and other students are very nice. There is always something to do and friendly people that encourage you to participate. Advisers are always there when you need them and do a good job at steering you in the right direction. Overall my first year was enjoyable and I would recommend coming here to further ones education.
Sophomore,4,"The entire environment of Auburn is so welcoming and feels like home. I love all the different majors, activities, extracurriculars Auburn offers. It is truly the best decision I made attending Auburn University."
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love it at Auburn. A lot of student evolvement and a ton of fun activities. There are many food options like food trucks and even common restaurants on campus.
Freshman,4,"I especially love the friendliness of the people here and the quintessential college town environment. Not to be forgotten, Auburn has challenging academics as well, leading to a great balance of work and play bound to make your college experience worth it."
Freshman,4,"I loved my experience. The only thing I would change is having professors that actually care. Also, I wish people took better care of campus. I hate walking around seeing people's trash all over the place. I know people are paid to clean, but that doesn't mean you have to make their job harder. Especially when there's garbage cans all over the place. Chances are, you can see at least 1 garbage can from where ever you're standing."
Junior,4,"I am entering Auburn University as a Junior in the fall. The application process was super simple and the staff I have communicated with have been nothing but polite and willing to help. Even though I am not currently attending the university, I have been kept up to date on what is happening on and around campus. The only problem I have had so far involves the lack of scholarship opportunities for transferring students. They were difficult to find, and once found, there were not many to choose from. I wish Auburn University would pursue transfer students by offering more abundant scholarships."
Freshman,4,"Great school with great programs and faculty, very friendly! The student center is a bit small for the amount of students, there is usually nowhere to sit during regular class sessions. Campus involvement and diversity could also improve as well as on campus dining options. Also don't advise the town for anyone who doesn't drive, very difficult to get around on weekends or late at night if you don't."
Freshman,4,"I like how big Auburn University is, it allows me to meet so many different people from all across the country and world. Auburn allows me to challenge myself, so I will be prepared for life outside of college."
Freshman,4,I just started here this year and itâ€™s been a blast! The academics are hard but if you work at it youâ€™ll do great!
Freshman,4,Good at providing lots of opportunities to plug students into organizations and clubs.  Beautiful campus and walkability is good.  Feels very safe.  Dorms and on-campus eating leave a lot to be desired.  Professors grade very hard in some classes.
Junior,4,"From my freshman year to junior year, Auburn has made tremendous steps in the right direction all around campus. They are almost finished building the graduate business building and many engineering buildings. The food my freshman year was pretty basic but they have listened to what the students want and are slowly upgrading food as well. In 10 years I see Auburn as a top 50 school in the nation based on how quickly and effectively changes are being made."
Sophomore,4,"I was not considering applying to Auburn, but once I visited, I was immediately struck by how welcoming everyone was.  I love being part of the Auburn family!"
Sophomore,4,"Auburn university is pretty decent school. Athletics are great, most of professors love teaching, and students work hard to get good results. Every year or two university makes new building so students can study in good environment and it has lot of facilities for students (gym, swimming pool, student center, etc). University cares about students"
Niche User,4,It's a great school! The atmosphere is very friendly and welcoming. I am proud to be a part of the Auburn family. War Eagle!
Senior,4,I've enjoyed my time here at Auburn and would recommend it to anyone looking for a fantastic education as well as a big football fan! War Eagle!
Sophomore,4,"Very good university for international students. They welcomed me very well in the first day, and continue the good behave still nowadays. Also the citizens in here are so friendly."
Junior,4,"This college definitely shapes you into a determined, self-sufficient person.  I have already learned so much in the short time I have been here.  The people are so nice, and professors want to help you.  There are so many resources available to you if you just use them.  What you put into the work is what you will get out of it, for sure.    Be attentive, punctual, and motivated and you should be just fine."
Alum,4,I enjoyed my time at Auburn and would absolutely recommend it. The only thing I would change is the lack of diversity represented at the university.
Junior,4,"I haven't been at Auburn long, but I am a transfer student and this is my first semester here. So, far everything has been very well. They have amazing resources such as free tutoring, study partners, and library. They also have a very good variety of food for students to be able to eat at. Although, the only problem I have had so far is some of my teacher aren't very good. I have one teacher that doesn't speak English very well and has terrible handwriting. But because of the great resources I am able to go to tutoring for it."
Niche User,4,"I really liked the friendly atmosphere of the University. I also liked how informative and helpful everyone was. It seemed like a place that would help me succeed. I did not like the dorms as much as UA, and Auburn does not give away very much scholarship money."
Niche User,4,"I love the campus and location of it.  It has very nice dorms and housing, and the atmosphere is amazing."
Freshman,4,"Great School, I love it. It is not your typical huge SEC school. Auburn is a fun, homey feel to the city. The school is huge but the way campus is set up, it feels way smaller than it is. You will run into friends on the concourse pretty much everyday. There is always something to do in town after classes, or even when school is out."
Senior,4,"They are definitely a great school, but some things are not a priority as it should be! Some of the professors are not helpful and are not great professors."
Graduate Student,4,"Auburn University is a very competitive college. If you like fast pace small community family environment, then you will like Auburn. Well known for its great performance in football, Auburn University is home to the Tigers fans.  War Eagle!"
Junior,4,"Auburn University is a fun, easy-going college culture to submerge yourself in. The school offers great courses particularly in Engineering and Industrial Design."
Senior,4,"I love auburn so much, but i would really love to see more diversity and i want to work to educate people on micro aggressions and how painful and harmful they can be."
Sophomore,4,"I loved my first year at Auburn University.  There are so many ways to get involved, especially for a shy person like me!  Auburn is a family that reaches far past its location in Alabama.  ""War Eagle!"" can be heard from the streets of D.C. to Chicago!"
Junior,4,"Overall, it's a very welcoming and friendly environment. The campus is absolutely beautiful, and it takes no longer than 20 minutes to walk from one side of campus to the next. My only complaints are the constant construction and the ridiculous fees factored into your tuition payments to pay for this construction. Dead days before finals would also be nice."
Alum,4,I had a good experience at Auburn. I liked the school spirit. I would have liked to see more diversity. It would have also been nice to have more opportunities of scholarships for students who have to work full time while balancing school.
Junior,4,Auburn is a nice city. It's not to big and not to small. I enjoy this university because they are not just focused on sports. They have a great engineering department. I would recommend if you can do not take physics here. Try to take it at a community college or another college because the professors do not really care about you learning the material.
Freshman,2,All my classes are online. I have to say that everything is not in order. They are unprepared to teach online courses.
Senior,2,"For the same education you could get anywhere, including an online school, Auburn expects you to pay an outrageous amount. At Auburn the payments to not stop at tuition, teachers will make up fees all semester long and withhold your grade until you pay. After 3 years in the engineering department at this school I can confidently say it is a scam, and you would be better off going elsewhere!"
College Senior,2,Not for me. Seems like the kind of thing you'd want to get involved with if you just can't let go of how socializing worked in grade school. Except now you'd have to pay for your friends.
College Senior,2,"The campus is nice, though a bit bland. The town is small and isolated - about 45 mins from the nearest ""city"", Montgomery. Depending on the curriculum, required courses spend too much time reviewing material from prerequisite courses, possibly because too many students with a failing knowledge are passed. Fewer courses could be required to get a degree if basic comprehension were consistently a baseline for passing, which would in turn save students money. That being said, it is still pretty tough to get an A. In terms of demographics, this university is painfully homogeneous: for every non-white student, there are about 9 or 10 white students. The culture of Southern conservatism is only slightly more implicit than elsewhere in small-town Alabama. So, if you're a white, heterosexual, cisgender Christian, then you'll be comfortably challenged by the low level of diversity (both of demographics and of thought) at Auburn. If you're not all of those things, however, then you run the risk of being scorned for something as simple as walking down the street. I can personally attest to that."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a white conservative Republican atmosphere on campus and in the surrounding city that makes the environment very insular and stifling.  It seems that the only African Americans that get acceptance on campus are those who play football and men's basketball.  Every other African American is seen as invisible unless they yell WAR EAGLE real loud or get too caught up in the Auburn ""family.'  The ""family"" concept is a good marketing tool to try to get people to get involved.  It's like a ""go along to get along/don't rock the boat"" atmosphere instead of the stereotypical ""friendly"" atmosphere.  Many African American alumni are just now starting to embrace Auburn."
College Sophomore,2,The things I've heard about Greek life disgust me.
College Freshman,2,"I don't know much about the Greek life since I have never tried to be a part of it, but it seems like everyone gets along alright."
College Sophomore,2,Professors kind of do whatever they want. It would be much easier if professors were required to be more available rather than relying on teachers assistants.
College Sophomore,2,On campus housing is expensive and not a good value for the money. They are dirty and very small.
College Freshman,2,Greeks are very cliquey and get on everyone's nerves and annoy people on the concourse.
College Freshman,2,"I live in the oldest dorms on campus, so my opinion of the dorms will be pretty negative. In my room alone, we have had issues with ants, worms in our sink, mold, ladybugs, and roaches. There are not many amenities in these dorms except old laundry machines in the basement. The cost is appropriate for the location."
College Freshman,2,"Recruitment is difficult and at times unfair. It is hard to get into Greek life and most Greek people have a certain ""reputation"". Auburn is majority Greek. The sororities aren't allowed to have houses, so they are located in dorms. The fraternities have houses on Old and New rows."
College Freshman,2,"A meal shouldn't cost $10-$16. Also, what are we supposed to eat on weekends. Throughout the year Terrell (the dining option closest for me) had its hours reduced until it was eliminated entirely. If you want us to eat there, it has to be open. I wish I could put $500 on meal plan and then buy groceries for the rest of my food."
College Freshman,2,There aren't many places to eat off campus and they are all unhealthy.
College Freshman,2,"All the food on campus is expensive and after you eat it, it will upset your stomach."
College Freshman,2,The on campus building are rundown and dirty.  I cannot imagine the last time a broom was swept through the hallways and there's always something falling apart.
College Junior,2,"I never lived on campus, but I heard friends complain about it."
College Junior,2,The school gives very few scholarships so your best bet is federal aid and independent scholarships.
College Freshman,2,"Everything is fast food, and I mean everything is fast food. People seem to worship Chick-Fil-A down here and Starbucks and go there daily for multiple meals at a time. There really isn't a buffet that serves healthy options besides the Wellness Kitchen that, let's face it, is really just for the athletes. Terrell is horrible (flies on the food, really?) and Tiger Zone in the Village is decent but soooo far away if you live in distant dorms such as the Hill or Quad. Lupton Deli is about as healthy as you can get on campus with the awesome Plains 2 Plate, but their hours are limited and they are not open on the weekends. Auburn really needs to add healthier and CHEAPER food options. Au Bon Pain for instance is an example of an overpriced meal: 1 sandwich + 1 drink was 13 dollars. Everything is a la carte."
College Freshman,2,"Almost everyone is from the local area, and they all act and look pretty much the same"
College Freshman,2,Academic scholarships are very hard to keep especially when stuck in difficult honors classes
College Freshman,2,"Nightlife at Auburn....... I mean..... There's sometimes stuff to do..... I would have expected a lot more from a big SEC school. The downtown is rather small and most parties revolve around frats, which honestly usually aren't that fun."
College Freshman,2,"Auburn is a quaint, quiet town. Which is nice if you like that.  As a lively college student I find it extremely boring. The shopping options are minimal, and I guess the only good part about Auburn is the fact that it's less than two hours from Atlanta."
College Sophomore,2,"If you're in-state, it's great. You can get a full-ride easily with a 31 ACT.

If you're out-of-state, sorry. Even with a 31 or 32 ACT, you'll be paying $30,000/yr. Not really worth it. 

The only big merit-based scholarships available are the automatic ones you get when you apply as a freshman (see above)

There are small departmental scholarships, but those are just about $1000/yr- Not much when you're looking at paying $40,000 for tuition.

"
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is competitive. If you get an RH pass (maybe 25% of students do?), you can park very close to your dorm. These run about $300 I believe. Otherwise, you can hope for an RO pass, which is about a 5 min walk if you live in the Village, or a 30 min walk if you live in the Hill. These are about $200? There are also a couple other passes for farther off campus. 

A shuttle can take you from your dorm to RO, but you have to wait for it.

Auburn is VERY strict about enforcing parking rules and is not at all hesitant to hand out tickets. You also have to move your car on game-day, so that's inconvenient and an easy way to get a ticket. Watch out. "
College Sophomore,2,"Shuttles are available for on-campus, but not many students use them. You can easily walk or bike anywhere on campus. Probably a 20-30 min walk from one end to the other. That said, the shuttle is nice for students living off campus.

However, if you want to get off campus, YOU NEED A CAR. The shuttle runs to a couple places (Walmart every third Friday, TigerTown once a week...), but it's incredibly inconvenient and honestly more difficult than just waiting for a friend with a car to drive you. You can get by without a car if you have friends that can drive, but it's frustrating to be so reliant on them since Auburn offers little assistance. "
College Sophomore,2,"The academics are not challenging (unless you are in engineering, architecture, or design. These programs are rigorous and competitive). "
College Sophomore,2,"It's in the deep south. Very conservative. Not open to new ideas. If you're looking for a place to exchange ideas and discuss politics, religion, or any type of change, Auburn is not the place to be. Although it's rare that students are blatantly rude, the school has an undertone of ""if you don't agree with us, don't mention it"". The school has been very slow and reluctant to implement anti-hate policies. "
College Sophomore,2,"While the food quality is ok, the price is terrible. A sandwich and a drink will cost you $8. You can't reasonably get a meal for less than $6. There aren't many healthy options and barely any fresh fruit/vegetables available. The staff is (typically) not friendly and is often actually rude, although there are 4 or 5 employees who are well-known to the students for being kind and friendly (Sharlotte, Manuel, Herman...). 

Unlike most campuses, Auburn does NOT have an all-you-can-eat cafeteria or meal swipes. It is entirely a la carte, with a variety of venues (such as Chick-fil-a, Panda, Au Bon Pain, etc.) around campus. Students have essentially an on-campus debit card with which they can buy food at these venues. However, food is very expensive. "
College Sophomore,2,"It's hard to get a permit, and even harder to find a spot. Students who live on campus get better parking - the further from campus your dorm is, the better the parking. Parking services are the worst though. They give out so many tickets."
College Junior,2,"There needs to be more financial aid given out to students that isn't only targeted to special people who excell at academics, athletics, or are just from foreign countries. There are plenty of hard working students who could really use some financial aid who are the smartest or brightest crayon in the box but are just as hardworking if not more. "
College Freshman,2,It's always crowded at lunch time and I only have a few options to choose from as a vegetarian. It's all very expensive.
College Freshman,2,"I am in the Pre-Communication program so I am only doing basics. I don't really know the first thing about my major other than what my friends and Google tell me, Auburn has not outreached to me whatsoever about my major."
College Freshman,2,Auburn was rated the #1 most conservative school in the nation. There are few African Americans and no Hispanics. The Asian population is oddly large. As a bisexual liberal Wiccan I keep quiet so I don't get made fun of by class mates.
College Sophomore,2,We definitely need more parking and accessability.
College Freshman,2,"It's very hard to get a parking pass in the zone closest to your dorm until you're an upperclassmen. But being at a school of 25,000+ kids that's to be expected."
College Senior,2,2 Chick-fil-as about 500 yards from each other. It only gets worse.
College Freshman,2,"Parking costs increased substantially, I have to take a transit from my parking spot, and Fridays before game days I cannot park because my spot is reserved for tailgaters. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not a ton of diversity, mostly rich, white Republicans."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Overpriced, not worth it for the hassle."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Some Greeks are obnoxious, but most are fine."
College Junior,2,It is frustrating that the meal plan is essentially just a credit that can only be spent in on-campus fast food restaurants. No cafeteria to speak of.
College Junior,2,"Restaurants in the immediate vicinity of campus tend to be fast food, but there are options for those that decide to look closer."
College Junior,2,"Generally, computer access is acceptable. There are multiple labs across campus and within specific departments available. However, wireless coverage can be spotty and unreliable at times. Speeds are never very fast, and all BitTorrent traffic is blocked."
College Junior,2,"Even though Greek participation reaches just 1/3 of the overall student body, much of the social interaction revolves around (or at least includes) Greek life. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school is majority Caucasian, with the minorities at a minimum. There are ways to connect with other minority groups, but they are not a prevalent force on campus."
College Junior,2,"I mean it's Greek life. Not my thing, it's a little too squealy and phony for me."
College Junior,2,"Parking permit are outrageously expensive ($160+). It is quite difficult to find a spot in a given parking lot during regular class hours. You have to arrive very early and perhaps search multiple parking lots before you will find a spot. If you are not granted ""proximity"" parking - proximal only in a relative manner of speaking, as in it is still far away from pretty much everything - then you may as well give up and just use the campus buses or plan half an hour to walk to class after driving to campus."
College Sophomore,2,It's the south. There's not much more to say.  I have a class of 120 and all but 5 are white/caucasian.  94 are women and 26 are men.
College Sophomore,2,Not many scholarships unless you were a High School ALL-STAR and a 3.0+ student.
College Senior,2,"Mostly white, upper middle class, Christian southern people"
College Sophomore,2,"Because Auburn University isn't as accepting as one would wish it to be which results in the difficulty of being a minority, all of the frats party together and if you're not involved in a frat of the majority then nightlife won't be of much excitement to you."
Recent Alumnus,2,"AU has students from several different countries and many different races, but the overall minority percentage is only about 12% (I got this stat from the AU website). Most of the students are white and from the US. This is a large school, though, so no matter what race/ethnicity or religion, you can find others from a similar background if you want, or the student body as a whole is pretty accepting, so you can find friends from a completely different background."
College Sophomore,2,"I've never felt completely unsafe on campus, but I would not run around alone at night. There are security guards around campus, sometimes. I see them from time to time. Also there are the help towers on campus where you can supposedly see three more when standing next to one, but I don't believe that to be extremely true."
College Sophomore,2,"Our parking situation is not very good. The prices for permits just went up this past year. There are limited spaces to park since our campus is so small. However, if you live off campus, there is a very efficient transit system that buses the majority of students onto campus throughout the week. They also run at nights on the weekends from downtown. If you live on campus, you can get away with not having a vehicle if you make friends to take you grocery shopping, etc."
College Sophomore,2,"I am an out of state student and finding financial aid has really been a challenge. The grant from my department was taken away so i am unable to get a scholarship through my department. The University has no scholarships available to me. I've been hunting for awhile and STILL have not received a single scholarship. The University keeps recommending FASFA, but again I get nothing."
College Freshman,2,"When it's good it's great. In the first month or so it's not that bad but come September Octoberish it starts to get real. The weather is not your friend. You will get rained on and not just any rain. I'm talking about the kind of rain where you need rain boots, a hat, and a huge umbrella so it doesn't blow up and break. BUT! Don't be surprised if the sky is falling during your 8:00 and its 70 degrees during your 12:30. The weather is extremely bipolar especially during the fall months and winter months. Just make sure you're prepared for everything."
College Freshman,2,"The frat scene is alright, its rare to find a party that is that much fun. For the most part once you hit 21, youll be spending all of your nights at sky bar, and the bars that are more lax on their policies of letting under 21 year olds in are not too much fun."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Sub Par â€“ The Buildings look really old and are gross, and the fitness center is so ridiculously small that it can barely fit 30 people inside."
College Freshman,2,"No Sorority Houses â€“ At Auburn there are only fraternity houses and not sorority houses. Each sorority has a hall and a chapter room in the dorm buildings in the village. While sorority dues are not nearly as expensive compared to at other universities, it really is something the girls miss out on the experience of being in a house together."
Sophomore,1,The online classes are a main source of teaching this fall. I do not find this conducive to good learning and am not happy about so many teachers making the decision to teach from home due to being scared of a virus. They definitely didnâ€™t do this during the flu crisis that had a much higher death rate than this virus.
Senior,1,"Online learning was even worse than in the classroom. After I payed all their hidden fees for the classroom, we moved online, and they tried to make students pay an additional fee for every class they were in! The only thing your tuition dollars go to is pretty flowers on campus and building a new library or gym every couple years. When I tried to talk to someone about the hidden fees I got transferred 7 times before my grade got so low I payed! The University of Phoenix is probably equal to or better than Auburn Online."
Graduate Student,1,"Worst staff of kind. Starting from Krysta Weed, outreach manager. Then Elaine Manning (Most cunning person, should not be in university). Wang, program director, Penny Christopher and George T Flowers. A bunch of scammers. Money hungry people, won't process your application until you call them. 1 star is also too much."
Sophomore,1,"Not the best school for people of color. Curriculum is great and professors are good, but often times you are the only non-white in your class, no matter how big the class size is. Most of the students are white or white and members of a sorority/fraternity and everyone else is an outsider. It is depressing. Auburn University, please work on accepting more diverse students or students who are not just focused on Greek Life. I mean the majority of your students even dress the same way. Please save your money and go somewhere with more support socially."
College Junior,1,It seems like every girl in auburn is in a sorority
College Junior,1,"Auburn doesn't give aid unless you are a merit scholar or valedictorian at your high school. Very expensive out-of-state tuition. After your first year it is still hard to get money, even if you do good."
College Freshman,1,"A bunch of rich, white, conservatives.... Not very diverse at all. Most of the students don't even seem to promote diversity. Not only are most people the same race, they also all dress the same..... Which is find weird. So yeah.... Diversity...... No."
College Freshman,1,Good luck walking everywhere. Especially when it rains.
College Freshman,1,You do not know whether to dress for rain or sunshine around here. I saw be prepared for anything. The heat is unbearable and the cold is bone-deep.
College Junior,1,There is not nearly enough parking on or near campus!! It is what I am most frustrated about my college.
College Sophomore,1,"So I don't have a car here and I'm kind of glad I don't. It's such a hassle. Parking permits are way overpriced and the Auburn traffic cops should probably be ranked best in the nation at giving tickets. Literally you'll park in the wrong spot for five minutes and you'll already have a ticket. I don't know how their so on top of their jobs, but it's incredible. You don't need a car to get around on campus, but I sometimes wish I had one so I had the opportunity of going farther off campus than just downtown Auburn."
College Senior,1,"One tiny mall in town supplemented by two Wal-Marts, a Target and various grocery stores do not make for a lot of options. The small town tries to hold events, but the parks are too small and the events too poorly executed that its not even worth trying anymore."
College Senior,1,"As an ethnic person, pretty much every social advantage at Auburn is unavailable. A lot of women don't want to date you (can't take you home to daddy) and guys would rather have white friends. This results in groups being formed of the ethnic/non-Southern WASP people which divides the campus. However, with a 70% caucasian population, doesn't matter too much."
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking is atrocious. No drop off zones.
Recent Alumnus,1,Could be better. Auburn is far from everything.
College Junior,1,"Housing on-campus is unacceptable. Freshmen are not guaranteed housing (chances are determined by how fast you signed up online), and even the housing that is provided is old and moldy. There are no real amenities provided. Depending on your major, your dorm could very well be farther from class than some off-campus housing options. Rooms are not extremely small but not very large either. Worst of all, the value is absolutely terrible - even expensive off-campus housing options are almost always cheaper on a per-month basis than the dorms are. And to top it off, RAs can be a mixed bag; some will cause a havoc for playing music at a somewhat-high volume."
College Sophomore,1,"The cheapest leaving options on Campus ""The Hill"" is the worst it has been there for years! and needs a lot or re-vamping. The parking lots are covered with giant pot holes and it is a hassle to find parking. There are these old big back TV's in most of the dorms that student's can't use because auburn has upgraded to an HDTV system, but failed to upgrade the TV's. There is a broken foosball table in some of the dorms or nothing at all. Not really the place to hang out. Then there is ""The QUAD"" which is also ancient. Then The Village (for the athletes, scholarship students, rich kids, and sorority girls) and the new South Donahue dorms."
College Sophomore,1,The diversity within the student body at Auburn University is horrible. Not only is their a minority ethnicity-wise but also a minority of those that aren't affiliated in greek life. There have been many times that I was looked over on the concourse for reasons that I am left to believe were due to my ethnicity. When events were taking place or when things were being handed out on the concourse I was almost always ignored!
College Junior,1,There is very little diversity at Auburn. On campus you'll see mostly white students walking the concourse. There are a few black students in each class- and occasionally you'll see a few groups of asians walking around as well.
Recent Alumnus,1,"They always oversell permits, so parking is a nightmare. You may get lucky if you have early classes and get on campus before 7:45am. If you have later classes, either get to campus 30-45 minutes before your class, or ride the transit. One thing I used to do when I didn't live near a transit stop, I drove to an apartment community with guest parking and parked there to catch the transit (they all have transit stops)."
College Freshman,1,Parking in Auburn is a huge ordeal. Most spaces require a pass to park and tow trucks are eagerly waiting for someone to break these laws. Towing is a daily problem. Parking passes are limited and outrageously priced.
College Freshman,1,"Parking on campus is never easy to find. The way the permits are set up between the Quad and Hill make it difficult to find an available spot. The Hill has a vast number of spots available extremely close to their dorms. They also have a level to themselves in Stadium Deck parking, which greatly limits the number of spaces available for Quad residents. However, the Quad only has one floor of spaces within a comfortable distance. After it is filled, we have to trek all the way across campus to parking that is much more convenient for the Hill residents."
Recent Alumnus,1,There isn't much parking and you get ticketed often.
College Sophomore,1,"The parking is my biggest complaint, they have very little parking and a lot of is is reserved for teachers or rich kids. Don't bother buying a parking permit, just take Tiger Transit"
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is definitely one of the weak points of the University. Parking passes are costly, but not necessary if you live off campus. The parking lots/decks become a free-for-all after 5pm, convenient for night library trips.  Because of the size of the campus and the limited parking, they are sticklers about ticketing and fines. If coming on campus to park for classes, give yourself time to find a spot."
College Sophomore,1,It is often complete chaos and it is often hard to find a spot
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus can big a huge nightmare and a hassle. As freshmen you do not need a vehicle, unless you have a job off campus. However if you do have a vehicle try to make it to campus at least 45 minutes before your first class because you will be searching for a parking space. Make sure you are parked in the correct parking zone as well because it is enforced on campus and the parking staff does not take it lightly. Classes are within walking distance and the campus provides a transit system and also a night shuttle that will take you anywhere on campuse."
College Freshman,1,"Before I came here, I had heard how strict parking was and how you can never find a spot.  I thought people were exaggerating, but I have experienced it first-hand.  I have only been attending Auburn for a month now and I have FIVE parking tickets ($50 each) automatically billed to my e-bill.  Before this, I had no tickets on my record - a clean slate.  It doesn't matter if you try to park in the correct places.  You can barely see any signs, and Parking Services are not understanding.  I went in there crying after I received my fifth ticket (and a boot on my car) and they still made me pay for it.  Good Luck finding a place anywhere around here!"
College Senior,1,"The parking situation here at Auburn University has gone from bad to worse. The parking services employees are extremely rude, bitter Nazis who have nothing better to do with their time than to set-up a skewed system by which they can punish the ""disobedient"" students of Auburn. They doubled the price of a C Zone parking permit while simultaneously reducing the number of available spaces. Part the the reduction of the C-Zone parking was the creation the of PC (preferred commuter) parking which costs $160.00 for a parking permit if you win their lottery at all. Parking Services at Auburn has been the disgrace of this great University for many years now."
College Junior,1,"I didn't think it possible, but the college has actually gotten WORSE with the parking.  Now they have a ""lottery"" where they say they randomly pick students to get the old C parking spots to guarantee parking there.  GREAT if you happen to have a contact or are supposedly the ""lucky"" one to get it.  If not, you are basically screwed.  Really for 15,000 dollars a semester, you should be able to park at this college.  This is an Epic Fail."
College Freshman,1,"Don't Even Try â€“ If you live on campus, you get to park a little over a mile away from where you live. If you live off campus you can (and are advised) to take the Tiger Transit (free for students) onto campus. Otherwise you get to fight over parking spots in lots that are varying distances fromt he core of campus. Of course you can park at the mall or Winn Dixie, both places are okay with this and cathc transit from there. Auburn is a predestrian campus, so there are few parkignlots, as thre are few roads on campus that you can drive on."
College Sophomore,1,No healthily food anywhere.  The smoothies on campus have like 80 grams of carbs.  Fast food with high calorie and fat content is abundant.
College Freshman,1,I have a total of three fifty dollar tickets for parking outside my dorm to bring in laundry for approximately 15 minutes.  They also automatically deduct the amount from your e-bill. Totally uncompromising and unfair. Absurd.  Parking is among if not THE most complained about problem at Auburn.
College Freshman,1,"Grease Is the Word â€“ There is absolutely no where on campus to eat healthy food.  And I am not one who is usually concerned about healthy food, but you can only take so much Chik-fil-A, Chik-N-Grill, Lupton's, Taco Truck, blah blah until you scream ""CAN I PLEASE GET A SALAD PRONTO!"" I have actually lost weight because I cannot stand eating the food on campus."
College Freshman,1,"Camebridge Off-Campus â€“ It is absolutely terrible, needs no more explanation"
College Student,1,"Scholarships are awful because you could have a 36 on the ACT but you wouldn't get any money if your GPA isn't higher than a 3.5. It doesn't matter how hard your classes are, they will not care."
College Student,1,For students who live on campus we have to park our car in such a far away lot we have to take a bus to get there. It's awful.
College Freshman,1,"Auburn University is located in the deep south, and as a result while some students are recruited from other areas, most students come from Alabama and share in typical southern beliefs. The racial diversity is almost non-existent as most students are white with maybe a total of 15% of the student body being any other race. The religious diversity is fare but not advertised. Likewise 50% of students on campus come from families whose income totals over $150,000 per year, and the other %50 is either on scholarship or loans. There are a lot of challenges posed at AU for students seeking to break the traditional molds and mingle with other groups. Mingling is looked down upon by many students and the University doesn't go far out of it's way to make students of different backgrounds feel welcome. Auburn has a lot of room for growth in this area."
College Freshman,1,"THE AUBURN POLICE DEPARTMENT BOTH ON AND OFF CAMPUS ARE CRAZY ABOUT GIVING TICKETS!! If you park in the wrong zone/spot even for 30 seconds during restricted hours your car will either have a ticket on the windshield, a boot on the tire, or be the newest member of the Auburn Impound Lot. Likewise, if you run a yellow light, cut off pedestrians, or speed at any rate, you will have a ticket faster than you can blink. Moral of this story: Do exactly as you are supposed to do when driving."
College Freshman,1,"Dorms? Ha. That'd Be a Nice Option. There is hardly any space for students to live on campus. Between the Quad, the Village, and the Hill, there's only room for a few thousand students. The entire freshmen class won't fit on campus. That's right: freshmen aren't guaranteed housing. I love Auburn, but I'll be honest, I've never heard of another school say that to freshmen. Many are forced to get off campus dorms or apartments. There are THOUSANDS of apartments and student housing around town because most students don't live on campus. If you're Greek, you most likely have a frat house or hall in the Village you can stay at sophomore year or above. If you're not, however, you have to come up with your own housing. Living off campus isn't terrible though, I actually really like it. It's hard sometimes, but you get a better room that comes furnished for a MUCH cheaper price than if you were paying the outrageous cost of room and board. It sounds tough but in the end, living off campus is worth it and is a better choice! If you have your heart set on living on campus at your college, either act fast to ensure a spot or find a place that guarantees freshmen housing."

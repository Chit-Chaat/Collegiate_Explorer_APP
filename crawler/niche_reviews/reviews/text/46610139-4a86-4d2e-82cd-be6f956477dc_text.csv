Senior,5,"I LOVE THE TEACHERS!  I have only had two teachers that were below par, otherwise I’ve had some of the best teachers!"
Junior,5,"I love how my universities business college exposes their students to some of the best opportunities like internships, conferences, and coding competitions!"
Freshman,5,"I’ve had a tour of the campus, I’ve been accepted to attend this coming spring 2021, so this scholar ship would really be a big blessing to me"
Freshman,5,I e had a couple of zoom calls and everyone went smooth and they were nice and very understanding and answered all my questions
Niche User,5,My learning experience was great. I took all my classes on campus. The teachers are really helpful. As well as the staff.
Niche User,5,"I loved the diversity. There were so many people from so many walks of life. Also, student life is amazing."
Niche User,5,"Personally, I had professors who were very comfortable with the online system; they were used to it. I really like the way they teach because they make students feel as if they were on face to face classes. I know it's very hard for them to handle this situation."
Niche User,5,"I came in the United States last year from France. I've been feeling like I was more advanced than the majority of people, so I decided to become a dual-enrollment student at GSU. Unfortunately, because of the COVID-19, everything is settled online, so I cannot enjoy the feeling of being on a college, in the campus."
Freshman,5,My experience with professors is quite well. They go above and beyond to help students understand and retain information. The work can be hard at times bit there are many options for tutoring and office hours. All professors have office hours which is very efficient when you have a question with assignments. Tutoring is available Monday-Fridays and is very efficient and helpful as well.  For the most part the teachers are very understanding and will help you understand whatever you have problems on.
Freshman,5,"I love Georgia State University. So far, my experience here has been great. The school is very diverse and filled with so many different personalities. The people that I have encountered are very supportive of my goals and help me with everything that I do. It is very easy to get around campus, and there is a lot of activities and opportunity all around campus. Student life is very  manageable and living on campus is very exciting and wonderful. Georgia state has many things to offer and many clubs that will look good on your Portfolium. Georgia state is also open to many ideas and they care about the students well being. I can honestly say that since I have been here I feel important and my voice matters. Georgia state is the place to be and is a great start if you are looking forward to starting college life in a big city. Georgia state is located in downtown Atlanta and has many tourist stops to explore. Living on campus for me is a good experience because I have seen a new world."
Freshman,5,"I like GSU because they are very helpful. I have academic advisors and they help because I can set up a meeting with them anytime I have questions or don't understand something. The professors are also very helpful and they are mindful that all courses are online so sometimes they don't give us a lot of work especially on the weeks we have exams. Georgia State has many resources for you so that you won't become behind or feel the need to drop out. As well as this scholarship I have with Atlanta Achieve, I have monthly meetings with people from Atlanta Achieve so I can stay on track and also keep my scholarship."
Freshman,5,Easy to communicate with professors if you have a doubt or simply need to contact them. Very easy to navigate. Professors explained what they need from you and upload videos of your lessons along with documents that support it.
Junior,5,I love the diversity of the school! I also love the city so having Georgia State right in the heart of Atlanta is amazing. I am also involved on the dance team at state and it is like my second family! The girls on the team are some of the best friends I have ever had in my life. There is a spot and place for everyone! There are so many different clubs and things to do in Atlanta!
Senior,5,GSU is amazing! The professors really care about your education and want to see you succeed. I'm so happy that I chose GSU.
Senior,5,"I love the diversity of GSU. The campus is full of life and is an excellent fit for partiers, researchers, and more."
Niche User,5,"If you like the big city Georgia State is the place for you. I like Georgia State because I'm close to home which is always a good thing. You can go to athletic events join clubs, and hangout with friends and make memories you will never forget."
Freshman,5,I like it the college has been pretty nice giving me more free time to do my work and finish it. I get to create my own schedule which allows me to work on my strengths more and learn more.
Freshman,5,"My online classes are fairly self-explanatory. I like that I can work ahead, so I save a lot of time. I also love that most of my professors do not have zoom/web-ex classes, so I never have to worry about accidentally missing them. Sometimes I have questions, but the syllabus usually answers most of them. The first week was good too, most teachers did not give that much work. I wished to have in-person classes, but under the circumstances, online classes are great."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshmen at Georgia State University. All my classes are online which means I have not gotten a chance to visit the campus yet. I have seen it when I have been to Atlanta but I have not been inside the buildings. I know many people who have been and graduated from Georgia State and I have heard nothing but good things. I am excited to hopefully have in-person classes next semester so I can actually live the campus life. I am not living on-campus since I only live about 40 minutes from Atlanta, so to save some money I will commute."
Sophomore,5,"Since this will be my second year in GSU, I’ve noticed that I enjoy how welcoming it is to be in this college. In my freshman year attending class on campus, I saw the diversity and all kinds of people from many cultures in each class room, library, cafeteria, and in the hallways. It was great seeing that because it didn’t make me feel different, but more accepted to be myself and make some friends. The professors are great and have shown that they actually care for students and their academics. One thing that I would like to see within this college is safety check up with metal detectors, for all students safety."
Niche User,5,"Georgia State is a great campus. Very student, friendly, and diverse with many different extracurriculars and activities for any type of student. This is probably one of Georgia's most notable public universities. They also have a multitude of career choices and courses, and allow you to really make your own schedule. Georgia State also provides a dual enrollment for a numerous amount of campus locations. I love the school and I cant wait to get my degree and credits."
Niche User,5,So far GSU has a great online scene. They keep the students informed and have a fast reply to emails. They have a secure line to make sure none of your information can be accessed from outside users.
Sophomore,5,Very smooth transition from in-person to online classes. The professors and other faculty have made sure to make the experience as easy as possible.
Sophomore,5,The experience of staying on a city campus is actually quite nice. It takes getting used to but it is very easy to maneuver throughout the city.
Freshman,5,"Georgia State University is a diverse school located in downtown Atlanta. This location provides the students with several opportunities to become involved in  local internships. I love that the campus if filled with school and city spirit. Students are always welcoming others and ensuring that no one is felt left out or excluded. However, the only con about this school is that because it admits so many students, that it becomes difficult for the staff to stay updated on emails and students' requests. For instance, because of the COVID-19 pandemic all of the staff has been working from home and because of this it is harder and takes longer to receive a reply from some of the school's departments. Overall, it is an incredible school that gives students opportunities to receive an excellent education and allows us to follow our dreams and make the world we live in a better place for us all!"
Freshman,5,The big appeal of Georgia State is the diversity and location! Georgia State is in the heart of Downtown Atlanta and has student of every background you can think of!
Sophomore,5,I love attending Georgia State University. It is a very diverse school that has six great campuses. The professors are amazing and willing to help you with whatever you need. I have not experienced one bad thing about this school.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the online learning experience that Georgia State University provides for its students. The professors make the online classes enjoyable as they do for the in-person classes.
Freshman,5,The classes are amazing the professors are nice and are very willing to help students out with understanding
Freshman,5,It has been great so far the advisor respond fast to all question I have so far and are a great help
Sophomore,5,"I have liked everything about the school, my only dislike is a couple of professors. The school its self was amazing."
Sophomore,5,I have taken many online classes and I love them all. Would do it again even with everything going on right now.
Niche User,5,"My professors were quite accomodating in contrast to the usual poor student reviews. In addition, I found the environment quite enriching having something for every ethnicity, race, sex, and religion with no discrimination whatsoever. I found my time here to be very fulfilling and could never replace such a stellar education."
Graduate Student,5,"Excellent! Extremely diverse in majors and students. It is in the heart of Atlanta, which creates a wealth of internship opportunities. I would highly recommend this University for both Undergrad and Graduate students."
Graduate Student,5,Very progressive take on online education. They have adapted well to web necessities. I am impressed by all professors involved in my online educational experience.
Sophomore,5,"I have had online classes at Georgia State. Each of my professors used different online platforms they felt best suited the learning material. Overall, Georgia State made a fairly smooth transition from in-class learning to online."
Sophomore,5,"I have taken online classes, especially with Covid. Classes such as US History, Biology, and Stats. The facility did a great job of emailing, video chatting, and just making sure everyone was aware of what to do."
Sophomore,5,The thing I love most about Georgia State is the diversity but  togetherness. Everyone knows that the system is broken and we all stand together to help and try to make a difference. Something I would change would have to be all the traffic to commute to school.
Sophomore,5,"This past spring semester is when I started taking solely online classes. Before then, all of my classes were face-to-face. Being that not only the students, but the professors as well had to all learn how to make such a big transition to only online learning, I can say that the experience actually turned at better than expected. Work and class meetings were easy to access and attend and even with everything being online, the professors were still very helpful."
Alum,5,I liked teh professors and the various types of teaching styles. I would like to see more multicultural classes.
Junior,5,"great!great school, I had a wonderful time applying and the process was very easy the staff were helpful and cared for the students well-being."
Niche User,5,"iCollege is a very intuitive and easy way to complete any and all courses and coursework, and it makes it very simple to navigate and find exactly what you need to succeed."
Junior,5,My professors were extremely accommodating and the university provided me with a plethora of resources to make the transition to online classes as easy as possible!
Junior,5,"During Spring 2020, GSU had transition its traditional, face-to-face classes to online. Personally, this transition was not daunting, since my professors were very understanding of the situation every student was caught in. In response, my professors lessened the workload and instructed the students to focus on studying for the final exams and quizzes remaining in the class. In case any students had questions, professors were more flexible in their office hours and responding to their emails."
Junior,5,"It went really smoothly, i took Bio 2 online and my professor responded to every question I had for him. Overall, GSU does a great job when it comes to shifting online."
Senior,5,"I love it! Georgia State is a diverse university where you see a lot of different people. You learn about their culture and how they do things. Majority of the teachers that I have are very kind, and they are open to help you in any type of way. There's also free tutoring, that's a huge plus for me!"
Sophomore,5,"Tuition is cheaper than most schools so a lot of the times, your professors are student teachers. Select professors that stood out and I will remember but for the most part, pretty average for the undergrad program."
Niche User,5,My experience with GSU has been phenomenal. I have attended the college as a dual enrollment student and spent two semesters studying in the campus. The professors are lively and helpful every day and do not hesitate to help students in need. You are given all the tools necessary to succeed. The only thing that determines a student's outcome in a class is their own effort in a course.
Niche User,5,"Although I have only experienced Georgia State online due to the effects of the Corona virus, it demonstrated a safe, organized, and open environment that allowed students and professors to communicate with each other in an effective manner. There were very few miscommunications. Any problems that may have arisen were solved with haste out of respect for maintaining a well constructed learning environment."
Sophomore,5,"I love being in the city, there are so many more job opportunities going to school downtown. The school really encourages creativity and individuality and has a lot of great resources."
Sophomore,5,"Due to Covid-19, all classes were moved online. All my professors were very understanding and helpful in such a difficult situation. The online classes are easy to navigate, it just takes self discipline to get the work done!"
Sophomore,5,"The major change I would love to see is, for the roads around the school well kept and the traffic around it controlled better."
Sophomore,5,"I love everything about my school. I was having a great time living in the Commons and going to class everyday until in-person classes were canceled due to the pandemic. Thankfully, all of my professors handled it well and I was able to complete my sophomore year!"
Sophomore,5,"Most of my teachers made video lessons for our classes, it was much better than simply having to read chapters out of a book."
Freshman,5,I took my first class on line and it was way better than sitting in a classroom for me. I was able to connect with the professor and my fellow classmates on a level that was understandable.
Sophomore,5,"An advantage of being a student at Georgia State University is the fact that it is in downtown. This means that there will be opportunities for networking with people and getting involved in different organizations and activities. In addition, there is no way that you cannot be inspired because many people are there to help you become successful in your endeavors. With all these in mind, I still believe that one thing that can be changed is for it to be mandatory for the teachers to have a personal discussion with you if it is projected that your grade will be a D or lower for the rest of the semester."
Alum,5,Georgia State University is an excellent school to attend. They offer a range of programs in a diverse setting. They are affordable and competitive in academics to other Georgia universities.
Freshman,5,"Just finished my freshman year at Georgia State. At fist I was planning on transferring but early in to the first semester that quickly changed. I met some of my best friends here and the teachers are amazing. Campus is also relatively safe, I haven't had anything shady happen to me since I've been here. If you are considering this college please come, it has a great atmosphere and the location is amazing as well. #State>Southern"
Freshman,5,"- I love how there are many job opportunities here, and the food is one of my favorite things about this place!"
Freshman,5,"Georgia State University is an amazing school! The professors care about their students and communicate with them effectively. They encourage students to reach their goals and never let them down. Students look out for other students and always willing to help each other. Courses are not bad as long as you study. I love the main campus and the satellite campuses, which are great for those wanting intimate classes for their first two years."
Freshman,4,"Overall, GSU is a diverse and decent institution. I've recently just applies for Spring classes, and compared to many other websites I've used the user interface is crisp and user-friendly. While I've yet to still step foot on campus to actually attend in-person classes, graduates have told me that campus services are really exceptional."
Sophomore,4,"It's been pretty alright for the most part, there're some bumps with certain professors and subjects here and there but so far it isn't too bad."
Senior,4,"GSU is a great university with some great teachers.  Most people are very friendly and helpful! The campus is very diverse and set in the middle of downtown which makes for some cool views.  Only negative I could say is the financial aid office, they’re very slow and it’s hard to find someone who wants to do their job.  Recently I’ve gotten the managers number and she’s great, but overall most of the employees in that office have horrible attitudes and don’t want to help!"
Alum,4,"The school campus may not be ideal, however, the opportunities the school provides is redeeming. The location is right in the city, hence why the safety may not be ideal, but there is always something fun to do. If you take advantage of the experiences offered, you will have a nice time and do well in school."
Freshman,4,"It was stressful at first but after the first couple of weeks of classes, it became easy and understandable and there was people to help me when school first started."
Freshman,4,"I go to the Alpharetta campus, it’s very well maintained and well equipped. The professors are good and always available to you."
Freshman,4,"So far all of my online classes are going pretty well. None of them have a set schedule, which is fine with me. This gives me a chance to really work on my time management skills."
Freshman,4,"Georgia State University was my dream school. In a way, I am disappointed with how everything is turning out. It is hard to get in touch with people in the financial aid department, which is frustrating. I come from a single parent house hold, so money is pretty tight. I need all the help I can get, so it feels like its hard to get anything done."
Freshman,4,Online work has been okay I get it done but sometimes it harder to find what I need to do because I have to click many links to find what I need to accomplish. I wish there was a page like in my math work where they tell me all the due dates instead of clicking many links so i can manage my time much better.
Junior,4,"It is strictly ok. It isnt that great, because some of the courses have been heavily disorganized and there have been clashes of the live sessions. Ive seen people who had 3 live sessions at the same time which is not good as they cannot focus on either. Georgia tech is really organized by keeping the sessions at their particular class times instead of putting them whenever."
Junior,4,"It is a pretty good university to attend to for majors like computer science, nursing economics. The diversity of this school appeals to me. It is very diverse. The campus downtown is decent as well, not that safe but can get through. It spread out all around the place which is why you may see all the people including homeless."
Sophomore,4,"I’ve taken about 5 online courses in GSU, it’s very convenient for me due to many things going on in my life. All of my professors have done well with addressing their teaching content. What’s great about online classes is that it does offer flexibility and although it isn’t on campus, the professors still find a way to engage students to interact and work in groups for our better understanding. I’ve noticed that it is important to write down deadlines especially when taking online courses, because deadlines are most likely not allowed to be extended."
Sophomore,4,Georgia State is a big campus inside of a big city but once you get to know people in the area the campus feeling turns out good. Mostly everyone is friendly especially your college peers. One thing that I would like to see change is walking distance to certain classes.
Sophomore,4,"With Corona virus taking a hold on classes on campus, resorting to online classes was not too bad. Was able to be in constant communication with my professors. Did really good on my exams. It is not a bad experience by any means."
Sophomore,4,Georgia State University has been good to me so far. My grades have been good and I enjoy the social dynamic of the school. Loads of opportunities to pursue
Senior,4,"Overall GSU is a great school, the price of tuition is very fair, while its facilities are exceptional."
Freshman,4,"I am about to start my classes in two weeks, and this will be my first experience taking a full semester of classes online. I hope that the professors will be easy to contact and ask questions."
Junior,4,"As a transfer in from a small town; Georgia State immediately came off as overwhelming because of the aura that the city of Atlanta presents. Upon setting in, as a student who is involved in the entertainment industry I immediately noticed how action packed the community is. My teachers are becoming mentors the more conversations I have. The lack of the fifth star ONLY presents itself because I was lucky enough to be out-going and willing to explore the city and my academic buildings. The big city can easily make you feel like you're just another number; but if you put in the effort to stand out; Georgia State will notice. LOOK INTO MEDIA ENTREPRENEURSHIP!!!!"
Junior,4,Spring 2020 presented itself as an emergency halt in face-to-face. I'd say that overall I commend my teachers for putting an enormous amount of effort into that tough transition. The majority of my instructors kept a constant eye on progress and was willing to help in various ways outside of academia and instead looked at the situation from a very humanistic perspective.
Freshman,4,"Corona has moved a lot of classes and other activities online, which isn’t ideal but they are handling it well!"
Sophomore,4,"The professors were all supportive and understanding. iCollege allowed for a streamlined way to turn in completed assignments online. The Atlanta GSU campus was very large, spacious, and easy to navigate. The student centers had a variety of foods and beverages available to eat between classes. However, I am confused as to why online courses have the same price as physical classes on campus."
Freshman,4,"I have yet to take classes, as I am an entering Freshman, but there seems to be lots of emphasis on blended learning and safety amidst the Coronavirus pandemic."
Senior,4,"Georgia State university is a pretty good school. They have good programs, a great library and great  diversity. The facilities are pretty good as well. I have not studied at other schools so I do not know how to compare but I have enjoyed my time so far. 
Note that you will not have anymore pushing you to success, so you have to be self motivated and do your best. If you need a lot of external motivation, then this will not be the best school for you. To get the best out of your professors, you will need to engage with them frequently. This is the same rule as most schools but I find it particularly important at G-State. 
It does not have a traditional campus as building are spread out across downtown Atlanta. This will be a shock to people accustomed to a closed campus community. However, this offers a unique experience as college life is mingled with normal life. This actually makes sense when you realize college is only a few years of your life."
Senior,4,"I have taken online classes only due to covid19 interruption. One professor did great, the other, not so much."
Freshman,4,"I have yet to learn from GSU, but I'm hoping that they live up to their information in being a very good school that can further educate students of all walks of life."
Freshman,4,"I'm an incoming freshman, and I would say that my experience with GSU has been fairly good. The staff are nice, charismatic and effective in helping with problems."
Alum,4,I took online classes a couple of years ago before COVID-19 and they were pretty good professors responded qucikly.
Sophomore,4,"I thoroughly enjoyed the online learning experience, and I even chose to enroll in a few online classes this summer. I felt that my schedule was more flexible and fitting to an online course, allowing me to work and enjoy time with family. I think Georgia State did a great job of switching to online, but I suggest taking the time to train professors in the online field. Online classes can be a great resource, but it can also lead students to failure if their professors are unsure of what to do."
Sophomore,4,I love the environment of Georgia State and all the culture that surrounds it. I came from a majority-white county in North Georgia and was beyond ready for a change. Georgia State is a school that strives for greatness with all of their students. I just finished my freshman year and enjoyed every second. My only complaint is with the Financial Aid office. There are times where you will sit on hold for over an hour and not even receive an answer to your question. I also wish the school was more transparent about changes in tuition prices or basic financial aid issues.
Senior,4,I like Georgia state and I've liked a lot of my professors. But recently the education program has had some issues with staying organized and consistent. Some of the professors aren't clear about their assignments. But I like a lot of stuff on campus like the library and the gym. And the accommodation office is very responsive.
Sophomore,4,I love that Georgia State is so innovative! They really make sure their students are on a good pathway for graduating.
Junior,4,I like it here at GA State University. It is a diverse school with a good campus. We have the appropriate amenities for the students and the housing is better than expected. They are handling Covid-19 better than I expected them too.
Junior,4,"I would say that learning online here at GSU can vary. There are some professors that care and others are like ""Here is the whole semester you do it"". Overall though I like being able to go at my own pace."
Sophomore,4,"I took 2 classes online all year, which was a good experience. When coronavirus happened and all classes switched to online, most of my professors adapted well and did a good job continuing to teach."
Sophomore,4,My favorite part about Georgia State is that its in the city of Atlanta. Its a very different experience than going to an SEC school in the middle of nowhere.
Sophomore,4,"I’ve been attending GSU for the past 3,going on 4, semesters and I can honestly say that my overall experience has been quite good. Being that the Atlanta campus is so big, it definitely gives you a chance to meet new people and experience new places. Finishing my freshman year and going into my sophomore year, the professors were quite helpful in helping the freshman students transition from high school to college life."
Junior,4,"Online classes at Georgia State are nice most of the time. Some professors have more difficulty teaching online, but many get the hang of it and do a good job. Online classes tend to be a bit easier overall with less assignments than some in person classes."
Junior,4,Georgia State is a great school in the city. You have a lot of opportunity here. The professors are great and the academics have the right amount of rigor. There’s lots to do on campus and a lot to explore.
Alum,4,I took some of my classes online. The professors were enaging and responded quickly. The classes were easy and asynochronous.
Sophomore,4,"Georgia state University have a lot of people who can help you out if you have a question or a concern, On the main campus and the perimeter campus."
Sophomore,4,The experience as a whole was alright. Nothing negative about it. Some professors did video calls and other just gave the materials for the upcoming test. The professors where allways online and will get back to me as soon as possible. It was not a bad experience with me.
Junior,4,"great school, I had a wonderful time applying and the process was very easy the staff were helpful and cared for the students well-being."
Junior,4,"It was a difficult transition, but my University handled the changes very quickly and efficiently. My professors were very understanding, somewhat lenient, and openly adjusted portions of the course. I missed the face to face interaction with my professors and classmates, but I still believe the semester was a success."
Junior,4,"I am currently a Junior at Georgia State University and will be attending the Atlanta campus in the Fall. I finished my Associates degree at one of Georgia States Perimeter campuses (Dunwoody) and honestly had an enjoyable first two years of college. A lot of those boring prerequisite courses were actually very interesting. I met great professors that were really passionate about teaching. Many professors are willing to give you one on one help, you just have to ask.  I also met students that were openminded, fun, and ready to learn. I look forward to continuing my education at one of Georgia’s largest and progressive universities."
Senior,4,"A relatively low in-state tuition, caring professors and staff members, a great place for networking/opportunities, and improving research opportunities are the strengths of Georgia State University."
Senior,4,"Losing my job due to the pandemic and personal matters made the transition to online courses harder for me, and my professors' making the deadlines for assignments much closer than normal, but I found a way to pass my courses."
Sophomore,4,Its been great so far. I really enjoyed my freshman year. I was able to become really close friends with my roommates since I live on campus. I was given the assistance I needed when I decided to change my major during my second semester.
Freshman,4,"I did not take any classes online, but I believe that overall their out of class academics will be just as outstanding  as their in class academics."
Freshman,4,"I have had a great experience with Georgia state University, I believe that this school may not be everyone's cup of tea but it is definitely a great school. Though it does not have the typical communal campus that everyones longs for, the Atlanta city life is extremely entertaining and vibrant. In Atlanta there is always something to do and partake in which makes it worthwhile."
Sophomore,4,"The transition from face to face learning to online instruction was not an easy one, there was many unforeseen circumstances that made it have to be a quick adjustment. Nonetheless, the faculty and staff at Georgia State were very understanding and flexible. They acknowledged how different students could have different circumstances that would possibly interfere with their education. They understood the bigger factors student could be facing and worked to make online instruction work as best as it could for everyone."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, my experience with Georgia State University was very impactful. I was so pleased with the quality of education I received from my professors inside and outside of the classroom. They genuinely cared that each student is as successful as they could be. The university provided a multitude of resources for students to use."
Niche User,4,"Overall GSU is a wonderful, diverse school where everyone is encouraged to be themselves and is welcomed easily. For me, it was a bit nerve-wracking to have a school so integrated into downtown Atlanta, however I think it is all part of the experience. 

If you want a great educational experience as well as a fantastic place to meet people from any and every background, Georgia State will fit you well."
Junior,4,"The atmosphere and environment created by the students and faculty has been so inspiring, encouraging, and productive. I have never felt more accepted and valued as a student!"
Sophomore,4,"I've personally enjoyed my overall experience with Georgia state university thus far. Being based in Atlanta means that everything you would want or need is within walking distance of the campus. This makes exploring Atlanta when you're not in class a rewarding and convenient experience. The campus is blended well with the city environment whether that be for better or worse. Due to the campus being in the city it doesn't feel like a campus but more like a subsection of the city which means that anyone can be on the campus at any time which doesn't create this feeling of overall campus safety. The learning environment is good and I would actually say it holds up to its contemporaries, the labs, and classrooms are well utilized by the staff so that the students get the most out of them."
Sophomore,4,I would say overall the online experience for Georgia state hasn't been bad. It's just that I don’t believe that the professors and staff were ready to switch entirely online at the drop of a hat. There was slight confusion over what had to be done regarding the scheduling of classes but nothing major that hindered my ability to learn from home instead of a classroom. The professors were understanding of students situation’s regarding internet access so there was leeway during assignments because not everyone’s situation was the same. Most student to professor communication was through class message boards and if you needed to be direct you could always email them through your school email. The lessons were taught through pre-recorded video from my experience and they worked just fine and the professors even allowed for out of class video sessions if the pre-recorded video wasn't enough.
Junior,4,"It was interesting it'll be interesting to see how they adapt for COVID 19 but pretty well so far. The campus is well maintained, the teachers care about their subjects. Things are pretty well they  struggle sometimes but most of the time GSU does pretty well."
Junior,4,Georgia state university is a good college to go to. I like the campus and the activities as well as the classes. I think it’s a good school to get a degree. This school was also just convenient  for me location wise. The situation with Covid 19 has made it sorta of complicated now that all classes are online.
Junior,4,My online classes are hard because things that are hard to learn get even harder to learn when you have only means of a computer screen to communicate with professors. Some professors are understanding about the situation and some are not.
Junior,4,"I really like the diversity that Georgia State brings, it makes everyone feel included. There are so many different people of different backgrounds that come to our University. Not to mention the education is solid, I feel confident that Georgia State will prepare me for my further studies after undergrad."
Junior,4,"I have only taken hybrid courses at GSU so far, however, I look forward to an all online class schedule during the upcoming two semesters. It seems as though the school has made a great effort to respond appropriately to the COVID-19 pandemic and moving all classes online."
Freshman,2,"Academics seemed average. My professors taught the material well in-person but weren't clear during the online adjustment (e.g. poor audio/camera quality, lack of communication, dysfunctional timeline). Now in regards to the student body, a lot of the students didn't seem very ambitious. I was also surprised to meet a handful of other freshman students with plans to transfer to a different institution."
Freshman,2,"At GSU, I didn't feel the college lifestyle. It felt like most students went to class and then went off to work, dorm, or home. This is in part of the scattered buildings that make up GSU's ""campus."" Due to being integrated within the city, safety was also a major concern. I've been catcalled and followed by men in broad daylight. I suppose the only pro of GSU's campus is being able to walk quickly between classes. The food at GSU can get repetitive, and I found that it was terribly catered towards a lot of oily foods. I could only really depend on the salad bar for greens that weren't mushy."
Junior,2,Could have been better professors refuse to upload lectures so the requirements are the same but your materials are fewer.
Senior,2,Many of my professors were not familiar with online or prepared to do online. The courses that are 100% online that I've taken in the past were good but these recent ones have been very messy and confusing.
Sophomore,2,As classes moved online professors became lazy. There was a-lot of poor communication due to Covid-19 striking.
Sophomore,2,"I've been attending GSU for two years now and I have not had the best time. I came to GSU with enough scholarship money to last me 4 years there but for some reason my freshman year I was dropped as a student and had to resolve it with the school. I never got a clear understanding as to why I was dropped as a student and why I had to pay almost 4k to the school. As for safety, GSU is not the best school to go to if you are concerned about safety. You are bound to get harassed by someone at least once a month."
Senior,2,I would like to see more safety at the school. It's a very social place. It's place for everyone to fit in even if they are not social.
Alum,2,"This school is a poor choice for working adult learners. Very few courses are available online, and those that are fill up extremely fast. There is also little to no consistency between the online courses. I've taken two, and the quality and organization of the coursework was vastly different. Location in downtown Atlanta makes it difficult to get from work to on-campus classes in late afternoon (hence my opting for online courses when possible), and parking is expensive and can be inconvenient. I've now transferred to the online campus of another state university, and the experience is already fitting much easier into my life."
Junior,2,"I liked how easy it was for me to take online classes as a transient student but I hope they change their customer service because everytime I had a question regarding financial aid, tuition, registration, etc, it took forever for them to respond to me which by the time they did, it was too late. When I was able to get in contact with someone, they were extremely unhelpful and I felt as if I was burdening them by asking."
Niche User,2,"I had committed to Georgia State and I regret my decision so much that a few weeks before school started, I quickly scrambled to apply to another college that was still taking applications (I was offered guaranteed transfer somewhere after a year so my first year didnt matter as much). 

My adviser was super sweet, but everyone in other departments such as financial aid or even just the people that answer the phone are extremely rude. When you call anyone at GSU for help, the phone will no joke ring for 30 mins until someone can finally be bothered to pick up. I did not feel respected at all at the few days I spent here during the student welcome events and just campus visits. They boast their innovation and rankings, but most people I know that attended GSU usually transfer to Georgia Tech where their time and goals will be respected. 

There are shootings and robberies nearby all the time. The only thing that impressed me was the dining hall food I ate at my time there."
Freshman,2,"Georgia State University's administration do not care about helping you. They do not check their emails and most mails are often left unopened. If you try to call them, they usually transfer you to another call just to get rid of you. Sometimes the transferred called are left unanswered. They are always in a rush to get the job done and have a terrible attitude. The administration and faculty are little to no help."
Freshman,2,Not safe. Huge drug problem. Don't get a professor with a tenure. They will screw you over because its hard for them to get fired.
Niche User,2,I will be attending this college in the fall of 2018 and will forward on going but when I visited the campus it was great but the only problem is that they are lots of problems in the campus like the only good dorms are piedmont Centeral which has the best dorms in the campus.
Sophomore,2,It's a interesting college experience for me because where the environment is. The campus is placed in the city and the campus is mixed with local business. It makes the campus feel less like a typically college campus. It makes learning and living on campus a really different experience to what average colleges students go through.
Niche User,2,"Aderhold classrooms need updating/remodeling; not enough outlets located within reaching distance to students' desks (difficulty charging electronics); in-class participation, group work, and oral presentations over-emphasized in course curriculum; accountability lacking for advisors, financial aid representatives, and support staff in college offices, whereas erroneous advice is given without consequence, and honest answers are hard to come by, as students are redirected to various departments to have their concerns addressed"
Sophomore,2,"It is in the city so that makes it amazing. However, as far as how much they actually care about their students, they're not good in that field. They have truly messed many people up housing and especially financial aid wise. They are horrible."
Sophomore,2,"Boring classes and professors who were strong armed into teaching because they didn't have another option. Only a few bright spots - there are some good teachers - but for the post part it was a terrible experience. Dirty campus, lack luster staff, and questionable security."
Freshman,2,I loved that it was in downtown Atlanta. I did not have good luck with roommates or help from Georgia State people when I needed it. I was more stressed out about everything else then my studies.
College Junior,2,We have had several incidents this year and also last year. They have very widely enhanced the security. There are now GSU police around every corner and sitting on every bloc. I feel safer now.
College Freshman,2,"I feel somewhat safe on campus, but I would recommend that you walk with a group of people. There are some but rarely any police officers on campus. I don't recommend walking alone at night. There are a lot of homeless people who love to hang at Hurt Park. There seems to always be a robbery here."
College Sophomore,2,Housing cost too much for what the school provides.
College Sophomore,2,"Living in downtown Atlanta is unsafe, but Georgia State tries to protect it's student, although incidents still occur occasionally."
College Sophomore,2,"My overall experience with housing is mix. Georgia State only cares about money, so they will charge you for anything even if it is not your fault."
College Junior,2,"My school is down town, and i do not feel as though our administrators take the precautions that they should to ensure our safety. A down town campus should not have facilities open to the public; it should be just for our students."
College Sophomore,2,I do not feel safe because some students laptops and phones got stolen.
Recent Alumnus,2,Counselors should listen to students more.
College Junior,2,Although there is a strict policy in place for drug use students still manager to abuse this. Most students know they should not partake in the drug use but do so because of on going peer pressure.I don't think drugs can be totally removed from schools.
Recent Alumnus,2,The concept of an RA is still something I don't understand nor agree with.
College Sophomore,2,I'm from Spain so I'm not used to Greek life.
College Sophomore,2,The crime rate in Atlanta is bad. There is always an email getting sent to students about robbery's on campus.
College Senior,2,"There isn't a lot of variety in the Greek system. There are few sorority and fraternities that are known. The others you literally have to go and search for via Facebook, hear-say, or talking to people involved."
College Junior,2,"As mentioned earlier, a shooting took place near the Piedmont North dorm earlier this Spring semester due to a botched drug deal. Further, students always find on- and off-campus connections for drugs and alcohol for parties if they really want it. There is only so much administrators and the police can do to except do better to warn students of possibly compromising their college careers if they are too brazen with the usage."
College Junior,2,"This school has seen an unprecedented and public string of armed robberies, snatch robberies, and a drug deal gone wrong near the Piedmont North dorm. President Becker initiated a swift and semester-long upheaval of the Georgia State Police Department, initiating much increased surveillance in the Library (where many of the crimes happened) and a brand new notification system."
College Sophomore,2,"The safety issue is really bad, as there is always a case of armed robbery in the campus library or students being attacked on the streets."
College Freshman,2,"We have robberies all the time. In fact, there were 4 robberies at the library and they people were never caught."
College Freshman,2,There is not much involvement in the athletics.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are on the complete opposite side of campus compared to classrooms. The space of the rooms are ok, but trying to get a room was awful. There is no social atmosphere since everyone keeps there doors shut and an RA tells you to shut-up if he can here you just outside the door."
College Freshman,2,No one cares about Greek life here. They don't contribute to the community or even throw parties. The Greeks here usually go to a Greek house at another college if they want to do something.
College Freshman,2,I have not enjoyed my school experience. There is very little campus life. I feel like an outcast.
College Sophomore,2,The safety and security on campus is bad. Students constantly receive emails each week about some theft or robbery or assault on campus. Police have yet to capture the notorious library theft that stole laptops. They actively try and fix this problem by installing more police by the library and printing out information about the suspect but nothing seems to be working fully.
College Junior,2,"I do not feel that safe on Ga State's campus! We do have campus police that do ride around the streets, but that did not prevent the string of robberies we've had in the library in the past month. My friends and I have been harassed several times by the homeless people who walk around campus. Now, the school has taken more measures to prevent crime around campus, but because we are located in the middle of downtown, there will always be some type of problem around campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,You have to pick your room about 8 months in advance which is a hassle because your don't really know how much finical help you will get. Also there isn't enough room in housing you could apply for it and think you have the room and you want find out until next semester that you didn't get your room.
College Freshman,2,"I personally lived in Piedmont North my freshman year with two other girls and I absolutely hated it. I ended up requesting a roommate change towards the end of the second semester. Other than roommate problems, which are always going to arise if three girls share one small space, I felt like the housing was not worth the money paid. The bathrooms are old, almost moldy, and something always breaks in there. Other than that, the rooms are fine. Yet, there have been situations where we were without heat during the winter, electricity in the evening, running water during the day, or got evacuated at the crack of dawn (5a.m.) because of a gas leak, followed by a power outage."
College Sophomore,2,not the school you want if you like a closed campus feel
College Freshman,2,Every week a incident occurs on campus. It's either someone gets rob or someone gets rape. It's not safe on campus. the campus is so big that no police or security guards can be everywhere every min of the day. Something needs to be done to fix that ASAP.
College Junior,2,I don't care for it.
Recent Alumnus,2,Most off campus housing is really expensive since it's downtown.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The GSU campus is very strict with permitting guest entry into the dorms. This makes sense because downtown can be a somewhat dangerous place, however, it's such a hassle to invite your friends over."
Recent Alumnus,2,Applying for financial aid is so complicated at Georgia State and you never know exactly when you will receive your funds.
College Sophomore,2,Try buying groceries for food.
College Sophomore,2,Greek Housing was the worst.
College Junior,2,"The police officers are super nice and looking out for your best interest. Outside of law enforcement, GSU is an administrative nightmare. Trying to get anything done in person is a chore. Do as much as you can online unless the website is acting up which it frequently is."
College Junior,2,Options that actually belong to GSU are terrible. Some nearby restaurants are decent.
College Freshman,2,"the financil aid process went smoothly, try to complete the steps necessary early and be persistent"
College Junior,2,"GSU lacks athletic engagement and facilities.  It would be great if they did acquire Turner Field.  However, it is also far from most students.  Due to the lack of campus-like feel, most student commute and would not go out of their ways to support the athletic spirit."
College Junior,2,"The system to apply for scholarships is old and not the best.  I have spent hours and hours looking and sorting through scholarships that do not apply to me.  However, the lack of search features and filters force me to go through every single one.  Scholarship hunting is very time consuming and the scholarship center does not help at all.  I have visited the office and I was instructed to go online."
College Junior,2,"The campus is far from the facilities and the area is not very safe.  The campus area is filled with homeless people constantly harassing for money.  At times, I do not feel safe."
College Freshman,2,The dining hall is the worst. The meal plan is very expensive and the food isn't even that good! There is no variety and I feel as though sometimes the cooks aren't even trying! Save that money and buy food at the wonderful places surrounding the campus. Even if you were to buy food for a whole entire semester it would still be cheaper than the meal plan.!
College Junior,2,The worst thing is having to check guests in. It is a hassle.
College Senior,2,Campus meal plan in expensive and gross. Not a wise option when there are hundreds of world famous restaurants in the city. Don't waste your money!
Sophomore,1,"Total disaster, total waste of money. Nobody cares from any departments. Good luck reaching out to anybody. Save yourself some stress, time and money."
Sophomore,1,"Really disappointing institution. Expected a lot more coming here from Germany. Academics are terrible, most professors don't care and do not prepare well. Adjustments to online school have been unacceptable. Totally wasted money. I would have learned more at udemy courses for 11.99 than at gsu. Facilities are old, run down and in really bad shape. Most people are not very welcoming and fake and hostile in their behaviors. Overall, stay away, you are better of saving money and doing literally anything else"
Junior,1,"I hate this school. No one is helpful and if you want to get a hold of anyone over the phone, forget it because they won't pick up (especially if you have Tmobile (they still haven't fixed the problem they had with Tmobile calls and it has been 3 years now)) . 

The profs themselves are not bad. Just like any other school. There are good ones and bad ones, but as far as admissions, financial office, etc. go they are useless.  

Also, there has been construction as long as I was in that school (two years). Not to mention, the place is crawling with homeless people. The park that students raised money to fix is completely ruined due to GSU not protecting it from homeless people. The campus is disgusting is basically what I am trying to say. If you don't mind disorder you'll be fine. 

Over the 5 semesters I have spent at that school, every semester I have gotten an email at least once how there was a shooting on or near the campus. The school does not spend any money protecting students"
Junior,1,"They have no responsibility. Each person sends you to someone else whenever there is an issue, you will be going around in circle trying to find someone to help you with your problem. Oh, also you will pay around 5000$ for 2 classes, and you will not learn anything in them because the professors do not speak english.They will also charge you extra money and not tell you why. Campus is dirty and nasty, people smoke weed in the smoking section. DO NOT MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE AS ME AND AVOID THIS SCHOOL! You will also get robbed everywhere you go. My macbook, my phone, and all my bookes were stolen on 2 different occasions, and police as well as security will make you write a police report and never follow up or do anything."
Sophomore,1,"GSU is very unorganized with money,advisors, and classes. They expect you to pay them on time but cant tell me certain things like why I cant get into a class, etc.."
Senior,1,"Initially I thought Georgia State would be a great fit for me, because it's in the city, extremely diverse, and amongst hundreds of jobs in Atlanta. However I quickly found that my college experience at Georgia State University was not all that I thought it would be. Freshman year was good, my grades were great, and I felt that my professors were easily accessible, and I had a plethora of resources as all freshman were placed in a Freshman Learning community. However I quickly learned that professors were actually not that accessible. I often encountered poor email correspondence, or none at all. Professors rarely posted grades which makes it hard to tracks one's progress in the course. Professors also seemed to be more concerned with merely covering the material as opposed to teaching it, and ensuring student comprehension. All of that paired with the constant crime on/around campus, doesn't create a pleasant collegiate experience."
Alum,1,"I went there for two years before I transferred to my current school. For those two years, I had 4 different advisors that I was assigned to. I wouldn't get an email from the school or my former advisor telling me about the change. They all said different things on the way my classes were supposed to be taken. All of the advisors were rude and would rush my appontments so that they could leave."
Freshman,1,I do not like Georgia State. The staffs of financial aid and student accounts are rude and do not help with their best interests.
Recent Alumnus,1,I'm usually not afraid to be on campus but recently I feel like the attacks on campus are happening more often.  I feel like the library is one of the worst spots to be because of the armed robberies that have happened.  That stinks because it was one of my favorite places to be when I first transferred here.
Recent Alumnus,1,"I have no idea about Greek Life, I've only seen a handful of people even involved in sororities in my years at the school."
Recent Alumnus,1,I've never heard anything about the athletics department.
College Freshman,1,I am scared to walk on the streets at night. The library has had student held at gunpoint on multiple occasions and there was shooting in the parking just last week that involved a student selling drugs.
College Freshman,1,I don't see the affects of Greek life.
College Sophomore,1,won't be paying for a meal plan next semester weekends is by far the worst ever for dining halls
College Student,1,Not interested in it. I also like to focus more on m career versus paying to make friends and go to outrageous parties.
College Freshman,1,It's extremely difficult to go out at night alone especially if you're a girl. Two of my friends were robbed at gun point. Atlanta and its community is not safe for GSU students.
College Freshman,1,There was a lot of information I was not given about financial aid until I had contacted the school's offices multiple times. It took losing a lot of money to finally get an answer.
College Senior,1,"GSU football is probably the worst team in the history of football. They can barely win one game per season. We've already gone through 3 coaches in the 4 years that we had a team. It's a really good thing that our other sports teams are pretty good, otherwise we'd be even more of a laughing stock. Basketball is definitely the crown jewel of our sports team. They are amazingly good."
College Sophomore,1,"Last week, somebody got killed on the street."
College Junior,1,"The athletic center (gym) is one of the best in the states. Awesome equipment and HUGE rock wall, and very nice sized pool. With this in mind, sports are kind of a joke. Yes, it's rising, but it's just not there as of now."
College Senior,1,"It's terrible. The dishes aren't always clean. You get the same bad options day in and out. The tray return system is disgusting. I would NOT recommend. They make you sign up if you're in a few dorms. If they actually provided a service worth buying, they wouldn't need to do that. I used to go to UGA where people living off-campus would still have the meal plan because it was THAT good. Georgia State does a horrific job in comparison"
College Sophomore,1,"The weather in Georgia is bipolar. The day will start out very cold, then by noon it will be in the 70's and by 4 it will be snowing. Then during the summer the heat is unbearable and you really can only make moves during the night."
College Sophomore,1,"It's only the worst when you don't have an umbrella on rainy days. Some classes are far from each other, so when it rains and you don't have an umbrella, well...good luck."
College Freshman,1,The weather at GSU is terrible.
College Freshman,1,they're ok. i havent participated in any and have a hard time find the people to talk to about getting involved in football.
College Freshman,1,"The weather is on and off; one day is cold, the next is hot. Don't underestimate Atlanta's Weather forecast- it snows."
College Freshman,1,"I started with Music Technology. However, if you don't have any formal music classes in high school, the program isn't going to be easy. Also, with the exception of a few Jazz oppurtunities, everything involves classical music. There's nothing contemporary or modern. The School of Music does not utilize Atlanta's melting pot of different musical styles and different student interests."
College Freshman,1,"Georgia State University doesn't seem to offer much assistance in terms of financial aid. If you call the offices to ask about where to seek aid, no one can even give you a good answer."
College Freshman,1,Wish I could get more money in general.
College Freshman,1,"Whenever it is cold or extremely rainy, less people are outside socializing and going to class. When the weather is great, attitudes are better on campus as well."
College Senior,1,For the school to have 30000 students you would think they would have more computers. you have to walk far to remote parts if campus to find open computers which is inconveinient when you want to print or do work between classes.
College Junior,1,"I don't own a car, but I've heard it is really bad"
College Junior,1,Guys here are not attractive.
College Junior,1,"I lived with an unstable roommate, background check should be performed on everyone who wants to live in the dorms."
College Junior,1,The system had too many glitches and the phones weren't always working. it wasn't convenient for people who work and have other things they must deal with. not to mention the price of courses is way too high so my financial aid that i will be receiving wont even cover the costs.
College Junior,1,Georgia state only has two dining halls and they're both pretty terrible. They're not open past 9pm or on the weekends. Most of the residence halls are apartment style and have kitchens thought so not many students are on the meal plan. Which is probably why it's so expensive.
College Junior,1,"I got a little financial aid, but the process is complicated and the people who handle it are so unhelpful."
College Student,1,"no parking, anywhere. students use public transit"
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid process is horrible. If you call, you're placed on hold for over an hour and if you walk in, you sit there for over an hour. But eventually, you get to speak to someone and hopefully get what you needed."
College Sophomore,1,I get emails about robberies often. 
College Sophomore,1,OneStop Shop employees are rude and act like it's their money out of their pocket! 
College Sophomore,1,The worst ever! The city of Atlanta should be ashamed of itself
College Junior,1,"if you had to take a class at a certain time due to you having a job with permanent hours  and that class was closed to certain students they will not let you in. for example, i am paying for college myself so i need to work everyday from 2-6 pm. i need to take an accounting class and the only early class is at 12-1 but it is closed to honors student only. i asked the professor if he was teaching them anything different or at a different speed than the rest of the classes he was teaching and he said no. so i figured i would call the school to request to get into this class especially because i am a senior. the school said no because im not in the honors program. i feel they should only restrict classes to honor student if the professor is going to be teaching them something different or at a different speed. needless to say i never got to take the class."
College Junior,1,"i gave this grade because i was there when swine flu started going around. when one of my roommates got swine flu, i was not allowed to make her go home and the school would not send her home, all they said was lysol everything down and wear a mask and avoid her. so in other words it was completely up to me to stay healthy instead of her made to go home. this could have potentially caused an outbreak at the school by having her on campus with swine flu. also the fact that it is not a closed campus ane being downtown, it was easy acces to the homeless to just walk onto campus. the only places they could not just walk into was the library and the dorms but they could walk into the cafeteria and classes with ease. breading ground for germs and illnesses. the police officers sometimes rather flirt with students than watch the streets."
College Sophomore,1,"There aren't many close options, and since it's downtown ATL, you don't want to walk to the slightly farther options."
College Junior,1,"granted they have sports but considering that they dont have to pay for tuition but the non athletes have to make up for the costs by raised tuiton, i dont care for them especially the fact that our football team sucks i dont really feel its fair that i have to pay for so much."
College Junior,1,"the shuttles dont have air conditioning, the drivers are rude. the busses are crowded. most of all the school says its free but if you look at your tuition and student fees you will actually see that they charge you per semester up to $600 per student. i figure since they charge so much per semester it would be better quality transport."
College Sophomore,1,"There were not any scholarships for my major available and most of the scholarships are for music or minorities, which is frustrating. If you want financial aid, you must use places like this one or other scholarship websites to add to HOPE and FAFSA."
College Senior,1,"Its downtown Atlanta, There is crime everywhere there aren't really any security measure I mean there is campus security but most buildings have no cameras. It's a joke really, campus crime is high. but so is the crime all around the city."
College Senior,1,"Our school is an open campus where many commute to the school, as oppose to being a university that has dormitory housing on the campus or within a short distance. The students are more apt at partying away from the campus, than on campus."
College Junior,1,"We're an urban university. Crime -- especially those of opportunity, like snatch-and-runs, are all over the place. Violent crimes are rarer, but are reported on maybe three times a month. Violent crimes include muggings, rape, that sort of thing. Always look over your shoulder. GSU has campus police, but we're still in downtown Atlanta."
College Junior,1,On campus parking at GSU is very expensive.  All the parking lots surrounding school are expensive as well.  It is best to take Marta if it is close to your house.
College Junior,1,The weather here is very rainy and going to georgia state you have to walk alot from class to class. Which can be a hassle in this up and down weather
College Student,1,Terrible. No parties. Bars/Clubs are THE BIGGEST JOKE.
College Junior,1,There is only one computer lab that I know of. Usually people just go to the library. Would be nice if our big school supplied more uses for computers.
College Sophomore,1,It feels like GPC just bigger.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no Greek life. There is a series of little cute Greek houses right next to the freshman dorms. It's a joke. People go to Tech if they want any Greek parties, but any philanthropy work is nonexistent at GSU. Plenty of black frats and soros though. One school where the independent crowd probably outdo the Greeks in terms of hotness. Yikes!"
College Sophomore,1,Go Panthers! Wait who? Basketball is the only thing close to a college sport at GSU. Football spirit/winning ratio is nonexistent. 
College Sophomore,1,"No regulation or strictness at all. People have sex everywhere, people smoke and deal drugs everywhere anything goes. The only thing that's a little strict now is housing is cutting down on who can visit and for how long. People had their friends living with them semi-permanently and homeless people found their way into Peidmont North several times. Plenty of campus ambassadors to help you walk around campus if need be. No regulation on the students. ironically that's where they need the most strictness. "
College Sophomore,1,"AIDS galore. Apart from that, pretty standard."

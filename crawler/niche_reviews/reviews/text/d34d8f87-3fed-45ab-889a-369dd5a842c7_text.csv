Senior,5,"What I like about Gwynedd is the closeness between everyone. The campus is very nice and small. the classroom is small in size, so you get the personal touch with your professors"
Senior,5,"The experience is very well done. You can learn in your home or dorm, and it feels like you in a classroom. Homework and tests are just a good as in-person class."
Senior,5,Great online and remote classes! Gwynedd handled pandemic learning very well! Wonderful professors and classes. The hybrid learning system for fall 2020 has been going very smoothly. My online classes take place in a zoom format which is great for creating a classroom atmosphere. My senior year has been different however GmercyU has been wonderful with resources for every student!
Senior,5,"A very warm and welcoming campus. As a transfer student, I found a home at Gwynedd Mercy University. The spirit of mercy is alive and visible within the faculty, staff, and student body! All my needs were meet when I transfered to GMercyU. They were awesome with sorting out my previous credits and getting my new class schedule! Wonderful Campus Ministry and choir. I love singing with The Voices of Gwynedd! Happy  to be a senior at Gwynedd and excited to be a graduate next year!"
Graduate Student,5,"I am taking some pre requisite courses online now. It is very interactive and the professor is very involved. The professor requires weekly phone calls to check up on us individually and personally which I greatly appreciate. Even if it is online, it feels very much like being in a classroom."
Graduate Student,5,I like how it is a Catholic University which aligns with my religion. I like its diversity and everything the university it has to offer.
Senior,5,I am a senior nursing student at Gwynedd Mercy University. It is an excellent school. It is a small school in which I love because you will get to meet so many people and make great friendships. The class sizes are small which is beneficial as a student because your professors get to really know you and help you out. I am also an athlete which is a bonus. The school offers great opportunities for their students. I couldn't imagine any other place that feels like home.
Senior,5,This past semester all of my classes turned to the online format due to COVID-19. The professors were extremely helpful and it truly felt like I was still in the classroom learning. They did everything they could to help their students and make them succeed despite the conditions we were facing.
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy that Gwynedd Mercy University is a small campus. Because it is a small campus, I feel very comfortable and I believe I have developed real relationships with some of my professors because of it."
Junior,5,Online courses were very convenient. I was able to work full time and take online classes. They have excellent advisors that check on your progress and needs throughout the academic experience.
Sophomore,5,"I have just completed my Freshman year at Gwynedd Mercy University. The transition from high school to college was scary and confusing at first, but as soon as I got to Gwynedd, I felt at home. Gwynedd has been a great fit for me and all of my friends I have met at this school. I am a nursing student and Gwynedd makes sure we are prepared for the career path we are venturing into. I am so proud to be a Gwynedd Mercy Student.  Gwynedd offers plenty of clubs for each individual to find their place at the school."
Niche User,5,I've went on multiple visits to Gwynedd and a couple of my friends go there and i love the campus life and the professors are very good.
Senior,5,"I feel that Gwynedd Mercy University is a hard school, but you come out prepared for the world in a strong stance."
Junior,5,Going to Gwynedd Mercy University is very diversity. They have many different campus one central city and then main campus they also have online classes.
Freshman,5,When i visited Gwynedd i fell in love with it. I felt at home and knew that this is where i wanted to spend the next 4 years of my life.
Sophomore,5,The environment is a great family environment where the professors really want to see you succeed. The university as a whole has that small town comfortable feel. There are many activities and organizations to choose from.
Sophomore,5,"I am currently enrolled in the nursing program for this up coming fall and just visiting the college for the times I did I enjoyed the relax environment, the homey environment, and the environment where you can grow."
Senior,5,Coming into Gwynedd Mercy my Freshman year I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't sure if College was for me or if playing College athletics would be for me. When I finally got acclimated to the campus and the faculty I can honestly say it is a home away from home. The friendly environment that is shown on campus through all members of this community has made this a memorable experience. The coaches and the Athletic Training staff have created a fantastic culture that makes it easy to be a college Athlete. My experience has been different from other as I was able to experience the athletic side of it too. Being a part of a team on campus allowed me to have better time management and has allowed me to grow not only as an athlete but as a student too. I have enjoyed my time on Campus thus far. They challenge you to think and be creative. But they also show support and are in your corner every step of the way and only want the best and to watch you succeed.
Senior,5,"Gwynedd Mercy University was the perfect place for me to pursue an education as well as furthering my athletic career. The classroom sizes are rather small, allowing for students to be more than 'just a number' in a lecture hall to our professors. GMercyU's professors not only know your name, but truly care about you and your success. In addition, being fortunate enough to continue my athletic career as a member of the men's lacrosse team was truly one of the most memorable aspects of my collegiate career. The friends I have made, the lessons learned, and experiences I have had playing lacrosse at Gwynedd Mercy University I will proudly carry with me upon graduation. The coaches emphasize excellence in academics to prepare us for our careers, while also pushing us to be the best athletes we can be. GMercyU truly was the perfect place for me to succeed in the classroom and on the lacrosse field as a student-athlete, and I am forever grateful for my 4 years here."
Senior,5,"My experience at Gwynedd Mercy University has only been great so far. It's a great community on this campus and I was able to meet wonderful professors and friends. I learned a lot, especially with the smaller class sizes and being able to fully interact with my professors. I was easily able to fit in with the vast amount of opportunities offered on campus. I joined many clubs along with finding a job on campus to further enrich my experience. I definitely couldn't ask for more and look forward to my future."
Graduate Student,5,"I love the supportive atmosphere. Their dissertation completion program is fantastic. I don't actually know about the dorms, party scene, etc. I've been to campus once for a residency for my online program. That was wonderful."
Junior,5,"I just started at Gwynedd. So far I enjoy it. The campus has a lot of grass, which helps me personally because a green environment brings me peace when I'm stressed. College does tend to stress you out. The staff are all so kind and helpful. As I walked around the hallways, I looked a bit confused on where to go and what to do. Well that was enough for the staff to approach me and offer generous help. They also offer one on one assistance with just about anything! I got my schedule for the fall semester done within fifteen minutes thanks to the help of Gwynedd's staff members. Overall I'm excited to attend the university and think it's going to be worth the hard work."
Alum,5,"The Biology department at Gwynedd was incredible. The student-teacher ratio is small, so you get the benefit of individual attention and in-depth assignments that prepare you well for graduate school. The community is very supportive and are interested in you as a full person, not just a tuition check. I can't recommend it enough."
Sophomore,5,"I love the campus overall! Its really pretty! The professors are awesome, and they strive to help the students at this university to achieve success in various ways, whether that is sending us to the Academic Resource Center (ARC) to get help for a class that we may be struggling in, or allowing us to meet with them one on one to get help."
Sophomore,5,"I love how the teacher to student ratio here at Gwynedd Mercy University. I have gotten to know most of my professors personally, which made communicating with them about certain issues so much easier. The people at this school are so extremely helpful and down to earth."
Alum,5,"Gwynedd Mercy was a small community which is something I really wanted in a university. I had the ability to be a student-athlete, member of multiple clubs/organizations, study for my bachelor's degree, and work part-time. The faculty and staff were very helpful, especially when it came down to ""crunch time"" and finding a job. I graduated GMercyU on May 12th and secured a teaching position May 14th! I highly recommend Gwynedd Mercy University, especially to education majors!"
Sophomore,5,I am a second semester transfer sophomore and I could not be happier that I chose to transfer to Gwynedd. I have met so many great people and love being apart of the Education program here. I play two sports and I am thankful for everything Gwynedd has given me so far.
Freshman,5,Gwynedd Mercy University so far has been a great decision. The professors are what makes this university stand out. They are so dedicated to their students not just receiving good grades but truly learning the material. The party scene on campus isn't the best but I always can find something fun to do on campus or around campus so I'm never bored. The staff is amazing and always super helpful. I rarely ever have complaints about the food and the breakfast selection is my favorite. Gwynedd makes me excited to go to class!
Senior,5,"Great four-year university. I am a commuter student, and love that I can attend a prestigious university yet still live at home. Class sizes are small- usually under 30 students or less, and the professors provide individualized teaching experience due to the small class size. You are more than just a number in the classroom; you are truly a name.  The campus is crisp and clean. Older buildings are being renovated each year, adding to the modern feel of this university. Every time that I have ever eaten at the cafeteria, I have always enjoyed the food. Centrally located around a magnitude of stores and places to shop and eat at."
Alum,5,"My college experience was truly amazing! I transferred to Gwynedd as a non-traditional student. I lived on campus all four years, which allowed me to become involved in clubs/organizations/activities and events on campus as well as focus on my academics. I was also a Resident Assistant for two of those years. In my opinion, this institution has a family feel to it, and the campus is very safe, clean and there are several ways to get involved on campus! I love the fact that the Professors truly care about you and want to see you blossom into your full potential. I am proud to be an Alumni of such a wonderful Institution. Since graduating from Gwynedd, I feel confident and prepared to conquer my dreams, goals and so much more. Gwynedd Challenged me to be the best version of myself and I challenge you to do the same thing!"
Senior,5,"I chose to attend Gwynedd Mercy University because of the small campus and classroom size. Since the classroom sizes are small, you can connect more with your professors and peers. I've lived in the Residence Halls the past four years, and I have seen constant improvement in ResLife to make my stay, and the other residents' stay, here the best experience possible.  There are a ton of ways to become involved on campus, such as the Student Activities Committee, Student Government Association, Residence Hall Association, and Intramurals. There is usually always something going on on campus that you can attend and participate in, which is a great way to be involved and meet new people."
Alum,5,I always felt welcome and supported at GMercyU. The professors and even staff members are always willing to help out students whether it's about class or searching for a job. It's a lot like a family here which is cool. You get to know your classmates and professors on a different level and there are a lot of clubs to get involved in. Our sports teams are pretty good too...it seems as if they are always in the playoffs.
Graduate Student,5,"Very small, but a very friendly and welcoming atmosphere.  Professors know the names of their students and are almost always willing to go above and beyond to help their students succeed.  Not much of a party scene, but still an excellent school if you are looking for a solid academic experience."
Freshman,5,"Great school and education system.  Georgia Gwinnett College is a growing school that gives you the experience of university life without the hefty price tag. The students here are very diverse which helps to showcase many different cultures around campus. New students will find the campus to fit them if they prefer smaller classrooms and smaller walks to classes, many campus events, an assortment of clubs, and school that cares about them."
Sophomore,5,Small quiet beautiful campus.  The nursing program has been fantastic up to this point and I have heard nothing but good things about it.
Sophomore,5,Gwynedd Mercy University is a great college to attend. Most professors are very nice and willing to help. It is perfect for anyone who wants a small and private school. They provide many opportunities for students to go out to experience their fields of study.
Freshman,5,So happy with my decision!! Love my school! It is a very caring and beautiful campus with the most sincere staff you could ever find.
College Senior,5,Campus feels safe and drugs are rarely an issue
College Senior,5,Career Development offers a lot of help to current students and alumni. The alumni network keeps active.
College Senior,5,The professors really get to know the students and work their hardest to help students understand the content.
College Senior,5,Living on campus was the best decision I ever made!
College Senior,5,"I love GMercyU. I was hesitant when first applying because I didn't know much about the school, but now I know I will never regret my decision to go here."
College Junior,5,I believe that I am in one of the best schools for my major
College Junior,5,I feel as though I learn something new every single day and I love it!
College Junior,5,I always feel safe while on campus
College Junior,5,The school is one of the best in the field of study I am majoring in.
College Junior,5,the safety on this campus is great.
College Junior,5,"I love Gwynedd Mercy because i feel like I am home when I am here. The campus is amazing, its a great place to take a walk or bring your family members to."
College Freshman,5,"Not a university for drugs and alcohol! This University is not a party school. If you want to learn and earn a degree this is the university for you. If your looking for a party and great social life this is not the school for you. Stay home and party and attend community college, you will save money. If you want an excellent education, apply at Gwynedd Mercy University."
College Freshman,5,"Security is excellent!!! There is always security available at all times, and they care about the students and university."
College Junior,5,"Gwynedd Mercy University is a wonderful school with teachers that care and students that are friendly. Campus is a small, beautiful, homey atmosphere. The area surrounding Gwynedd has a lot of restaurant and shopping options."
College Junior,5,"I love GMercyU! I love my professors. They want students to do well and give us the tools to succeed. I am a person and I have a name, at Gwynedd I am not just a number. I feel very confident that before I graduate I will have a career lined up for me, because my professors are still currently active in the criminal justice system, therefore I have one foot in the door of opportunity already."
College Freshman,5,People do it but you don't hear about it much.
College Freshman,5,Small class sizes and amazing professors.
College Freshman,5,The athletic facilities are the best. They have numerous teams to try out for and many of the students get involved. Gwyned is a Division III school and definitely lets students participate on teams as well as get their school work done.
College Freshman,5,"Public safety are everywhere on campus. It is really safe and if there ever is a problem, they are very helpful and fast."
College Freshman,5,"The professors are very kind and are willing to help if students are struggling. The workload depends on the professors and the major. Popular study areas are the library and Rotelle Lounge. Registering for classes is a race and difficult. In order to get into the classes, a student has to have them in their cart days in advance. Once students do this they must go on the portal before midnight and press submit when it turns midnight."
College Senior,5,I would recommend this school.
College Senior,5,The workload is intense but it is very beneficial.
College Senior,5,I have never heard of an assault on campus.
Sophomore,4,"I took statistics and nutrition online and I think it went very well. I am not usually a person that learns material online very well, but with the help of my reliable and resourceful professors I managed to perform much better than anticipated."
Alum,4,I have just recently graduated from Gwynedd Mercy University with my Bachelors in Social Work. My classes were small but it allowed for my professors to connect with each student and make you feel valued. If you are interested in the work social workers do I suggest you contact either Dr. Luquet or Professor Nuss. Both professors are incredible in what they do. They give their all in and out of the classrooms while always supporting you in your goals.
Alum,4,I have taken a few classes online and had much success. The professors were great and kept the due dates similar each week.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very beautiful, the staff is excellent and it has an amazing reputation. This school excels in their nursing and education programs. This was my top choice school to complete my undergrad nursing education, because of how reputable the Gwynedd Mercy University name is. However, with how expensive this school is the food selection is subpar. There are three food options to choose from, which always seem to be closed at the most inappropriate times. Gwynedd is a D3 school which offers many sports to students, including intramural sports as well. They also offer a dance team and a cheerleading team, unfortunately Gwynedd does not have a football team. Overall Gwynedd is an amazing school that provides many great resources such as the Academic Resource Center (ARC) which student can utilize if they need a tutor or help writing an essay and they also have faculty dedicated to help build your resume so you can tackle the real world after college. Gwynedd is an amazing school."
Alum,4,"The social work program is new, but it great. I just graduated in the program and I feel and think as a social worker. I feel prepared and I owe that too the amazing social work faculty at Gwynedd."
Junior,4,"As a Nursing major at Gwynedd Mercy University, it is undoubtedly one of the most difficult programs in the country, but it is also one of the best in terms of return on investment. The professors are helpful and the campus is extremely safe. Most people who go to this institution are Nursing majors and they are mainly commuters both in and out of state. Academically, you can certainly exceed in the program, but it will require a lot of hard work and it ultimately rewarding. Things to improve on would be increased clarity for some professors who lecture as well as an increased number of commuter parking lots as finding parking is often difficult when running late to class."
Freshman,4,"Gwynedd Mercy University is a great school, they are very focused on academics and making sure that every student has the chance to shine. Even though it is a smaller school, I think that's better than a larger school because you get to know your peers and professors better."
Junior,4,My experience with Gwynedd Mercy has been nothing but amazing and truly life changing. I feel in love with school as soon as I stepped on campus and I've never looked back. The faculty genuinely cares about your success and that was the personal connection I was looking for in a university. The students on campus are friendly and the living experience on campus is unmatched by most other colleges or universities. With every university there are thing that are not perfect but there are too many good things about Gwynedd that total eclipse the negatives.
Junior,4,"Overall, I feel Gwynedd provided me with an education that I will carry with my for a lifetime. There are some professors that are better than others, but that is just like every other school. What makes Gwynedd stand out is the close community it enables allowing you to feel like a family. I have made some of my best friends while attending this college. The only thing to be aware of is it is indeed a small college, and approximately 85% commuter school. There could definitely be more parking spaces, but other than that I have no major issues."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Gwynedd Mercy University has been great. All the professors I have had are dedicated to seeing their students excel. They care about you and do not assign busy work; they present new materials in exciting ways that help you learn. The other students I have met are helpful; they are friendly and open to study groups. My favorite part of the University is the ARC, that is where students can go for tutoring and extra help.The only thing I would change about the university is the cost, the education is excellent, but I wish it were more affordable."
Sophomore,4,I am going into my sophomore year this upcoming fall. The school is very focused in the academics which is what drew me to it. The campus is fairly small but still very decent.
Graduate Student,4,Being an adult learner with work & the primary caregiver for my mother. Gwynedd Mercy doctoral program fit perfectly into my lifestyle. Also the professor & staff were very supportive & helpful in helping me successfully complete my degree.
Senior,4,I like there activities for student/resident life. They need to change the amount of activities for students. They need more!
Sophomore,4,"I transferred form another university and transferring to Gwynedd was the best decision I made. I am so much happier here, I'm close with all my teachers, and I have made amazing friends."
Freshman,4,"Gwynedd Mercy is such a great for me personally. It's a small school but it gives you a family and homey feel. Since its such a small school, class sizes are usually small too, which makes it easier to build relationships with professors. As a freshman, everyone is so helpful and give you the perfect amount of independence and guidance that you need. Since it's mostly a commuter school, there's not a lot of people on campus on the weekends. But it's easy to find something to do around town or with your friends. It also makes it easier to focus on the work load. Overall, coming to Gwynedd was one of the best decisions I've ever made."
Junior,4,"I am a junior, and I could not have found a better school for myself. Gwynedd's most exceptional attribute is its family atmosphere and the variety of activities it offers for the students which allowed me to make friends since I knew not one person coming to Gwynedd. Their weekly activities in ResHalls were the most beneficial as a freshman because they allowed me to form relationships. Gwynedd also has a variety of clubs that fit the needs of each student. I have made friends, joined clubs, and I have even become a Resident Assistant to help others with their transition. I also love the teachers here; the classes are small enough that students get to interact with them and feel like you matter to the teacher. I continue to enjoy my time at Gwynedd, and my advice for those who plan to attend or are attending Gwynedd is to get involved. The school is diverse and offers a variety of interests, and to make the best of your experience at Gwynedd take your time to enjoy the opportunities"
Freshman,4,Gwynedd Mercy University is a very diverse school where your education matters and the university wants to see you succeed.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore who lives on campus. Although I thought about transferring last year I am very happy that I did not. Switching my major to our new Occupational Therapy program is what really made me stay. However, there are many pros besides my major. All of the professors here are great, the campus is beautiful, and there are many clubs that one could get involved in. I am in the Voices of Gwynedd which is an awesome environment for newbies that want to sing. ResLife is great, they are always offering cheap/free opportunities to participate in such as trips to aquariums, New York, Color Me Mine parties etc. Also, since we are a small university, it is very easy to get help from financial aid, tutoring, and our career resources center. Finally, in my opinion, we are a VERY safe campus. The only complaints I would have is there are not many parties here and there are so many cliques that it sometimes makes it difficult to socialize."
Junior,4,"Gwynedd Mercy University has provided me a safe and nurturing environment to grow in my academic, professional, and personal life. When searching for schools to attend, I wasn't sure exactly what I was looking for other than a small school with a good nursing program. GMercyU has given me that and so much more. Through Gwynedd, I have become involved in many different organizations and offices on campus. I have been able to build my resume and skills for my future profession. The professors here at Gwynedd Mercy University have provided me with motivation and the support I needed to succeed in my academics. Something that I love about Gwynedd is that there are so many people to go to that are willing to help and listen. I can honestly say that at GMercyU I feel at home."
Alum,4,"I fondly look back on the four years I spent at the then, Gwynedd-Mercy College. I met wonderful friends, my future husband and have developed friendships with professors that I have maintained since graduating back in 2012. The one main negative I can say about Gwynedd, was their lack of student activities for those who lived on campus. However, I hear they are making a real effort to change this and have provided more options for students to have a fulfilling college experience. Every school has flaws, but the overall camaraderie, and the majority of awesome professors really made this school a place I am proud to have been apart of."
Sophomore,4,I like Gwynedd because it's a small university and it's tight-knit. I like that everyone knows each other and there is a close student-to-teacher bond. I wish more students were more friendly but not everyone can be that open. Overall it's a fantastic school.
Freshman,4,"Wish the food was better, the school is what you make it. Getting involved in sports has allowed me to have the best time. Housing is so nice."
College Senior,4,Nursing is one of the most popular majors
College Senior,4,Diversity on campus is there
College Senior,4,Public Safety offers a lot to keep students on campus safe.
College Senior,4,"Our sports teams are really great! They win a lot and when there is a home game, especially basketball, attendance is high."

College Junior,4,I'm enrolled in an online program. The classes are challenging and convenient.
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school and I am so glad I choose to attend. The faculty and staff are warm and welcoming. I have created strong bonds with several people already, both teachers and students."
College Sophomore,4,I play Lacrosse at Gwynedd and love it. The athletic building is great and the athletic training staff is very helpful.
College Sophomore,4,I really enjoy Gwynedd and its small campus and professors. They really help you when you are having trouble.
College Junior,4,Campus life is great at Gwynedd Mercy.
College Junior,4,we don't have Greek life on campus.
College Junior,4,"Sports are a key part of the Gwynedd Mercy community, especially basketball."
College Freshman,4,I have not done job/internships but have heard they are great.
College Freshman,4,Professors are nice and willing to help.
College Junior,4,"I've never felt threatened or in danger on campus. I've gone to parties, gotten drunk and separated from my friends, but because Gwynedd is so small we all relatively know of each other and no one would do anything serious. I haven't heard of any serious sexual assaults."
College Junior,4,A lot of the professors work part-time because they are still active in their field which is nice because that opens so many opportunities to students.
College Junior,4,"They have a weight room and a cardio room and it it always open to any students, residents or commuters, faulty and staff."
College Freshman,4,They have a mixture of suites and regular dorms. Both of these styles are very nice.
College Senior,4,The connections you make throughout the programs are excellent.
College Senior,4,Professors are always there to answer questions.
College Senior,4,I feel that gwynedd has achieved in creating well rounded and adequately educated students in every major.
College Freshman,4,I like my school. My school is unique because it close enough for my parents to see me play but nice to be away from them.
College Sophomore,4,"plenty of off campus housing and options, need a car if going to live off campus"
College Sophomore,4,Campus food is always fresh and many options. Would perfer if hours were earlier and later
College Sophomore,4,Gywynedd has a small school community that is tight knit. Your professors know you by name and your class size is small. The buildings and grounds are beatiful and spacious.
College Sophomore,4,"it's pretty good there are a ton of options, it's just if you feel like spending money or not, but I'm pretty sure none of those places has student discounts.."
Recent Alumnus,4,There are many places near my school. They have a whole foods where you can get great organic and healthy food. They also have different pubs and restaurants in the surrounding area.
College Junior,4,Gwynedd has a zero tolerance for drugs and drug use on campus.
College Junior,4,My program is a 2+2 program meaning you spend two full years at Gwynedd Mercy and two full years at an accredited hospital which you apply to.
College Junior,4,Most professors care about you and how you are doing in their class. They will always offer extra time for you to meet with them if you are ever falling behind or confused about what you are covering in class.
College Junior,4,The members of Public Safety also do whatever they can to help people when they are in need. They are very kind so people are never afraid to approach them and talk to them. All of the doors are always locked and you need an ID to swipe in. Guests must sign in and there is always security out and about.
College Junior,4,"I love the program that I am in because it is very different from all the other programs offered at Gwynedd. Its a 2+2 program, giving me the opportunity to meet new people, expand my knowledge and help me become a more well rounded person."
College Sophomore,4,"Financial aid was something I knew I would need so I took care of it early. When I got to school, there were still some things that needed to be taken care of but the Financial Aid office was always open and the people there could help you in a flash. I got a partial scholarship and I received grants that helped me pay for the first year but I know that as my time in college goes on, I'll want a lot more financial help. My advice for others is to get it done early, apply for grants, scholarships, loans, early and even when you get there, KEEP applying. There is always some free money out there waiting for you, even when you're already in college."
College Sophomore,4,"Everyone on campus is respectful to each other and their differences. There are some rare cases where that does not apply but for the most part, everyone gets along and there is no discrimination. Being a minority in a predominately white school, it seems unsettling but when everyone around interacts with you it eases the discomfort a lot."
College Sophomore,4,"Living on campus is very convenient. Everything you need for food, class, sports, fun, etc. is right there. The people are friendly, the environment is beautiful, and finding housing is very easy to do."
College Sophomore,4,The weather there is nothing I am not used to. The campus is natural and beautiful in the summer as it is covered in snow in the winter.
College Freshman,4,"Many different ethnic groups, no issues getting along."
Sophomore,2,"I thought was going to like the school and all, but the campus is very boring. It is not very active. The sports sucks there. they only have like 5 sports there and you can't really play if your are not really good, which make no sense, because they are divsion3. The academic at this school  is okay, but not all that. You can go some where a even better education for a way cheaper cost. The food here sucks. A lot of students who come here do not return back for a second year or the next semester. The party here sucks. We have them off campus, because the school don't want to have it on campus. The place the party are held sucks. if you are not drunk or high- the party sucks. Everything is wrong with this campus. The students are nice the RA are helpful and the dorms are suitable- nothing special."
Junior,2,"Residential student life is lackluster as the school is more of a commuter campus. If you simply want to go to schoo and get out, without getting anything else from the school, then this is the place for you. The teachers don't want to be there any more than the students. There is an overall feeling of ""just get me out of here as soon as possible"" that permeates the air for every student."
College Sophomore,2,theres no drinking allowed in dorms and the policy is weird with the school not being a dry campus but dry dorms.  the RAs can wright you up if they smell alcohol on your breath.  Quit hours are from 10pm to 10am which suck.. and no one of the opposite sex is allowed to spend the night in your room
College Junior,2,"The food they serve at Gwynedd is not at all appetizing. After awhile you begin to get used to it, but there are very little options and the lines always take forever."
College Junior,2,the program im in is the best in the area but everything else in the school sucks. i would still go to my school but i would not live on campus.
College Junior,2,they care about things they shouldnt and dont care about what they should. 
College Junior,2,Nothing open past 11pm. On the weekends there is one dining location open on campus and its from 11am-6pm and nothing is available after.
College Junior,2,The only people that go to sporting events are other athletes because they are required to. Other than that the sporting teams are just a nuisance to students
College Sophomore,2,"wilted salad, dried pasta, soup all tastes the same, poor flying insect control"
College Junior,2,Although I was happy with the program initially I don't know if I would recommend it now. The changes that have been made have come from some higher up people mostly on the main campus. This campus is strictly young college students. Although they claim that they have a better learning environment and that their students work so much harder than the adult students the results are staggering. The Nursing program just about came to a halt due the graduates not passing their boards! The professors from main campus seem very disrespectful towards the evening adult students. The director of the program views the evening students as some type of disfunctional students that just get handed a degree. The is life beyond academia 
College Junior,2,"I have not participated in a internship program. Internships have not been discussed, we do not have stable advisors"
College Junior,2,The process of getting into the Business Administration Program at Gwynedd Mercy College. I just feel as if I was sold a dream just so they could feel the seats in the program at the Center for Life Learning for adults who who during the day and take classes during the evening.
College Junior,2,"Need a Ride to Go to Places – Although there are only a few chains established near the campus, you certainly need a car to drive to places. The closest ones are located in 1 mile distance. Subway, starbucks, and McDonalds are some of the names that are good places to visit. There are not much of a variety foods available unless you drive into nearby cities --- lansdale, North Wales."
College Student,2,Event Depending – The students will have very good school spirit when the majority of the school is willing to attend a sports event. Our atheletes are dedicated to what they do and perform at the best of their abilities. Go Griffins!
College Student,2,Just So-So – Even ratio. Not the most attractive. Relaxed Style
College Junior,2,"Life on Campus – Life on campus is not that great, because on the weekends a lot of people go home. If you don't have a car there is not much you can do on or off campus. The dorms are average nothing to write home about."
College Freshman,2,the nursing program is very competitive on top of your regular workload from classes
College Junior,2,"there is no nightlife at my school, there's always security, and student that don't have a car are stuck on the boring campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Average Food for Above Average Students – The cafeteria food is average at Gwynedd-Mercy College and is rarely satisfying. Once in a while the cafeteria will serve steak, fish, or turkey but on most days I find myself just eating a burger that has been laying out for an hour. The students at Gwynedd-Mercy spend their money on a meal plan so they can eat and enjoy great quality food. The cafeteria needs a make over to get the respect of its student body back."
Niche User,1,"Horrible,racist, overpriced and organized. Might be ok for the working adult student, but do not send your children to live on campus here!"

College Freshman,1,It's so quiet after everyone's classes are done for the day.

College Junior,1,"I am a full time nursing student and i work full time and live alone, so it is very hard for me because i have to work alot in order to pay my bills, and i end up with nothing and dont qualify for aide. Its really hard."
College Junior,1,"The school is so strict about everything. Gives the students very little to practically no freedom to do much of anything. Quiet hours start at 11 pm, absolutely no alcohol even if your 21 or over. Supposed to be dry residence hall but you can't drink anywhere on campus? School dances are like high school, they end early, if you leave you cannot come back and you must have your student id present."
College Junior,1,they are very strict with parking and will not hesitate to ticket/boot your car for something stupid. 
College Junior,1,"we have no greek life. alot of people on campus want greek life to be an option especially since we just reached university status

College Junior,1,"The only reason I came here is because of field hockey. The school is pretty boring, everyone goes home on the weekends. You have to make your own fun. There is no service anywhere on campus."
College Student,1,Not Much to Do – There are not many parties going on at Gwynedd Mercy. On occasion there are but not on the regular. On the plus side the school is in the suburbs and there is plenty to do in the surrounding area. Also a train ride or drive to philadelphia is only minutes away.
College Freshman,1,NO SCOOP – this school isnt that interesting only bragging rights are towards the nursing program because its pretty good
College Freshman,1,"Its not so diverse here, everyone pretty much stays in their cliques"

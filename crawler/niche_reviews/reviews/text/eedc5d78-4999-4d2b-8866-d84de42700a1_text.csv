Sophomore,5,"I love Luther College so far!! The professors truly care about their students and are involved on campus. The dorms are some of the nicer ones that I have seen, and the atmosphere on campus is very friendly and welcoming."
Junior,5,I love Luther its such a beautiful campus an the life here on campus is all about changing the world for the better.
Junior,5,As a nursing student online learning was challenging from a totally hands on learning perspective to individualized care acts home. I demonstrated nursing skills on family members and recorded them for assignments. My professors were very understanding to the lack of internet or access for distance learning due to covid.
Alum,5,Luther is a fantastic program for those who are wanting to involve themselves in music. It also has a fantastic nursing program.
Alum,5,Due to COVID we had to transition to online classes. This didn't affect the quality of the courses though.
Alum,5,"Small school with strong academics and close-knit student body. Campus is situated overlooking a river and has nearby bluffs, hiking and more."
Senior,5,Wonderful school. A liberal arts education has provided a well-rounded experience. The school and Decorah area create a special community.
Freshman,5,"Luther is a small and beautiful campus and the faculty engage the students in all class activities. The campus feels like home no matter where you are from and the inclusive environment allows for all students to find a place. They have international programs, dance teams, sports teams, recreational sport clubs, music clubs, student body organizations, anything you could ever want and everyone is always welcome. The environment is truly magnificent for learning and thriving, as everyone around you wants you to succeed as well."
Freshman,5,"The Luther College campus is great.  It is beautiful and the Decorah area around it is the same way.  Most everyone who works at Luther College is incredibly nice, and there are some brilliant professors to help teach students.  The programs on campus are great, and there are plenty of ways to get involved, no matter your interests."
Freshman,5,"Luther college has a beautiful campus, everyone is very kind, very easy to make friends in this small town environment."
Niche User,5,"When I went to tour the college, I found it was a beautiful and welcoming college. The campus is absolutely gorgeous and very well kept up. The college itself focuses a lot on community building. It was overwhelming at first, but everyone I came across was extremely friendly and willing to help with whatever I needed. The staff I met were amazing. They were willing to sit down with my family and I to answer any questions I had. This college has made my decision process much harder."
Sophomore,5,"This college is like a small gem: you don't get lost here. There are great research opportunities, accessible professors, caring counselors, good food and amazing nature!"
Niche User,5,"Thought they weren’t very diverse, they were able to make everyone feel included and comfortable. They are very welcoming"
Alum,5,"Luther College provided an incredible experience through their nursing program. Getting to spend a year at Mayo Clinic through the program provided clinical experiences that are not afforded elsewhere, because patients go there when they have no where else to go. Incredible."
Niche User,5,"It's a great college! Everyone here is friendly and welcoming. There's always something to do, whether it be in the res halls or with the clubs. It's easy to make friends here. I love it!"
Freshman,5,"Luther is an amazing place for all people. Diversity of thought and students is incredible, school culture is wonderful, facilities are beautiful, and staff is helpful!"
Alum,5,"Luther College was a perfect undergraduate/liberal arts experience. They are known for their music programs, which are phenomenal, but I also benefited from the wide range of study abroad opportunities. Studying abroad in college is one of the best life experiences a person can ask for, and I participated in two while I was studying at Luther: one J-term abroad to complete my minor and one year-long study abroad program which was absolutely life changing."
Freshman,5,Luther is a wonderful school! With great academics and an even better atmosphere Luther is the perfect fit for almost any college student. Located in a small town there is never not enough to do. There are always activities on campus and things to do in the community. The Luther community is so kind and they are always smiling at you as you walk to class. Academics here a great classes are challenging and really get you thinking. Professors are amazing!
Freshman,5,"Luther has been a very challenging and eye-opening place and has provided many amazing experiences for me already. The professors here are extremely understanding and want to work with each and every student in order for everyone to succeed. There are plenty of opportunities to get involved for students at every level and social group. I have met a lot of amazing people here, and am really enjoying my experiences."
Freshman,5,"Luther College is a wonderful college located in beautiful Decorah, Iowa. It is a great place to receive an even better degree. The professors are driven to provide you with the best resources to help exceed in both class and in the future. Everyone here is very kind and nice, as well. Finally, between sporting events and all the great things to do in Decorah, there are plenty of things to keep you interested."
Junior,5,"The college strives to make sure that all students are successful. Students are able to develop relationships with their professors due to small class sizes. There are many opportunities to try new things, as well as opportunity for discussion when deemed necessary."
Sophomore,5,"Academically, there are a lot of opportunities for me at Luther that I couldn't get at a large public school, i.e. student/faculty research. Decorah and its scenery is beautiful."
Senior,5,Luther is a great school for one seeking a liberal arts education. The academics provided at Luther challenge students to think in cross-disciplinary ways and students will truly find what they are passionate about here. Luther is an excellent undergraduate choice.
Senior,5,"The unique sense of community at Luther makes it really something special. The professors are excellent and there to help you succeed. Luther is the perfect place for those who want an excellent education but also want to be involved in athletics, clubs, or other organizations."
Freshman,5,"I think it's a great college. The community is so welcoming and everyone is amazing! I would HIGHLY recommend to anyone looking at the smaller colleges. There's something for everyone, athletics, music, great academics, theater, there are tons of clubs and other opportunities for you to find your scene!"
Freshman,5,"I love the support staff offer and how much they truly enjoy their job. Their music program is phenomenal, and it is the perfect place to go for a small-town college."
Alum,5,Great School and professors take the time to get to know you. Pretty white student population with similar backgrounds but generally a fantastic atmosphere to learn.
Niche User,5,I'm going to be attending Luther in the Fall 2018.  I had a great visit and I love the campus and the people I've met.  I can't wait to be a Norse!
Freshman,5,Luther is an excellent college in a beautiful town.  The professors are outstanding and always willing to help students learn.   Luther has strong academic and athletic programs.  The campus is very safe and has a lot of organizations students can join.  I highly recommend Luther College to prospective students.
Freshman,5,"I just completed my first semester at Luther College and absolutely love it there.  All of the buildings are well taken care of the professors take the time to value you as an individual. They have a wonderful small, gorgeous, and cozy campus. This works perfect if the big universities intimidate you and you are looking for a smaller feel. Everyone is very welcoming and you find your sense of community really fast on campus"
Junior,5,"I love the campus, its beautiful. About 85% of the professors are amazing. I am going to be a junior and would not have chose any other school."
Freshman,5,"Amazing school. Open and inviting. Great education, especially nursing. Athletics are great. The music department is insane."
Sophomore,5,"Every second I have been at Luther I have cherished immensely. The professors here want to help you gain a helpful education that will serve you in the long-term and everyone is friendly. The city of Decorah is also very neighborly and I often wave to people I don't even know and they wave back! We are a very diverse campus with students from sixty countries I believe and are safe for all people. If you would like a good education settled in a beautiful area with kind people, Luther is the place for you."
Freshman,5,"Luther College is an awesome place to pursue a liberal arts education. The academics are solid, and it's a great place to figure out what you want to do if you aren't sure where you want your life to go after college. From my perspective, as an art major, the art program is amazing. I am able to perfect my craft, as well as dabble in other subjects that peak my interest, which is something every student can do. I love science, so I'm taking a biology class, that fulfills general requirements as well as my fascination. 
The campus is beautiful, the professors care about you, and the overall environment is accepting and obliging."
Freshman,5,"I love it here! Everyone here is welcoming and positive. You don't really need to open doors, someone will open it for you. Food is okay, nothing special."
Freshman,5,"Overall, I really love Luther. The community here is amazing. Everyone is so nice and welcoming. There is plenty to do and I am very actively involved- because they made it so easy. One thing I would change would be the academic challenge- I wish I was being challenged a little more but my courses will  become more rigorous with time."
College Freshman,5,I know I made the right choice. It's beautiful and everyone is easy to talk to and so welcoming.
College Senior,5,"Luther College is very down to earth, very connected to the Decorah community, and very involved in improving the environment through reducing their carbon footprint, recycling, and preserving nature. My favorite experience so far at Luther was my junior year, when I took a course on insects. The professor offered many opportunities to connect to the natural world around us through field trips and up-close and personal insects from the area and from around the world. I learned many new things about identifying and classifying insects as well as their importance and impact on the economy and their role in nature. This was very cool to experience as I learned to appreciate insects instead of fear them."
College Junior,5,"Luther is a place that most students can call home. They feel safe there and like they are part of a great loving community. The professors really care about the students success and the students seem to care about their classmates. On top of this, the city of Decorah is absolutely beautiful. If you are ever bored in this town, you are missing out on a lot."
College Sophomore,5,"Luther is like home to me. It is expensive, but I wouldn't want to go to school anywhere else."
College Sophomore,5,"Being a liberal arts college, Luther offers a wide variety of majors and minors, all with wonderful programs of study.  In particular, Luther has a very strong science program with ties to Mayo Clinic in Rochester, MN.  The career center is very helpful and tailors its help with the use of the Five Strengths model of personality analysis.  J-Term provides wonderful access to major/career-specific learning opportunities, both on campus and abroad."
College Sophomore,5,"Luther is a private, liberal arts college, and it greatly emphasizes creating well-rounded, open-minded and academically excellent students.  Thus, there is a wide variety of courses offered, and all courses approach academic material as it could be applied in real life, not merely in a classroom setting.  Classes are small and personal, offering deep and tailored enrichment for each student, and free tutoring services are available through the school for every class.  Professors at Luther are all deeply passionate and well-studied in their areas of expertise, and are very engaging and helpful, treating students more as partners in learning than merely as students.  Professors are very flexible and almost always available outside of classroom hours to assist students."
College Sophomore,5,"Luther's campus is incredibly safe, and Campus Security is very easily accessible and willing to help in various different situations, including offering students free escorts to their dorms if they ever feel unsafe at nighttime hours.  I personally have never experienced anything but kindness from anyone on campus and feel very safe at Luther during all hours of the day and night."
College Sophomore,5,"Everyone at Luther is so deeply engaged, passionate, kind, helpful and wonderful.  Academics are very high-stakes and professors treat them as such, however, they are also incredibly helpful and personable when approached by students.  Students are all incredibly kind, accepting and helpful as well, and everyone takes the honor code seriously, holding grades to the highest standard.  The music at Luther is phenomenal, and is a treat even for students who are not personally involved in a music program.  The town of Decorah is so quaint and nature-oriented, and everyone is ""Midwest nice"" and has his/her own passion, making it an all around wonderful college town.  Overall, attending Luther College is a dream!"
College Freshman,5,The teachers are passionate and the community is very caring. I feel right at home here!
College Junior,5,The counseling services and health services on campus provide students with everything they need to be healthy and safe both mentally and physically. Our campus security is always ready to help students in need no matter what the issue and they are always ready to walk a student back from studying to their dorm late at night or drive them where they need to go. Safety and health and well being are a priority on campus.
College Junior,5,"It is very important for the career center that they are focused on life after Luther, and the provide tons of work shops about resumes and various career fairs or summer work fairs to help student get to that next step in their life."
College Junior,5,"My professors are really accepting, understanding, and helpful. You can tell that they care about students want them to succeed and want to know their students on a personal level. Classes are challenging, but as long as you put the work and get a head of the game before you are struggling there is no reason for a student to not succeed."
College Junior,5,"Students on campus care about what is going on in the athletics of luther college. The entire student-athlete population is a community with each other. There is a lot of support for one another, and there is a lot of Luther Pride that goes one for both athletes and non-athletes (including intramurals)"
College Junior,5,"College is always what you make of it. Being at Luther has provided me with opportunities to step out of my comfort zone, become a leader, and really tap into my potential. I am involved in athletics at school and my experience with the programs have been outstanding. They are helping me become more then an athlete but they are teaching me how to be an individual that is a good steward of the earth and all of those that live on it as well. Hard work is a priority but so fun and positivity."
College Senior,5,"Luther College is made by the people.  As cheesy as it sounds, it is a great community.  From the faculty and staff to the students, everyone is connected to the college and each other.  Students have really good relationships with professors; it is not unusual for professors to invite groups of students over to their house at some point.  Personally, I have met some of my best friends at Luther and will keep in touch with many more after I graduate.  Everywhere you go, you will find someone who has heard of, knows someone or personally went to Luther College.  It's amazing how strong such a small campus can be."
College Sophomore,5,"I love my school. It has been so academically rigorous and I actually retain information that I have learned. It is a very close knit community and it truly feels like my second home. My favorite experiences have been playing on the rugby team, joining a sorority and volunteering through that, and all the random activities that happen. I would definitely choose my school again if I could do it all over because it is an all around great school and wonderful fit for me. Four years of my life that I will cherish forever."
College Freshman,5,"Pretty darn good, but the registration process was really annoying and stressful."
College Freshman,5,It all seems pretty great.
College Freshman,5,This school is the best! I honestly can't imagine myself ANYWHERE else. I love it here!
College Freshman,5,"I love, love, love it! The RA's are literally the best, and the hall directors are AMAZING!"
College Freshman,5,"The teams definitely are not division one, but they are pretty decent. I am involved in some intramurals and they are really fun."
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love it! It's amazing and I couldn't imagine myself at any other school!
College Senior,5,"Decorah is a very safe place. People often leave doors unlocked as they are so comfortable in the community. Occasionally there are incidents, but this is rare, and if something does happen it is usually dealt with well and in an efficient way"
College Senior,5,"I have had a great experience with courses and profs. They are quality courses and profs, regardless of the field. The small class sizes make things easy to get closer to people and feel important."
Sophomore,4,"The switch to online was confusing at first because Luther had no online classes set up. However, professors were very understanding and stayed connected with students as much as possible."
Sophomore,4,"Nobody was really ready for the online schooling. The professors did a great job quickly coming up with online learning plans despite the pressure. With a new term coming up, the teachers will have more online teaching, and I believe it will be easier for everyone to do because they had more time to prepare a plan for online classes."
Sophomore,4,"The college is absolutely beautiful and a majority of the teachers are amazing. The theatre and music departments are strong and have amazing professors. I would say to check ratemyprofessors.com in order to really get student's opinion. There isn't much diversity on campus, considering that the college is in small-town Iowa.  However, I can see that the professors are welcoming to all students of different backgrounds. Decorah is a cute town with bigger cities about an hour away. My experience at Luther has been great so far and have been getting a strong education here. I would definitely recommend coming to Luther for a personalized education with good relationships with professors."
Sophomore,4,"So far in my first year at Luther College, I have had a fairly decent experience. Luther is an expensive university to attend. However, Luther College has been very generous to me in terms of financial aid. I still have to take out student loans and I am looking to have to take out less so I am not so far in debt when I graduate. I have made some good relationships with some very capable professors. My experience at Luther has only made me want to progress my academics more. I look forward to my next years at Luther, and more good experiences."
Sophomore,4,I am now a Sophomore at Luther College and I love it! I am on the swim team there and I think that has been the highlight of my college experience. I had automatic friends and it felt like a home away from home. Academically it has been a challenge but in the best way possible. I am a math major and an education minor. I absolutely love my education classes and my math classes give me more of a challenge but in the best way possible. If I were to change one thing about Luther it would be to have a finance class be required because I think those skills are so important to know but I don't have time for them.
Junior,4,I love Luther but there are some things I would change about it like its food. The food in the cafeteria is not good.
Freshman,4,I have been here for a year so far and the campus is a great place during the fall. Participating in Football was a great thing to get to know people and to see how the life of a college student athlete can be influenced by the school.
Freshman,4,"The campus is wonderful! You really feel united with one another and its just a great vibe. There isn't really anything that I don't like about the college other than it isn't really lit up well at night, There aren't very many lamppost, so if you're walking outside at night, it's kind of hard to see."
Freshman,4,"My experience with Luther College so far is a beautiful campus filled with many interesting people. There is a great focus on the Liberal arts in the classroom, and many staff who are willing to help with even the smallest question."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Luther is a great place to be involved in, the campus and the community are excellent. It also gives out good financial aids, scholarships. Professors are great and the small size classes provide opportunities for deep learning and critical thinking. However, the location is poor; it is a small town lifestyle and there are not many opportunities for students outside of the campus. I wish Decorah would have public transportation options. But Luther also has an Alumni internship network and a variety of study abroad programs. For example, it has a one year off study abroad program at the University of Nottingham, UK, also semester off programs and many J term options worldwide. As an international student, overall my experience is positive at Luther college."
Sophomore,4,"My first year was an amazing wild ride! I am great friends with my roommates, I loved my music classes, and even found an interest in Norwegian. Luther College offers lots of different classes that expand on your learning and education. They also have wonderful and excellent staff! All of the professors want to know every single one of their students and they want them to succeed. The only thing I would like to see change is more availability in classes. The classes fill up extremely fast, so if you don't have an early registration time you don't have high chances of getting in the classes you want."
Senior,4,"For an international student, Luther College is like exactly going to a place that know nothing about the outside world. I do understand that a lot of people do not know a lot about other countries but my experiences at Luther College have been a whole new level. The school is in a closed small community that is predorminantly white and elder generation . The closest big city to Luther is in Rochester, some 2 hours away which makes the school a lot rural and slow. The up side is the community is surrounded by beautiful scenery of nature and sometimes wildlife."
Sophomore,4,"I love the community at Luther, everyone is so kind and involved on campus and in the community. Some things I would change is for the faculty to be more inclusive and understanding, and also for the diversity to be increased."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy Luther! Students have the opportunity to become close to their professors and their peers. Music is very good at this school!
Freshman,4,"I like the community at Luther, people are very friendly. Despite not having a lot of diversity in the student body other than international students, lots of diffident opinion are available. Professors want their students to succeed, and are always available for questions and help."
Freshman,4,"When I applied to Luther College (due to a recommendation from a high school counselor), I thought I would be surrounded by cornfields. However after first stepping onto campus, I knew that Luther would be my home. It is nothing like I was expecting. Luther is located in the bluffs of the NE corner of Iowa, making it one of Iowa's hidden gems. I have never met so many people on campus who are genuinely friendly and caring to each person they meet. The community on campus has already offered me so many opportunities within my first couple of months away from home. I am so excited to see what Luther has in store for both me and future prospective students!"
Sophomore,4,Luther College provides an inclusive learning environment. The small class sizes make everyone feel like they are a part of the discussion. The all college requirements really helped me grow as a person.
Senior,4,"I absolutely love the community at Luther College. Its a college that is big enough that you can still meet new people every day, but is small enough that you don't just feel like a number.  If I were going to have a say in something that Luther could change in order to become a better school, I think I would say that the president, and their committees that make a majority of the decisions about campus would become more involved and interac"
Sophomore,4,"I love Luther College. For the most part, all faculty have respected me and given me a great education. Good food and fresh options. I have been given so many educational tools and opportunities not many other places give to their students. All educators are willing to help students. I love the one-on-one time as well. I feel at home on campus; However, the campus leans very liberal and kinda squashes any conservative ideas. Being a more conservative Christian sometimes makes me feel like an outcast."
Sophomore,4,"I have only completed one year at Luther College, but overall my experience has been pretty good. I love the community there. People are very kind as well as welcoming. One thing I would like to see improve is the flexibility of a couple of professors."
Freshman,4,"A beautiful campus with welcoming people and a wide range of options for academic pursuit.  The small town also adds a sense of quiet to what would otherwise be, a fairly busy place."
Junior,4,"Luther college strives to be an inclusive, tight-knit community. For the most part, they are. Although it is a private Lutheran school, it is a progressive college who welcome all."
Freshman,4,"It's a very good college, but relations with international students could definitely be better. It almost feels as if we are segregated. Something else that could change at Luther is the food. It is often sub-par, but we do have food so that's a plus. It is also bogus that we have to pay for laundry, but here we are."
Freshman,4,"Luther College has a very friendly community atmosphere.The professors, and staff really care about their students, and encourage their success. The liberal arts curriculum encourages study in a variety of areas which is great for the student diverse passions and interests. Luther students are extremely active in on campus activities and organizations, and are active in volunteering and promoting causes they believe in. I appreciate Luther's diversity, with a large international student population, but I often find myself wishing there was more diversity in experience and opinion in my classes. 
Working with the housing system at Luther was not always the easiest or best experience when trying to manage toxic rooming situations, and think the housing application should be updated, and procedures changed to give students more flexibility.
Overall, I have had a good experience at Luther, and hope that it will only improve in the years to come."
Junior,4,"Luther provides a competitive  environment in order to earn a degree. Professors want their students to succeed, and are understanding of personal issues."
Senior,4,I have really enjoyed my time at Luther and it has been a wonderful place for me to figure out my passion in life. Professors really do want to help you find the best opportunities in life.
Sophomore,4,"Luther has a great community and professors that are committed to student success. The campus is a welcoming place. However, There are issues with tuition increases and diversity at the school."
Sophomore,4,"Luther college has a lovely campus with plenty of outdoor activities to enjoy! The first year dorms are separated into an athlete dorm, a arts oriented dorm, and an outdoors man dorm which allows you to meet with people you have things in common with immediately! The only issue I have with Luther is that there is little to no diversity, with only 25 black or mixed females attending within the full 4 years, resulting in only 1% of students being female students with African-american heritage."
Sophomore,4,Very happy at Luther. Truly a sanctuary from the world. Pursuit of excellence and a strong sense of community can describe the campus.
Senior,4,Luther College has given me the opportunity to travel and see the world and experience it in a new and eye opening kind of way. Everyone is so kind and friendly and the professors know who you are by name.
Freshman,4,"I definitely felt like Luther seemed a lot better when I was a prospective student, but I do still think it is a great place to be. The teachers aren't always great, but when you get a good one, they are superb. The food though? Generally not great. One awesome thing about Luther, though, is the people. They are normally very nice and accepting."
Senior,4,"Overall, I have had a good experience at Luther College. My academics have helped me achieve graduate school, so I am excited for my future. Hopefully Luther College can become more diverse, and make students more of a priority over money."
Senior,4,"Luther College has provided me with an exemplary liberal arts education. However, it is truly a liberal school. Nonetheless, such a school has equipped me to better understand how to live in the world. Class sizes are small, professors are genuinely vested in students' learning and are quite personable, and the campus is situated amongst a beautiful landscape. While the number of cliques at the school rivals that of your average prep high school, many students are friendly and sociable. Decorah, the college's town, is a small but forward minded town with several unique venues such as the Whippy Dip or Mabes Pizza, as well as the infamous ""Scoes"" bar and the actually famous Toppling Goliath Brewery. Seriously, Google it. The Norwegian heritage heavily colors the area and school, with our mascot being the Norse, the existence of a Norwegian museum, and many churches for such a small town. If you love music, the outdoors, and sustainability, you will feel right at home."
Sophomore,4,"I love Luther. It's a wonderful institution, and it challenges me to be a better musician and scholar. The classes may be a bit challenging, but what else would you expect from a small school. There are friendly people and great alumni!"
Freshman,4,Luther is home. It's beautiful and the professors are great - the perks of a small school. Campus is very liberal though.
Junior,4,"Luther has a great campus in a beautiful area. My only complaint is that there is not too much to do in town, but what else would you expect in a small Iowan town? Most students are very nice, and there is a great sense of community here. I have liked the majority of my professors. I do wish there was a higher turnout at athletic events, as we do have good soccer, wrestling, women's basketball, and softball teams. The biggest problem I have is the student life office, who has treated me poorly on numerous occasions. However, overall, Luther is a great place to be."
College Senior,4,"Luther highly regards their athletics programs, but they also do not focus too much on it. Luther does a great job balancing their appreciation for academics, athletics, and music. School spirit is widely spread for all activities, and students attend sports events regularly to support their peers."
College Junior,4,Getting a degree from Luther is extremely helpful when it comes to trying to get a job after school. Few people I know have any troubles finding work after they finish with their education at Luther.
College Junior,4,I always feel as though I am able to be engaged in the classes I attend. They are interesting and the teachers find ways to keep you motivated to learn in the classroom.
College Junior,4,Most people can feel like they are really safe whenever they are on campus. The campus security staff is really nice and help all students in need as quickly as possible.
College Sophomore,4,"It is a very safe environment. I have never felt scared to walk past people on campus or walk alone at night. As a young woman, I feel safe no matter what on campus."
College Sophomore,4,Our campus is very safe. We have had some assaults and rapes unfortunately but it is very rare. I feel very safe on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"Housing is great, clean, and conveniently placed. Some buildings don't have air conditioning."
College Sophomore,4,"Housing selection is a very detailed and thorough process intended to place students with both roommates and floor-mates with similar personalities and interests to create small communities in which students can feel comfortable and happy.  Luther is a residential college, so everyone is guaranteed on-campus housing, and the housing selection process is based on class rank.  The dorms are all better than most colleges, but some are more standard, or do not have air conditioning, while some are incredibly up-to-date and even borderline luxurious.  Overall, with housing at Luther, you can't go wrong."
College Sophomore,4,"I am not personally involved in sports, but the people who are participate with pride, even though Luther is a relatively small school.  The general student population is also very supportive of both varsity and intramural sports, as any extracurricular participation is highly encouraged at Luther."
College Sophomore,4,"What it comes down to is what you make out of it. If you make the most out of the career center, you will get ahead with your degree. I think there is value of a degree from this school, especially for music and with nursing."
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoyed most of my professors this year. They are very open to meeting up for office hours to help out. The class sizes are on the smaller side which is nice. I think some of my courses could have been ran more smoothly, but overall the quality was good."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel pretty save on campus. I'm a girl and I have no issues walking alone on campus. It was a shock this year when people started stealing money out of other people's personal belongings in the music building. A lot of people will leave their backpacks unattended, not worried anyone will touch them. That is how safe people feel at Luther. But this year however, someone caught on and felt the need to steal money from people's wallets. 

I think there were 2 sexual harassment cases that were told to campus. Luther does a huge amount of things for rape and consent, especially for the first-years. I went to a sexual assault event this year hearing about people and their stories. The Luther community makes an effort to make people aware that they have resources."
College Sophomore,4,"I have been at Luther for one year and I would say my overall experience has been great. At first, it was hard to feel like I was a part of the campus, but I think the biggest thing to alleviate that is to get involved. It takes time to get used to a new home. I feel like Luther is my home now. 

Luther is unique because a lot of the students enjoy nature and being outside. Chacos are super popular. There are many hiking trails, waterfalls and parks to visit in Deborah. It is a beautiful campus. If you want a crazy party scene keep in mind that there aren't a lot of things to do at night on weekends besides going downtown to eat a meal and drinking at the bar that accept 19 and older. If you appreciate concerts, Luther does put on productions on the weekends that are free to go to for students.  

A lot of the kids here are involved with music. It's a huge part of school culture. I've noticed there are two sides to campus –the students in music and the ones in sports. To be honest, I rarely talk to anyone who isn't in a musical ensemble because I don't cross paths with them. All of the sports people tend to glob onto each other as well. In that sense, there are two huge gaps in student culture. People who aren't in music sometimes feel isolated, which I can understand because there are just so many people involved in a musical ensemble. 

Christmas at Luther is a great experience where all of the choirs (and orchestra) put on a Christmas program. I was very fortunate to be in the orchestra this last year!"
College Freshman,4,"Courses provide a wide range of subjects, and professors are mostly all trained to teach the given classes. This makes classes more enjoyable and most beneficial. Since Luther is a liberal arts college, it means students are required to take a variety of classes for the general requirements. Although it can be tedious at times, this produces well rounded students that many employees look for. Class sizes are great! Obviously some of the introduction/general courses can be bigger, but once a student narrows their desired major classes only get smaller and smaller."
College Freshman,4,"Although I haven't personally been to the career center, they have come to some of my classes to show the many options they have. Luther has a large network that allows them to place students all over the country, and even some abroad! I also know since Decorah is near the twin cities, this is where many of the graduates are able to find jobs. Since I'm a first year, I haven't done much exploring in the career center/internship area, but I have heard good things!"
College Freshman,4,"Don't let the first year non air conditioned dorms scare you away. Once you're out of the freshman dorms, most of the other ones have AC. I think most people would say the Luther dorms are good enough, but not the BEST or the worst. The rooms in Brandt (first year) are the biggest, so that's nice. In Ylvisaker, they are pretty small, but not unbearable. If you are a spacious minded person, you should be able to sort the furniture in a way that makes the most room (my room is very spacious and I'm in Ylvi). In addition, the RAs are all really friendly and always willing to help. As for roommates, Luther does a good job at matching people up. Obviously not every match will be good, but if you answer the survey honestly and detailed, there really is not much to worry about. The towers, Dieseth and Miller, both have nice open kitchens as well (all the other dorms have kitchens as well!). Anyone is free to use it if they feel like making a home cooked meal. But it's important to keep in mind (first years) that no matter how great your roommate is, the first couple of weeks are the hardest. If you stick it out, make an effort to make friends, and go to events, chances are your first year will be great!"
College Freshman,4,"I am part of one of the varsity teams on campus, and from my experience I think the athletic program and support is very good. Many people come to basketball, soccer, softball, baseball, and the other events to come and support the teams. In addition, fans like to have a theme for fan section, so some games students will have a black out or a white out or Hawaiian night. It's so much fun! As an student-athlete, I first thought juggling to two could be difficult, but really it's not. Knowing I have practices and games on certain days and times makes me manage my time. Instead of procrastinating, I get the work done. I noticed when my team had two weeks off after the season ended, my school work time management got out of wack. As for coaches and professor understanding, both are very good at working together. My coach always understands if I will be late to practice because a trip in class or a lab that went long, and likewise, my professors are very understanding and always wish me luck if I have to leave class early because of a game. In fact, my coach has often said that academics always comes first. It really is awesome!"
College Freshman,4,"Luther College provides a wide range of activities to be a part of. This means students (especially first year) get many opportunities to connect with a lot of different people. I love that there are so many different events throughout just one week including concerts, plays, athletic games, clubs, and so many more. You could never be bored if you didn't want to! Also, I love the class sizes and classes in general. Professors here are very understanding and care about students. The professors even meet up and have coffee if you asked, and I know a lot of graduates who still communicate with their professors. As for classes, since Luther is a liberal arts school, students get the experience of taking a wide range of classes. This means students here get a well rounded education. Personally I've noticed how many of my classes connect with other classes. I find it very interesting and exciting! The beautiful campus is another bonus! Luther does a great job at giving work study out to students, and many of the students will do grounds and custodial. This means students get the opportunity to help keep the school clean, plus they get paid too! The town Luther is in is unlike most other places as well. Decorah's countless trails and springs make it fun to just go out on a hike, especially on this hot days. In addition, Decorah has the Upper Iowa river run through, and many students take advantage of this by tubing, kayaking, or just swimming. It's a great community as well!"
College Junior,4,"Campus housing is great. There a lot of options for upperclassmen to choose from. Overall, the living situation is a good one and the resident assistants are usually pretty great people."
College Freshman,4,"All the classes I have taken so far have been extremely interesting and all the professors are very cool. In top of that, you can't beat the account of awesome people to meat here."
College Freshman,4,"I don't remember much about getting my housing, so it must have been pretty easy. The roommate lottery is not the best, but it could easily be worse."
College Freshman,4,"The atmosphere feels like home. Everyone I've met is friendly, or at least willing to cooperate. There are many fun events to attend, and helpful and informative seminars to assist in guiding you through to the next year. I would say that the board is not the greatest at selecting roommates for first years. My roommate is ok, but I have multiple friends that got different roommates because they could not stand each other. That is why I deducted a rating."
College Sophomore,4,"There are quality safety measures on campus. There are the security guards who drive around campus and make rounds at night, checking every building. At the beginning of the year the RAs tell people to put security's phone number in their phones, because it has come in handy if you need to get into somewhere or want a ride home after work late at night. Overall good safety on campus."
College Sophomore,4,The professors on campus are very friendly and want to see their students succeed. They know their material they are teaching and enjoy teaching it. I like that the class sizes are generally small because that is a better learning environment to absorb information. Overall wonderful place to learn.
Senior,2,"I gave Luther College 2 stars based upon my past experience: professors who have not made students feel welcomed, cases sexual assault that have been brought to Luther's attention, but little had been done about it, lack of social scene, diminished experience with Decorah, and overall a poor college experience."
College Junior,2,I think we have like two sororities and maybe a fraternity? I can't even name what they are. They play little to no importance on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Many students end up picking this school so that they can play on one of the teams, and then the realize they made a mistake."
College Sophomore,2,"We don't really have a big Greek Life impact at Luther. I've heard of one sorority and one fraternity that is underground. If you're interested in being involved with Greek Life, go to another school. I'm not even sure if there is a Greek house."
College Sophomore,2,Not always the best places to live; hard to get what you want when it comes to living.
College Freshman,2,"If you are not the kind of person that this school built for, you will not like it. I would not recommend if you are majoring in anything besides nursing or music. The choir situation is cult like and there is not heavy variation in the type of songs you sing. The college was portrayed in an excepting and full of possibilities light, but does not meet those ideals. I met some of the most close minded people here, who refused to listen to opposing views or have thoughtful discussion. Not a place that helps you grow your ideas or expand your knowledge of the world, rather a sheltered bubble where students just pretend for 4 years that they are worldly. If you are looking for a one minded student body with no opposing view points this is your college."
College Freshman,2,"I knew before I came that I had made the wrong choice. It was just a vibe I'd had since the beginning. You have to trust your gut. The school is beautiful, breathtaking campus, good teachers.... BUT the student body is a nightmare. The music groups are like cult-like cliques. You will not be accepted here unless you are very involved in the music departments. People just kinda suck. Very odd bunch of kids. The school runs around them. UNLESS YOU'RE 100% sure this is the right place for you...DO NOT GO. Luther did not meet their quota last year & by the time I withdrew this year 15 kids had already left for the weekend and never come back. Approx 60% of people who leave Luther leave within the first 2-3 weeks because they realize their mistake in coming here once they arrive.(a counselor there gave me that number) Decorah is tiny. There is nothing to do. You're miles and miles away from any kind of public transport. You are very trapped. OH AND THIS IS IMPORTANT-- the reason I left: A lot of the classes are ""Luther Specific"" and WILL NOT transfer. Paideia isn't accepted anywhere. So don't even try. Most 4 credit classes that will transfer, only transfer as 2-3 credits because it is well known that Luther hands out credits. Other universities tend to not trust their classes. Nearly everyone is studying music in some sense. Other majors are not given as much attention. No diversity what-so-ever. Everyone is from Iowa, Minnesota, or Wisconsin. Couple Illinois people. Lots of VERY VERY religious people. Also quite of few unaccepting people... Homophobes & racists. Not as liberal as you might think. So long story short. IF YOU DO NOT KNOW IF YOU WANT TO SPEND 4 YEARS HERE-- DO NOT ATTEND. Out of 16 credits.. only 8 would transfer for me. So be careful. No hate. I'm just trying to be honest so I can save someone out there time and money."
College Senior,2,"The dining services at Luther really nickles and dimes you. I think it is absolutely ridiculous that I pay a flat fee for dining when I know I only use a fraction of that cost. Essentially, my money adds direct profit to the bottom line because I am sure that I do not make up the amount I pay in even cost of goods. It should be a tiered system in which I can choose a lower plan in order to best fit my eating style. I also hate that the cafeteria is the only place I can go to that has any sort of healthy food once Oneota Market is closed for the day. The Caf may have healthier food, but it is so bland and poorly cooked. Marty's on the other hand has terrible service, but the food is decent, just unhealthy. Luther could do with a major overhaul of their system to benefit the STUDENTS, not Sodexo."
College Freshman,2,"There are not enough choices, but there are a couple of good places."
College Freshman,2,The not being able to live off campus is a real hassle.
College Freshman,2,They withdrew some of the scholarships they were going to give me because i did not agree to the award letter.
College Freshman,2,Its always cold. Which makes it hard to do stuff during the school year.
College Senior,2,"School policies are a joke and often ras will not uphold them. Easy to get away with a lot. Spo cops are the worst, only there to give parking tickets and probably over paid"
College Junior,2,"The current dining system of meal plans and dining dollars is attempting to get students to eat in the cafeteria, while also cutting hours the cafeteria is open.  It does not work well for people who can't get to the cafeteria during times it's open and many students end up with an abundance of meals left at the end of the semester which can not be transfered over to the next semester, paid back to the student, or put as interest into next semester's costs."
College Junior,2,"There is a bus service which stops in major mid-western cities, but it is somewhat pricey and not always reliable."
College Junior,2,"I've held an internship with my state health department.  Eight hour days, five days a week at $12 an hour."
College Junior,2,Too many parking tickets! Its not always obvious where students can and cannot park and at what times and our security loves to ticket people and the prices of those tickets are ridiculous!
College Sophomore,2,"I would say, for the mid-west, it's very average. Ethnic diversity is present, but not a great percentage. Many people come from Minnesota, Iowa, and Wisconsin. This does limit the range of economic background too, because people don't come from very far, they can't necessarily afford it, but because it's private, you either need a lot of aid, which Luther gives, or you have to be decently well off."
College Sophomore,2,"I have not lived off-campus at this college, for I just finished my freshman year. I have been to quite a few off-campus houses and have seen what is available though. I do not know anything when it comes to cost or how the landlords are, but the houses seen fairly close to campus and are in overall good shape."
College Freshman,2,"Luther College emphasises the use on on-campus housing in their schooling. Off-campus housing is possible through the college, but is discouraged."
Senior,1,"If you are a student of color, an LGBTQIA+ student, or a student with a disability, DO NOT ATTEND. This college is fraught with rug-sweeping. They will not listen to you. They will dehumanize you. But thank GOD for the annual Luther gift or the free pizza night once in a blue moon."
Freshman,1,"The college overall is alright. I would only consider coming here if you're interested in music or nursing. Also if you're a person of LatinX background I wouldn't even bother coming here. Luther claims to be diverse when in reality they are not. They don't even do a good job of providing first-year students with diverse Resident Assistants. Horrible for people who feel out of place. In ylvisaker, there are only white male RAs, no Latinx person insight. You think especially in a first-year hall they would attempt to make first-year students comfotrable."
College Senior,1,You have to get pre-approved to live off campus and you only can if you are a senior.
College Sophomore,1,Winter weather is the worst. If you don't like the cold or the snow I probably wouldn't go here.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Luther has more than it's fair share of a-hole professors,   and even more ivory tower than the state schools."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I watched a classmate and friend at Luther be told ""you better watch out black boy"".      I will never ever forget that, or a dozen other incidents.     Luther, in my opinion,  is strictly ""whites only.""    

BTW, you can google Luther College and the term ""black face"",  more than a few of their students have a disrespectful attitude toward people of color.   

"
Recent Alumnus,1,"Locals are typical small-town, white Iowa racists and bigots.  Having spent 4 years at Luther, in my experience I felt  non-whites were not welcome either in Decorah or at Luther,  avoid this school if you are black, latino or asian!!!"
College Junior,1,"We try really hard to get international students and there is a pretty large contingent of them on campus, but it is still mostly just a bunch of middle class white students from the midwest. There is not a lot of ethnic, racial or economic diversity on campus, even though the college likes to say that there is."
College Sophomore,1,"Due to the fact it is a private school and the enrollment is low, there is not a ton of Greek life at Luther, but there is a decent amount. Due to the fact I have not attempted to enter a sorority I wouldn't know much about it."
College Freshman,1,It is definitely not the kind of Greek life that would be observed at other colleges and it is basically non-existent. There are a couple of groups but its mostly for doing ridiculous things or for the social element rather than anything scholarly or to help the community. It could use some improvement and structure.
College Freshman,1,"Very few places for students to park, and most places students can park are far away from the center of campus. LOTS OF WALKING. Although it's relatively easy to park next to the gym, Farwell, or Olsen."
College Senior,1,"Not So Much – there's a couple sororities worth mentioning, not any frats. The best greek life are the groups who lost their college charter and are underground, such as the best frat."

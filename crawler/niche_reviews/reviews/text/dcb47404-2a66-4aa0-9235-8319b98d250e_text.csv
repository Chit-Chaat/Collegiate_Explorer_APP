Freshman,5,Havenâ€™t started classes yet  just now enrolled in online paralegal bachelors program starting November 27 2018
Senior,5,"The program is rigorous, with a workload comparable to any brick and mortar school. Most of the professors are top notch, and have or are currently working within the field they are teaching, meaning, law classes are taught by practicing or retired lawyers, accounting by accountants, IT by IT professionals, etc. This has made this experience well worth the price of admission. Whether I go on to work in a law firm or continue working in the field of taxes and accounting, the education I've received here has made a positive impact on my life and been well worth the time and money to attend."
College Junior,5,Job assistance once you graduate
College Junior,5,I have had no issues and everyone is helpful
College Senior,5,Most students attend the lectures as I do and actively participate with class discussions.  The professors are very knowledgeable and always keep the lectures fun and informative.
College Freshman,5,"As stated previously in another answer, the most unique feature is the courseware. The workload is flexible for even a busy adult to be able to devote time to their studies. If you can't attend a lecture, there are other options to receiving credit for participation/interaction. Registration process was smooth and if you're unsure about enrolling, you can request more information and receive a free two-week trial at no obligation. During the free trial you can see what it is like within the classroom and courseware. Professors are great and are available by email, some are also available by phone. In every lecture that I've attended there has always been an element of surprise/fun that makes it worthwhile. In the interactive classrooms, you can private message another student and exchange information for contact outside of the classroom."
College Freshman,5,"One of the greatest aspects of the school is the courseware. Courseware is offered for online reading with the capability to print it yourself for offline reading as well as to purchase from the ""bookstore"" instead of printing it out yourself. Courseware is included in the cost of tuition and is available for the majority of courses. Several courses do require books, however, you are allowed to purchase/rent from sources of your choosing as the school's ""bookstore"" only offers printed version of the courseware. Internship opportunities can be coordinated but will not be offered at the school. Job placement is also offered but is similar to internship opportunities in the sense that it will not be offered at the school."
College Freshman,5,"Class registration is simple and is completed by contacting the admissions office upon being accepted into the college. To be full-time you will be required to take two courses at a time. The professors are great and are available through email and some through phone. The professors are well-educated and experienced within the field of law. So far, the professors have been very personable and approachable, even quite humorous. The college is a member of NALA and offers a free preparation course for the CLA/CP exams to students and alumni."
College Freshman,5,"All the courses are offered online. You are given several choices to choose from when you enroll and are allowed to choose your own courses, although it is highly recommended that you take the core courses first. You are even given a ""free"" introductory course with no time limit and all you have to do is read and take the exam; it is a pass/fail course. There are weekly lectures twice a week in which participation/interaction credit is given if you attend. If not, submitting an exam or answering the weekly interaction questions will also give you participation/interaction credit."
College Freshman,5,This school definitely requires self-discipline even amidst its flexibility. You are not given reminders to attend lectures or to complete your assignments/exams. It has definitely challenged me to develop greater self-discipline and I am learning a lot from my readings and professors who are experienced in the legal field.
College Freshman,5,"When I first contacted the college, they were very forward with the fees and costs of attendance. I was worried that I would not have enough financial aid to attend, they assured me that they would let me know if anything was amiss and would not allow me to start classes if I did not have enough financial aid."
College Senior,5,It is a great school experience all around
College Senior,5,This is an online college experience. We have access to Lexis and are taught how to research on the internet.
College Senior,5,"excellent online lectures

teachers are accessible

the learning experience is enjoyable

teachers are fair"
College Senior,5,The teachers have a positive sense of humor. They also are willing to stay after class and answer everyones question.
College Senior,5,"All classes are online, we do not attend classes on a campus."
College Senior,5,"The classes are challenging, teaching everything that you would possibly need to know to enter the field. I think the price for the courses are fair for what they are teaching you. The teachers are always there to help you if you have questions."
Freshman,4,"Great at keeping in contact via phone or email. very willing to help answer any questions. online schooling so it fits whatever schedule you have! i'm a mom of two and work nights, so it fits great for me!"
Senior,4,I love the coursework of NPC and the fact that the professors are either active lawyers or retired lawyers and often work in the field that the class is in. A lot of the classes are in the evening which makes it better for someone who works. The professors and graders get back to you in a timely manner and they assign you a student mentor who will help you with assignments. The courses are on par with a brick and mortar and the accelerated pace makes you think. The assignments and exams are very real life based with real life applications.
Recent Alumnus,4,I have graduated and would like to return but the funds are not that easy to come up with for tuition.
College Senior,4,"I would chose this school again  believe I have learned a lot here, but its been a long, hard road in order to do that."
College Senior,4,"Class size averages about 35-50 students.  This can sometimes get hectic during lectures when some of the more ""chatty"" students like to take over the discussions.  Most professors will clear the chat when its getting overran."
College Senior,4,"The recruiting to this college was pretty much non-existent.  I researched the college on my own and called each time I had a question.  I was looking at about 5 different colleges when I chose this one, but overall I am happy with my choice."
College Senior,4,The workload is pretty intense!  Tests are always given in essay format and have ten questions on them.  Each class requires five fairly long written assignments and three exams throughout as well as regular attendance with the lectures to pass.  I do feel like the standard is pretty high to achieve a high grade and maintain the grade throughout the program.
College Senior,4,This is a for profit college I am attending.  The cost was pretty comparable to other on-line paralegal programs I checked into.
College Senior,4,Most of the students attending this program have plans to attend law school once completing this program.
College Senior,4,"The curriculum is great, the work load is pretty intense, but you have to be prepared to work as a paralegal.  Other students have also taken an initiative to begin study groups and outside groups via face book."
College Senior,4,I have worked very hard for the scores I make.
College Senior,4,Currently I attend classes on-line.  The staff and professor's are very knowledgeable and eager to assist when I call or ask a question.  For the past three years I have attended this college taking three classes each term.  The program for the degree in legal studies is very intense and I feel prepared for continuing with my master's degree as my final destination.
Graduate Student,2,"erified that the student is part of the school for other benefits that would be free to the student to help them out while in the program. National Paralegal need to have a VPN establish for other student taking government courses and learning for free, I noticed when doing research that other online schools had VPN for there students its part of the program, I say this because someone had their computer attached to mine while I was studying online for my degree. National Paralegal College need have a communication. I have study online previous before attending this college and the other school I never had an online problem of hacking, but it was not government information."
Senior,2,"Teachers are good, but you deal with the admissions office for everything and they aren't very helpful. Currently locked out of the website and losing points in the classes that I am taking and already paid for because I haven't signed up for next year's classes yet. And of course no one will answer the phones."
Graduate Student,1,"It is a TOTAL RIP-OFF. All the ""National Paralegal College"" is doing is exploiting the federal guaranteed student loan program.

It costs $13k and the degree is USELESS.  I graduated from NPC and I know ONE person that got a paralegal job (and that was only because she spoke Spanish).

The problem is that there are millions of people with four year university degrees  seeking paralegal jobs.

A HUUUUGE WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!"

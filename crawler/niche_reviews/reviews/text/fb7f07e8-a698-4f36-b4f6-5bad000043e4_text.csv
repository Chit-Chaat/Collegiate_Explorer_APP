Sophomore,5,"Did not have to take online courses as of yet.  They are still into full classes, physical attendance and participation."
Sophomore,5,"This is a well ran University, I am very comfortable here and is learning a lot about the culture, policy and procedures."
Junior,5,Quincy University has such a great atmosphere. The campus is beautiful. The classroom sizes are perfect.
Senior,5,Quincy University is a small private university. The main goal for professors is to have students achieve academically and fro to further knowledge for their intended career. Students and faculty at this university are very close due to the small size. The atmosphere at QU really feels like home.
Senior,5,The teachers here are very knowledgeable and personable. My only complaint is that office staff can be very slow when getting back to you about inquiries.
Alum,5,Quincy University is the best choice for someone looking for a personal learning experience.  Faculty is willing and available to work with each student one on one and the class sizes don't make you feel lost in a crown.  The aviation program is relatively cheap compared to other schools in Illinois and the instructors are usually program born. Overall great school in a gem of a city.
Freshman,5,My sister and dad went to QU they loved it. I am excited to attend as a freshman in the fall to follow there footsteps.
Senior,5,"Best schook to offer, especially for a single mother taking on het Bachelors! 
Great teachers and great classes! 
Thank you QU!"
Niche User,5,"Quincy University has small beautiful campus and honestly, I like that. The experience that the staff had shared with me while I was touring the university was absolutely great. I really enjoyed every moment on my visit and I hope this will be my next school!"
Freshman,5,"Quincy is a small school with a small population. Student to faculty ratio is good, many majors to choose from, and a quality campus life experience."
Alum,5,Attending Quincy was a great decision! They professors there really work with you and want to see you succeed! It was a great school and I'm happy to be part of the alum!
Senior,5,"Quincy University opened the door for me to rediscover myself as a student, leader, and person through many rewarding experiences.  The entrepreneurship club, mission trips, and student sports broadcasting opportunities all served as building blocks for my growth in my four years on campus.  I would highly recommend attending QU."
Freshman,5,Overall this school has been good. I hope it continues to be through out the rest of my time here. I really like how it is easy to make friends with your class and the upper class mates. I would change how the weekends are because they told my parents that they would have a bunch of things for us to do on the weekends but there hasn't been much. All I have heard about is the intermural events but that's on Sunday at five so at that time a lot of people can't go or be involved with it because of homework and the fact that dinner is at that time.
College Freshman,5,I never hear of anyone getting hurt and security is quick to respond to any issue.
College Freshman,5,The sports teams are good and the school spirit around them is great as well.
College Freshman,5,"Our campus security is by far the best I've seen. They are always there making sure we are in a safe environment. If we need them to escort us, they are only a quick call away"
College Freshman,5,One of my worst subjects is History. I was really worried about how I'd do in that class and how the professor would be. I was quite shocked to see how well the professor helped me understand the material I had to know. The way she presented the material really helped me to remember it and advance myself in the work.
College Freshman,5,"I come from a smaller town than Quincy, so it's size is easy to adjust to for me. I love the size of the classes and how the professors know all of our names and genuinely care about our future. We have a local phrase of ""It's a Q thing"" that we all laugh about. My school is truely a match for me and I'd choose it again in a heartbeat."
College Junior,5,I feel safe in the town of Quincy and on campus. We have 24 hour accessible security.
College Junior,5,"I have many opportunities for practicum hours, and there seems to be lots of jobs for interpreters after graduation."
Sophomore,4,"I love Quincy University because, despite its small size, it truly did give me the entire college experience in my first year there. They were sure to get people involved on campus and there was always some type of event happening. The small-town feel really comes across when you live on campus and it was super easy to make friends. The only thing I found myself disliking was the state of the dorms. The freshman dorm was slightly outdated and while I was there, we experienced some problems with the building itself. Though this year COVID-19 did send many students home, Quincy University still maintained on-campus housing for those who needed it and made sure we all were well informed about what actions they were taking to ensure safety. They handled it very well."
Sophomore,4,"For the last half of the Spring semester, classes were entirely online. All of my teachers were very clear about their own hesitations about moving to the online platform in the wake of the pandemic, however, each of them made sure to keep communication open as they made the transition. Overall, it ended up working extremely well. The teachers took the feedback to make the classes easier for not only the students but for them as well. I do not think there was much more that any of my teachers could have done to make it any better for those involved than what they did. They managed to successfully teach us the material as well as making it extremely easy for us to voice our concerns regarding their classes."
Sophomore,4,The environment and community of QU is very welcoming and open. The professors make it known that if you need something they will help so that you can succeed. The one thing I would change about the school is to redo the campus housing.
Sophomore,4,"I like the location and size of the school! The faculty and staff are very supportive and nice, as well. I have a hard time being on a sports team here as there is not very much support."
Freshman,4,"Quincy University offers multiple different majors for students. As an NCAA Division 2 school, our athletics provide students with a great on the field/court learning experience in which each student athlete can learn in every day life (hard-work, determination, effort). The on campus student life is very outstanding. The campus is very warm and welcoming and there is never a moment of boredom- there is always something to do on campus! Around campus there is multiple bars and restaurants in case a student isn't feeling up for our Cafe. Campus security is ALWAYS available at any time of the day which makes the campus life more reassuring and enjoyable."
Sophomore,4,I would like to see more activities that are commuter friendly. Also maybe more gathering areas for study groups.
Sophomore,4,I wish that the financial aid office was more helpful. Some of the professors are not very open to talk to or they don't explain things very well. There should be more events that get us student to be more active in our community.
Sophomore,4,"Quincy University is an amazing school in a great small location in Adams County. Not a day goes bye without enjoying a nice sporting event, hanging out with friends, or meeting a new friend.  Quincy University is a top notch school when it comes to education. This is the reason why Quincy excels at academics. The hands on training at Quincy is superb. Every teacher cares and wants to help each student be the best at what they want to be in life. That is what makes Quincy so great, everybody's on one page and have the same goal to be the best student, to be the teacher,  to be the best athlete to be the best period. That's what makes Quincy...... Quincy."
Junior,4,I like how everyone is treated like family and that they value this trait very highly. The Athletics program is top notch and always great to watch. Made a good friends there as well.
Alum,4,I had a great experience at QU. I stayed on campus all 4 years of undergrad. I can truly say I have met some amazing people and life long friends. The professors are more than helpful and understanding; it's very rare that you run into a professor that isn't approachable or uncaring about students success. The only downfall about QU is how expensive it is each year; however they do have scholarship to help.
Senior,4,Well Quincy University has a great business program start. The university also makes you feel welcome in a family style atmosphere. It also has great athletic teams who are also academically stout.
Sophomore,4,"Quincy University has been such a great environment to get involved, make friends, and to get my higher education. The campus is a place where everyone knows each other, and the people and faculty genuinely care about the students. It is a place where you get to be on a first name basis with the cafeteria workers and all the heads of the different departments. The campus is small, which always brings comfort because you can walk through and see all the buildings around and most likely run into a few friends on the way to class. While it gets a reputation for being boring sometimes, the students know how to make the best of their experience here, and as long as the student makes the most of what they have, they will have fun everyday here."
Sophomore,4,"Coming to Quincy helped shape me into the person I am today. I've made life long friends, have trusted relationships with my professors and am enjoying my major classes as the semesters go on. "
Junior,4,"I have so far very much enjoyed my time here at QU. The professors I primarily deal with are in the political science, philosophy, and criminal justice departments and they are all so helpful! I only gave 4 out of 5 because I seem to always have trouble with the people working in the registrar and the business office, but everything else is great. "
College Sophomore,4,Quincy has a great production of kids to get great jobs once they graduate
College Sophomore,4,"Quincy is basically an athletes school since majority of the population all play some varsity sport. That being said, the school spirit is amazing and we all look to cheer each other on. Certain games create a great atmosphere and the campus can go nuts if a win is the outcome."
College Sophomore,4,The athletic facilities are beautiful!!! The individual sports teams could use improvements to their locker rooms however the fields and courts are all kept in good condition.  Any student has access to space to play their desired sport on a regular basis.
College Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love being a music major at Quincy University!!!  The professors are extremely kind and helpful.  They will always take time out of their day to talk to a student.  The school is expensive, however you can take up to 18 credit hours for the same price.  If you are in the honors program you can take more without additional costs.  They keep their students active.  School spirit is very high and sports teams are fun to support."
College Freshman,4,"Class sizes are great because I feel comfortable asking questions and there are many discussions during class. I feel close with most of my professors, but some do not care about my success."
College Freshman,4,Career center is great on campus. Most anyone is willing to help.
College Freshman,4,Good workout center and free classes for students
College Freshman,4,I love the professors. They are all creative and make material interesting. I don't like the party atmosphere on weekends. I don't like to party.
College Freshman,4,Most areas have great succes whereas a pre-med student may find themselves having trouble getting into a med school.
College Freshman,4,The proffesors truly care whether you pass and put themselves out there to help you if you ask for it.
College Freshman,4,I dont live in them but visit them frquently and they seem to be in nice condition.
College Freshman,4,I wouldnt know but it seems to be nice from what I have heard.
College Freshman,4,Great community around it but isnt quite as diverse as some other colleges are.
College Freshman,4,"Being a part of Greek life is truly a great opportunity. We are trying to change the way we are seen on a constant basis. We are constantly thinking of ways to give back to the community, whether it's from service hours or generous donations, we truly are trying to serve for the betterment of out community. Being a Phi Sig has truly changed my outlook on Greek life and I know that we aren't just a joke. We need to be taken seriously for our efforts. We are not a party sorority that gets drunk every weekend. We take our academics seriously and strive to be the best in our class."
College Freshman,4,"Since a majority of the students participate in a sport, our school is quite supportive of each sport. We all come together and cheer each other on. We recruit athletes from all over the United States and even some from foreign countries. No matter our differences, we all support each other and strive to be the best."
College Freshman,4,There is an on campus nurse ready to assist those who need medicine or injuries. Extremely helpful and security is always on duty around the campus on surveillance.
College Freshman,4,Depending on where you want to get a career they are easy to get. Campus hires recently graduated alumni as well if looking for a job straight out of college.
College Freshman,4,The professors and classes are great. They are easy to understand and access. Not too far from the forms either.
College Freshman,4,Quincy offers good programs and most likely will be the least expensive school to attend on your least of other schools.
College Junior,4,"Dorms need to be renovated, but are adequate"
College Junior,4,Good service and community involvement from Greeks
College Junior,4,"The sports don't have the best performance, but good support from the school and students"
College Senior,4,My major is so unique that we'll all get jobs. Some people aren't so lucky.
College Freshman,4,I love all the resources they have here. The money is extreamly tight though and makes for stress and anxiety not knowing if ill be able to find the money to cover tuition.
College Junior,4,The athletic facilities are great.
College Freshman,4,Lots of majors and places to study
College Freshman,4,Lots of computers and plenty of printing money given
College Sophomore,4,"I feel very safe at this school. Sometimes I don't like walking alone at night, but we have very little crime. "
College Sophomore,4,"The gym is newer and has pretty nice equipment. There are quite a few people from the community that workout at our gym. Some people go to the sports games, but not a huge amount. There isn't much school spirit. "
College Junior,4,"We have two sororities, one fraternity, with several academic and honorary fraternities as well. We have tons of sports and clubs. There is almost always something going on. Meetings are held every night. Events are happening every weekend. We also have a great policy of creating your own clubs and such. We just had a few people start a Creativity Club and a Paint Ball Club. If we don't already have it, all you have to do is get a group of people who want to do it and sign them up!"
College Junior,4,"Our security is everywhere. They are at every event, patrol every day and night, stop by every party, and take care of everything they need to. I feel extremely safe on campus. We recently just put in new locks for our dorms where a magnetic strip in our student ID allows us access instead of having extra keys. It has really cut down on people borrowing keys and others losing them and all around keeping us way safer."
College Junior,4,We have an integrated nursing program with the local hospital. Our music department is renovating for a brand new recording and producing studio. Our theater department is offering student writers changes to perform their own work. Our Business degree is great. We have a great school community. We are one of few schools in the area to have a Kappa Kappa Psi (the Honorary Band Fraternity) chapter.
College Junior,4,We have people who offer great deals for students. The houses are on the same block as the school or at least walking distance. It is a safe neighborhood surrounding schools and churches. The houses are definitely worth the price. They are cheaper than living on campus and students can still use their meal plans if they want to eat on campus. It is actually pretty easy to find a house or at least a room near campus to rent.
College Freshman,4,everything is within walking distance and there are numerous people to help you if you have questions. also the quincy university website has most of the information you will ever need.
College Freshman,4,They have buses all the time to get you from place to place.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Quincy is very rich in dining options. Maybe too rich. There are a lot of chain restaurants, and some smaller individually operated eateries. Whatever your taste may be, it won't be difficult to find a good place to eat. If nothing else, and your on a budget, there are a lot of cheaper grocery stores for those seeking to save on coupons or eating at home."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The campus security were sufficient. Luckily, our town was small enough so as to not give unsafe feelings or lots of crime. The crime rate on campus was low, with little to no thefts or burglaries, and even fewer violent crimes."
College Freshman,4,"Majoring in sciences, chemistry and biology in my case, takes a lot of effort. However, Quincy University provides many opportunities for outside help. Tutoring, study sessions, and review sessions are a courtesy provided for us students."
College Sophomore,4,"I always find a parking spot, the permit for parking is free, and you dont really NEED a car, you just will want one to get to Walmart faster than the bus"
College Sophomore,4,"Drinking is the most popular activity, it is not too often i see people smoking."
College Sophomore,4,"It's about average for any small school. There's a ton of athletes, but there's a lot of average to geeky people too. There's a lot of preppy boys and girls. We're all mostly from Illinois, so we're used to farm towns, but then there's the ones from Chicago who don't know a mule from a donkey. It's a good mixture."
College Freshman,4,"There is a wide variety of places to eat. There is sit down restaurants that are not part of a chain like Applebee's, but there is also chain restaurants too. Some of the places are town-based only, where they are only here in Quincy. Then you have the fast food places."
College Freshman,4,"Eating out is expensive everywhere, but we like Qdoba and El Ranche rito for Mexican, 1/2 price pizz night at the Tower of Pizza and HyVee for chinese food.  These are all very close to the campus--but not in walking distance."
College Freshman,4,"I hang out with the athletes as I am a member of the volleyball team.  All sports teams are very supportive of each other regardless of sport and gender.  Dress is casual and hanging out at the Hawks Nest is fun!  There is a wide variety of activities to participate in if you have the time to...between laundry, studying and going to class that is!"
College Freshman,4,Transportation is really good. They have buses running all the time.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the dorms only thing that makes it not an A+ is some of the people that live there but nothing you can really do about it
Freshman,2,QU is very overpriced.  Some of the facilities need to be updated or remodeled.  The university is strictly an athletes school.  There are very few non-athletes around.  Some students regret coming here and end up transferring.
College Senior,2,"We pay all this money for housing & the buildings are all awdul, except for the freshman buildings and the SLC."
College Sophomore,2,"The dining options off campus are mainly just regular fast food. However, most restaurants are closed by 11pm here, for some reason. Taco Bell and Dominoes are open until 1am and Hardees 24/7. But other than that, I'm not sure there are any other late night options. I know Dominoes runs some QU discounts, but they're not frequent."
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not a party-attender, but living on campus where parties take place is definitely not a great experience if you're anything like me and working most of the time you're not in class. The noise is obnoxious as are the drunk people. Others may argue it's fun and such but for me at least it's just a nuisance."
College Sophomore,2,"There is very little to do in Quincy. It is two hours from St. Louis, but it can get boring being in Quincy for too long. "
College Sophomore,2,It is not a very lively town. There is one club and several dumpy bars. Most nightlife happens at house parties near campus.
College Sophomore,2,"There are two places on campus to get food. The cafeteria is one and I hate eating there. The food generally tastes pretty bland and you do not stay full very long. There is also the UC where you can stand in line and they make your food either at the cold bar where they have sandwiches and wraps or at the hot bar where you can get burgers, chicken strips, phillies. The UC also has some snacks and drinks, but mostly chips and candy bars. "
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life doesn't have a big influence in our school. I don't ever hear about Greek life doing much around campus; there isn't very many students in our fraternities or sororities, but the people I know that are in them are very nice. I know that our Greek life is always looking for more people to join."
College Sophomore,2,"Little theatre, blues in the park, HS sports, mall, strip mall, St. Louis is only 2 hours away."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The food midly scanty, and somewhat expensive. The only good option is the cafeteria food, but even that becomes a matter of selective shopping for what is on the menu that day. I was altogether not impressed by the on-campus food options. The two main places are either expensive, crowded, or just plain not appealing on most days."
College Freshman,2,At QU there are mainly 2 different races and a couple students of different races. It doesn't matter their race everyone gets accepted by other students. I rarely see students not getting accepted by a group of other students.
College Freshman,2,Police are rarely called to campus.  We are a NCAA division II school so of course there are rules the athletes have to follow to remain eligible.
College Freshman,2,Quincy University does not have a great physical therapy program.  The workload is heavy and the classes are challenging. Teachers are willing to help during office hours but hours are not efficient to students who have general education classes.
College Freshman,2,"Night Life – Anywhere that there is to go for parties or bars and such are all within walking distance from campus; most are actually directly across the street from the school. Parties usually don't got to big, cops barley come to shut them down. The bars are pretty cheep with amazing specials and the local club plays pretty good music to dance too. Most people don't dress up or anything, just regular day to day clothes."
College Junior,2,Parking is very limited.  Most of the time you park on the street because there are no spots available.
College Freshman,2,"Computers at Quincy University are like most computers at other schools; the computers are in a computer lab and are used by students that attend Quincy University. There is WiFi all over camps;therefore, students barely use the computer labs because they have their own laptops. The printing is not free and sometimes the printer has errors which makes it impossible to print papers without getting the problem fixed. All in all, Quincy University computers are like other computers at different schools."
College Freshman,2,"Its mediocure feels like high school, never can sustain a good party."
College Junior,2,"It's Black and White – There is a good mix of black and white students, but not many other races are represented. There are few Asians and Latinos. There are not many students from other countries."
College Junior,2,There Are Always Problems – The financial aid office is very inefficient. They tend not to tell you when your grants have mysteriously been taken away and you don't find out until you can't register for classes because you still owe the University $3000.
Alum,1,The place is about as catholic as a gas station. Students steal from surrounding  neighborhoods  as well as vandalize private property.  So it's no wonder the the neighborhoods are unfriendly or helpful to the  students. It is a godless university that pretends and hides behind the cross that means nothing to them.
Junior,1,"""It's a QU thing"" whenever something goes wrong. Bats in the dorms? Printers broken? Bathroom smells moldy? 
They give out lots of money, but it's not worth it. I stayed for a year and transferred; I had a free ride and it wasn't worth it.

I was a secondary ed major and the program is pretty much all elem. ed. They got rid of majors and didn't tell the students already enrolled IN those majors. Technology is outdated. People cheat all the time and don't care. Library hasn't seen a real update since the sixties, when it was built. Go upstairs on your tour; in some spots the carpet CRUNCHES when you walk on it. The librarians are mad because they had to throw away books a few years ago and they can't buy books. Mission trips the students have to pay for, but the athletes? Everything is covered, even though no ones winning anything. Police come on campus, they DO NOT put it on the website, the idea the campus is a safe one is a LIE. Baseball team calls their house the 'r*pe cave'."
Freshman,1,"Most of our student population plays some type of sport here. However, most of our teams have had losing and even embarrassingly bad records this year.
 The night lifeis always the same, starts super late, and is always held at a football or baseball house. The bars are boring and unappealing to college kids. Since the vast majority of the student population plays a sport, due to the 48 hour rule and saturday games, nothing happens on fridays during any season.The dorms suck; they are all very old and outdated. I currently live in Garner hall, and we have a mouse problem. Friars hall has bats. Campus security is psycho, so attempt to follow the rules in the dorms as much as possible.  In conclusion, if you enjoy a microscopic sized student population, failing athletic programs, old and ugly buildings, boring and repetitive night life, hardly edible food and pest problems, Quincy University is the school for you!"
College Sophomore,1,"QU only allows you to live off campus if you A) are from the area originally, B) are a transfer student, or C) are a senior of good standing. If you do not meet these requirements, it is a huge battle for no better reason than ""they want your money"". If they discover you are lying about your place of residence and living off campus without permission they can take away financial aid."
College Sophomore,1,"The freshman dorms are the second best dorms on campus- every affordable option for upperclassmen is not only disappointing but the bare minimum of ""liveable."" The building lacks central air/ventilation, the heat is out half the time, and there are few outlets in the room (none of which are guaranteed to work). The main building has one elevator, which has been outdated and due for a new inspection since Oct. 31, 2014. The food is disgusting, the meal plans are highly over priced."
College Freshman,1,Literally they live like animals. This place is a s*** hole.
College Freshman,1,"There is 2 main parking lots for students, lot C and D. Lot C is the bigger lot out of the two but its a little ways from the freshman dorms so during bad weather no one wants to walk to it.  Lot D on the other-hand is too small.  Students are having to park on the road and that is not safe for students to get in/out of their cars."
College Freshman,1,After a while you tired of eating the same food everyday.
College Freshman,1,"Not Much – Quincy gives away a lot of scholarship money because it lacks everything else. I feel I got more of an education taking all AP classes in a public Chicago high school than I have here. The facilities close at 11 p.m. or midnight so it is difficult to get to anything late at night. If you're a music student, forget it! All of the music equipment is at a separate campus that you cannot reach unless you go by car."
College Freshman,1,"No Car, No Fun. It's hard to get anywhere in Quincy without a car. Walgreens is the closest store, but even that is a bit of a trek. There are buses (mini buses) that run throughout the town, but the schedules are hard to follow."
College Senior,1,Meth Labs Rampant – Parents be advised that there is a heavy meth presence in the community.  Q.U. campus is a few short blocks from a very troubled low income area in Quincy. Meth and other drugs are readily available in the community.
College Senior,1,"Not a Good Expierience – Q.U..

The location is nice, and that's really the only positive thing I can say about Quincy University. Q.U. has a reputation of not accepting accountability for the negligence of its staff in respect to proper guidance and advisement of students. The staff does a poor job communicating to students and share relevant information necessary to ensure student success in their programs. 

Buyers beware, you may pay for services which you may or may not receive from this school. Unfortunately if you get burned, you're just out of luck, time, and money. You can expect no advocate to assist you if you have a bad situation occur while a student here. If it comes down to your word versus a staff member, you are out of luck.

ATTENTION Armed Forces Veterans: This school is not a veteran friendly facility, and was not listed in the 2010-11 G.I. Jobs list for veteran friendly schools (for good reason). If you are considering attending Q.U., I strongly urge you to execute an ""about face, forward march"", or better yet ""double time"" away from this college. You are better off to seek your education elsewhere. You will thank me later. 

I would not recommend attending this school. You would be better off flushing about 40K down the toilet for what you would receive attending Q.U. 

I would recommend Western Illinois University, or Hannibal - Lagrange College, if seeking an education in this area. Those are reputable institutions with favorable reviews, and both are veteran friendly.

Good luck in your search for colleges. Hope this review helps."
College Freshman,1,greeks suck at quincy there is no variety and cost an arm and a leg. They really don't show their faces other than in their fundraisers.They have one house per greek life association.
College Sophomore,1,"Robbed on Site – There are various food places on the strip of broadway but for us college students none stay open late enough for us except hardee's. Honestly, We Are All sick of Hardee's!!"
College Freshman,1,Ther  is a shuttle service that takes students from the main campus to the north campus. This is all the shuttle does. It does not take you off campus or anything.

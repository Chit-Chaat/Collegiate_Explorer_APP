Sophomore,5,"I love my college. It is a small college, but that makes it easy to get to know your classmates and professors. You will find your place here"
Freshman,5,Have nit taken online classes here yet. But through the COVID pandemic they stayed connected with us a great deal.
Freshman,5,My overall experience with roger williams has been pleasant. I would like to see more opportunity in morning classes.
Junior,5,"My experience at Roger Williams University has been very memorable. I just finished my sophomore year, going into my junior year abroad in Italy. I have met so many wonderful friends that I know will last a lifetime. I have also attended multiple events throughout campus, as well as sports games. I also really enjoy the law program here at Roger Williams University. I am extremely interested in attending law school after finishing my undergrad. Being apart of the ""Legal Studies"" program has been very beneficial. Especially with the help from wonderful professors."
Junior,5,"This past semester, I took all of my classes online due to Covid-19. It was definitely a struggle, but I made it work. The classes went well and students were allowed more leisure with the workload. Professors were very understanding and helpful throughout this tough time. I did very well this semester having all of my classes online."
Alum,5,"I adored my time at Roger Williams, from academics, to culture, to campus, to location, it was a dream. I left equipped to tackle the challenges ahead of me. College is what you make of it, there will always be those who complain and sweat the small stuff. For me, this school was incredible."
Freshman,5,Everybody is super welcoming and very easy to fit in. The food is unmatched and it is never a bad thing to be walking to class and look out at the water.
Sophomore,5,"An excellent campus! The small class sizes make for a better learning environment. The student body is all highly motivated, the teachers are all caring, and the school itself gives every resource needed!"
Freshman,5,Roger Williams University is a small 4 year college. I love the class sizes because it is not very overwhelming and you get the individualized help you need if you do in fact need it.
Freshman,5,"Roger Williams Universities school communities is strong, but you have to be willing to put yourself out there. The school will not do the work for you, just like in the real world. Roger Williams for me as a black female is a taste of what the business world will be like, white and typically male oriented. Saying that, it gives me the opportunity to find my voice as a women and as a black women."
Freshman,5,They placed me on a floor with a great group that have similar interests. We have a lot of classes together which made the college transition easy
Freshman,5,Everything about this school was perfect for me. I am from Southern Massachusetts and I wanted to stay local but I wanted to also pursue a degree in architecture. Roger Williams fit perfectly. I can commute but I also can be involved on campus and I have met so many friends. I love my major and the facilities provided are incredible.
Freshman,5,Roger Williams University is an amazing private school. The architecture program is one of the most challenging but one of the most rewarding programs at this school. All of the staff at this school make you feel welcomed as if you are part of their family.
Freshman,5,"Great campus with amazing schools. Most of the professors are understanding and nice and good at their subject. Overall, I am looking forward to be here next 4 years"
Freshman,5,"It's been amazing! People here are wonderful and really care about your education. As an international student, I thought I wouldn't fit in, but I found it so easy to make friends and enjoy my time here. There is always something going on around campus which helps you when you are homesick. The food here is amazing and there is a great variety."
Freshman,5,"I love RWU because it is such a welcoming community. Class sizes are small so you get to know your professors, which is great. The food provided is very good and there are many different housing options to fit everyone's needs. The only thing I think I would change would be to  let freshman have cars on campus to make it easier for people who live farther away."
Freshman,5,I really like how beautiful campus is. I also love how the classes always are small and professors are really passionate about teaching. I do find whoever that we do need more diversity.
Sophomore,5,I have had a very good year and a half with Roger. I don't foresee myself transferring as this campus has everything I need. The professors are good and are dedicated to your achievement both in and out of the classroom. Most if not all professors will offer research opportunities or know another professor who would love to do research with you.
Sophomore,5,"The campus at Roger Williams is beautiful and the perfect size if you are not used to going to a huge school. Everyone is very friendly and make you feel very comfortable, especially as a freshman."
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved my 4 years at Roger Williams.  The campus is beyond beautiful and the staff are so welcoming and friendly.  The campus is easy to navigate and the dorms were wonderful.  It was truly a community and an amazing place to live, learn,and grow in."
Freshman,5,"I love the Diversity of the college. When I went to go visit the school I felt like I belong and not out of place. The area is beautiful, they had a lot of clubs which I am excited about. They had all my major which is a huge plus for me. I am excited to move in and get started at Roger Williams."
Sophomore,5,"The location of the school attracted me the most, being near the water. I was so excited about taking classes because there are small class sizes. I am also able to minor in American Sign Langauge which is uncommon. I love the environment of the school with the students and faculty."
Freshman,5,"So far, so good! Deposit made. Housing chosen. Off we go! Everyone we have had the pleasure in dealing with throughout this preliminary period, has been wonderful! Beautiful school...the counselors, professors, and students that have answered questions and done tours, etc., have been outstanding! The N/As below are only because she hasn't started yet, so can't rate at the moment."
Niche User,5,"I have visited the RWU campus numerous times and have never been disappointed. The students and teachers on campus were kind and welcoming, the campus itself provided a safe environment, and facilities were incredible."
Freshman,5,"The school is in a great location. Students are offered many options to stay involved on campus and mingle with each other. Roger Williams also is great at giving back to the community with their freshman year Community Connections day each year, this also gives out of state students a chance to see different parts of Rhode Island. Overall I would say that Roger Williams University is a great place to be for anyone."
Freshman,5,"Roger Williams University is a great school and a great match for me coming out of high school. The food is some of the best college food I have ever had, along with being able to make new friends that I never imagined having. The dorms are average, but doable. The academics are challenging, but I find a way to manage from studying and doing my homework. RWU is a great university and I am looking forward to the next three years here."
Niche User,5,"The campus is absolutely gorgeous, the people are extremely helpful. Went for an accepted students day and was very pleased, they really let you explore the campus the way that best suits you."
Senior,5,"I have found that Roger William's gives a hometown feel, with a wealth of knowledge in many of the majors. A major reason to go would be the connections you make in your time there."
Senior,5,I personally love being at Roger Williams University. It is close to both Newport and Providence. As an adult the night life around town and nearby is always fun.  It's a pretty good fit for me and the faculty are there for me when I need help. I feel like I am getting a proper education. The food at commons is pretty tasty too.
Niche User,5,"Friendly, informative and helpful professors and staff.  The professors make a good effort to be available for students and are available during the noted office hours for advising, etc."
Junior,5,"Roger Williams University has changed my life, such as meeting new people, having new experiences and giving me the education that will help me reach my goal in my career and in life."
Niche User,5,I loved being on campus and can't wait to attend in the fall! this is my top choice school for sure and i can't imagine going anywhere else
Niche User,5,Roger Williams University offers a wonderful hands on Architecture Program. I have been interested in Roger Williams University since I was a sophomore in high school.
Niche User,5,I loved that the architecture Dean knew all of his students and knew exactly what they were working on.
Junior,5,I have had a pretty good experience at Roger Williams. Roger Williams has helped me find myself and create a life that I did not know was possible. It has helped me find my path and get excited for the future. Roger Williams has thoroughly prepared me for my future as I continue to learn every single day.
Junior,5,It's just an all around fun and beautiful school.  Being right on the water helps as well.  Every day is a beach day.
Alum,5,My 6 years at RWU were excellent. The architecture program was incredible. The size of the classes and the campus itself allowed me to focus on my education above everything else.
Senior,5,I love this school! It's gorgeous! There are SO many ways to get involved on campus! I made so many great friends through all of the opportunities that RWU has to offer. Everyone at RWU believes in your future and your success.
Sophomore,5,"My first year at RWU was challenging, memorable and rewarding. Not only did I learn in the classroom but I learned about myself as well. RWU gave me so many opportunities to better myself and advance in my major by allowing me to attend Model UN conferences with my peers which not only allowed me to meet people from many backgrounds but helped me become a better public speaker as well. Experiential learning was something I was thankful to be apart of my first year. For my public administration course, my classmates and I started our own sustainability club to promote environmental awareness. We sought a need for change in the way RWU handled sustainability and believed that as students we could make this change happen. We created something the university never had before and learned about public administration by being administrators in our club. We promoted sustainability which appealed to students and helped start a movement for different preservation efforts on campus."
Sophomore,5,"I love Roger Williams University due to the small campus size, supportive faculty and peers, and the resources they provide.  When I was struggling in a class, professors would always reach out to numerous resources around me and connect me to them, showing they care about the individual student success.  I love the beautiful ocean view and the beautiful facilities around campus as well, so overall a wonderful opportunity and experience!!!"
Senior,5,RWU has been a great environment for the last four years- there are so much needed improvements on diversity inclusion and the CORE curriculum but other than that it is an excellent place to grow and learn
Sophomore,5,"Once you get to the upper levels of classes, the curriculum becomes more challenging, engaging and purposeful! The majority of the professors that I have interacted with here want their students to succeed."
Alum,5,"Fantastic school to attend. All my professors always made time for me and the campus is beautiful. Providence is so close if you want a city night life, and the RIPTA's actually pretty reliable."
Sophomore,5,i love this school. it has been an awesome experience. it is student friendly and i usually get the help i need when it comes to any issues that may arise.
Sophomore,5,I love the school! The small campus environment allows personal connection with professors. It is exactly what I wanted from my University.
Freshman,5,"Roger Williams is a great school not only academically but socially. The professors are fantastic and make it their mission to get to know each one of their students on a personal level. They notice when a student is feeling down and are always there for comfort. Along with the professors, Roger Williams provides many resources and help for students who may have questions or concerns. If a student is struggling in a course, the school provides a tutoring center open all day so the struggling student can get the help needed to understand the material. By providing career and job fairs, I am sure that when I graduate I will be able to get a job that I love and am enthusiastic about. Overall, Roger Williams is a fantastic school which really makes it a mission of theirs to make sure all their students get the proper education so that they can graduate and survive in the real world."
Sophomore,5,"The staff goes above and beyond in all departments to see students succeed or happy. The food is really good, the academic advisors (if you have the right one, if not switch) really make sure you're getting the most out of your education and relate to you at a personal level to help in any way they can to help find internships or jobs related in your field. The education here is so personalized. However, the public safety department officers are annoying and give parking tickets for anything and there is not a lot of diversity here . College is what you make it, if you have fun friends that are down to go out (and thats what you're interested in) you're going to love this school, but if your friends are boring you're not going to have the best time."
Alum,5,"Roger Williams University was the springboard to my career. Not only did I learn how to study, write intelligent papers, and pass exams, but I learned what really matters - how to communicate, collaborate, and work with others. Professors and fellow students always challenged my thinking in a positive and constructive way. Despite the hours of handwork, sweat, and tears, I would do all 4 years over again if I could - because it was that enjoyable."
Niche User,5,"Great, small college atmosphere. Beautiful campus right on the water. Had a tour there last March and really loved their range of academic programs!"
Junior,5,"This semester was great. The professors challenged me. I had a mock trial that gave me a real sense of how the court room and court case really was. It didn't hurt that I received all A's, lol. But seriously, Roger Williams is a great school and I hope to attend the law school in the near future."
Niche User,5,"My campus experience at Roger Williams University was amazing. I loved the fact that just on my tour, many students were getting involved and there was so many activities that I was informed about. The education system was great and the cost is affordable too. I am looking forward to hearing back from them with my decision."
College Junior,5,I love my classes and find the topics engaging. The teachers are passionate and clear. I wish I could take all the electives offered but I cannot due to time restrictions. Though I have audited classes before and find that any thought provoking clas is all worth while in the end.
College Junior,5,I've had two internships prior to my junior year which have proved themselves very useful in the future career. I believe experience and a college degree is what will set you up to be successful in the future. I believe I will be able to pursue what I want to do with the degree I will receive in 2018. I've had to do my own research when it comes to internships but I found them easy to find. I have not used the career center yet but I may plan to do so in the future.
College Sophomore,5,I am not very qualified to talk about this since I have not graduated but I have heard very good results from graduated students that have gotten jobs right after graduating.
College Sophomore,5,"Educational talks are very common on campus about alcohol, sexual education, sexual assault, health and much more. There are many faculty members and student leaders available to consult about health and safety."
College Sophomore,5,"On Wednesdays and Thursdays most people on to the clubs/bars. On Friday and Saturday most people go to parties on and off campus. The best and biggest parties are definitely off campus, but other good parties are at bayside, almeida and new res! I suggest getting a fake id. Also, younger boys sometimes have trouble getting into big parties but thats at every school, so if you want to go I suggest bringing a couple girls! Also, don't show up to parties with 10+ people, it is obnoxious"
College Sophomore,5,"To be honest, the public safety officers seem to care more about alcohol than drugs. I have been seen drinking and smoking multiple times and only got in trouble once for drinking. Honestly, if you're not being an obnoxious idiot about drugs or alcohol you are not going to get in trouble"
College Sophomore,5,I can't put into words how amazing this school is and how thankful I am to go here.
College Sophomore,5,"I don't know anyone thats been sexually assaulted on campus which definitely says something about the school, health services is really helpful and accommodating. I got strep 6 times freshman year and they gave me medicine, doctors notes and called to check up on me. A nurse even got me a few things to eat once, the staff is super nice."
College Sophomore,5,"Honestly it's a beautiful school on the ocean. Theres something for everyone that attends rwu, if you like partying, smoking, not drinking, literally there is anything and everything here. However, we don't have Greek life or a football team because the football team burnt down all the frat houses a while ago, and both have been banned from campus since, which is understandable."
Senior,4,The transition to online classes was difficult but made much easier by the professors and school. I will give them much credit because they worked very hard to ensure we succeeded on online classes.
Senior,4,"The location of the school is amazing, right on the water.  My favorite part about the school is the professors.  It is evident that they care about the students not just academically but personally.  The only thing about the school that is not my favorite is the student body and their lack of diversity.  Other than that the school is very  nice."
Senior,4,"I love just about everything about this school. The type of professors that you will get very greatly, some are the best professors you'll ever meet, then there are some who don't care about you at all and only care about the money. But overall a very beautiful, small, fun school. Highly recommended."
Senior,4,"Got forced to take online classes due to coronavirus. #zoomuniversity can't complain, but also can't compliment the online courses either."
Sophomore,4,"Roger Williams is at a great location, right on Narragansett Bay. This school has fantastic academics and professors that really want to see you succeed. Likewise, the school is full of clubs and organizations that consistently try to reach out and connect with the student body."
Senior,4,"I went to Roger Williams University for the full four years, majoring in architecture and minoring in film studies. The campus is beautiful and the campus has a lovely view of the water. The academics for architecture help you with your future endeavors."
Junior,4,"I love this school! Great academics, great professors, fun times with friends! Definitely recommend you come here!"
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the academic aspect of RWU. The class sizes are small and allows the professor to know each of the students. This helps with attendance, focus, and it has helped me to be successful in my first semester. There is a variety of housing options for each class and there are many food options. As far as the social life, there's not always a lot going on- sporting events are not really hyped up. However the shuttles will take you into Bristol and the campus is beautiful."
Senior,4,"I loved the welcoming atmosphere. This school and all the people who work for it made me feel like they really wanted me to succeed, rather than being the type of school looking only for the best of the best. I hope in the future the school will continue this effort and create programs to ready their students for life in the real world."
Freshman,4,"The teachers and staff of Roger Williams are kind, inclusive, and determined to make students feel safe, welcome, and appreciated."
Senior,4,"I like how personal the education is, but I wish that it helped me grow a little bit more opportunity wise."
Sophomore,4,Roger Williams University is a beautiful campus that offers great classes for each individual to take. One great thing about RWU is that it is a very welcoming campus (especially for incoming Freshman) and it is a very safe feeling campus. One thing that I think should change is having more options to choose from for majors and minors for those attending the school and wanting to change their major
Freshman,4,The admissions staff is extremely helpful in answering questions and making themselves available. There was no pressure to decide before I was ready and this was consistent among all admissions staff. They really wanted me to make the decision that was right for me. The accepted students day was really informative and fun. There were so many places to get more information about your major and extra curricular activities. RWU helps you change majors easily.
Junior,4,"Absolutley love the campus. Great resources. Administration is pretty bad and professors are always a hit or miss. Food is good at first and gets old quick. Housing can be a pain, just like parking."
Freshman,4,"Its great overall, im learning a lot of new information. One thing that i would like to see change would be the scheduling of spring break"
Freshman,4,"Because I am just a freshman with one semester finished, I can not completely access every aspect of Roger. However, from what a have experienced, this is a great place to be."
Sophomore,4,"Roger Williams has an unprecedented amount of untouched potential to not only be a great academic school but a great school for the community. Because of the blatant lack of diversity on the campus, Roger Williams falls short of being a dynamic and inclusive community to their students. The campus does not reflect what the world looks like which only hinders the students. With a majority of the students being the same skin color, growing up in the same communities and having similar backgrounds, it impacts the students that don't fall in the same catergories. Roger Williams has a high retention rate and one of the biggest reasons is because of the lack of diversity, the school's board does minimal to fix it. Education wise, the school hires professors that do their job well. The professors are professionals in their field and it shows during class. Students will be well equipped with knowledge of their field by the end of their four years."
Junior,4,We need more diversity. The criminal justice program is amazing and I have loved learning the information and being challenged. Campus and food are amazing. I wish there was more financial aid and more parking.
Niche User,4,"Beautiful campus, has a great student life and amazing food, the professors are amazing and athletics are great. small campus and community but perfect fit for those who are looking for not that big of a school. feels like a family. swim team is amazing and the other students in the school support each other. dorms are very nice."
Senior,4,"I love the small classrooms and the connection that is felt between student and professor, everyone is always every helpful and great with financial aid. The school is transforming in learning about cultural diversity with the many programs that are offered at the school"
Sophomore,4,"The campus is absolutely gorgeous, and the community is a very open-minded one, although the population itself is not particularly diverse, which is most likely a result of economic resources. There are a fair amount of unique clubs, and the food is some of the best in the country among universities."
Alum,4,Great school to build independence. Far enough away from Boston to enjoy quiet but ability to get there quickly. Bristol is beautiful and Newport is a stones throw away. Dorm life is especially fun.
Sophomore,4,"Campus is beautiful as it is right on the water, good selection of courses, food is amazing for a college campus, not much to do in the surrounding area or on campus"
Freshman,4,Roger Williams is a good school overall. The academics are going to push you but the professors are actually able to take your specific needs into consideration because their classes tend to be quite small. I am only a freshman so I have only lived in one dorm building (Cedar) and it is okay but not great. Next year I will be living in Baypoint which from what I have heard is going to be good. Overall Roger Williams cares about you as a student and is a pretty good school.
Sophomore,4,"While not perfect, I can say will full confidence that when I'm RWU during the school year, it is my second home and I am thankful not only from the academic knowledge that I have gained from my time here, but also thankful for the people I have met and the experiences that I've had so far."
Sophomore,4,"I love the fact the Roger Williams University has a great staff who is more than willing to help with any issues you may have. The food is fantastic and the extracurriculars are outstanding. This is not a diverse school at all, considering the fact that its Acronym has been used as (R)ich (W)hite (U)nderachievers. The school president makes it known that he wants to increase diversity, but does nothing about it."
Freshman,4,The Campus is clean and safe. The teachers do a great job of leading the class. Students are engaged and active in school.
Senior,4,"I love the campus. Such a perfect size, and so beautiful. Everyone is so nice and the professor to student ratio is perfect. I was able to become close with professors which made my experience more comfortable. Only suggestion is that more than one on campus dining hall is needed. There are not enoug meal options."
Sophomore,4,"Roger Williams University provides both the support and encouragement needed to successed academically. The professors have the students best intrest in mind, as they truly care about your success. The small class size allows one to create close connections with peers and professors. Not only are the professors and academics wonderful, the location of Roger Williams is breathtaking. Looking out your window, to gaze at the sunrise across the bay is absolutely spectacular.  This school is a great fit for anyone who strives to successed academically and hopes to gain lasting bonds with peers and staff."
Freshman,4,Roger Williams University is a place where you visit once and know you want to attend. It has an amazing waterfront campus and is a good sized school. It's small enough to have plenty of time to work with professors and big enough where it doesn't feel like high school. The only down side is it is a pricy university.
Alum,4,"It's a great day to be a Hawk! I enjoyed my time at RWU. 95% of the professors I've had at this school are just incredible people and so full of knowledge. I loved the classes I took and most were pretty engaging. Commons though... the dining hall is actually really good. Some meals were a little iffy, but usually you could count on Commons to have some really good, hearty and healthy meals that definitely don't feel like your typical college food. Athletics is alright. I worked in athletics and liked watching our teams play, but they're not exactly a gathering point. I'd say school spirit is a little lacking in that manner. The location of the schools is so great. Right on the bay and the view of the bridge never gets old.  But the wind and rain is real. It's 30 minutes from Newport which is so nice in the summer, early fall, and spring. It's also 30 minutes from Providence. Bristol itself is a nice quaint town, and Colt State Park is a great place to study."
Senior,4,"Roger Williams University is a really great small university. Due to the relatively small class sizes, students are able to receive a more personal connection with professors and therefore obtain much more valuable information from lectures and discussions."
Freshman,4,Roger Williams is a great place. Only thing to complain about is the easy classes and the drug culture there. Both are easily avoidable.
Freshman,4,"All the friends that I have made here are super supportive, compassionate and caring. They are also very loving! Coming here, I was worried that I wouldn't make friends easily. But boy, was I wrong?"
Niche User,4,"Two years ago my classmates and I went on a college tour there, and my experience visiting this college was amazing.  The staff and  students were friendly and welcoming. They answered questions of what is expected for a student who wants to attend, and they would  need to meet requirements  when they choose  to apply to this college, and I got to learn about what their ambitions are : as of being there to guide students if they are lost about what's going on, having small classes so things can be simpler to handle for professors, and if you have any trouble with work you can find your  professor and they'll help you. "
College Junior,4,I feel very safe even though rape culture is gaining a reputation all over the country. This school has the right resources to deal with it and students who are not afraid to speak up and do something in situations leading to sexual misconduct.
College Junior,4,"The gym has great equipment and reasonable hours. They also provide spin, yoga, and pilates classes."
College Junior,4,The sciences at Roger are top notch. Classes are difficult yet manageable if your motivated to work hard consistently. Teachers are always there to help and will donate extra time if necessary. I recommend this school for their curriculum but not for campus politics and financial help.
College Freshman,4,Don't have much experience with this
College Freshman,4,"Never had an issue, but they talk about it a lot"
College Sophomore,4,"I love the school, the activities and clubs, the class size, and the professors. There are very unique and specified classes and great academic departments. The courses are rich with material and the professors are very knowledgable in the course material. The academic panels that occur throughout the year are also extremely interesting."
College Sophomore,4,"I don't live on campus but I've been inside them and they are very clean, spacious, and have an ok value for the price."
College Sophomore,4,Wonderful professors that are passionate and care about the students they teach and advise. Beautiful campus and cozy oceanside town that it's in.
College Sophomore,4,"I have not had much experience with this yet because I have only completed one year, but I have heard great things about it."
College Sophomore,4,"I have had a great experience with most of my classes and professors. however, I have had a few professors who were not the best and were not very accommodating to students and their feedback."
College Sophomore,4,I feel safe walking around campus alone. I am generally a very paranoid person so it is important for me to feel safe. I have never witnessed any troubling behavior that I would consider dangerous or harmful to another person.
College Sophomore,4,I love my school and the people I have met there. I have had great classes and an awesome experience so far.
College Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy the night life at my school. On Wednesdays and Thursdays, most people go to the bars or the clubs and Friday/Saturday most people go to parties. Some parties are a hit or miss but on weekends if you know the right people and have friends there will be at least 4 options per night, some better than others. Most people don't go out until 11ish, so don't be afraid if you don't have set plans by 10. I would suggest getting a fake ID, there are multiple 18+ bars/clubs in providence but having a fake definitely makes underaged drinking easier"
College Sophomore,4,"If it wasn't for amazing professors and small classroom sizes I wouldn't have the good grades that I have. Professors make it impossible not to succeed if you're putting in a good effort. The study areas on campus are really awesome, every building on campus has a dedicated study area including the dorm rooms which is very nice. The workload is average, there are a lot of extra help options and every professor has office hours where you can get more help if a tutor isn't cutting it for you"
College Sophomore,4,"Roger Williams primarily consists of white students and I would guess Saudi Arabian students/Middle Eastern students. However, nobody seems to care about money or the color of anyones skin, everyone I have come in contact with seems really chill about that stuff."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm only a freshman so I don't really know, but I know some seniors and all of them have set jobs, or are moving onto grad school."
College Sophomore,4,"I've only lived in one on-campus place so far, but I have been in every building and they are all very nice, fun, clean and generally have a really good set up. New Res, Bayside & Almeida are the places to go if you're looking for a party"
College Freshman,4,I would choose my school over gain bevause the academics are amazing and it is rated nationally for architecture.
College Freshman,4,When ever someone is in need of help Public Safe if always there.
College Freshman,4,I can not complain I have had an amazing first year at RWU.
College Freshman,4,I have made great friends within my hall. I haven't had a problem with any living on campus.
College Freshman,4,Club sports don't get as much recognition as the varsity sports. Club sports are always given the last time slots no matter what the time is.
College Freshman,4,Its a great school but when it comes to class selection they run out of classes necessary for people to take. People with certain majors have to be written into a class for their major. That is the only complaint that I have for this university.
College Sophomore,4,RWU is the only University in the state of Rhode Island to have adapted to the national regulations of the NREMT.
College Sophomore,4,"EMT is a fairly easy job to land once you have a certificate, the school does well to let you know when places are testing."
Freshman,2,"If you want to experience high school 2.0, Roger is perfect for you. But if you are looking for a well-rounded college experience and to be surrounded by like-minded hard working students, I'd reconsider. The student body reeks of immaturity and privilege, and although the water front views are tough to beat, the campus feels extremely isolated with nothing to do. Night life is pretty nonexistent and you'll feel just how small the school is immediately. Most students fit the New Englander stereotype and there is no diversity. Can't lie about the dining hall food though, it is really good and I'll miss it. But I decided to transfer after my freshman year because I felt like I was taking steps backwards and Roger couldn't provide the resources and atmosphere I want out of my college experience."
Junior,2,"If I could recommend Roger Williams to anyone I would tell them to avoid it. The academics here are very well with small classes and easy access to your advisor. A majority of the professor is here are nice but of course like any other university there are a few horrendous ones. As for the social life on campus, if you’re not a resident good luck trying to make friends. The students that go here are very entitled and stuck up. Not to mention it’s As if I’ve never left high school. Like I said previously if you dont live on campus at all, expect people to treat you like an outsider. If you commute, people are quick to turn your backs to you as if you’re a disgrace. Even with the numerous clubs and opportunities the university offers there’s nothing to do"
Senior,2,"The campus is beautiful... in the summer. 80% of the time there it is freezing cold thanks to the dirty water and crappy beach. 25% of the teachers actually care, while the others are old and confused. The administration is clueless and actually made my college experience miserable. The food is great, but don't expect a different meal after the first week. The parties are thrown by the kids in high-school that were left out. The ""cool"" kids have daddy's money and think that's cool. After committing to the school, I realized why RWU is everyone's second choice."
Junior,2,"After two years here, I feel that I can now make a good review.  Honestly, this is a really average university.  The only majors I would say are worth is architecture and marine biology.  If you're interested in any other major, I'd recommend going somewhere else.  The culture here is toxic, many people act quite immature, and it feels like I've gone backwards since high school.  The social scene isn't awesome, and quite a few people don't come back after freshmen year.  There isn't a ton to do in this area, so most people become apathetic and sit around.  Professors are very hit or miss, I've had some incredible ones, I've had some awful ones.  Food is good, but gets old.  Dorms are fine overall.  This school is way to expensive, and I got a huge scholarship to come here.  My honest recommendation, find a different school if you're not going for the majors I already listed.  Don't be fooled by tours, it's all designed to make the school look and sound better than it actually is."
Freshman,2,"After spending one semester here, transferring is a must. Overall the school is decent. The only good aspects are the food and views on the bay. The teachers are ok overall. In my first semester, I had great professors and some terrible ones. The academics were easy to handle almost too easy. The worst part is the students. All rich, white, underachievers with no goals. Some think they are the kings and queens of campus. Social life is decent at best. The parties can be ok but they make my high school parties seem better. Nothing to do on campus so everyone goes to low-end clubs thinking its the best."
Freshman,2,"I spent one semester at Roger Williams before I knew I had to transfer. I felt like I was wasting my money and time here. I did not learn anything new here, it was pretty much like another year of high school for me. Classes are small, but there is little collaboration or discussion. It is pretty much a 20 person lecture, which is a weird experience. Most of the people who I met here have had everything done for them in the past, so college is a bit of shock for them. If you are looking for a school where they will hold your hand and guide you through everything, this school is perfect for you, but if you are looking for independence and a real learning experience, I would not recommend. Overall, I was displeased with Roger Williams, but I did make some friends who I am still in touch with."
Freshman,2,This school is not for me. There is a lack of motivation from the majority of students and teachers here. It is not a community that supports each other. I feel like I have gone backwards since high school. Also the majority of students here are very immature and act very petty and childish. I am not used to that and have little tolerance for people like that. 
College Freshman,2,"division 3 not the best.. not bad.. not a lot of school spirit, they try, but no."
College Junior,2,The career center is very unhelpful. I've been once and they have me jumping through all these loops just to get a meeting.
College Sophomore,2,We don't have Greek life on campus but there are clubs and organizations that you can join.
College Junior,2,Students dont care about their education making class discussions difficult. It is hard to find a professor that actually cares about the class and knows what they are teaching. Many profesors just read off powerpoints and talk at the class.
College Sophomore,2,"The parties can be fun for about an hour, until 1) the cops break it up, 2) they get too crowded, and 3) the people become drunk and rude."
College Sophomore,2,They couldn't be any more inconsistent with their punishments. Never the same for students violating the same rules.
College Sophomore,2,"This school over accepts students not considering that too many students will attend. In this case they run out of housing for students and have to cram three students into a room meant for two people. This is what happened to me and many of my friends. Also, the rooms meant to dorm two students are small as it is, so trying to fit three people into these rooms is not exactly the easiest thing to do."
College Freshman,2,"This is not a party school. Even though people still party, it's not the ideal party school. You're not going to have huge ragers on campus because they get shut down fairly quickly."
College Junior,2,"the food is tasteless, not well season"
College Freshman,2,The school is difficult to get any money from
College Senior,2,"As a graduate student, i received very little financial aid, which is why i need scholarships now!"
College Freshman,2,"Public Safety breaks up everything fun, tickets anyone they can find and will look through your stuff."
College Freshman,2,Public Safety and the RAs are pretty bad. I guess they are following their jobs but it is still REALLY annoying. I have been to a couple meetings where students have expressed how annoying this is and hopefully they lighten up.  It caused a lot of people to transfer last semester.
College Freshman,2,I did not get enough financial aid to attend this school and my parents struggle to pay. My parents and I wrote/spoke to them about our financial problems and they did not take it into consideration. They are rude. I also will mention I am probably getting better grades than most of the school.
College Freshman,2,There would always be another form that RWU would not tell you about until you have a week left to complete it.
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing to do on campus or around town. If you wanna study all day or not be sober all day, this is the place for u! Nothing really around. RWU say they have events, but they are not fun or not often."
College Freshman,2,"There is nothing in Bristol. Every time you want to go out to eat or whatever, you would need to go to Providence. Done even get me started about RIPTA....."
College Freshman,2,Financial aid people are not very clear
College Freshman,2,"The party life at RWU doesn't seem to live up to the expectations of a typical college party.  Most parties take place in an upperclassmen dorm, off-campus, or in Providence."
College Freshman,2,There is very little school spirit involving the athletics of the university.  It is below the expectation for a standard college athletic experience.
College Junior,2,"Public Safety takes their job way too seriously and do almost anything to break up parties even if no rules are being broken. if they even find alcohol in your room during inspections regardless of age, unless you have a small bottle, they fine you write you up and send you through some review as if you're in middle school and aren't responsible or have common sense"
College Junior,2,The school is close enough to travel to Providence and Newport but the locals don't tend to like the schools students and the bus line through town is a little particular about where they travel
College Senior,2,Living in the dorms suck because RA's and public safety roam often and get you in trouble.
College Sophomore,2,"Campus isn't really diverse at all. As much as the school promotes diversity, it seems like everyone is in one way or another the same. It depends on how involved you get and who you hangout with"
College Freshman,2,"Public Safety at Roger Williams is ridiculous. They drive around campus constantly and just sit and wait for an RA to phone them up requesting help, whether it be for someone sick or a party out of control. They treat everyone like criminals and I truly think that they forget it's a COLLEGE. My best advice for anyone coming here....DO NOT GET CAUGHT. The punishments for alcohol violations aren't fun."
College Freshman,2,"I came to this school interested in the per-veterinary medicine program. Turns out when I got here, it doesn't even exist leaving me very unhappy with my counselors at this school. In turn I switched to an accounting degree and it isn't too bad. The business school (Gabelli) is really nice and the professors know what they're doing. If you're coming here with a business or science major, you're in the right place. IF YOU'RE PRE-MED DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME HERE."
College Freshman,2,rains here all the time and if you don't bring a wind jacket you're SCREWED.
College Freshman,2,everyone is rich so they take advantage of it
College Freshman,2,you wait 20-30 minutes at New Res just to find strangers to let you into a party that gets busted before midnight.
College Freshman,2,it's undereducated and you waste a lot of money on pointless classes that don't have much to do with your career/major
College Senior,2,they don't do enough to control it
College Junior,2,"They are very strict when it comes to playing loud music, even if it is on Friday or Saturday night."
College Junior,2,"Its not a huge party school, there are parties with 50 people max. House parties are the best"
College Sophomore,2,"The computer labs are great, there are always spots open to do work even during the busy times of the year. But the wireless internet is horrific."
College Sophomore,2,"You never think about how your school feels in another season usually. At our school in the winter, the winds are ridiculous! It gets very cold and windy, but summer days are really beautiful if your planning on summer classes."
College Freshman,2,Freshman party life is clearly not comparable with senior party life but still you hear of nothing cool going on ever. 
College Freshman,2,"The academics are decent. I personally got off to a bad start, but it is easy to do freshman year. There is nothing to do on campus. Literally nothing, unless you are involved in athletics. "
College Freshman,2,J-Lot is miles and miles away it seems like especially on a cold windy day!
College Freshman,2,I regret coming to this school
College Freshman,2,You have to go off campus to do anything sort of fun
College Freshman,2,It's just not a great place
College Freshman,2,Not enough money given out
College Freshman,2,I was offered large talent scholarships at other schools. However I preferred the program at RWU. They did not offer talent scholarships but when I showed them the offers from other schools they gave me a merit scholarship instead.
College Freshman,2,"A lot of the students do not care much about their academics; the teachers are often unmotivated by their student's total apathy. The school is known for a safe haven of B students. If you are looking for a challenging environment, this is not the school for you. The classes are small to a fault; you WILL be noticed if you are gone, so skipping is out of the question, and even sick days are seen as ""skips"" unless you drag yourself to get a note from health services or the hospital"
College Sophomore,2,"I received the average financial aid package. However, after my freshman year, my financial situation changed and the financial aid I received was no longer enough to support my college education without graduating in a huge amount of debt. I wrote a letter of appeal to the financial aid office explaining my situation and asking if they would reconsider my award. They took three weeks to get back to me, and they said they have offered me the maximum amount they can give me based on my need."
College Sophomore,2,"As a freshman it is a little more difficult to make it off campus to restaurants. A popular choice is a small Italian restaurant with reasonable prices and a student discount with school identification. The restaurants in the surrounding cities are more expensive with unique foods, and lots of fresh fish options."
College Junior,2,"Various programs are acceptable; but the average level of curricular difficulty is pitiful, professor competency is unfortunately lacking, peer motivation is non-existent, and the CORE curriculum is surpassed in challenge level by eighth grade coursework.

Marine Biology, possibly Business, and several other related majors are the only ones worth attending for. Engineering is supposedly decent, but evidence to the contrary is abundant when the program and its achievements are compared with those of other comparably-priced institutions."
College Sophomore,2,You have to take public transportation the RIPTA. There are weird people on it. It does not always run at times listed. But bus stop right off campus
College Student,2,the teams sucks and like 5 people show up to watch the game
College Freshman,2,"There are mostly just pizzerias (Dominos), some Chinese food takeout and coffee shops like Dunkin Donuts."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is very strict about alcohol or drug abuse and Public Safety is called multiple times on the weekend. No matter if you were involved, Public Safety writes you up and the consequences are pretty harsh."
College Freshman,2,"There are plenty of rules regarding underage drinking including a dry South Campus policy.  There are also plenty of RAs to circulate and catch underage drinking, however, students seem to find a way to do just what they want."
College Freshman,2,"It rains a lot here. You can count on it raining at least 3 days a week, even in the winter. Classes aren't too far from the dorms so it isn't too bad, but it is annoying getting soaked when walking to and from class."
Senior,1,I think I went to high school twice. THIS SCHOOL SUCKS. There is no party scene at all. Prepare to die a painful death of boredom.
Senior,1,"Campus location is nice when it is warm but it’s usually always cold and rainy during the school months. Food is good some days and very average on others. Quality of Academics is average to below average if your not in one of the top major such as architecture. 

Social scene is non existent. There is flat out nothing to do. No Greek life or party scene haunts  this school. Campus is dead 24/7 and even the bar scene is anything but what you want it to be. Bars in Bristol are going out of business. The 2 bars that are left are super lame super expensive and have no drink deals. This school is high school 2.0 .  If you are looking to do more than sit in your room and do nothing every night this school definitely isn’t for you. 

Can confidently say I regret my decision"
Graduate Student,1,"This may be one of the worst schools in the country in terms of value and return on investment. They make you feel like it's great, but in the real world, it does not help at all. They must not have much money because they continuously take from us wherever possible, whether its outrageous fees for late returns on your book rental or ridiculous parking tickets because there is not enough room for commuter students to park, they are always taking money from students or their parents. You will get about 30+ emails and 20+ letters a semester asking for donations, but nothing offering you help or asking what you would like to see improved.  Please, for your own sake, go somewhere else..."
Niche User,1,"If I could give RWU a one I would. I was a student at Roger for around a month before I realized I was paying 50k to be absolutely miserable. The campus is filled with snobby white rich kids who don't take no for an answer. Campus safety could careless about the things that happen on campus. There is nothing to do so all kids do is drink and smoke. Don't let the views fool you the dorms are absolutely horrific, I found dirty underwear in my drawers when I moved in. The RAs are rude and dont care about the safety of their residents. The food is gross and the dining staff is beyond rude. Not only was this school the worst decision of my life but they continue to cause me issues even after I have left. The school despite me leaving in September has continued to claim I am a matriculated student and keeps dispersing my loans which at this point are not needed. Bottom line is if you want to be miserable and spend a pretty penny to do so, then Roger is the place for you."
Freshman,1,"This campus is literally the most boring campus ever. There is nothing to day except drink, smoke, and sleep. It's literally that bad. You get harassed on public transport and the housing doesn't care about your safety. It is a living hell. The classes are easy but sometimes the professors are really bad and mean. The food isn't as good as advertised, DON'T BE FOOLED. The RAs aren't great and they don't care about safety. They also tell you that you will not be in a forced triple but then they put you in one."
Freshman,1,Met the worst kind of people here hoping to transfer immediately. Had some horrible teachers who are completely un organized. Lack of diversity and creativity in the students and staff.
Alum,1,"The campus is pretty, but it's very small & boring. Being a division III school, the sports don't elicit much hype and there's a poor selection of clubs to join. Bristol is just a RIPTA ride away, but there isn't much to do there. Newport is an hour RIPTA ride, but it's not fun in the cold weather that makes up most of the school year. Classes are easy, which is good since there aren't many places to study. The dining hall food is good, but it gets old after a bit since the only other on-campus option is lower commons, which gets old quickly too. The Starbucks doesn't have the full menu as it's only a satellite branch & the Dunkin is VERY limited and is a self-serve. The organized events were usually boring and nobody ever went to them. In combination with the lack of sports and the easy classes, most of the time you'll be really bored. Parties always get busted. My dorm sometimes had brown water and the heat didn't come on until December, and the wind is awful."
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life
College Freshman,1,We do not have greek housing
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life.
College Freshman,1,"Roger does not have greek life, even though it should and has the money for it."
College Freshman,1,The campus police think they are cops. P-SAFE strikes fear into the hearts of many here.
College Freshman,1,There is NO greek life here....
College Freshman,1,"Worst dorms ever, especially for the high price"
College Freshman,1,I have had so much trouble with financial aid at this school. The offices mess up all the time. My tips would be try to get as much money as possible in scholarships and then try to do monthly payments through TMS.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek Life .... it's depressing.
College Freshman,1,"It makes me laugh that when touring Roger Williams they stressed how ""diverse"" the campus is. In reality, there is merely a handful of students who are not white. The only other ethnicity's seen are Middle Eastern and Asian."
College Freshman,1,We dont have greek life
College Senior,1,THERE IS NO DIVERSITY it is weird
College Student,1,"There is no diversity at this school. If you are looking for a college with a mixed group of people, you are not going to find it here. Endicott is known for being a rich barbie school and the kids here are just that."
College Junior,1,The problem with our campus is that there is hardly any wireless.
College Freshman,1,I cant even begin to tell you how annoying public safety is with tickets. They literally go to work so they can write a ticket for parking in the wrong area.. while there is no where else to park. 
College Sophomore,1,"We actually don't have greek life at our school, and it is fine without it. "
College Junior,1,"The majority of students are overly-entitled, self-involved, vapid wastes of the intellectual exertion it requires to down-filter your thoughts to a level they can readily comprehend without a thesaurus and a team of tutors hired by their parents.

The women are thankfully attractive overall, and the eye candy is very competitive with surrounding universities."
College Student,1,there is no diversity! everyone looks and acts the same. nobody is an individual at rwu
College Freshman,1,"Its mostly upper middle class, although the majority of the kids aren't snobby and do get some sort of scholarship money to aid the cost of tuition.  There is a variety of international students, but the overwhelming majority of students are white."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't know of any greek life available for students to participate in on campus... if it does exist, it is not prevalent at all."
Recent Alumnus,1,"We pay 150 dollars per year to park on campus but yet after five oclock when  most classes are over students are not allowed to park in any areas besides their sticker permit areas but yet, people who do not even go to the school and do not pay for a parking pass may park anywhere they please including the teach lot 24A. Vistors may park there even to go to a basketball game but it is off limits to students"
College Freshman,1,"your joking – Haha kid you have no clue what your are talking about. Either you do not understand the definition of diversity or you have not yet seen Roger Williams. Diversity is a group of individuals coming from various races, religions etc. Roger Williams is NOT THAT AT ALL. RWU - Rich Under Achievers.. I Went there for one semester and I think this website has the stats wrong, it should not be 74% white but instead probably around 90-92% white. Get your facts right before you decide on a college so quickly. And sorry to burst your bubble but I hope you do not like to drink or party, cuz you wont be doing much of that."
College Freshman,1,NO FUN – If you like to party do not go to Roger Williams.  The school loves to fine kids for everything.  They look through your bag every time you go into your dorm.  Providence and Newport are a pain to get to.  You can't even smoke a cigarette on the way to class because its a smoke free campus.  Every sports team is terrible besides sailing.  If you plan on drinking and partying alot in college do not go to Roger Williams most of my friends have already been thrown out
College Freshman,1,"Rich White Underachievers – It's the stereotypical nickname of Roger. There is some diversity, on campus but the diverse populations stick in groups just creating more issues than necessary. I have an ESL student in my writing class (came to his first class on Thursday) and the professor had a very long talk with him in class if taking writing would be a good idea. It was like she was talking him out of the class. I think the school could use a boost of diversity."
College Freshman,1,I need it but they would not provide me with any everyone gets it but I didn't.
College Freshman,1,Seperated Ethnic Groups – I have never had any one in my classes except white students. The foreign kids only hang out with each other on campus and all live together. There are a good amount of them but they dont mingle with everyone else
College Freshman,1,"Watch your back. One of the worst things about this school is its strictness. If you are caught drinking on the dry-side of campus get ready for a hefty fine and more likely an alcohol education class. Roger Williams completely changed its campus strictness from somewhat linient to a $50 fine just for smoking a cigarette a couple feet outside the but hutts. The school used to be known as ""Rager Williams"" but now the name is abused as the school is the complete opposite. If u are entering as a freshmen I pray you don't expect to party, go out, or do anything of what the college nightlife is suppose to be. Most likely you will end up drinking in your dorm with a few kids playing music very softly because if played loud RA's will immidiately enter your room. Overall the strictness of this school is ridicolous, as my roomate was literally taken out of his bed and thrown in an ambulance for being intoxicated. If your not a good looking girl.. you're screwed."
College Freshman,1,"Rains a Lot – It rains here more than another other place in New England. I expected to have to deal with snow, but as soon as I came to orientation I was warned to buy rain boots and a rain jacket due to the amount of rain. It can also be very windy due to the fact that the beach is 2 seconds away. But, once he weather is nice, you are often hit with a warm ocean breeze."
College Freshman,1,Drugs Are Popular – The drinking scene at Roger Williams University is big and so is the drug scene. In my unit alone there are tons of students who smoke marijuana and sniff different prescription drugs such as adderall. It is common to see people smoking at the different huts around campus or even on the sands of the beach that is literally 2 seconds away.
College Student,1,Not So Diverse – the campus is not very diverse as far as race/ethnicity/ religion
College Junior,1,"This school boasts about it's mission to ""bridge the world"" but it's almost as though they hide any one of international dissent away!  We have a good reputation and fairly extensive study abroad program, but it's as though we have no real diversity on campus."
College Senior,1,The school has frats based out of the individual schools but nothing like you would see at a larger school or in the movies
College Freshman,1,"What Its Really About – Small Campus, less than 5,000 people, lots transfer more than the website admits. The school used to be a community college not too long ago, its easy, expensive,and cold and windy as shi**, everyone wishes they were in Boston."

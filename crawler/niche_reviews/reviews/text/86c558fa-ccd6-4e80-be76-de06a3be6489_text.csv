Freshman,5,"I don't have any classes that are strictly online.  We may have times when we log on to zoom for a class , but it's rare at this point."
Sophomore,5,"Simpson College has a beautiful and safe campus. I feel safe at any time in the day or night and have quick and easy access to amazing security officers and resources. In addition, the professors connect with you one on one due to small class sizes. Professors get to know if both inside and outside of the classroom and are willing to help you one on one with their class or any class that you may struggle in. The campus is welcoming and fun to be on as Simpson offers many activies, clubs, organizations, fine arts, and athletics."
Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere here at Simpson College where almost all students are involved in some kind of extracurricular, whether that be sports, music, student government, or some other group. Professors truly care about us students and take time to help us."
Sophomore,5,I liked how much the teachers and staff cared about helping the students succeed.Simpson college has a very welcoming staff and friendly environment!!!
Junior,5,The professors care very deeply about your education. When ever a student needs help there are many options for them on campus. It is a small campus and you can get to know many people.
Freshman,5,Right now I am a first year and I have to say I haven’t regretted coming here it is amazing all the teachers actually care about you and join a fraternity was the best decision I’ve ever made yea simpson has a few bumps but I know that we will get through it and it will be a better college because of it
Junior,5,"Simpson is a very friendly campus. Professors that I have had have been very nice and helpful, I like having the smaller class sizes since it makes me feel like I can actively participate."
Freshman,5,"Simpson College is a Liberal Arts private college located 15 minutes south of Iowa's capital city, Des Moines. The location is great, the campus is beautiful, and the academics are of the highest standard."
Freshman,5,"Just stepping on campus the first time my junior year of high school I knew this school was for me. Since coming to Simpson everything has been great. There are so many people that want to know you, and help."
Sophomore,5,"Simpson offers a variety of majors and activities. The classes are not bigger than 40 students. This allows professors to get to know their students. If a student is struggling, the professors go out of their way to try to help. I have learned that from experience. 
The campus is small and easy to navigate. It feels like a community. Everyone knows each other and are friendly. 
There are lots of clubs and activities to involved with. There seems to be something available for everyone. 
There are also various opportunities to play a varsity sport or participate in intramural sports. 
The classes are challenging and push you to think."
Freshman,5,My favorite thing about Simpson College is how inclusive it is. It truly is a campus that welcomes all beliefs and ideas!
College Freshman,5,Simpson has great systems in place to help you with internships and jobs. Career services has done a wonderful job and frequently checks in on students.
College Freshman,5,I absolutely love Simpson. Everyone on campus is friendly and supportive and professors truly care about the student. I have great relationships with my professors and frequently go to office hours. I'm definitely getting my money's worth.
College Freshman,5,"Greek life at Simpson is amazing. I feel totally at home at TriDelta, but Non-Greeks and Greeks get along great! Two of my best friends are in a different sorority and the other two aren't Greek affiliated at all, so it isn't cliquey or exclusive. Every chapter on campus supports each other, regardless of affiliation."
College Freshman,5,The faculty and students at Simpson are what makes it truly incredible. I have found an amazing support system here that helps me to thrive and be my best.
College Freshman,5,"Before my senior year in high school, I didn't know what it would take to get financial aid. My best tip is to apply early as well as to apply for many scholarships."
College Freshman,5,The professors are the best! They are always available to help out with whatever problems arise. My professors have helped me find classes that are just right for me and offer support.
College Freshman,5,"The workload seems just right and has awesome flexibility with classes that are available. I believe an internship is required in order to graduate, and help is offered to help find a place."
College Sophomore,5,"I have NEVER felt unsafe at Simpson. I go on runs at one in the morning, and not once have I felt paranoid about it. I can walk home in the dark by myself and feel completely secure."
College Junior,5,"I've never actually heard of a sexual assault happening on campus, seen drug or alcohol use on campus, heard of or witnessed crime occurring on campus, or heard/seen anything bad happen at all other than maybe some poor parking skills. Simpson College advocates and provides excellent services to meet its students mental and physical health needs. I do not live on campus so it is possible that some of these things occur in dorms."
Junior,4,"I absolutely adore the close-knit community here on campus. Everyone is super nice and it gives you ability to have those relationships with professors that you could not have a bigger school. In addition, everyone feels part of the community and I like that I walk around campus and I recognize most people & they know my name."
Junior,4,"Overall, they have been quite accommodating with all the craziness in our world. They are good at being transparent. Also, they have been strict on COVID rules, but heck we are doing a lot better than other colleges, so I am not that mad about it."
Freshman,4,So far it's been a great experience.  In the 3 weeks since I've started I've made a lot of friends.  There's a lot of things to do in Des Moines on the weekends. Professors and classes are good.
Senior,4,Amazing professors willing to go above and beyond to make sure you learn while getting a degree. Located in a great community with a nearby city with great internship opportunities.
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the atmosphere at Simpson College. Everyone from the professors to the kitchen staff are all very kind and helpful, especially as a first year this was very much appreciated. The biology professors are my favorite and I am really glad that I chose this school. However, the fact is that it is a very expensive institution, and they for some reason decided that it would be a good decision to raise expenses next year for tuition and housing without adding to or improving anything. I just think that this was a poor decision to make, and many students I know are considering leaving due to the continuing increase in expenses without improvement, especially in the food department. Unless you go to Tyler's on campus, your food is likely to be very bland, and at times, undercooked."
Freshman,4,I love it here. The food is pretty good and the faculty is really nice. I’m really glad I decided to go here.
Sophomore,4,"Simpson College is a good Liberal Arts School. They provide a wide range of activities on campus, and do their best to welcome all new students. With a small campus it makes it easy to have individualized time with professors, and accumulate a closer support system."
Sophomore,4,I have enjoyed my Simpson College overall. There are some good things among some bad things. The professors are very friendly and will do whatever they can to help their students. The school is very tight knit and it is very easy to find connections for internships and jobs. There are very limited things that students can do on the weekends and there is not really a spot for students to have fun and have the fun of the college experience. The facilities are decent but there is some maintenance work that needs to be done to improve the buildings overall. Overall there is a good and strong community at Simpson College.
Alum,4,"Simpson College has mismanaged funds in the past few years leaving professors and students unsure of the future of the college. However, even in spite of apparent lapses in administration the professors have always been stellar leaving students with an excellent education and prepared for the future."
Niche User,4,"Very friendly campus and environment! All of your teachers know you by name, and you know mostly everyone on campus. Classes are very small and more individualized than they would be at a bigger University. It gives you the opportunity to explore yourself more, as you are given many more opportunities to make friends and be involved. Also has a very convenient location and is not far from the city."
Junior,4,"Overall I enjoy going to Simpson College. The class sizes are small, therefore the professors get to know their students on a personal level rather than the student being 1 out of 100 in an auditorium. The campus is really scenic and during fall the colors are just spectacular."
Niche User,4,While visiting I felt like I was being apart of a family. I enjoyed the visit and they showed me that they care about the students on their campus.
Junior,4,"Simpson has a very welcoming atmosphere throughout the campus, and it provides so many opportunities to try new things. Because it's a small liberal arts college, it's easier for everyone to be a part of a lot of different things. Because Simpson is a small liberal arts college, you have a stronger connection to professors, and they actually care about you. Indianola is a smaller town, but it's less than a half hour away from Des Moines so it's not isolated."
Junior,4,I like how the classes are small enough so the professors know who you are. I also like how the professors in my major and other classes care about me. I think the food could be improved but it's not terrible.
Niche User,4,It's a caring community that will not only prepare you for your intended major but for your life as well.
Sophomore,4,I'm a student that has struggles to find a major but I found many different outlets at Simpson that helped me figure out what I want to do in life.
Sophomore,4,What I like most about Simpson is the great atmosphere that it tends to give out. There are a lot of friends and great people to meet. You also get the chance to study abroad which is a lot of fun.
Alum,4,It was an overall great experience. I transferred my junior year and met new people right away. I had a few issues with getting credits and my general education requirements. My roommates were not that great either.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a 1st year student at SImpsona and so far this college is amazing. It has a feeling of being home and everyone is so kind and nice, you don't get that everywhere. Simpson has a lot to offer from majors, clubs, organizations, and events you can participate in."
Junior,4,Simpson college is a great small town college with a lot to offer. The professors genuinely care for their students and the small size of classes allows for more one-on-one help and personalization of learning. Simpson is especially great for those who are looking to study politics or enjoy being politically active. The diversity is low on campus but the school does a great job of promoting multicultural awareness through their strong support  of multicultural organizations and students.
Senior,4,"I enjoy the proximity to the Des Moines Metro area and the career opportunities for internships. The overall vibe of the college is very enjoyable and friendly. I know most people I see around campus and have developed some great relationships with friends. I enjoy the smaller class size so I can ask more questions and have a voice in my own learning. The lack of new enrollment has resulted in some negative outcomes, particularly cutting key support staff, cable, and food services. If the college can bring in more working revenue it will continue to be a great college that I am proud to go to."
College Junior,4,I have never felt unsafe on campus and their is always campus security that you can call if there is an issue or if you need a ride.
College Junior,4,"The career services department is wonderful. The counselors listen to what you need and give great tips and genuinely care about finding a great fit for you. You have to make the effort of going in and listening to their advice, but if you do that and put in your part there is honestly no reason you can`t be successful."
College Sophomore,4,I have seen various works from upper classman and have been very impressed with their work.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy my small class sizes and the one on one connection with professors.
College Sophomore,4,I thoroughly enjoy being a part of the athletics at my school! The support is there but more school spirit would always be nice.
College Sophomore,4,This school focuses on academics which is important when gaining an education. There are various ways to stay involved throughout the year.
College Freshman,4,Campus is pretty safe. I haven't felt unsafe walking across campus. Campus crime is low and rarely heard of. Security is wonderful and are always there shortly after you have called them. Sexual assault is a big topic on campus and the college has SARA (Sexual Assault Response Advocates) who are very influential.
College Freshman,4,"My experience with courses and professors have been good. I have liked all of my professors; they are very knowledgable about the areas in which they teach. I have liked the majority of my classes. The quality of the courses are very good. Class sizes are usually about 20-25 people per class, but some specified major classes can be even smaller. This is very helpful so that you can use your professor to get as much help as you can."
College Freshman,4,"The majority of students on campus are there for Music, Education, Science, or Politics. The value of the degree at Simpson College is well valued. Majority of people are hired after graduation."
College Freshman,4,"It is nice to live on campus. The first-year dorms are in close proximity to the classes and important buildings on campus. The further you progress in your years at Simpson College, the further away your living areas get. However, in the Sophomore housing, they have suites that will share a bathroom. For upperclassmen, apartments are available in several different locations around the college. The social atmosphere is great, and you get to know your neighbors well. The cost is very pricey."
College Freshman,4,"I am not a part of Greek life, but have several friends that participate in Greek Life. The sororities and fraternities are extremely dedicated towards their philanthropy and community service. They host many events and are very friendly. There are four fraternities on campus, three which are recognized nationally. There are also three sororities that are very involved in the student life."
College Freshman,4,"The athletics at Simpson College are pretty good. Many people are involved in different ways. Non-athletic students participate in intramurals and the facilities are wonderful. They even have a fitness center and weight deck that average students are allowed to use for exercise. School spirit is somewhat felt, but the teams all perform well."
College Freshman,4,"My overall experience has been wonderful. My class sizes are small which gives me one-on-one attention, the campus is small and easy to maneuver, and the people who are attending the school care greatly about their academics. If I were to go through the process of choosing a college again, I wouldn't pick any different than I have."
College Freshman,4,"Some girls still have lots of problems with sexual assault on campus, but there are lots of resources and education about the topics."
College Freshman,4,Professors are great. I've only had problems with two professors.
College Freshman,4,"I just got pledged into my sorority a few weeks ago. Other than the fact that's its super expensive, I love it."
College Freshman,4,"Our school just spent 1 million dollars to renovate the fitness center, to make it more accessible to all students. The squat benches, and ""football workout equipment"" is located downstairs, and the cardio equipment and yoga is upstairs. This makes students want to workout more often, because they aren't pressured by the different skill levels."
College Freshman,4,"My college is very accepting of all students, and is still working hard to increase diversity. The professors care about each student and know their students personally. Simpson is more like one big family, which is important to be so connected and involved."
College Junior,4,"Campus security is very nice because if you feel unsafe about walking from your car to your dorm late at night, you can stay in your car until they get there and they will drop you off right at the front door."
College Junior,4,I really enjoy how small the class sized are. It gives me as a student the chance to speak up in class and really get to know my classmates. It builds a greater sense of community.
College Junior,4,The career services department at this school is great. They are always giving out information about new and different opportunities for employment or internships. They will work with you and help you find the job you are looking for.
College Junior,4,I was a student athlete my first few years here. All of my professors were very understanding when I had to travel for games and were willing to work with me when it came to turning things in and making up the things I missed.
College Senior,4,I will be graduating with my Bachelor's next January. This degree is going to help me significantly because it will allow me to promote two steps within my department. It will also open doors for other opportunity. My goal is to seek a job within our local utility company because the family benefits they offer are amazing. Benefits are important to me because my fiancé has 2 children that I want to make sure they have the best health care that we don't have to pay a huge fortune for.
College Senior,4,The school counselors are great. They are very responsive to emails. If there is one thing I would change it would be to make sure everyone at Simpson is on the same page. I had turned in paperwork months before they did not keep. It took almost 3 months to receive a acceptance letter and I could not proceed with my financial aid. I had no idea how much my tuition was going to cost and how much I was going to have to come up with. Then 2 weeks before class starts they tell me I owe them 5990.00. They however worked with me and I was able to pay two weeks later than everyone because I missed the deadline by 1 day. It is all working out just very confusing.
College Freshman,4,"Simpson works extremely hard to prevent sexual assault, and when it does happen the staff is extremely supportive of survivors and absolutely does not tolerate sexual assault. They do everything in their power to ensure that it NEVER happens again and take it very seriously. The only sexual assault cases I've heard about occurred when alcohol was present, and the guys were very drunk. Simpson has SARA in place, which is helpful for survivors, and it also has presentations on sexual assault."
College Freshman,4,"While the first-year dorms are not as comfortable as home, they are very close to my classes. I can get to all of my classes within 5 minutes of leaving my room. The lounges in the dorms are also great. I do think that my roommate was not a good fit, but the housing staff worked with me to find a better fit."
College Freshman,4,"The facilities here are great for both athletes and non-athletes. Sports are a part of campus culture but not the focus, which I appreciate."
College Freshman,4,I feel like I fit in with my college community.
College Junior,4,I love Simpson College. I could not have chosen a better school that fits my academic goals.
College Junior,4,"Simpson College is a great place to continue your education.  The class sizes are perfect, the professors go out of their way to accommodate you, and the campus is small.  I wanted to go to a college where I can walk from class to class and see someone I know, Simpson has that.  I like knowing that I matter to my professors, and that they care about my success in the classroom, and throughout life."
College Junior,4,I have never heard of somethng unsafe occuring at Simpson.
College Junior,4,I don't really know much about it but their houses look nice and Ive always heard nice things about the sororities and fraternities.
College Junior,4,"The school maybe be strict on a lot of things, however it is to make sure that they keep the whole student body as safe as possible."
College Sophomore,4,"We have a nice facility that was just completed last year that everyone can use, there a time blocks that aren't available when being used by teams, but they're really easy to access."
College Freshman,4,we have heat and air conditioning so that is nice.
College Sophomore,4,"I think that campus housing is viewed as very important here at Simpson College.  All students are actually required to live on campus unless they petition to live off campus.  Here at Simpson, living campus is viewed so highly because they want students to socialize and get the full college experience."
College Freshman,4,The dorms are a great way to make lasting friends.
College Freshman,4,We have many options to help keep everyone safe!
College Junior,4,"These are students who will respond kindly when greeting, assuming you haven't already met the bunch that'll treat you like you grew up together before having spoken with you."
Freshman,2,"Liked simpsons but the food was awful on campus for what we paid. The dorms were outdated, toliet seats were awful. They had 1 ply toilet paper. The academic side of things was great, the living side was not."
College Junior,2,"Campus housing is mandatory, which is absolutely ridiculous in my opinion. The rooms in the apartments can vary dramatically in size which is unfair because everyone in the same apartment pays the same. Some of the apartments are in shambles and need to be torn down. When you break down the cost of what you pay in a month it is definitely not worth it, but everyone under 23 has to."
College Junior,2,The only real off-campus options are fast food resturants.
College Sophomore,2,There are not a lot of variety or options and it is Really expensive.
College Junior,2,It is very expensive and there is a poor variety of choice.
College Senior,2,There is hardly any off campus apartments. Everyone just lives on campus all four years. The only time people live off is over the summer.
College Junior,2,"There is not much racial diversity and people don't seem to talk much about other types of diversity. But, they don't seem to discriminate, either."
College Junior,2,"Unless you really like pizza, there are not that many places to eat in Indianola. But, Des Moines is close and they have a lot more to offer."
College Sophomore,2,"The food is okay. But its college, it is rarely great food."
College Freshman,2,"There are a lot of the same kind of people at Simpson, I don't have a problem with this because I get along with a lot of them but it doesn't get very different."
College Freshman,2,"Freshman parking is horrible but it does get a lot better, and hardly no one is on campus during the weekend."
College Freshman,2,"Being in Iowa, it snows here all the time and unfortunately, classes very rarely get cancelled either.  However, since it is a smaller campus, you don't have too far to trek in the snow.  Just make sure you own some boots and mittens!"
College Freshman,2,"I have a couple of friends, but a lot of people I have met are really stuck up. Typical student looks athletic and rich. I know a lot about the people here because it is such a small school, I know if someone broke up with someone else. Which seems to happen a lot. I know when new people start dating, hooking up, or going to parties. I can tell we have a lot of partiers on campus, that's not my thing but I know whose it is."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not a whole lot of minorities on campus, but at the same time the campus is small in general. It is also in Iowa, so a lot of diversity is not necessarily expected. Everyone is kind though and also accepting of others."
College Sophomore,2,Only places in town are limited. Mostly fast food with a few other places to get food.
College Freshman,2,"There a not a lot of options, and the different places are often running out of food. When they do have stuff, it is usually pretty good."
College Junior,2,"Since the school is in a small community, there is not much transportation, besides using your own vehicle."
College Sophomore,2,Parties are not that bad at my school but some may get out of hand and it just depends where and who you go with. There are no local 18 year old clubs and they ID everyone who goes into clubs and bars.
College Sophomore,2,"Snow Snow Snow – It's the midwest so there's pretty intense winters. Luckily the school is small so you don't have to walk very far, and they clear the sidewalks when it snows. So the weather doesn't really affect classes very often"
College Sophomore,2,We are a school dominated by white students. However we have a ton of foreign exchange students.
College Sophomore,1,"Simpson College wants everyone to live on campus, and they deny many people to live off campus. It probably could be cheaper to live off campus, but it is hard to do."
College Freshman,1,"Indianola is a very small town in the middle of no where so there is not much to do for fun unless it's on campus. This college is what you would refer to as a ""suitcase college"" which means pretty much everyone leaves on the weekends, meaning there is nothing to do then."
College Freshman,1,"Simpson Internet – Internet access sucks, always down and broken. Printing on campus is too expensive and computer lab computers are worthless."

Alum,5,"The political science department at Kent State University is exceptional. The campus, city and facilities were wonderful."
Sophomore,5,"The online experience has gone very well through Kent State. The transition was very smooth, and the professors did their best to keep everyone updated. Because times are tough, the college is willing to to be lenient on payments or assignments being turned in on time. Overall, I'd give it 5 stars because their change to online really showed how much they cared about the student body's safety over academic status."
Alum,5,"I loved my experience at Kent. They had such fun activities every weekend. When I got into my major, the professors cared so much and were so helpful. They made you truly excited for your career."

The professors were really thorough on the design of their class, and I never felt like I was confused or concerned about the content. They make it very easy with flash line to navigate all online accessibility."
Senior,5,"Kent State University was the perfect fit for me. I like more of the secluded campus feel, where all the buildings, restaurants, shops, etc. are all in the same area. Kent was a large campus that felt like home. Great professors, extra-curricular activities, and FOOD! The atmosphere was like no other college I visited in the NE Ohio area. I would highly recommend if you are interested even from afar!"
Freshman,5,My first year at Kent State University was amazing ! The atmosphere is very welcoming. It really feels like a big family. Flashes definitely help flashes!
Sophomore,5,"I've had a really strong experience with my online courses through Kent State. My professors were very clear with their expectations and took the time to create an immersive environment for students. Online courses can become very jumbled and confusing, but my professors made sure to provide a simple and concise plan."

Graduate Student,5,Kent State University has provided me with wonderful research and travel opportunities that have aloud me to showcase my current research to the scientific community.
Senior,5,"After I went to a different college for about a year, I decided to transfer to Kent State. I love the campus environment and the campus community. There are so many opportunities to get involved on campus and there is a focus on keeping the campus busy. There are so many events on campus and the library is a great place for studying and meeting friends. The academics are relative depending on the area of study, however, the professors are held to a high standard and many professors are compassionate and understanding. I love this university and the campus environment that they have created and maintain."
Sophomore,5,"Very warm and welcoming, inclusive and all professors were great, many groups as well to show that flash pride!"

Sophomore,5,Currently in my sophomore year at Kent. Have taking a few online classes so far and they have been great. Professors I had all helped me if I had any questions.
Freshman,5,"My experience with Kent State University has been nothing but good things. The staff is amazing and you can really see they care about there students. The diversity on campus is amazing as well,"
Junior,5,"I took a few online classes, but due to COVID-19 all of my classes are online. At first I was very nervous to not have any in person classes, but my professors have been very accommodating with the current situations."
Junior,5,I am an out of state student which I thought would be hard to adapt. I was completely wrong! I have made many friendships at Kent and I couldn't have had better professors! Kent State is the best decision I could ever made when decided to choose which school to attend.
Sophomore,5,"Kent State University was my number one choice while applying to colleges and I was over the moon excited to have gotten my acceptance letter last year. I was committed and ready to start a new journey towards my degree. 
I soon figured out I was moving to Florida and college was just way too expensive for me, so I had made my mind up on going to a community college in my new town for a couple of years before I transferred somewhere else in Florida.
I worked as much as I could and one day bought a plane ticket to visit my old friends in Ohio. They all were talking about how excited they were to decorate their dorms and live on campus to get the college experience. I felt like I was missing out on such a prime time in my life. I called Kent State the next day and asked if I could still move in, in the fall. To my surprise they said yes. I never went back to Florida and moved in the next week. That has been one of the biggest decisions I have ever made, but it has also been the best."
Sophomore,5,I have taken two classes online as it worked best with my work schedule as well. Taking both of the online classes was the best choice that I could have made! Each professor was understanding and adaptable to the students and technology. The professors made the course personable even though it was not actually in person and the course work meaningful.
Sophomore,5,"Personally, I gave Kent State University 5/5 stars because I have absolutely loved all of my experiences that the college has had to offer thus far. I feel at home, safe, and involved. There are so many opportunities and friendly faces around the beautiful campus! Kent State University is truly my home away from home."
Junior,5,"Ever since I toured KSU as a high school freshman, Kent State has truly felt like home to me. You know when you come home from a bad day at work, and your mom or another family member is baking cookies and has the fireplace on and your favorite movie on? That's what Kent State feels like to me, except that it feels incredibly rewarding when it comes to opportunity on top of that. All of the staff has provided me with the tools to succeed and has always made me feel like I can achieve anything, and that security feels amazing. I am incredibly excited to be going back in the fall."
Senior,5,"My experience at Kent has been Overwhelmingly positive! I love the campus, the students, and the faculty."
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved Kent State! I have been to two homecomings as an alumna because the memories I made at Kent State were like no other and I could not imagine how much this town could mean to me. Being from NYC things were definetly different but I loved my classes, even the ones that took me out of my comfort zone. This experience was truely life changing and I would definetly recommend this school for an upcoming college freshman!"
Alum,5,"I took a few online classes that I really liked, it was helpful for me to be able to have the material at my disposal which really helped me when it came to studying. The professors were very open to office hourse and they were always willing to work with me on anything I needed."
Freshman,5,"KSU is has a very nice arts program which is what I am, interested in. They have a nice campus too. All the staff are very helpful and want their students to be there!"
Graduate Student,5,"While face-to-face classes are the best. Sometimes, there are only options for an online course(s). However, the online atmosphere is just as lovely and just as helpful in allowing students to succeed. Almost half of my senior year at Kent was online, and I still graduated with honors. As long as students are willing yo put in the effort, there is noy reason why they cannot succeed in an online setting."
Graduate Student,5,"This college is amazing. Evderyone involved it so helpful and kind. This was my first and only choice for colleges, and I am glad I went here. I look forward to earning another degree from this wonderful school."
Freshman,5,Downtown Kent is full of restaurants and fun places to go while only being a 10-20 minute walk away. If you don't feel like walking too far there's always something to do on campus. There are a lot of free events and sporting events are free for students
Sophomore,5,"Kent State University has given me the opportunity to talk to new people and make new friends. Campus life at Kent State makes the experience more lively. Multiple organizations on campus are available, therefore students are able to meet other people, cultures as well as environments."
Freshman,5,"The campus is amazing, the advisors and people around are friendly, and it is also cheaper than other schools around. It is also close to my home, which is a nice plus for me. There isn't really anything off the top of my head that I would change!"
Junior,5,"Kent State University is my home away from Columbus. Kent State is an amazing environment and the university really wants everyone to succeed. Kent isn't too big but it's also not small, everyone knows everyone. The community is amazing here and enjoy living in Kent."
Junior,5,The professors at Kent State are some of the nicest most caring people that could be providing you with an education right now!
Junior,5,The professors do a great job of making online learning enjoyable! They are always available during the day and sometime even late into the night. The online textbooks used for these classes are also very interactive and easy to use compared to other online textbooks you may have used in high school.
Senior,5,"The university is quite and kept clean, however I'd like to see a change in the staffing at the university with more teachers that grade fairly."
Junior,5,Kent State as been very good to me. They giving me the best opportunity to be successful in my field and challenge me in every way. I have no complaints with them so far.
Junior,5,Teachers are helpful and questions are answered quickly. This is my first online class. I prefer to take classes in person but under the current circumstances this was the best option.
Junior,5,Friendly campus. There are a  variety of classes offered each semester. Professors are always available to assist.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoy everything about KSU. The area is great, there are a lot of things to do all of the time, and the professors are awesome."
Junior,5,Dorms were awesome! Professors were very flexible and encouraging. Beautiful campus. Lots of dining halls and meal plans to choose from. Awesome student wellness and recreation center to workout in.
Freshman,5,"Very welcoming, and tries to make sure their students succeed with various different free sources and opportunities!"
Senior,5,Kent State is an amazing place. I love the campus as a whole. Each and everyday I am happy I ended up picking this university
Freshman,5,"I have truly found what it means to be a fully-fledged functioning adult at Kent State, both when it comes to my professional and personal life. I love every part of what it means to be a golden flash all the way down to my core, because the community I have found in Kent is like no other campus I have encountered. From the academics to even the food, it has a sense of home to it, everyone wants to be connected in some way to show that we are a collective unit of a campus. I have found myself wanting to pursue my career at the Kent campus, even to the point where I want to work for them. This campus has enabled me to find my own identity, community, and sense of what I want to do with my life and future, and I would leave that for anything else in the world."
Graduate Student,5,Great! I would recommend! It helped give me the knowledge and tools needed to advance my career and grow as a person.
Freshman,5,"After graduating high school from a small town, I was nervous to attend college. Although I was anxious about starting a whole new chapter in my life, Kent State University as a whole has made me feel so welcomed and at home. Students and staff are super friendly and truly care about your well being. I have never felt so welcomed somewhere in my life! Kent State University has provided me with so many opportunities, new friendships, and knowledge!"
Junior,5,Kent State has a beautiful campus and professors that are focused on student success. I have had such a great experience at Kent and am so glad I decided to study here.
Graduate Student,5,"KSU is a great school, not only for educational purposes but for the culture and people you'll meet. I have met amazing friends while becoming educated and better suited for the real world."

Freshman,5,"I loved it! I have not even gotten there and I already feel surrounded by a positive ""family"" of Flashes!"
Junior,5,Kent State is an amazing college. The professors take their time and allow me to ask questions and get quick responses in return. The campus is very safe and inviting. I would not pick another college.
Freshman,5,"Kent State University is a beautiful school, wonderful campus with great teachers and a fantastic range of things. The school work is easy but not too easy, the teachers are so good with students, and I just enjoy being here"
Sophomore,5,I have had a great experience there. Its is a great College.  I never even thought that I would be able to start my Degree and now I am here in my second year as a Kent State University Golden flash.
Alum,4,"I took a few classes online, and all but one of them were wonderful. The class I didn't like was due to one professor, but overall it was easy to use, and the professors were great."
Sophomore,4,"Kent State is a good place to go if you're looking for a cheaper education outside of high school. From my experience, the staff is very welcoming and helpful. If you have any questions, there is almost always someone there to answer it for you. On top of being affordable, they give plenty of options when it comes to making payments. This can include getting in touch with scholarships and loan options, or making monthly payments to cover the costs of your semester. There are also plenty of classes to take to fit everyone's wants or needs. The only thing you might have to worry about is potentially swapping campus, but they have online options if you'd like to avoid such a thing. Kent State also keeps its student body updated with emails on the regular, and they will let you know what events are planned for the week. Of course, this was all before Covid, but they've made great changes in switching to online courses to keep everyone safe."
Alum,4,I took a few summer courses online. Classes were fast paced but good to take in an online setting. I enjoyed having the freedom that an online class gives you.
Junior,4,I'm confident in my choice to attend Kent State University. I have had amazing professors who have always been there to assist me in my hour of need. Kent State also offers great resources for students to help them cope with stress and other life issues. Overall I'm glade I choose to attend Kent State University.
Freshman,4,"I haven't minded online learning. My professors are very understanding. As I get into a more specific degree path, I am scared that I won't be learning everything I need to know in depth."
Freshman,4,I was on the fence for so long about attending Kent State since it was so far away from my hometown. I absolutely love it here and have made so many friends despite living here during a pandemic. The campus is beautiful and your professors care about your success.
Junior,4,"So far, Kent State has been helpful and supportive throughout my journey as a Journalism student. If I ever feel I am in need of guidance or support, there are always people I can go to."
Junior,4,"Online learning isn't my style, but the courses I have taken online were thorough and definitely worth my time."
Sophomore,4,I am in my second year at Kent State and I am very happy with my descision to go here. I chose the school because it had a very good program for the major I wanted to go into. It was a hard transition from high school to college personally but I adjust better everyday.
Sophomore,4,"I am attending Kent State as a fashion major from out-of-state. I love Kent State becuase of the fashion program, the amazing people you meet, great proffesor relationships, and resources for me career path. People are very open minded and accepting here. One thing I would like to see improvement on is atheletics and more overall student communitty between all majors."
Junior,4,"My experience at Kent is not yet done, but I have been impressed with it so far. I am part of the Applied Conflict Management degree, and I have been very impressed with the professors' knowledge and background from this department. It has made me more excited for my degree and career afterward."
Alum,4,"I had a great experience at Kent State! I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Integrated Language Arts (English Ed 7-12). All of my professors had doctorates if that's something that interests you - I had many embedded student teaching experiences that gave me a huge leg up when applying to jobs. I got a job in 5 days after graduating - that variety of experiences is what persuaded my current dept/admin to hire me in our first interview. I enjoyed the campus and the local city. I felt incredibly safe walking across campus even in the middle of the night.  I had a few excellent admission counselors. The health center does a good job keeping prices low. I only have good things to say about Kent! The downside is definitely the price and lack of scholarships, which is why I gave it 4 stars. I genuinely look back fondly at Kent, but just not at my loan repayments."
Freshman,4,My online experience with Kent State was a little awkward at first but with the extra help from my professors I was able to pass my classes.
Sophomore,4,"Kent State is a wonderful school that provides endless opportunities for students of all types. My favorite thing about Kent State is the student life and club options. There is a club for every type of individual and they're usually very welcoming. I was a part of CHAARG, an all girls workout group located on campus. I found a lot of community and comfort within the members during my freshman year. Although I do love most of Kent State, I'm not in love with how they handled COVID-19. They increased course costs since most of them switched to remote learning. Remote learning is usually not as beneficial for students so it's hard to see why we're paying more without the benefits of an in-person lecture."
Senior,4,"I have taken a few classes online (before COVID) and I have had a positive experience with professors being firm but fair. I had one professor that was always available to chat and really wanted to interact with their students. I prefer taking classes in-person to keep me accountable, but most online professors understand the different learning formats that students use and try to accommodate it the best they can."
Junior,4,Kent State is a wonderful place to be. It is a small town with a very vibrant night life and and a great place to get an education. You walk on to campus and you can tell immediately tell how great the education you are going to get. You know it is an institution for higher learning. There is not much I would like to change about Kent State unless you count its very limited parking situation but it has just about anything a student needs to succeed there. You have professors that care about how you do and are willing to help through any situation. It is truly a great place to be.
Junior,4,"By the end of the semester all of my classes were online because of COVID. With my major being athletic training, it was definitely a tough transition, to learn hands-on material online. But, my professors did whatever they could to help us. They assigned a lot of hands-on projects that we could do at home. One, for example, was our suture (stitches) project when we were learning how to properly tie a suture. Instead of using a dummy, which we probably would have used had we been in class, I had to tie the suture and tied it around the ankle of a coffee mug which allowed to get an idea of the technique involved. This is only one example and I could give you more. My professors did what they could to make sure we were still learning hand-on material in an online fashion."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, Kent State has been fantastic. Professors are helpful and available if you have questions. The only downside is, since I commute, I feel that I miss out on a lot of activities that take place in the evening."
Freshman,4,they online classes are good but i would've like to see more in person classes offered. Other than that my experience was very good and professors are always there to help
Junior,4,"Online learning has its ups and downs, but overall I have had a mostly pleasant experience. You have more flexibility with how you learn, and can most of the time go at your own pace. I've found a lot of online classes had all the material available so that I could complete it early during the semester, and I enjoyed that."
Senior,4,"My experience has been really good. I have enjoyed taking classes and getting my degree at Kent State and the teachers and staff have been wonderful. I started off at a regional campus and transferred to Kent Campus, and it is much bigger and takes awhile to get used to walking. The only thing I think needs to change is their tuition rate, its higher but not too bad if you qualify for scholarships and  are eligible for their grants. Overall a wonderful experience!"
Senior,4,"For my online experience I will say it took some getting used too because I am a visual learner and have to be in a physical class to learn, so it took some time for me to adjust and figure out a plan on how I could learn successfully. Once I got a routine down and used my resources the learning process wasn't too bad for me, I was able to email my professors if I had any issues."
Junior,4,"Great school, great teachers, and good availability to resources. The only con is that it is a popular school, so class sizes are pretty big."
Freshman,4,The transition to online classes was rather abrupt but it was handled pretty well. Professors took a while to get everything organized but once everyone was settled things went smoothly.
Junior,4,"I have taken a handful of online courses at Kent and I absolutely love them. While it is different than taking face-to-face courses, the flexibility that online courses gives me, opens up a whole different set of opportunities. The professors that teach online courses are often attentive and are swift responders."
Junior,4,"Kent has such an array of people, opportunities , activities and overall an amazing environment. I am a transfer student that came to Kent in the Fall of 2019, I have loved it ever since."
Junior,4,"Online learning was difficult because my major is very hands-on. Having said that, my professors did the best they could to accommodate all of our needs and were always there for us when we needed them. They made the process significantly less painful than it already was."
Alum,4,It was a great experience! One area I can see improvement in is for transfer students. I transferred from out of state and struggled to meet other students in my similar situation. Kent could work on building a stronger transfer student community on campus.
Alum,4,"I took a few classes online, it pushed me to become more accountable for motivated. Also I enjoyed it because of the flexibility it gave me. I spent many work days at some local coffeeshops."
Senior,4,"Kent is a lovely campus. As an Education major I have had some amazing opportunities to work with students in a classroom environment all throughout my college experience. This is something that sets Kent apart from other teaching programs. When I graduate, I know that I will love being an educator, because I'm had the experience needed. Kent may seem like a large campus, but as you get deeper into your degree you will find yourself surrounded by people who support and care for you."
Junior,4,Challenging to adjust but in the end overall a good experience and helped me become more adaptable and flexible.
Freshman,4,"It's a very hit or miss when it comes to most teachers, but when it hits well, it's really really well!"
Senior,4,The online class are pretty good. I would say usually they are easier then some of the in person section of the class.
Sophomore,4,The staff is extremely helpful and there are a lot of resources on campus! The exploratory program helped me declare my major! I wish there were more places to eat on campus.
Senior,4,I enjoy the student experience as a non-traditional college student. The education and instruction are the same for students of every age and walk of life. I have managed to maintain an excellent GPA while working and attending classes. Kent State University offers me the opportunity to do that while supporting myself and working to better my financial situation.
Sophomore,4,"I think Kent State University is a great school, I've only been at the main campus for less than a semester, but the campus is beautiful and the professors are great."
Freshman,4,"Kent State University offers a diverse welcoming environment. It is definitely the best place for my major, offering an extremely demanding and competitive program that leads to many job opportunities."
Sophomore,4,I haven't found anything that is severely displeasing about Kent State University. My mother got her degree here and my brother is graduating in the spring as well. Professors are kind and respectful and if there ever is a problem I know there are trusted individuals within the school that I know I can turn to if need be. Our university president has done everything he can to keep us students afloat during this crisis caused by COVID-19. Students are still being offered opportunities so they can continue to succeed and be superb in classes.
Freshman,4,"I love my school. They have so many choices as to events to go to and organizations to be a part of. I love living on campus and seeing my friends. I also love the many different courses you can take that apply to many different interests, not just one's major. I have yet to have a bad professor and don't regret my choice in the slightest"
Freshman,4,"Kent State is a great school. The campus is very nice, and it is large but it isn't huge like other colleges which is nice for someone like me who did't want to be going to a huge college. The teachers are helpful and kind, as are most of the people in Kent. Kent itself is also lovely, the downtown has really cool shops and there are lots of nearby trails for biking or just walking. While Kent was not my first choice, I'm still glad that I went here because I have had an amazing time."
Junior,4,"Great campus, adequate dorms and dining. I was at this University for 6 semester and for the price you cannot beat it. If you're interested in becoming a pilot there is no place better."
Sophomore,4,"I am a Sophomore nursing student at Kent State University. My advisers have been extremely helpful in my journey. I have had some great professors and some okay professors but I haven't had any that are straight up terrible. I have met a great deal of people here, from all different races, religions and financial status's. The people here whether it be the staff or students have always been welcoming, and helpful no matter what it is you need. I have never felt scared to ask for help because there is always someone to ask. The bookstore does a good job at helping you find what you need, and quick."
Junior,4,"I like how the teachers are very helpful, and want me to succeed and work with me. There isn't a lot of diversity especially in my field, which is performing arts. I am a African American female and I'd like to see more diverse plays on the stage. and More diverse professors."
Junior,4,It is a large campus in a nice area with a newly built downtown area. The campus is spread over a rolling hills area with a beautiful landscape. The faculty I have encountered have been kind and 100% interested in helping me to succeed.
Freshman,4,Since my first day on campus I felt super welcomed and connected. Everyone is super helpful and sweet.
Junior,4,"A great school willing to help their students succeed. Kent State allows you to get the experience of a University without losing the small town feel that creates a strong community. They are continually working to keep buildings up to date and create a safe welcoming environment for their students and staff. The school’s public transportation is definitely at par with other competing schools and offer a great variety of dining options for student whether you commute or live on campus, and ore consistently working to improve the health (both mentally and physically) of the student body. The wide variety of majors offered allows for students to follow their dreams and become prepared for their future careers."
Freshman,4,"The campus was very welcoming and clean. If I could change one thing it would be who took us on the tour of the campus because they were talking very quietly and walking too fast for the group of over 50 people, which I thought was way too much. The dorms looked to be a descent space and the fact they come with both a microwave and fridge is a great touch. I can not wait to come back for a tour and to get to know more people on campus. I would like to see the education department because I have heard it is a very nice department. The campus is beautiful and very pleasing to the eye which is a nice touch!"
Sophomore,4,"I’m currently a transfer student at KSU. It’s my second semester living on campus.
So far I’m glad I transferred here 
Biggest pros: there’s a lot of student organizations on campus for every imaginable interest which is great, academically I’ve had so far really good experiences 
I think their psychology program is underrated it’s large but also a lot of engaged professors, major specific advisors and ways to get involved such as research and student organizations. 
Kent can feel intimate and personable if you make the effort to make it that way so such as going to office hours, asking questions, and joining groups.

Cons:
Housing is adequate but for my first semester was placed somewhere I didn’t ask for (a Double) ended up getting a single this semester which has been good.
Dining options need improvement especially for healthy options.
Class sizes can be large even in junior and senior level classes which can suck 
Though they vary greatly"
Sophomore,4,Very affordable. Very nice dorms. Campus and surroundings well-maintained.  Large campus but small campus feel.
Sophomore,4,"The campus itself is beautiful and it has some of the most amazing professors. However, because it's such a big school it's hard to find help or answers to questions you have, because you can easily be treated poorly and as one of the masses."
Freshman,4,I’m only one semester in but it’s great so far! People are nice and the professors genuinely care about how you are doing.
Junior,4,I really enjoy kent state and all it has to offer. I personally went to the Stark branch before I went to main which I preferred due to its small class and amazing professors.
Freshman,4,It's very excepting medium sized campus. Very friendly and a highly dafe college. Foods very diverse and lots of choices. Nice place!
Freshman,4,Kent has beautiful campuses all over. There are so many unique people to meet. There are programs for everyone.
Sophomore,4,"It is a great school with many amazing and renowned programs but is very expensive for what they offer. If you're in the Fashion or Architecture school, it is a beautiful campus with great amenities but the education and arts and science colleges have not been renovated since the 1900s."
Junior,4,I liked the environment and how it's not a downtown city. I lived on campus the first year and it was nice and reasonable. Students are crazy sometimes but most are respectful and intelligent. LOTS of opportunities for socialization and relaxation. Good food and drink choices. Lots of giveaways and free t-shirts.
Senior,4,I loved the Early Childhood Education program at KSU! The professors were very supportive of us as students and I feel prepared to be a teacher after having gone through this rigorous but helpful program.
Freshman,4,"I came to KSU for fashion design. The work is grueling. Kent is a small town with many family owned shops. The place is incredibly scenic, with animals like black squirrels, groundhogs, and deer wandering around. I was assigned a cheap double, and it has reasonable space and air conditioning. My friends share a townhouse, so I'll probably live there soon. My biggest complaint is the cafeteria food. It's just enough to keep you alive. I prefer to get SB at the library. Various student events are held regularly so you'll never be bored. You'll meet  foreign students from Japan, China, Korea, Nigeria, etc. There are also many opportunities to study abroad. I generally avoid the greek houses and sports, but I hear they're very lively. So far I've had no negative experience with class, resources, or otherwise. It's overall a great place to live and study. People are really nice here in Ohio."
Junior,4,"Overall a good experience, I had good and bad professors just like everyone else but I learned a lot and made some great friends. The advising resources could do with more updating, they're helpful but its hard to know which one to pick that could help you the most with your issues. The campus is really nice and they have buses that can shuttle you if you get a bad parking spot in the winter. I haven't tried the food yet but I haven't heard anything bad about it so i assume it's decent, which I hope it would be if you're paying thousands of dollars to be there. Kent State is a good school with a lot of diversity in the classes, people, and professors. I would recommend it to anyone that asked."
Freshman,4,Kent State is an amazing school full of passionate staff members and driven students. It's a place where I can learn and grow as a student and become trained in my field. I would change the cost if I could. Having to pay for college myself has made it impossible for me to finish school. I'm not sure if I'll be able to attend next semester.
Freshman,2,If you want to pay over 5k a semester just to be treated like a prisoner Kent state is for you. Seriously don't come here unless it's the only school you got accepted to or the cheapest option. This school is a complete joke. They never live up to their words. All talk but no action. Covid exposed all the flaws in this school. All they want is your MONEY! Unless you want to be miserable go elsewhere.
Graduate Student,2,"Online professors, for the most part, truly do not care about providing a decent learning experience. Most of them just provide readings, tell you to read it, and have you write a paragraph for it like a high school English class. There is little communication and instruction. It is far below what I expect from a graduate degree program."
Graduate Student,2,"Kent State, regardless of the qualifications of their professors, does not function like a cohesive university. Communication with the faculty is nearly impossible. This has been consistent throughout the entirety of my program, not just during the pandemic. Outside of this, most of my professors were alright, with only one or two that stood out. The rest were unremarkable or just as difficult to communicate with as the rest of the staff. I'm considering transferring for my last semester, because Kent State has refused to respond to my requests for approval for my final course for a month now, so I won't be able to attend classes."
Senior,2,"I like the atmosphere created by the students. I was placed with a different advisor every time I had an appointment which made scheduling hard. None of them were on the same page. I had a lot of issues with professors, many were rude and disrespectful. The ""no technology"" rules in the classrooms are out of hand. Many of my courses this past semester forced us to work with a non-profit. It took up all free time and we get no credit if they implement our ideas."
Sophomore,2,"The class sizes are typically very large and heavily reliant on PowerPoints. I often feel that the professors are just reading off the screen and not going into depth about the topics. I transferred to Kent State University from a different university, and I am able to see how class sizes, professors, peers, etc. can effect your willingness to learn. The school is decent, but there is not a very large focus on programs other than Fashion and Architecture."
Freshman,2,They convinced me to join a Living learning community and then told me I couldn’t stay in it after freshman year. Horrible place.
Niche User,2,"disability services is not helpful. policies do not consider special needs of individual circumstances. professors are not responsive. administrative staff says they want to help but are limited because of general policies meant to serve the majority. overall unsatisfied. did not meet expectations of what I thought a larger college would offer. i gave a slightly better rating bcz of other aspects...campus is nice, clean, safe, good size, people are nice, good variety of people/cultures, nice surrounding town"
Freshman,2,"I attended Kent State for a semester and a half. I had to leave my housing contract half way through the year and they made it very difficult for me to do so. The classes were not worth the cost. I lost all of my savings for a mere 19 credits. I did not complete my freshman year and had to drop out due to expenses. The online courses I took during the second semester were NOT worth 500 dollars a credit. Save your money, do not go to state school, do not live on campus. NOT worth it if you don't know what you want to do with your life."
Niche User,2,"Its okay. Not a lot to do, parties are decent but not the best. Dorms are okay and most professors are pretty good. Small for me."
College Sophomore,2,I don't like how some of the dorms do not have carpet of air-conditioning. They should really invest in upgrading the dorm so they are more comfortable to live in.
College Sophomore,2,"If you pursue drugs than it's super easy to find them, especially weed, alcohol, and xans. Those are like the most popular, but truthfully whatever drug you want you can find. Just make friends.

If you're not pursuing drugs than it's super easy to not know where to find them at all. Kent State is really a ""you choose what experience you want"" type campus."
College Sophomore,2,I was stuck in the worst dorm on campus so my living experience was not very good. My dorm was small and we did not have our own bathroom or even our own lounge to study in. It was also very far from any food places and classrooms.
College Freshman,2,"I am not in a frat, but from what I have heard, they suck. The parties are mostly just people involved with Greek life."
College Freshman,2,I got the impression that Greek life at Kent was more for people who have trouble making friends
College Junior,2,The members of the divine nine are missing so......
College Senior,2,We pay a lot of money to go to school and a chunk of all our tuitions go towards sports that no one really gives a damn about.
College Freshman,2,"There's plenty of it, and it's very noticeable. Noise never ends!"
College Freshman,2,"My hallway reeks of weed, there are bongs nearly every other dorm room, security seems to only give talks and not give punishments."
College Freshman,2,"If you want to stand outside all night and wait to get in the bar 145-4157 or Lake St., Tavern it's fun Kinda your best bet is to drive into a bigger city but they have nice little turnouts can is definitely more fun in the summer when most of the students go home. Finally has goobers now so that's a plus for the nondrivers it's about time"
College Freshman,2,"Many professors are lacking and it's a wonder why they are even her ""teaching."" The curriculum ranges from bad to great. Kent Core is dumb and pointless."
College Sophomore,2,i really do not see the point of greek life.
College Junior,2,While the dorm I lived in was immaculate most dorms on campus were outdated and cramped.
College Junior,2,Hazing is insane at Kent and was the reason I had to leave school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Few courses, classes fill really fast, no extra financial support for those in need."
College Freshman,2,"I dislike my school, I have nothing to say"
College Freshman,2,"The required ""Kent Core"" is useless. It has nothing to do with my major and is so we have to stay in school longer and give more money. I've had a run in with politically incorrect, borderline teachers who should be fired. I've been ignored by staff when I send emails. Classes are often over crowded and students suffer. I'm not paying 25,000 dollars to have professors teach me nothing or treat me rudely."
College Freshman,2,The rooms are small. The big light they have in the rooms makes it hot after awhile of having it on. The bathrooms are disgusting and the cleaning crew clean nothing. Things are broken all the time in the resident halls. You have to bombard them to fix it and half the time it still doesn't get fixed or it's not fixed properly. It's crap
College Freshman,2,"The housekeeping in my residence hall seems to have a policy of ""let's say we cleaned and not."" This school doesn't care who they hire and have teachers ranging from ""why are you even here"" to down right awful. The academic advisers shouldn't even be here because they don't advise anything.  The food tastes like crap and is highway robbery.  I know plenty of other colleges are like this too but that doesn't give Kent State an excuse to be terrible as well. People pay a lot to go here and it's not fair the teachers, classes, and facilities are crap. I'm disappointed with the way this whole school is run."
College Freshman,2,We really aren't good at any sports but baseball
College Freshman,2,"I've had numerous problems with on-campus housing. My first roommate was horrible, so to switch rooms I had to go though the building director. He was an absolute headache to work with: wouldn't show up to office hours, wouldn't show up to appointments I made with him just hours before, took days to reply to my emails. Finally I switched, and thank god, because in addition to my roommate, the bathrooms were disgusting. Now, even though I live in an air conditioned building, they turned the aircon off months before the temperature dropped below 70, and it interrupted my sleep because our room was almost 80 degrees. We complained multiple times and were told there was nothing that could be done. I'm moving to an apartment next year where I get my own large room, a living room, a kitchen, and a full bathroom for less than half the yearly cost. Plus, the apartment is closer to the academic buildings than most of the dorms."
College Freshman,2,Athletics is not a big part of this school. Students don't really have much of school spirit and rarely ever attend games.
College Freshman,2,"Sport at Kent are not as big as I would like them to be. A lot of money is invested in the athletes, but i feel like it is not returned by their performances. Baseball, gymnastics, and wrestling are the top sports and no one really wants to go watch those sports"
College Freshman,2,"Greek life at Kent is all about partying. I never hear them doing  extraordinary things for the school or community. Only certain (skinny, pretty) girls get into sororities. I'm not too sure about fears but they are all known for partying."
Recent Alumnus,2,I honestly have not seen campus security in campus besides 1 incident
Recent Alumnus,2,"Low class as selection of online classes, classes fill up really fast, high cost of attendance"
College Sophomore,2,They are not good at deadlines or remebering important details.
College Sophomore,2,"the communication between the college and its ""tuition paying units"" (what they call students) is very poor. I had to write several letters to get aid, and they strongly and clearly push loan opportunities but not for grants or scholarships."
College Junior,2,I feel that school spirit is very low. More people are interested in tailgating than going to the actual games.
College Freshman,2,I am not able to receive the amount of financial aid I need. My mom has even taken out loans.
College Freshman,2,I'm not a party person so I think the party scene is not so good.
College Junior,2,"I had to pay out of pocket for semester because Kent lost my check and instead of just canceling and writing a new one, they had to go through the longest process ever."
College Sophomore,2,They're very full of themselves.
College Freshman,2,It's easy to do what you want no matter what their rules are.
College Freshman,2,Scholarships aren't my favorite. As many  of them that I've applied for like hundred or so I haven't received not one. I'm paying out of pocket and having a hard time doing that
College Junior,2,Kent state doesn't offer any scholarships in my field so I received no financial help from them.
College Senior,2,"The food meals are expensive and the food on campus it no where near as good as food right around the corner at restaurants such as Chipotle, Burger king, etc."
College Freshman,2,The housing is not that great. Some buildings are better than others.
College Freshman,2,"The football team is ok, but the games are not widely attended."
College Freshman,2,The football team didn't do too hot this year. Other than that the teams are average.
College Sophomore,2,Some professors lack knowledge of the material.
College Freshman,2,"My dorm, baker east, needs updated and a kitchen would be perfect."
College Senior,2,The housing on campus is so expensive. There is no social aspect to it.
College Senior,2,The people who work in the financial aid office are always rude.
College Sophomore,2,It's very hard to find housing. The college seems to have more students enroll every year and people start looking for housing two weeks into the fall semester since they seem to go fast.
College Junior,2,There is not enough housing for people that want to get apartments and wait lists are pages long. There is a very small variety of places to live and the newer apartment complexes are ridiculously priced and definitely is not affordable for the average college student.
College Junior,2,"I would never join Greek Life just because I don't believe in the whole concept and at Kent it is very easy to join a Sorority with people that are just like you. I think it is cliquey and very conforming. Although, they do a lot of great things for our community and other organizations."
College Freshman,2,Yeah our sports teams are pretty bad.
College Freshman,2,"To most, Greeks seem very rude and self-absorbed. A lot of jokes are made about them but people go to their parties anyways."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is a big party central at my school. There are some fraternities and sororities that do some community outreach programs but Greek life is known for throwing parties at my school.
College Senior,2,The speed of the network and the reliability of the network is very poor on campus. It often goes in and out of service throughout the day.
Junior,1,"Online platform that they use hasn't been updated in 6+ years.  It's slow as shit, full of problems, and online professors do the absolutely bare minimum to teach the already extremely outdated material."
Junior,1,Grossly overpriced would be the most important thing to get across.  They just raised tuition prices because of low enrollment (that'll really get people to be able to afford your school!) The education that you get for said price is absolutely garbage.  Professors do the bare minimum and use the same materials year after year after year.  I personally think Blackboard needs throw away.  How can you raise tuition by thousands of dollars and then not update your systems in 10 years?
Graduate Student,1,"If I could give Kent State 0 Stars, I would. I obtained my undergraduate degree (BBA in Marketing) from Kent and decided to continue for my MBA. Not only did they not offer the classes promised, they cancelled my concentration (Supply Chain Management) all together when I was in the middle of a semester. I was supposed to graduate in 1 year (Summer 2020) and they extended my program through Fall 2020 because the classes I needed were not offered. Many other students were told to re-evaluate their decisions by advisors and apply to other colleges like YSU or Akron. What university tells their students to go to another university?"
Graduate Student,1,"I take all of my classes online and none of the professor that Kent hires for the MBA program cares. They upload subpar materials and do not grade by the rubrics. I highly DO NO recommend this university. All they want is your butt in their seat, aka: your money."
Junior,1,The online classes when switched from traditional were awful. One professor used a new proctoring system that never worked. She often set it up wrong and we were not able to test if the application worked until it was time to test. This caused me to start many exams and quizzes with crying and overwhelming anxiety since we were often locked out of the tests without any help from the professor. We were left to our own devices a lot on a program that was setup incorrectly by our professor. Even the online technical issue department couldn't help.
Senior,1,I bet a hobo could become a professor here no standard of teaching and a waste of my time (senior of economics)
Niche User,1,"Took a class a few years back, withdrew 2 weeks in (I understand that I would be charged a bit), and was charged for the whole semester.  It was turned over to the Ohio Attorney General and of course Kent has done nothing about it.

Save your money kids, collage is a SCAM.  You can learn 90% of everything these crooks teach you online for free."
Sophomore,1,I have had the worst experience at this school. My first semester was drowned by a terrible roommate as well as an administration that only stepped in when said roommate vandalized the dorm. The rest of my year and a half has been utterly broken by pretentious and unfriendly fashion students that tote around their fast fashion as if they run the world. There is a difference between confidence and venting out your own insecurities on others. The rest of the kids here need a behavior check because they're either like rabid animals or utter sloths. REALLY unimpressed with this school overall. Don't even get me started about being on a meal plan with the foul faced servers that try and overcharge you every chance you get.
Alum,1,"don't let the beautiful campus fool you.

 the organizational system here is absolutely awful. when I had questions about my classes, dorms, or other administrative issues, nobody knew how to deal with them. I had to spend a lot a lot of time, going to different departments and people. each department/person would give me a different answer. i felt lost. 

also there is a lack of flexibility and compassion for the students. some departments and professor used their high social status to cover something they screwed up and blamed it on me. now I had to pay for this error for a very long time. one of the professor even tried to use irrelevant information against me and made illogical attacks so she can shut me up. how unethical! kent state totally screwed me over and I will never forget and forgive the people who used their power to oppress me."
College Freshman,1,Parties are constant Thursday through Sunday.
College Freshman,1,"Being a black student at Kent state university the black fraternities and sororities are subpar to be kind.  Are sororities a fraternities don't have any housing and haven't since the 50s a lot has changed since then but I don't see the University reaching out to them to help or the members of the sororities and fraternities to reach out and help from either feeling like they are not really apart of the campuses Greek life  since the loss of housing and the fact that most of the sororities fraternities have a great housing that are on campus but Fraternity Circle, University Circle it just seems like other fraternities and sororities get the funding in the members in the minority fraternity and sorority's"
College Sophomore,1,"Oh my gosh......just Google ""Kent State Football"" we are horrible! If youre a big football fan, pick another team to like because this isnt it. The basketball team is pretty good. They dont really promote other sports as much as football and basketball. The track team is pretty good too."
College Freshman,1,I find them to be a waste of time and money
College Sophomore,1,"Last football season Kent State was the worst team in the NCAA, so this very upsetting for a school that has nearly 30,000 students. Kent State also does not fund a mens soccer team, mens hockey, mens volleyball or mens lacrosse. They don't fund womens lacrosse, swimming, or diving. They school does a very bad job of promoting sporting events. The only publicity they receive is a sign outside of the MAC center which is the athletic building."
College Freshman,1,"The parties are good, but most Greek students I know are very stuck up and think they are better than nonGreek students."
College Sophomore,1,"I transferred and even though I was receiving scholarships at Cleveland State University, Kent did not give me one scholarship and I have to pay full tuition."
College Freshman,1,It's easy to not get caught
College Junior,1,Come your fasfa ASAP. The earlier you complete it sorta smooths the process a little bit.
College Junior,1,"All loans, no grants or scholarships. I was told grad students don't get any aid. My entire year is being covered through loans even though I've read about other schools supplying students with scholarships and grants. When I inquired about aid to help me, I received a very rude, unprofessional reply that nearly caused me to cancel everything and find a better school. I only hope that next year is better."
College Sophomore,1,So many people get away with it.
College Freshman,1,"It's been an awful year in Ohio- cold, rainy, windy and gray."
College Freshman,1,"I think that printing should be free because tuition is enough why should i pay $0.07 per page to print, it should be free. 

Then if you have a laptop on campus, I wish luck to everyone who is trying to connect to the Wi-Fi because it is horrible and takes forever to connect to. Then  after connected to it, the internet is so slow. So just go to the library or a lab to get on the computer but good luck finding on because usually everyone one of them is full."
College Junior,1,"It's horrible going to class in the freezing, cold"
College Sophomore,1,It is hard to get a scholarship.
College Freshman,1,The campus health center is awful. The people are rude and its inconvenient.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Really?  This is Northeast Ohio we're talking about here!  One minute the sun could be shining, the next minute it's freezing and the snow is blowing!  I dreaded the drive in on days when it was bad out.  Sometimes it took me over 3 hours to get to school because of the weather."
College Freshman,1,Kents windy and snowy weather is a hard struggle. When spring hits it's going to be beautiful.
College Sophomore,1,The Wi-Fi on the Kent Campus is terrible. It will make you mad many times.
College Freshman,1,"It's Ohio. The weather is always terrible, no matter what season. Just something you have to learn to live with."
College Junior,1,Advisors do nothing but try to keep you at this university for as long as they possibly can.
College Junior,1,Things are constantly breaking down or falling apart.
College Junior,1,"The entire campus is like a giant wind tunnel. In the winter the sidewalks and roads are barely plowed or salted. I have found myself walking to class through fields covered in snow rather than walking on the sidewalk because it is a solid sheet of ice. Rarely do we get cancellations due to weather in the winter, even when temperatures are in the -20s with windchill."
College Sophomore,1,There aren't too many kinds of people on campus. Many post-secondaries and non-traditional students.
College Freshman,1,Waited for a bus for 30 minutes and they wont wait for people trying to get on bus and you never know when it will come. Easier to walk
College Sophomore,1,Always cold and snowing. But it is very beautiful. 
College Freshman,1,At Kent State University you can experience all four seasons in one week.
College Junior,1,"As a commuter, I pay the same amount for a parking pass as everyone else does. On top of that I have to park 10-15 minutes away from campus and either walk or take a bus to get anywhere near my classes."
College Junior,1,"No convient parking spaces are ever open, they ticket like crazy. Any chance they get you will be given a ticket. The permit costs are crazy, its over 200 for the year of just commuter lots which are the worst parking on campus. Freshman have to park at the stadium which is over around two miles from campus and you need to take a bus to"
College Junior,1,"It is very windy. Campus is like a wind tunnel, people do occasionally get knocked down. Also the snow really affects the buses, they are already always late, snow makes it worse."
College Junior,1,Everyone uses a large amount of drugs and drink a lot. Its very easy to get access to all of the above.
College Freshman,1,You have to pay $150 to park three miles off campus at the football stadium. You have to take a shuttle to get there and usually there are no spots.
College Freshman,1,The financial aid process at Kent State University could be more efficient.
College Junior,1,I dont like the hole in the wall placs they have on campus. I prefer to drive up to cleveland
College Junior,1,"Kent State is known as a party school. A lot of people like to stay in and drink a few beers while playing video games or doing homework, but when it comes time for a party down town like College Fest, Pledge Week, Halloween... it can get really out of hand. The university and the city does a great job with the law enforcement during those times, but how much can you really control the students? Shooting us down and tear gas hasn't worked."
College Sophomore,1,"I can't honestly find many good scholarships Kent State has to offer, they are not very good at helping their students financially."
College Junior,1,There aren't enough parking spots to the amount of parking passes they sell. They also don't have any free parking anywhere for me to just park and do something really quickly!
College Senior,1,"I drive my car to campus and I find it to be very costly. Parking pass costs are very insane, $90-200$ per semester is crazy when you factor in how much tuition is already charging you. Finding a parking spot with your pass is also a hassle, sometimes they oversell making it very difficult. If you want a spot you have to leave at least 30 mins early. The bus service is usually running late also."
College Sophomore,1,Mother Nature at kent state is most deffiently on some kind of drug.
College Sophomore,1,"They gave me a couple scholarships, but my financial aid took forever to go through because it got audited. I seriously had the worse experience with getting financial aid. Kent doesn't play about getting their money, I had to pay almost $2000 out of pocket and I seriously don't have that type of money. So, if you plan on going here make sure you have the financial aspect covered or else there's no point in attending because they will kick you out until you paid off your debt in full."
College Sophomore,1,It is very difficult to find parking. Parking passes are also VERY expensive
College Senior,1,"Parking permits are way to expensive, especially when we are paying so much already just to attend the school. The parking spots are very far from classes, especially stadium parking and if you want a spot you better wake up at least 30 mins earlier than everyone else."
College Senior,1,"I have heard many students talking about parties and how there would be alot of drinking and drugs going on. A major problem with the location of the school is that there are alot of drug dealers that are around, especially for weed and crystal meth. Ith has become a major problem in northeast Ohio. There is alot of drug and alcohol visibility."
College Sophomore,1,"Kent weather is very fickle, and changes VERY often. One day it will be 78 degrees and the next it will be pushing 50. And the winters are harsh and awful, and main campus DOES NOT close for anything, so bring a good coat and boots! When it's nice out though campus is beautiful and very lively!"
College Freshman,1,"Kent is a predominantly white institution, so that's mainly what you see on campus. There is a pretty good number of international students on campus, but after that the rest of the other minorities are sprinkled about and hard to find. Also, beware of prejudice, racism, and closed-mindedness, as it is sadly bound to occur at some point if you are a minority ."
College Freshman,1,"Weather is horrible and bi-polar. Snow on monday, rain on tuesday, windy on wednesday and they're horrible at shoveling the snow sooo eh."
College Junior,1,"There is not nearly enough on campus parking at the school. They sell 200$ passes for parking, but sell more passes than parking spots so its a waste of money."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking can be a hassle. They are VERY serious about ticketing, and we have weird rules for some of our lots. Not to mention we just destroyed a good amount of our parking to put up more grass. You can park, it's just going to be a pain. Also freshman have to park all the way at the stadium."
College Freshman,1,"The weather is only enjoyable 2 or 3 months in the fall semester. The school for some crazy reason was designed for down south so there are many wind tunnels that take your breath away. Its a large campus and very spread out, making walking to class and food freezing and difficult. Because of the cold, snow and ice there's nothing going on. Because its so large the sidewalks don't get treated well and you fall a lot. There are red brick patches of the sidewalk that get super slick when wet and you will slip in any shoe."
College Freshman,1,"Although I myself do not drive, a lot of my friends do. The first few weeks of the semester are the worst for parking because everyone is showing up for their class. As the semester goes on people tend to start to skip more so parking is a little more reasonable. I would definitely plan on getting there early in case you park far away from your class and end up having to walk or take the bus."
College Sophomore,1,"Very few restaurants and shops around, even with renovation. Downtown has a few bars. Most locals are dope heads and anything past downtown or Walmart or the stadium is shady. Only  a few mile radius of Kent for the students."

Senior,5,"Professors here really care about your learning and will do anything they can to help you succeed as much as possible. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we took classes online, and every teacher was as accommodating as possible."
Sophomore,5,I love everything about the school. I love Providence so much because of the amazing people that it brought into my life. Providence has helped me develop as a man and as a student. I have learned so much and am grateful that I was able to come to such an amazing college.
Alum,5,I graduated from PC in 2019. I had a great experience. Wonderful professors and campus! I am now a year post grad and am about to start at MGH IHP Nursing school.
Junior,5,"Providence College is the most wonderful place in the world. Academics are challenging and eye opening, and the core curriculum challenges you to in all areas to become a responsible and well versed citizen by obtaining a well-rounded education. The Dominican Friars are amazing and their influence on the Catholic identity of the College is something that has changed my life for the better; their focus on study and truth has helped me to answer the biggest questions about life with faith and intellect."
Senior,5,Providence College allowed me to become an independent adult ready to enter the workforce with a great education. The relationships I have made have truly been special and made my time at PC unforgettable. GO FRIARS!!!!!!
Niche User,5,"The sense of community is amazing here! As a prospective student, I walked around campus knowing no one, yet I got so many smiles and ""Hello! How are you?"" comments. I absolutely love it here and look forward to applying."
Alum,5,"I enjoyed my time at PC very much. They are working on diversity which is great, because there wasn't much of it while I was there from 2010-2014. I was an Orientation Leader, which allowed me to help the freshmen, and I love PC's giving spirit."
Niche User,5,I loved the campus vibe and facilities. The weightroom and athletic facilities were especially nice.
Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere and sense of community among the students, faculty, and staff. The professors, for the most part, genuinely care about their students' learning. Athletics and Catholicism largely define the school. My only complaint is that the food could be better."
Junior,5,"So far Providence College has been an unforgettable experience. The campus is a family/friendly environment that it truly makes you feel at home. The professors and staff all over on campus are helpful in every way. There is so much to do on campus as well, that you will never feel bored."
Sophomore,5,I have only been at providence college for a year now. The college atmosphere is one of the best. The school wants to see the students succeed and gives the students all the resources to do well.
Junior,5,"Providence College is a fantastic liberal arts private college. Even though the food is not great, and the professors can be a bit conservative due to the Catholic affiliation, the overall quality of education and amazing student life and party scene. The housing situation improves over your years, and the lack of diversity could be bothersome to some."
Alum,5,I loved the biology department and felt it prepared so many students for medical school. The city of Providence is great.
Freshman,5,"The school overall has a very accepting and open feel. The food isn't as bad as people say it is, and you are in close distant to several major cities.  They also provide massive amounts of financial aid to the student in lower income brackets. The school is amazing and I advise those interested to take a deeper look at attending PC."
Niche User,5,Great food and atmosphere! The campus is amazing and the academics are unmatched. The campus is close to the city part of Providence so a quick change from deep city to more of a serene campus is only a 5 minute drive. All of the teachers were delightful and I would definitely recommend anyone who is considering to go here to definitely check it out!
Niche User,5,"Providence College is the most adorable college. It is a small Jesuit college in the hipster-filled town of Providence, RI. PC has the classic New England aesthetic I love, yet also provides the D1 school most college students seek. The Friar Family is has, in my opinion, the most tight knit and spirited fans out of all colleges. PC is home of many traditions: Sunday night masses and the intense intramural championship to earn the sacred winning shirts."
Freshman,5,Providence has given me the opportunity to know different cultures. The campus is safe and has access to different areas of study. The area of ​​academic counseling is excellent. They keep us well informed about what is happening in our community.
Alum,5,Providence College really was as they say my Friar Family for the past four years and I am proud to say that I am an Alum from such a college.
Sophomore,5,"I love Providence College. As a current student, I am so grateful for my time I have had so far here. I have thrived in and out of the classroom, and have met friends I will stay in touch with forever."
Sophomore,5,"I love the atmosphere and the people! The Civ program is actually enjoyable for me, and I adore every second I'm on campus. Could not be happier that I chose Providence College!"
Freshman,5,"During my time at Providence College, I had an eventful time. Both the professors and students have outstanding personalities, and it makes the campus brighter. I love how there are numerous universities in the city and Brown University adds another beauty to this city. If you are in the mood for some Italian food, I recommend Federal Hill because it is exceptional! Unfortunately, the university was too small, and I am now transferring, but this university was one of the best things to happen to me because it has helped me shape who I am. I made many friends, and I am forever grateful!"
Sophomore,5,"Providence College has given me some of the best experiences of my life both in and out of the classroom. I love going to my classes, especially Development of Western Civilizations, Philosophy, Theology, and Mathematics. The professors are devoted, understanding, and incredibly intelligent. I know I am learning things I could not have learned anywhere else. It is so easy to get involved, the campus is beautiful, and I have made lifelong friends. Everyone smiles at each other, holds doors open for one another, and waves a friendly hello, even if it is to a complete stranger."
Junior,5,This school overall is a great place to go to college. Students here are very friendly and everyone looks out for one another. One thing they need to work on is the housing situation. Housing is far too expensive and there are not enough rooms for everyone on campus.
Freshman,5,I love the atmosphere and being a part of the friar family. My mom and grandfather both went here and it was all I had expected it to be. This first semester has been absolutely amazing and I am so happy to experience the next three years.
Sophomore,5,"Providence College is a great place to be. The professors really help the students develop skills for the real world. The facilities and gym are nice and well kept. Th food could definitely improve, but is not terrible."
Senior,5,"I could not imagine going to another college. The opportunities I've had at PC are incomparable. The smaller class size has allowed me to flourish as a student and get the most out of my education. Some of my professors have basically become parents for me and I've even gone to some of their homes. They truly do care for their students and you will never have someone other than your professor teaching the class. 
I have had many different internship and research opportunities that I have enjoyed very much. PC does a fantastic job helping students find internships in their home town, in Providence, or wherever you want to work. PC students work hard and play hard. We take our academics seriously and then reward ourselves on the weekend. The city of Providence is a fun place to be too. 

If you get in to PC and don't go... you're making the biggest mistake of your life."
Freshman,5,I haven't even started and I already love it. Everyone treats each other with respect and it is a very close knit community. Great diversity of activities and growing diversity in student body. Love it.
Freshman,5,"Awesome school.  Great people, and a great dorm environment.  Good social life.  A ton of stuff to do like intramural sports to exploring the city of Providence."
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman here at PC and one thing I know for SURE is that I made the right choice coming to this school. The community is nothing but welcoming with open arms and love. The academics are beyond wonderful and I know I am getting a top notch education here. Even though this may be a small school in size, it feels like a huge one with all the school spirit and the kindness that is spread through out campus, daily. Whether that is holding doors for strangers or helping your friends with homework, the kindness does not go unnoticed. The staff here is extremely generous and will do anything for their students. The safety here is nothing like any other school. I always know I am in excellent hands with the safety and security team here at PC. This will always be my second home. Friar. Family. Together. Forever. !!!"
Sophomore,5,"I love the beauty of a school that still values a broad, liberal arts education. We take a course called Development of Western Civilization for 4 semesters, and it basically starts with the Greeks and moves forward looking at everything through the lens of English, Philosophy, and Literature. It is taught by a team of three professors and they all listen to each other  lecture, so the teachers are learning with you."
Junior,5,"Providence College is an amazing institution. The fact that it is a Catholic school makes it feel like a family due to the faithful foundation, regardless of any personal beliefs/values. The professors are extremely helpful and are masters at their subjects. There is always somewhere to go for help whether it be the free tutoring center or a professor's office hours. Something that I would like to see change is the conservative habits and alternatively transforming with the liberal world around us. "
College Junior,5,The basketball games are the absolute best games.
College Junior,5,"Providence College has truly changed my life.  I have had great experiences in my classes.  I have not only excelled in the classroom, but have become friends with my classmates and professors.  Outside of the classroom I have met a great group of friends who I know I will be friends with for the rest of my life."
College Sophomore,5,I love it. Its my home. Wouldnt chose anywhere else.
College Sophomore,5,A lot of success after life at PC.
College Sophomore,5,Feel very safe to walk on campus at any time at night.
College Sophomore,5,Gym is amazing for everyone. Big basketball school.
College Junior,5,"A degree from Providence College is a ticket to the world. Not only are you well prepared for the future, but you have the connections to go anywhere you want to go. Companies are eager to hire Providence College students and are always on campus advertising employment opportunities, and PC alumni are especially eager to help out fellow Friars. The alumni association is one of the strongest in the country, and provides security that you will find a job after graduation."
College Junior,5,"Classes are small, professors get to know their students on a personal level and really look out for them, all faculty and staff are aware and sensitive to the needs of students, courses really challenge students, and the liberal arts requirements shape extremely well-rounded individuals. Providence College prepares students for the workforce and future social encounters, provides an education comprised of both hard and soft skills, and maintains an environment of respect between students and faculty and staff that allows everyone to grow and flourish."
College Junior,5,"Providence College has opened my mind to so many new ideas, challenged me not only academically, but also mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. The people I have surrounded myself with bring out the best in me, inspire me to reach higher, give me opportunities to grow, force me to recognize what I am capable of, and have led me to find who I really am."
College Sophomore,5,"I think my favorite part about Providence College is the growth that I have experienced there. The people I met during my first year are those whom I know will be in my life for a very long time. They are people who have pushed me and inspired me to strive to tap into and reach my full potential, something that didn't really happen in high school and at home. As cheesy and pamphlet-y as it sounds, there really is a sense of community you feel with the other students. Age differences don't matter there. Some of my best friends that I made this past year were seniors, and they taught me so much in just one year. There's just something about PC that makes you feel as though you really are a part of a family. I would one thousand percent choose this school again if I could do it all over."
College Freshman,5,PC is a fun and safe school. You can always find something to do however most people participate in the party scene. The students tend to be pretty smart with it though. The majority of groups have at least one sober friend who is willing to be responsible for the night. The social scene is always fun.
College Freshman,5,The sports are a huge part of the school and are always big social events. Some of the athletes are looked at as celebrities which is kind of funny but the school spirit here is always above average.
College Freshman,5,I have grown to absolutely love PC and everything it has to offer. I truly feel like I have found my family and look forward to what's in store. College is what you make of it no matter where you go and PC can be anything you want it to be. I am so thankful for the amazing students and professors I have met and know these relationships will carry me through.
College Junior,5,So glad I came here!
College Junior,5,Alumni at PC is tops!  Jobs are waiting for the graduates!
College Junior,5,Sports are huge at Providence!
College Freshman,5,Basketball and hockey are big here
College Freshman,5,The athletics are a great part of the experience
College Freshman,5,"The career center is THE BEST. They will help you with everything. Make a perfect resume, cover letter, master an interview... you name it, they'll help. Alumni network is good but not huge."
College Freshman,5,"Going to basketball games and hockey games are really fun. Everyone goes and the environment is awesome. Intramurals are also fun, so get involved in a lot of them. The fitness center is new and updated and has great equipment."
College Freshman,5,There's always something to do
College Sophomore,5,Providence College is the best. There are so many people that are warm and the liberal arts honors program is fantastic at giving opportunities and helping students succeed.
College Freshman,5,"I thought diversity was not going to be a big thing in Providence, but I am surprised at the amount of diversity it has. There are people from many places around the world. I have made friends from places like Africa, Guatemala, Puerto Rico, and Ecuador."
College Freshman,5,The tutors offered for students are great resources to have. They help especially with CIV.
College Freshman,5,"I am not so sure about the saftey of the campus. There has been many robberies in students apartments. Also, the security does not really check who enters the campus very well. almost anyone can enter most of the time."
College Freshman,5,The professors that I have had have shown a great importance towards their students education. They show that they care and are willing to meet with their students even when time is limited. One of my favorite professors that I had was in my Intro to Acting class. My professor's desire to teach and make a difference in the students acting abilities really shined in every class.
College Freshman,5,"Providence College has many resources that help students with their future by having professionals check students resumes, and fairs where companys from all over come to talk to students about future possibilitites."
College Freshman,5,"At first I was very homesick, but with the help of my roommate and friends on my floor, I have grown to love my residence hall. There are events that happen every week in the building that allows the students to socialize and meet other people on the floor. Events such as pizza night or ""netflex and chill"" happen. The residence activities help each student feel welcomed and more comforatble in the enviornment."
College Freshman,5,"Students show their love and appreciation for Providence College's sports teams. Students go and support their peers in  games, making it more memorable for the players themselves."
Junior,4,The online learning experience was easily adaptable to student. The school made it is best effort to buy the best software so the student could have the best experience.
Junior,4,"The overall experience is pleasant. The academic challenge to you to be a better student every day.  The professors are invested  in the education they give to you. they truly only want you to succeed,"
Senior,4,"I love the overall status of Providence Colllege. I am granted with meeting alumni, amazing faculty who want to help all students succeed. However, the status of financial aid should be fixed."
Freshman,4,"Not my first choice but I’ve never been happier. Some kids here are privileged, shallow, and disconnected, but if you look around you will find amazing people that fit your vibe. Classes are amazing, the professors really want you to succeed and the small class size allows you to get to know them more personally. It’s an amazing place to network. Party scene is there if you want it, but there’s always something to do if you’re not into that. They improved the food second semester and it was really going great!  The college could definitely be more diverse and welcoming towards low income students, but there are safe spaces and good and down to earth people, you just need to know where to look."
Senior,4,"Providence College was not my first choice school. After four years here, however, I am able to say that it is my home away from home. I have grown so much over the past four years thanks to all the people I have met, the professors that have pushed me, and the opportunities that I would not have had anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"While things haven't always been easy for me at PC, it has been great overall. You definitely get out of it what you put into it. my suggestion is to get involved"
Alum,4,"A quality educational experience where had dedicated professors who took pride in jobs. The school also had enjoyable activities from intramural sports, college sports, and other on campus activities. The location was amazing as it was close to downtown Providence but still far enough away where you did not feel like you were in the city."
Senior,4,"While my personal experience at PC has been great, there are a lot of underlaying diversity issues on our campus. Providence College is not a very diverse campus. However, they try to put up an image of diversity. In addition, the clubs on campus are very exclusive, and prevent students from getting involved. Lack of inclusivity and lack of diversity are two components that have displeased me at this school. Nonetheless, I was lucky enough to find a great group of friends my freshman year, and they are truly the reason I have been able to have such a great personal experience."
Freshman,4,"Overall, PC is a great place if you make the most of it and try to do something you enjoy.  If you do not get involved, you are losing out.  If you do, you will likely find your people and have a great time."
Freshman,4,I love the opportunities I have gotten at Providence College and the professors are always available to help students. The School of Business is great and has strong connections with big companies.
Freshman,4,"I am only a freshman, but I loved PC from the moment I stepped on campus. It has a great community feel to it, and I am very comfortable on campus. The food is not good. At all, except for the options that are not included in your meal plan. The dorms are old, but homey. Most of the people I have met are super nice and want you to do well. They really focus on human flourishing, not just giving you a degree and kicking you out. The pros outweigh the cons."
Freshman,4,"The food that is provided at Raymond Dining Hall is terrible, but is almost your only option since it is serviced by swipes. However, Alumni Hall is slightly better, but you must use your coveted friar bucks. The surrounding area is super sketchy but the overall location is super convenient. Campus is gorgeous and everyone is super friendly as well as the professors. The dorms are your typical dorms; not incredible not horrible. Overall, I love my school, but there are definitely some things that could be improved."
Alum,4,"Loved PC. Its a small campus but I think it has a more homey feel to it because of that. Class rooms are not giant lecture halls, you have more opportunity to discuss with the professors and actually have you questions answered in a timely manner."
Sophomore,4,"One thing I love about PC is the small-campus community feel while being able to see a new face every day. Being in Providence means there is always something to do or new to try. While it may not be the safest city, campus security helps make PC feel like it is in its own ""bubble"". Even though the food is not the best on campus, do not feel discouraged because the food off campus is always a hit! Dorms are mostly average, some are great while some of the older buildings definitely need renovation. Athletics are a big plus to this school whether you will be playing or in the audience. The school is strongly affiliated with the Catholic faith, however, all of the professors and Dominican Friars will be welcoming of all religious backgrounds. Also, PC may be lacking in diversity but I can tell they are trying to be more inclusive, especially when it comes to clubs and organizations. Overall, a great (and expensive) school. I am very proud to call myself a Friar!"
Sophomore,4,"The challenging academics and great networking connections. Ability to create clubs for every student, a lot of student involvement. Great athletic programs and school spirit. They have programs on weekend nights to get off campus and explore the surrounding area that are free and fun. The food is the number one thing that should be changed, poor quality. Great student centers and plenty of opportunity to get extra help outside of class such as tutoring or writing center. Professors are typically very nice and understanding of student course load."
Junior,4,"Providence College is an amazing school not that I'm being bias or anything. Professor and staff wants students to pursued our dreams. Even outside of the campus, we have a speacial bond."
Sophomore,4,It's a fun place with great students and great professors. People are very friendly and there's always activities on or around campus.
Freshman,4,"easy to move in ability to meet a lot of people, accessible to downtown dorms could be more roomy grounds are nice and athletics are good.  class size average professors are good"
College Junior,4,My professors related to my majors have been excellent
College Junior,4,The alumni network is phenomenal
College Freshman,4,Great atmosphere and great class choices. Awesome so far!
College Sophomore,4,Have the space I need. Everything fits perfectly.
College Sophomore,4,I found my group of friends and thia is my home. love it
College Junior,4,"The only time I ever feel unsafe while at school is when walking off campus in the surrounding neighborhood. Security is quick to respond whenever they are called for a dispute, and I have never had anything stolen while on campus, nor have any of my friends (to my knowledge). Sexual assault is not talked about frequently, but there have been a few cases that I have heard about during my time at PC. Various offices, including residence life, student affairs, and campus ministry work hard to prevent sexual assault as well as provide support services for victims of sexual assault."
College Junior,4,"The residence halls are structurally great! For those on lower campus, getting to class or to buildings around campus can be daunting and very time consuming. Social atmosphere and residential community is great in underclassmen dorms, but is much more difficult to achieve in suites and apartment-style resident halls."
College Junior,4,"Sporting events really unite the student body! It's a shame that many of our sports are overshadowed by the popularity of the men's hockey and basketball teams, but there is great support for all of our student athletes. Most of the student population played sports in high school, and it shows with the quality of our athletic facilities, attendance at the gym, and participation in intramural and club sports."
College Sophomore,4,"The courses themselves are interesting, and most of the professors are also engaging. I had a few that were somewhat uninspiring, but those are kind of exceptions. The Development of Western Civilization program, though most people (and honestly including me on occasion) complain about it, is really an interesting and unique program that, when taken seriously by the students, can do so much to help broaden one's understanding of the world we live in today."
College Sophomore,4,"The network of alumni who help students is known throughout campus as being very available and useful to students looking for jobs after graduation. I've never been to the career center, so I can't really talk about any personal experiences with it, but I hear good things."
College Sophomore,4,Students are really involved in intramural sports and the friendly competitive spirit is also really awesome for morale. Student fan support at the basketball and ice hockey games is incredible.
College Freshman,4,"I love the majority of my professors, like every school there are a few that you have to avoid but if you do what you're suppose to most of the professors are there to help and want to see you succeed. I have never had a bad experience with a professor. This makes going to class much more enjoyable."
College Freshman,4,"Although I have not really attempted finding any real internships or jobs, I have heard nothing but positive experiences when it comes to the alumni network. I went to the career center once and because I live outside of the immediate area (Providence, Boston) they didn't have too many options however they were and will be happy to help in the future."
College Junior,4,"Providence works hard to ensure safety,"
College Freshman,4,"I know people go to bars and clubs; my roommate and her friends were some of many. I preferred to go to parties on or near campus that were hosted by people I knew and I always went with a group of friends. That's something unique about the community: no matter how messed up someone gets at a party, if they go with friends, their Friar family will bring them home safely."
College Freshman,4,"There are very few parties on weeknights, but sometimes there are a few on Wednesdays and Thursdays. There are always parties somewhere (on or off campus) on Fridays and Saturdays. Even if people don't plan on hosting a party, they gather with a group of friends who bring alcohol and music, and it turns into a party. Most of the parties are really fun, especially if they are with friends. They also tend to die out as the night gets later; many parties don't last past 2am."
College Freshman,4,"Every class tries to relate to another. Students have many different opinions on Civ, but many have said in the end, that the class was useful and helpful to their ultimate goal of study. It helped broaden their horizons, and in some cases, encouraged a few to pick up another major or minor."
College Freshman,4,Campus is safe. surrounding area could be safer
College Freshman,4,Teachers and class sizes are great
College Freshman,4,Campus housing is pretty good. The only thing that stinks about it is the lottery system. Housing selection can be a hassle
College Freshman,4,We have a great athletic program and facilities to make participation possible.
College Freshman,4,"The professors I've had have been good. The dorms are really not that terrible at all, and the party scene is great. There's always something going on on campus. The only bad thing about the school is the housing process. It's on a lottery basis and is done completely randomly, which can be frustrating at times."
College Freshman,4,"The security on campus is of the best quality. People tend to walk in groups on campus, so it's easy to stick with friends. Everyone encourages safety, especially students. I know that even if I leave campus, if I travel with fellow Friars, we all look out for each other."
College Freshman,4,"The professors are very friendly and approachable. The work provides an adequate, manageable challenge. I've found a variety of courses that suit my fancy, and the program set up for my major allows me to learn as much as possible both in and outside of my major."
College Freshman,4,"The rooms are small, but that's to be expected for a dorm. The rooms are efficient and functional. The bathrooms are cleaned on a regular basis. Most of the housing is in the middle of campus and a quick 2-10 minute walk to any building on campus, including the dining halls. It tends to be a pain to find roommates and get the housing you want though."
College Freshman,4,"Everyone gets excited about the basketball and hockey games. People cheer at the games, and those who aren't there in person usually watch on television or keep updated on scores and wins. However, it can seem a little obsessive sometimes when everything on campus revolves around the sports."
College Freshman,4,I've learned more than I ever expected and I have opportunities that have not been previously available. Not to mention I have awesome friends who I suspect to keep in touch with even after graduation.
College Freshman,4,Safety is a huge part of the PC community
College Freshman,4,Very helpful department and very concerned with it
College Freshman,4,The social aspect is great and makes it very comfy
College Freshman,4,PC is a great experience and very vigorous!
College Sophomore,4,"Transport is common, sexual assault and crimes are not rare but not common, just be careful in general. But pretty safe"
College Sophomore,4,"Science classes and major's classes are the hardest, I personally found civ easy and enjoyable but oly because I read every article, book , pamphlet they gave and took notes and was able to remeber nearly all of it. Have fun and study, especially for civ!"
College Sophomore,4,"It depends on where you live, they are kept clean according to how much the people on your floor want it clean. But kept clean by the cleaning crew and they do a great job."
College Sophomore,4,"You cannot go anywhere without being reminded of the athletics, we are division 1 I believe and have one of the best hockey and basketball teams in the college level in the nation. A lot of place for athletics and everything associated with them."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my school, bingo, clubs, there is no shortage of fun stuff to do. Fairly easy to gain admission in to but courses are not that easy."
College Freshman,4,Professors are generally nice. Research them before to make sure you are picking the good ones with the best reputation. This will help you get a good grade especially for civ where your teacher basically is the determining factor of your experience in the class.
College Freshman,4,"Providence College is great. The academics are good and professors (mostly) care about you. Go to office hours to get them to like you more. Food isn't the best, but once your past freshman year you can downgrade your meal plan and use more money off campus. Downtown Prov has a lot to do and some of the best restaurants I've ever been to. There is always stuff to do on the weekends whether its going to off campus parties, bars, or activities put on by the school for kids who dont like to go out."
College Freshman,4,Great academics! Students are very studious
College Freshman,4,Rarely see hard drugs on campus
College Freshman,4,"I love going to games, the gym and club sports are awesome."
College Sophomore,4,Getting a degree from this school is very important and impressive.
Freshman,2,"PC is definitely a party school and pretty much everything seems to revolve around going out every night and ofc dartys on Saturday.  There is little to no diversity and at least 80% of the kids seem to be from Mass.  The food is awful, they even find ways to make the pasta taste bad. It's also extremely difficult to find healthy options. Found students to be very complacent and cliquey. The campus itself is very pretty and they have great facilities, also a majority of the professors are top-notch. However, I will be transferring."
Freshman,2,"I’m not usually the type to right reviews on things, but I feel that it’s important to tell people about the reality of PC. The culture of the school is based solely around drinking, so if your not about that then don’t apply here. Not to mention the clear racial divide.  Secondly, there just wasn’t enough to do at all. The school is small and there is essentially no way to get away from campus and into nature. I was trapped. A third thing is that the kids are not inclusive and accepting. It seemed as though groups were established the first week of school and nothing changed after that. Overall I would not recommend this school to anyone. Needless to say, I will be transferring the next chance I get."
Junior,2,"Took only one winter course. Highly demanding for a winter course with so much material, and difficult to reach the professor for help."
Freshman,2,"The food is horrid.  Parasites, glass, mold, under cooked meat...for real. In November they stopped serving codfish due to a ringworm parasite. Most all the choices are highly processed and kids get sick all the time.  Check out all the violations from health department inspections before you pay to come here.  They work really hard at recruiting but once you're here  you can see it's clear that nobody cares about the food or the disgusting dorms."
Alum,2,"Entitled, white and rich student body - mostly average achievers. Inconsistent professors but the stand outs have been amazing. Town, dorms, and food are barely adequate. Safety issues are just a stone’s throw from campus."
Sophomore,2,"Listen, I’m going to be straight up. If you’re from providence, Massachusetts, or New York, you’ll have a great time. If you’re not...Goodluck because it sucks. People are so cliquey it’ll feel like you’re in high school with slightly more people. The people here are like 12 year old girls. It’s actually unbelievable."
College Freshman,2,"3 months in to freshman year and I am still strongly considering transferring. The size is great and the campus is gorgeous. I have also had great professors. However, it is the people that have made it difficult. If you are from New England, are white, wealthy, went to private catholic school, wear Lilly Pulitzer and J.Crew exclusively, and know people from your high school that go here or have a sibling here: you will fit in. If not, you will have a hard time making friends. Also, if you are not interested in getting black out drunk wed-sat nights, you will have a difficult time feeling like you belong."
College Freshman,2,I do not know why this college has a party scene reputation. A majority of the freshman class are two beer queers. The parties are fun if you are blackout and don't mind dealing with asshole seniors who demand money from freshman girls.
College Freshman,2,"Looking at the school from an academic standpoint, it is a good fit for someone who wants the traditional catholic education. Certain departments are excellent while some are a complete joke. I would not suggest coming here unless you have a strong interest in either Biology or Business."
College Freshman,2,"The food is the worst part about PC. If you're lucky there will be two or three appetizing meals offered in Ray a week, but most of the time I either eat pizza or salad. Alumni is better than Ray but the options are much less healthy."
College Freshman,2,"Outside of the college, the place is run down."
College Junior,2,"Many students are of the same race and social/economic background with little diversity.  This is not necessarily a bad thing, but the school makes sure to point out the differences between students of different ethnicity by assigning the racially diverse students a Dean of Multicultural Students."
College Junior,2,"The locals seem to generally dislike the students and often prey on their obliviousness.  However, the local transportation is easily maneuverable and the dining, nightlife, and shopping is good."
College Freshman,2,Parking on campus seems to be a hassle. I have never had a car on campus although I've tried and found that no one is very helpful when asked. It is competitive.
College Freshman,2,Most kids are preppy and think that everything can be handed to them.
College Freshman,2,"Diversity is a huge problem.  The campus is made up of mostly white, upper/middle-class, Catholic students.  While there are several spectacular organizations on campus that do fantastic work to create a good atmosphere for racial and sexual-preference minorities, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done."
College Sophomore,2,"The internet at PC sucks.  It's very weak, especially in the dorms, and isn't very reliable.  You can do your online homework in a computer lab or on the library computers, but it's more of a hassle."
College Freshman,2,I did get a good amount of financial aid but it was a big pain to go through the process. I recieved my final finanical aid package like 3 months after my friends going to other schools.
College Freshman,2,Although mostly everyone is white there are still more black people than you would think!
College Freshman,2,"Panera and Cheesecake Factory and American Joes. That's it. Other questionable food places lie near Johnson and Wales University, downtown, but I'd be cautious when trying something new."
College Freshman,2,"Realistically PC is not a diverse place, although the freshman class is said to be ""the most diverse class in the history of the college"". For the most part, everyone here dresses similar and comes from very similar backgrounds, with money not being a problem for most students on campus. A lot of people feel the need to fit in with everyone else which brings down the diversity even more. I'd prefer it be more diverse... hopefully it will get there one day."
College Freshman,2,"Seriously, the food is probably the worst part about PC. I mean, you can live off of it, but it's definitely worse than my high school cafeteria food."
College Freshman,2,No variety and bad quality
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is not great, but it does not really affect my experience at the school. It usually rains once a week. It gives me an excuse to wear my rain jacket, which I look snazzy in by the way."
College Junior,2,"There are 2 dining halls on the providence college campus,raymond hall(casually referred to as ray) and alumni. The food at ray according to many is sub par but as long as you get a little variety every day and dont stick to the same meals its not too bad in ray. Alumni is expensive by any standard especially by a college student perspective but you pay what you get for it is usually pretty good."
College Freshman,2,"PC is reknown for its students' wild partying, underaged drinking, and drug use with limited interference, and is in this way lenient, but it also is reknown for its strict parietals. There is no comfortable way of getting around them, nor is there any comfortable way of getting over that men and women should be kept so separate. It is a Catholic school run by friars themselves, though, and the school stays true to its dogmatism."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Little to no hard drug use, except among a few small groups of friends. Little smoking. Significant alcohol use."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is not that diverse, mainly white people, although more and more people of different backgrounds are coming to the school. The Friar community is very accepting of everyone."
College Freshman,2,"What I have seen is decent, just don't expect anything fancy."
College Junior,2,"We're Open Minded but Not Physically Diverse – Providence College students are for the most part very open minded and accepting of students of a different nationality, sexual orientation, religion etc. However our school is very homogenous in all of these areas. There aren't any instances of discrimination that I have come into contact with, except one this past year where a racist comment was written in one of the dorm bathrooms. The school freaked out and the entire hall was put on probation until someone came forward and said they wrote the statement. Providence takes safety very seriously and wants every student to feel welcome and at home on campus. This means there is no room for hate or bullying. Student Congress just passed the anti-bulling legislation this past year and organizations such as SHEPARD (Stop Homophobia End Prejudice and Restore Dignity) have a noticeable presence on campus and an office in the student union."
College Junior,2,"It is common for students to choose to live off-campus their senior year at PC. Many male students choose to live off junior year as well because the off-campus houses are notorious for ticket parties and annual celebrations. However if you're looking for a clean place to come home to at the end of a long day of class, off-campus living does not provide the best accommodations. There are places that are nice but the vast majority of off-campus housing is dirty and old. Landlords promise to make renovations every year, but those are big words when a guy is showing you a house with a hole in the wall (literally this happened to me). Students love the atmosphere of off-campus living because you don't have to deal with a hall director or RA, but with great power comes great responsibility. You have to get on your roommates to make sure they send payments on time each month and make sure you're signing a lease with a reliable landlord. If you sign with your good friends who you trust, off-campus living can be fun for upperclassmen. Just remember to be safe because the houses are in a dangerous area of Providence and break-ins are common during winter break and summer vacation when students leave the houses."
College Sophomore,2,"It's Catholic School. As much as I love PC, it isn't very diverse. However, many programs and clubs are directed towards improving the diversity of the school and raising awareness towards the minorities on campus. Although ethnicity and social class may be relatively similar among students, it's important to keep in mind that people come from a variety of different states and upbringings."
Recent Alumnus,2,Typical: Unless You Get Away from the Everyday Mcdonald's and Burger Kings – Go ethnic and experience some of Providence's African cuisine...it's great!!!
College Sophomore,2,Financial  Aide – It has been  very  mixed  because  sallie  mae   has been  great   but   my   parents  can not get  any loans  and  are  always  denied. I  have  no  cosigners   and   I  can't  get  any  help   regarding   how  to   finance  my   education  with poor or no   credit  and  middle income  family.
College Sophomore,2,"there  are some  great  apartments  but they  are  quite   costly  and  the ones  that  are more  reasonable   are in  very poor unsafe  areas. I  am  going  into  an  apartment  next  fall   mostly because I  can  not  afford  to live on  campus  and  I  am  hoping  that   this  will  help. the  lococal area    is unsafe  to  walk  to  places  for  shopping,  eating  and   I will have  to  get   a   car."
College Freshman,2,I Hate It – So I am currently a freshman at Providence College and I completely hate it. This school is very closed minded. I am looking to transfer soon.
College Student,2,The computers are terrible. The keys are sticky and just in general are slow. Not to mention the wifi here is very weak. Printing is pretty easy
College Freshman,2,"Can't say I love it. Rumor has it that it takes some getting used to so I haven't filled out my transfer applications just yet, but its very hard to adjust to college life here. Your social life depends completely on where you live and who you already know. The food makes you sick for the first 3 weeks. And you will never ever find time to sleep, especially not during orientation."
College Freshman,2,News Flash: College Students Don't Want the Blue Plate Special! Raymond Hall is never open when I'm hungry! -It closes at 6:30 on Saturdays and 7:00 on Sundays! Who eats that early? I always end up spending money in Alumni Hall even though I already spent money on my meal plan. The food is edible but I definitely miss home cooked meals.
College Junior,2,"Everything Is About Friendship – If you know the right people, you can get away with anything. If you and an RA are cool, they will typically allow you to do things that other RAs don't allow. Bottomline: Become friends with everyone on campus and you rule the campus. Also getting into Friar's Club (the only fraternity on campus) will give some of the same perks."
Junior,1,"Almost no diversity or inclusivity. There's a reason this is a very segregated school and is acknowledged correctly as so. It is also highly sexist and homophobic. It also has a poor reputation when it comes to handling sexual assault and racist incidents. The reputation of its sports teams is all that matters, not the safety or wellbeing of its students. I am happy to have transferred and never graduated here. If you're not white, wealthy, Catholic, drink accessibly, and are not (preferably) male, you won't belong here, and you may not even be safe here."
Freshman,1,No online experience. But again I hope students look elsewhere for their college education. Research safe schools and stay far away from PC
Freshman,1,"This school will not protect you. They only care about themselves and their reputation. Please if you’re considering this school, I beg you to go elsewhere"
Senior,1,"Please renovate the dorms and improve the quality of the food....going into massive debt to go here while the education and athletics have been average at best. The campus is not secure (people from town are constantly walking through) and theft and sexual harassment are not uncommon. Have had some great classes and professors although it’s been hit or miss. For the most part, kids are white and wealthy."
Sophomore,1,"This school is not what I expected at all. I thought I would really enjoy my college experience, however that is not the case. The students are cliquey and unfriendly, and often times rude to your face. They are not welcoming at all, especially the blondes, beware. The academics are decent, this is quite possibly the only area I do not have a complaint regarding.  However, they will somehow incorporate God into every class you take even business ones. The food leaves much to be desired and the freshman and sophomore dorms are run down and need a major face lift. The party scene is practically nonexistent, the extend of ""going out"" involves standing in a room with people who clearly do not care if you are there or not. I entirely regret my decision to come here and I would not recommend this school to my worst enemy."
Sophomore,1,Let me tell you something about this school. HORRID. the girls are cliquey and rude and into themselves. AND SECOND. I was walking to class in A HURRICANE and almost got blown over by the 80mph wind.. My professors refused to cancel my classes so I almost died walking to them when I saw a tree branch fall right in front of me. THANK YOU- DO NOT COME HERE. you will die because of the terrible campus safety. oh but one good thing! There are fireworks every night!- oh wait never mind those were gunshots.
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly I am not a fan of the security team and the health center. The only place I have felt safe and valued is at the Personal Counseling Center. I felt belittled and ashamed of being sick at the health center, and I felt embarrassed FOR and exploited by our safety and security team when asked about sexual assault because it is beyond clear that they only care about covering it up and keeping PC's image intact."
College Freshman,1,"I feel a bit too safe on campus. Constantly have eyes on you due to the small size of the school. If you're someone who enjoys smoking marijuana this is not the right school for you. Getting caught even twice puts you on deferred suspension, and security and the office of community standards is extremely harsh and almost cruel. Honestly, I have never been treated with less respect and understanding than that of the Providence College safety and security."
College Junior,1,We don't have greek life.
College Junior,1,We do not have Greek life.
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid process is pretty messed up here. There is an obvious preference toward Catholic school kids when distributing aid. Let me put it to you like this: I was in the National Honors Society in high school, a mainly A's with a few B's student. I took 7 AP tests, got all 4s and 5s. I went to a public high school that was recently ranked 25th best in Massachusetts, including private schools. I got no financial aid from the school, despite multiple attempts speaking with the financial aid office. I know someone who went to the local Catholic school in my town, which is on the verge of being bulldozed and turned into a parking garage. This is a notoriously bad school in our town. She had mostly B's, which is very good. She applied here and got more than half the tuition for a scholarship. To me, the financial aid process does not seem fair. If you want to come here and need financial aid either transfer to a Catholic school or hope you get lots of scholarships through other organizations."
College Freshman,1,"Providence College is not a very diverse college. It is a predominantly white, Catholic campus. Recently the college has been putting an emphasis on diversity, but in an incredibly forced way. Students are being admitted to the college solely based on race or socioeconomic status, and this has been harmful because it has created tension among students. It is important to remember that the majority of kids who enroll here are white, upper middle class, conservative Catholic high school graduates. It has a reputation as a school for the privileged and, despite the college's efforts to change this, I don't see this changing in the near future. As a graduate of a large, diverse public high school, the transition from high school to college has been difficult to adjust to in terms of diversity."
College Freshman,1,Very small amount of diversity. The school only accepts a certain number of students to fulfill a quota.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek Life
College Freshman,1,"The college struggles with diversity and tries to bring more diverse students here to integrate the students, but does nothing to help them so it is a disaster. I, myself, embrace diversity but the school does not. There are various diversity clubs on campus but nobody else joins- I think mostly because the non-diverse students think they are not welcome, but also because there is a general ""racism"" that floats in the minds of all these east-coasters, but that is an incredibly accepting west-coaster speaking on behalf of what I hear from other non-diverse students at this school. Also, this school, because it is religious, struggles to accept varying sexualities and this has become a real problem."
College Freshman,1,"I want to study Environmental Studies and this major is not available here! Wtf?! Definitely do not go here if the major you are interested in is not here, there are no replacements for doing what you love. Also, I was told originally that making your major is do-able but it is IMPOSSIBLE. You have to do a ton of paperwork, and must present your idea to many many people and after doing all this work you can still be denied! Then you will have to scramble around your senior year to take classes to fill another random major and hope you graduate on time. A girl I was told about, re-did her huge essays and presentations THREE times and was denied each time and probably would not have graduated on time if the professors and board did not eventually give in. They want you to pick a major they have and take classes you are interested in to fill requirements."
College Freshman,1,"There is very little diversity here at Providence College, and I mean that in every way possible. The VAST majority of students here are rich white kids from the northeastern United States. If you want a diverse campus, Providence may not be the place for you."
College Freshman,1,"Everyone looks exactly the same.  Same clothes same apperence same wealthy backround.  If you are even somewhat ""ethnic"" you receive a huge scholarship, but unless youre an athlete youll pretty much stick with the other ""ethnic"" kids. "
College Freshman,1,"I really do not enjoy it here.  The rules are extremely strict and there is very little school spirit.  I went to several basketball and hockey games with my friends and they were all completly dead.
Its the same thing every weekend for parties, sure its fun for the first few weeks.  I loved the off campus housing parties and the bars but when winter came the bars get packed and its miserable.
The boys over all are complete jerks and the girls are extremely shallow.  The majority of people worry about what theyre going to wear and if they wore it within the last three weeks.  Everyone is on a diet and everyone couldnt care less about anyone else other then themselves.  I feel as if i have met everyone since the school is so small and everyone seems intolerable"
College Freshman,1,The food in the main dining hall is awful and always the same nothing seems fresh or cooked right and the other dining hall (alumni) is extmrely pricely and not that great

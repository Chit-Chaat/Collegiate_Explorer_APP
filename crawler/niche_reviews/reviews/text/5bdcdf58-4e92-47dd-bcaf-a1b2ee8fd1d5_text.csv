Sophomore,5,"This past semester was my first semester at baptist and I loved it ! My professors and advisers were extremely helpful during this period of time with all classes being online. Having all online courses isn't the best or easiest thing in the world, but at baptist the faculty all work together to make you feel comfortable."
Sophomore,5,I rate my experience at baptist to be excellent so far. Everyone is so nice and helpful here and I love it.
Senior,5,"As the pandemic, took a toll in my junior year our teachers were able to offer online learning. They took the equipment home so that we could still get a visual of ventilator equipment."
Senior,5,"I am currently a senior at Baptist College of Health Sciences. I am in the Respiratory Care program and I have enjoyed myself. I chose this profession based on personal experience. I gave birth to a child at 24weeks and 4 days. My daughter was placed on ventilators, used cpap, and even came home on oxygen. With my background in respiratory care, I somewhat felt like I was prepared for my situation. It has helped me recall information taught in pervious classes and i am able to apply it to life situation."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Baptist has been very eye opening. Baptist has taught me how to study more effectively and practice more time management for my classes. Before I came to Baptist my habits of studying was very poor and did not know how to proper rly manage my time. Once I enrolled I had teachers who helped me turned my weakness into strengths
Sophomore,5,I love that Baptist College employees and instructors are so helpful and encouraging. They want everyone student to be successful.
Sophomore,5,I have taken a few online classes. Even though they are online the instructors are very helpful as if you were in a classroom setting.
Niche User,5,The staff is extremely helpful. They help you as much as they can and follow up with you by phone frequently. The campus is beautiful with lots of amenities
Junior,5,I love this school. The professors are very caring and concerned about your future. Everyone is so friendly. The school is very challenging but they prepare you for your career. The school also cares about your safety. The coat is very reasonable for it being a private college.
Alum,5,Baptist College of Health Sciences allowed me to obtain my RN-BSN completely online. The coursework was both challenging and doable. Highly recommend! This program took into account that most students were working either full or part time.
Junior,5,I am currently enrolled at Baptist as a junior from Northwest MS community college. I like how open their campus is and how many options they have. One thing I think that needs improvement is how orientation works. I went into orientation over the summer and waited for hours to be called back to enroll in classes and ended up being the very last person called back to be helped. I think as a new student transferring to a school they should take a little more initiative to help make the process a little smoother.
Junior,5,"I love this college, it is a four year private christian college. The school only focuses on students that are majoring in any type of health sciences field, such as doctors, nurses, health administration etc. You receive that hands on experience that I feel every student will want to have.  The college and classrooms are smaller, and finding classes and buildings on campus is extremely easy! I definitely recommend this college for any student that is looking for a new home.  As a student in the health studies field it is hard to find a suitable job after you graduate, but Baptist will already have opportunities lined up for you even before you cross that stage!"
Sophomore,5,I love everything about baptist. The teachers and staffs are always there if you need help with anything.
Junior,5,I think baptist college is a great chance for a student to further themselves within the health care field. I recommend for any student wanting a degree in health care.
Niche User,5,Baptist College of Health Sciences is very great. They make sure you know everything you need to know about their school through email and mail.
Sophomore,5,I like Baptist College of Health Science because they have many different fields to choose. They also have excellent professors and staffs.
Alum,5,I loved my time at Baptist! It truly prepared me for the journey ahead and I can't wait to let them see the influence they have had on me.
Sophomore,5,Baptist College of Health Sciences has been one of the best schools I have attended. The staff and other students are very welcoming and helpful.
Sophomore,5,"I love going to Baptist everyone is so nice and friendly. This is my second semester here. I moved to Tennessee from Illinois to study Radiation Therapy.  My professors and advisor are always there for me when I need help with something, they told me to come to them whenever I need anything or just to talk."
Junior,5,"Baptist is a great school! I feel safe 100% of the time while I’m there, and the education is magnificent! All instructors are loving and caring towards the students & their futures!"

College Sophomore,5,Campus security at Baptist is the best in Memphis.
College Sophomore,5,This is by far the best school that I have attended. Most of the professors are very caring and compassionate and go above and beyond to help their students with any issues that arise. This college is dedicated to the education of it's students and holds high standards for each student who attends. Baptist is a smaller college which means that students and faculty become almost like family. It is also a Christian college and this is a major plus for me. If I could choose again I would definitely choose Baptist College.
College Sophomore,5,"There are no drug issues on campus, making campus feel safe"
College Sophomore,5,the security is very good especially since school is not in a good part of town. Security is the best of any school I've been to.
College Freshman,5,Baptist's academic programs are excellent! The teachers are great at what they do and are willing to help with any problems we might have. They definitely play a significant role in our success at Baptist!
College Freshman,5,"The security at Baptist is top notch. There is security available 24/7, and they are very serious about their job. They are very kind too and will even walk you out to your car!"
College Freshman,5,"Though I have not had experience with this topic yet, I am sure the clinicals/internship experience is excllent. I have heard that they do work long, hard hours, but like all things at Baptist they are there to do nothing other than prepare us for our futures in the healthcare field."
College Junior,5,"I have had an awesome experience at Baptist College of Health Sciences so far. The teachers are always there to help you and they push you to do well in their classes.

College Junior,5,I'm lucky enough to have received a great scholarship based on my high school GPA and ACT scores.
College Junior,5,The people in the financial aid office are always available and very helpful at explaining costs and loans available.

College Junior,5,When we party we are celebrating our faith. NO drugs! NO drinks! All we need is Jesus' presence!
College Junior,5,Never had any issues with administration
College Junior,5,Our school has little to know crime that I know of

College Sophomore,5,I haven't started the nursing program yet but I've heard a lot of people say it is hard but a great program
College Junior,5,THE COLLEGE SECURITY IS GREAT I ALWAYS FEEL SAFE WHEN I AM ON CAMPUS
College Senior,5,I have learned from other people who go to that place that is safe but I will start next semester
College Freshman,5,"As a private, religious college, there is a zero tolerance for drugs and alcohol.  The school takes academic integrity very seriously."
College Freshman,5,"The school has the best radiation therapy program in the state.  The classes are small, and there is plenty of resources to help students.
"
College Freshman,5,"The workload is nothing to joke around about, but the professors and Tudors want you to succeed and understand clearly.  There are study rooms with the proper equipment for learning.  The curriculum and courses are designed to produce knowledgeable allied health employees and nurses."
College Freshman,5,BCHS has the best radiation therapy program in Tennessee.  I am excited to see how this program assures me a great career opportunity.
College Freshman,5,"I've grown up in Memphis.  The campus is downtown and I love that.  I love being in medical district--our campus is surrounded by other medical students, etc.  I love being able to go to coffee shops and restaurants only a few blocks away to study between, before, or after classes."
College Freshman,5,"Everyone is so nice--whether you know them or not, everyone is willing to share a smile.  There are tons of student activities available on campus."
College Freshman,5,I love the key card access.  The campus is well-maintained and clean.  I feel proud to be a student of BCHS.
College Freshman,5,"As a private, religious school, the tolerance for drugs and alcohol is ZERO.  drug tests will be administered if there is any suspicion if drug use.  Every student at BCHS is driven and working toward one thing--a degree.  I love being surrounded by hard-working students just like me."
College Freshman,5,"As I said, this is the best school I have been to.  The school wants every student to succeed and they supply us with all of the resources that we need.  Everyone is so kind and willing to help with anything we need.  And I love the religious aspect of the school.  It has restored my faith and self-hope."
College Junior,5,"I am in the Radiation Therapy program at my school and it goes above and beyond. We are the first graduating class that have a VERT (Virtual Environment Radiotherapy Training) simulator. Additionally, our instructors involve us in many of the volunteer opportunities in the area and they are always ready to help."
College Junior,5,"Although there are no sports at BCHS, there are plenty of other groups available to join. These groups are constantly hosting different meetings and fundraisers, both on-campus and off-campus."
College Sophomore,5,Parking on the campus is awesome. It is extremely secure and allows students to get to the main building in a timely fashion.
College Junior,5,I am in the pinnacle program for accelerated students in Health Care Management and so far the program is great at BCHS
College Sophomore,5,I love the off campus dining. It is diverse and delicious! My parents love coming to the city to enjoy the food variety.
Sophomore,4,The professors online are really trying! They make sure the students are able to comprehend when it comes to online coursework and activities. Most professors implement activities when it comes to online work to get students more comfortable with their online courses
Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at Baptist has been a great.  Very low-key school, not much happening but student's serious about studying"
Sophomore,4,The online experience doable.  The instructors make sure that everything is covered in your syllabus and we have weekly web classes so that your instructor and classmates can see and interact with you.
Sophomore,4,"I love going to this college! It's as if it is a tight knit community. The classes are small, so whoever goes here never feels like just a number in the classroom. The college is linked to the Baptist Hospital, so students have opportunities to find jobs or take tours at one of the Baptist hospitals. The teaching methods are effective and hands on, so you can understand how what you learn ties in with your profession. Also, the administration is kind and try to help their students to the best of their abilities. If I could change anything, it would be class availability. Some classes are not available for students when they need it, so it can be problem for some students. It might even push them back. So, it is best ask about when classes are generally given throughout the school year verses what the generic one says (because it can be misleading)."
Sophomore,4,Baptist College of Health Sciences is a very good school. This school will definitely challenge you to be the best that you can be. Baptist is far different from some of the other schools in Memphis because of the relationships the professors and staff establish with the students. The professors and staff definitely offer resources and go out of their way to ensure that you succeed.
Junior,4,I like that the professors are always willing to help the students achieve their goals. I like that most of the professors break down the subjects to an understanding for the students.
Sophomore,4,"BCHS is a very positive and faith-based environment. In most of my classes, our professors pray before we take exams. It’s one of the little things I love about Baptist College. I think it is an amazing college to attend."
College Sophomore,4,A lot of people are conservative
College Sophomore,4,I am majoring in diagnostic medical sonography and all of last years alumni landed jobs before they even graduated the program. Most healthcare facilities around the area are more inclined to hire students from Baptist college rather than students from other colleges.
College Sophomore,4,The courses are really only things you need and no other variety of fun courses.The teachers are great and are interested in more than just your academic career and want to know you personally to help you succeed.
College Sophomore,4,"Really makes you feel like you are a part of a bigger family, and that they are there for you in all sort of ways."
College Freshman,4,"Overall, Baptist is a wonderful school and definitely prepares you for the future. Initiative is a MUST at this school."
College Freshman,4,"Though it is hard to say dormitories are excellent because most are relitively small, Baptist is no acception. The dorms are quite small, but they are what you make them to be. I, being the OCD person I am, have had limited issues with the dorms. Though my toilet has been broken once, the maintance people toom care of it right away. The only complaint I have is that we cannot use toasters..."
College Freshman,4,"I love Baptist College because of the oneness that is felt amongst the students and facualty! The advantages of going to a small, private college are great if you are a person like me who tends to ask questions, engage in class with the instuctor and classmates, and emails their instructor often. Though the classes are much more challenging than I visioned, they are definitely worth the challenge because I am most assured that they will prepare me for my future responsibilities in the healthcare field. One aspect of the school I have noticed is that you do not have to worry about anyone stealing your things if you set them down! Overall, great school, and great students and facualty!"
College Sophomore,4,I love school and the school I have chose to earn a degree. I would choose my school again because the professors are very helpful and encouraging.
College Sophomore,4,So far Baptist College has done a great job impressing me. I am excited to start my school year and get to know people who will serve as fellow healthcare providers.
College Junior,4,They are great. They are easy to get along with.
College Senior,4,"I go to a Baptist affiliate college. Some of the rules seem extreme but I can see how they benefit the students. It is a very religious school so drinking and drugs are against the rules. But they do allow freedom of clubs, swimsuits, and guest in the dorms"
College Senior,4,"There is no need to leave campus (unless you want to). The school has a gym, pool, and even a convenience store. You are right above the classrooms so all you have to do is take the elevator down and go to class. It is the same amount as an apartment near buy would be per month."
College Junior,4,"I've lived on campus for 3 years now. I loved it when I was a freshman, but it becomes less exciting the longer you live here."
College Freshman,4,"I bring my lunch to school, so I do not know how the food on campus is. There seems to be plenty of choices though."
College Sophomore,4,I am majoring in pre respiratory care because I have asthma. I am a first year student so I hope it is everything I expect it to be.
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of restaurants off campus and they are in very convenient locations.
College Junior,4,Close to downtown and in proximity of a few of the city's hospitals.
College Sophomore,4,There are video cameras in the parking lots and everyone has an assigned parking lot to park just in case something happens. Any one that enters a building must have an excess card.
College Junior,4,Many options to chose from
College Junior,4,There is a lot to do and see in Memphis. The school is in a great location.
College Senior,4,"We are a private health sciences college. We offer bachelor degrees in Nursing,  Medical Radiography, Diagnostic Medical Sonography, Nuclear Medicine, Respiratory Care, Radiation Therapy, Biomedical Science. The professors really care about our students and want to see us succeed."
College Senior,4,"There are a lot of options all around my campus. From healthy to fast food, there are options all around."
College Senior,4,My campus is very safe because our campus security does a wonderful job.
College Junior,4,Baptist Memorial College of Health Science is located in the heart of downtown Memphis.  We're surrounding by all types of attractions and scenery.  I love the atmosphere of the school and the local establishments around the school.
College Junior,4,THIS CITY IS GREAT I HAVE LIVED HER FOREVER AND INTEND TO STAY AFTER I COMPLETE SCHOOL
College Junior,4,The diversity on campus is great
College Freshman,4,The campus crime is very low and I feel safe being on campus. Not just anyone can enter the campus a school badge is needed to get through the school gate and security gaurds are always there at the front desk.
College Senior,4,"The campus is a private, spiritual campus, I thaink it is great for students who want to concentrate on their beliefs"
College Senior,4,I am not too used to the campus but I have heard that they very good facilities on campus.
College Senior,4,"great, teachers are helpful to help you succeed in the class so it is one of the best school."
College Senior,4,The professors are very helpful and they help with every single step of the course
College Senior,4,"From what I have heard, they have  great campus housing "
College Senior,4,The overall experience is great and friendly from what I have heard 
College Senior,4,I have heard from other students that it is very good
College Senior,4,I am not sure yet 
College Freshman,4,"The lots fill up quickly, but I have not had a problem since getting to campus early each day, before it fills up.  The overflow lot is definitely a trek and is located in an area that seems slightly unsecure, despite the key card access.  However, there is a very secure bridge that goes over the busy street to just across the street from campus.  "
College Freshman,4,"This campus is about as diverse as other colleges I have been to.  It is a religious college, but not overly religious.  "
College Freshman,4,There are a decent amount of computers available to students.  I have not once had an issue of finding an available computer.  The printers are fast and there are copy machines available.  Everything that we need is there.
College Freshman,4,"If I have a late class, I can call security and have them take me to my car.  I love that this is available to us, despite us being a small, private school.  This further helps me to feel safe."
College Freshman,4,"I feel extremely safe on this campus.  The key card access for buildings, parking lots, etc. assist in my feeling of safety.  I love the close-knit feel of BCHS.  Everyone is so kind and helpful if you need it.  The resources seem to be never-ending.  This school wants to see you succeed--I love that!"
College Sophomore,4,"Parking permit is a mandantory $25 whether you own a car or not. I've never had a ticket. If you live on campus, you do not need a car because you can ride the trolley downtown or walk to nearby fast food resturants. There are four parking lots: one for people who live on campus, and three for commuters, one of which not many people seem to know about. Parking between 10am- noon is aweful in two parking lots, but if you know about the third, then you can easily find a spot any time of day. Parking lots close at 10:30pm. Each lot is convient to different buildings."
College Freshman,4,BCHS has a pretty widely diversified student body.
College Freshman,4,I'm not aware of any drug or alcohol usage at the school.
College Sophomore,4,"There are many restaurants in the are, however you will need a vehicle because this is not a very safe city area. The downtown area is full of choices for dining, from fine dining to little ""hole in the wall' types of places. I enjoy the dining area."
College Freshman,4,"I know campus police is strict, but the bottom line is it makes me feel safe. We are in the middle of a downtown area where there are all kinds of people, good and bad and the strict security is needed. Once you are on campus you know you are ok."
College Freshman,4,The school is very good about making sure you know your stuff. The teachers are always available and make sure you know their office hours. I am very pleased with it so far.
College Sophomore,4,The campus actually has an zero tolerance of drugs being allowed on campus as well as smoking... That zero tolerance is being enforced daily..
College Sophomore,4,"There are plenty of computers that can be used and they are updated, and also they have accessible WIFI available ."
College Sophomore,4,"They have excellent security around the campus. Only those with access pass are allowed in unless vistors come to visit, but they have to buzz in and are required to show ID before they look around the campus.."
College Sophomore,4,"Great school, not many activities but the school is located downtown so you have lots to choose from."
College Junior,4,It's Awesome – Baptist is the greatest school! The only reason I wouldn't choose this school is because it is expensive. Other than that--everything is PERFECT!
College Junior,4,"Friendly People – The girls that go here are very pretty and there are not that many guys, but the ones that are enrolled are nice. Everyone dresses casual unless they must be in scrubs for class. Everyone is very friendly."
College Junior,4,"Very Easy – Getting into this program is not difficult, but getting your name on the list ASAP is the key. There is a long waiting list of people waiting to get a spot in the nursing program."
College Freshman,2,Most of the scholarships offered I do not qualify for because I am not in that major.  Very little allied health scholarships available.
College Freshman,2,"Not too many parties on campus, but plenty of social events."
College Sophomore,2,I didn't receive any aid :(
College Senior,2,"My campus doesn't have campus dining. We have an area that we can purchase candy, chips, ""vending machine food,"" but nothing really besides that."
College Freshman,2,"You have city buses, which is not the best way to come and go. The trolleys are great for the medicak and downtown areas."
College Junior,2,Not Very Friendly – The finaancial aid staff are not very friendly and seem to never have time for the students.
College Sophomore,2,Only residents get the best parking because there is no parking lot for the nursing building and you have to take a chance by parking in others' lots or park all the way back by the science building and take you forever to walk to class.
College Senior,1,"There is no party scene. It is a Christian college in downtown Memphis. They do not host parties. But, the University of Memphis is down the road and you can usually find a college party there. Or you can grab a cab to downtown Memphis."
College Junior,1,Mansatory parking fees even if you don't have a car.

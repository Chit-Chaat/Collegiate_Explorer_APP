Freshman,5,So far so good! All the advisors have been quick to respond and very helpful (which is great for incoming freshmen who feel over their head like me).
Niche User,5,I love the atmosphere and kind people. Everyone is so welcoming and it's in a great community. I can't wait to go to school here!
Freshman,5,"I am only a freshman in my second semester at the University of Maine, Farmington, but I have enjoyed my time here up to this point. My professors are very nice and always willing to work with me. It is a quiet, hard working campus, with motivated students. The campus is right next to downtown, which is easy access to stores, and a movie theater. I would recommend University of Maine, Farmington, to anyone going into the education field."
Niche User,5,I have spent many summers at UMF with the Upward Bound program. Other than cleanliness I have no complaints
Sophomore,5,"The University of Maine at Farmington captures the essence of Smalltown, USA. The tight knit community allows each student to feel safe and involved in all activities the campus and surrounding towns have to offer. This University is willing to help each student individually to ensure that they have the best experience and gain the most knowledge from their courses and from experiences during their time. The many athletic contests and arts performances allow each student to find something that suits their interest. The faculty and staff become a second family as this college truly feels like home away from home. The coaches and professors are willing to help each student to ensure they gain the most knowledge and have the support they need to grow into the professional they are studying to be."
Junior,5,"I’ve been attending UMF for a while now, and the thing I enjoy most is the professors and class experience. The class sizes are small, and because of this I feel like you learn more through being more connected to your professor and peers. Professors actually know your name and are interested to learn more about you, unlike bigger campuses where professors don’t do the same thing"
Niche User,5,"I have gone to many of their open houses, and I have always enjoyed going every time. The community of the town is very pleasant. The students are very down to earth, and they seem like my kind of people. I am most interested in majoring in special elementary education. I would recommend this university to anyone who is interested in majoring in education."
Sophomore,5,"From day one there is always someone there to support you no matter what problems you may have. The people there are so helpful and friendly, they want the best for you and will do anything to help you succeed!"
Alum,5,"University of Maine at Farmington is an excellent college.  If you’re not from Maine, it’s a great way to take advantage of all the wonderful outdoor activities, such as skiing, snow shoeing, white water rafting, canoeing, fly fishing, hiking and more.  As well as an excellent education in a great community."
Freshman,5,Absolutely love it there! I will be attending in the fall and have never been so excited! I met with the staff and multiple current students and am blown away!
Niche User,5,"I will be attending University of Maine at Farmington in the Fall of 2019 as a Freshman, and I love it there. The students and the staff are all super friendly, and there is such an amazing community there, both with the school and the surrounding town of Farmington. The campus is a nice size, and there are so many different clubs, activities, and different opportunities for people to meet others and explore their interests. I can’t wait to go there in the Fall!"
Freshman,5,"I love the University of Maine at Farmington because the class sizes are small, which allows for a personal connection to develop between students and professors. They truly care about your success. They have many unique majors and amazing professors."
Niche User,5,"University of Maine at Farmington is incredibly welcoming and helpful. It is such a close knit community and everyone is involved! They offer many different activities, clubs, and sports that would suit anyone. UMF is a safe environment full of friendly faces."
Freshman,5,I love UMaine at Farmington. The faculty really want us to succeed and the extracurriculars are fantastic here!
Niche User,5,I’m always at UMF visiting my sister Brooke. I spent most of my weekends there staying with my sister and her roommate in Scott Hall and I love their dorms. It has suck a friendly environment and I just feel so at home with all the people there. This is my sisters sophomore year at UMF and she now has an apartment and she plays field hockey. I still get to spend so much of my time at UMF and it’s amazing!!
Freshman,5,"Going to college in Maine is somethting if a special experience. It is /very/ small town. Near the beginning of a semester, when everyone is still excited, expect hellos on the street of campus and a super friendly atmosphere. The town is super easy to get involved in, there is always something going on, though don't expect it to be all sorority parties or whatever it is that really big colleges have. Central of town hosts music, festivals etc. Clubs are all active and awesome. Dorms are friendly, safe places where you will probably know some of your neighbors even if you really try not to. Classes don't slack, so keep your school/social life balanced! Still, professors are also cool and for the most part don't seem like they hate their own existence. Go here especially if you've never been a Mainer. I moved to texas and am super homesick for the place, and I only lived in Maine for 5 years. It's an amazing place."
Junior,5,"University of Maine at Farmington is a nice, small college. It is like the whole campus is a family in a way. Everyone knows eachother and the proffesors really care about how you do within their classes."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Maine at Farmington has always been my dream school and being accepted was the best day of my life. I have been at UMF for 2 years now and loving every minute of it. The small classes lead to a sense of community and trust between myself and my professors. The only thing that they could change is the food program, as the food provided by sodexo is subpar."
Freshman,5,"Love almost every professor I've had. They really know their stuff  and are always so willing to help. There's so many great clubs to join and everyone is so welcoming of new members which is great! Overall it's just such a friendly and welcoming campus and gives off such good, positive experiences. The food is also great and there's so much variety and there's options for every kind of person. The dorms are all great and each have their own special features and atmospheres. I LOVE this campus."
Niche User,5,"I am a senior in High School and going through the college process has been incredibly stressful, however, dealing with UMF has been fantastic. I love the atmosphere and truly believe I have found the place for me!"
Alum,5,"The college was a great fit for me. The campus was small and located in a small community. The staff were warm, helpful and welcoming. The college provided academic help in any subject and the staff and student body stived for everyone to be successful. There are many opportunities for student students to participate in clubs, volunteering opportunities, and other great learning experiences. The University also does a great job getting students ready for life after college. I like how the college got their education majors into the classroom and working with students as of beginning of sophomore year. The college gave me many opportunities to communicate with other students and get to know my fellow classmates on a personal level. The college was a great fit for me and I am so glad I chose this college. My self confidence, self esteem and educational experience blossomed while attending this college and I believe I wouldn’t have been as successful anywhere else."
Freshman,5,"UMF is comprised of students who both value education, and who strive to push themselves. That, in addition to the welcoming environment of the school has made my transition from high school to college exceptionally smooth. Additionally, I feel that all the professors are dedicated their work, and do everything they can to help their students succeed. I am proud to be a student of the UMF community! Go Beavers!"
Freshman,5,The atmosphere that farmington had around it. The way they presented farmington within the tour was just fantastic.
Freshman,5,The admission members are always trying their very best to help you! It's such a joy to see they want you to be part of their university campus!
Sophomore,5,The staff and students are all amazing at making it feel like a community and I am proud to call it my home away from home.
Freshman,5,"Everyone there is so kind and helpful. Every single student and staff I have talked to have been so eager to help me out with any questions I have. The campus is beautiful and clean. I love hanging out in either the green grasses on campus, or even the lounge and library since everything is so neat and easy to work in."
Sophomore,5,I went here on chance and it ended up being a great decision. The community is what makes it the best and it will give you the college experience you will remember forever. There education program is top notch and I can tell I set up well once I graduate.
Sophomore,5,"It is a great and friendly campus. There are a lot of other thins to do off campus like hike, ski, or even go the the river."
Junior,5,"While attending the University of Maine at Farmington, I have felt very at home. The campus community is welcoming and pleasant to just about everyone, accepting and friendly. Class sizes are more often fairly small, with the vast majority of the professors being engaging, interesting, and very knowledgeable about their subject. In all I have been very pleased while attending UMF."
College Junior,5,You get into your field as soon as possible
College Junior,5,This school turns into more of a home instead of just where you go to college
College Junior,5,Safety is a huge concern for professors and students and recently have been improved.
College Junior,5,This school has become my home! I feel so comfortable and confident in class!
College Sophomore,5,"I would choose UMF all over again because they make you feel like everyone belongs and is equal. It is a very friendly community overall. All the professors are wonderful, they go out of their way sometimes for us students which makes it really easy to transition into the college life. Being in a small community makes it easy to go anywhere without traveling very far which is very nice when you are on a tight budget."
College Freshman,5,"I may have not had the best social life, but the best educational experience, which has only made me reach for my goals more and more each day."
College Freshman,5,"The University of Maine at Farmington has provided me with an amazing education experience so far. The professors are all very friendly, as are advisers, and other students. I've never once felt out of place here. The campus is well integrated into the town itself and the students are just as much a part of the community as the rest of the town residents. The overwhelming majority of the people here are incredibly friendly and help to provide a positive and welcoming atmosphere."
College Sophomore,5,Since I started at UMF my favorite experiences have been in my Early Childhood classes. The fact that the whole community of the town of Farmington is involved with the college is what makes my school unique. I'm a third generation at UMF and it has been my dream school ever since I was in the second grade. If I could do it all over again I would still choose UMF. I love UMF and all the courses and experiences and fun events that it has to offer.
College Senior,5,"UMF is know nationally for it's academic ratings and is considered one of the best colleges in the country.  Originally, a teaching college, UMF maintains one of the strongest teaching programs in the country."
College Sophomore,5,Its a great school to go for teaching and I love the closeness of everyone.
College Sophomore,5,Our President is on campus the majority of the time and tries to get to know each student personally!
College Freshman,5,"The financial aid process went very smoothly. It took a lot of time to fill out the whole application, but once it was done, the next semester was easy. All I had to do was fix a few details that changed and the rest of the application stayed the same."
College Freshman,5,I have always felt very safe!
College Senior,5,"I love psychology and getting to understand how people function mentally. I am constantly reading people now. The work load is reasonable and the curriculum is a bit repetitive. There are not a lot of job or internship opportunities close to campus. Overall, I wouldnt have chosen another major."
Recent Alumnus,5,"As a Community Assistant, I was able to see multiple aspects of the leniency and strictness of the university and I believe it was very fair!"
Recent Alumnus,5,I had a wonderful experience overall. Most students do.
Recent Alumnus,5,Public Safety works hard to accommodate students and keep them safe. The Health Center is always helpful and even willing it participate in Community Assistant programming.
Recent Alumnus,5,"As a liberal arts school, there is a wide variety of majors offered."
Recent Alumnus,5,The Creative Writing program is one of the greatest CW programs in the country in terms of overall value and cost.
Recent Alumnus,5,It is very accepting of different types of people and their beliefs.
College Freshman,5,The computer center is pretty fantastic.
College Sophomore,5,We have a few outdated dorms. Overall though the communities in those dorms are incredibly warm and welcoming. Its very family like. 
College Senior,5,I love the program that I am in. The teachers travel to the students so they can meet a greater population of students.
College Senior,5,Classes will be cancelled if the weather is to bad to commute in. They are great at letting students know ahead of time before you leave for class.
College Senior,5,I am a student that attends classes at off-campus sites. The parking is always near the building and never an issue.
College Junior,5,"I love our campus. It's very close-knit, with a ton of green space. There aren't words to describe how amazing it is to be on campus when spring comes. There are also a lot of awesome campus events and activities, they really do try to have something for everyone. It's basically just an incredible school to be a part of if you're looking for a college that feels more like home."
College Senior,5,"Farmington has made the campus the center of the town. You just can't miss it! Who doesn't like the beautiful mountains of Maine? Who doesn't like a gorgeous river? Who wouldn't want to go to the fair right down the road? There is shopping, sports fields and arenas, a movie theater, and other places within walking distance. Well done on the local atmosphere!"
College Freshman,5,This school is perfect for Elementary Education majors.  There are so many of us and the school really knows how to create great teachers.
College Freshman,5,The education program here is what Farmington is known for. I am in elementary education and they teach you great skills for being a teacher. You will do practicum your sophomore year here. There is a lot of time that students spend working in the classroom getting practice. Senior year education students spend the majority of their time student teaching in a local classroom.
College Freshman,5,So far my professors have been excellent. I came to Farmington for the teaching program and the small school feeling. The teachers give great one on one attention and push you to do your best. The workload is manageable as long as you keep up. Teachers have office hours to meet with them if you have any questions and are willing to work with you if you need any sort of help.
College Senior,5,"Early Childhood Education – As a early childhood education major, you get a lot of hands-on classes on the subject areas such as math and science.  I will be doing a internship which I have heard will be a lot of work.  I will not be paid for taking the internship."
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the Early Childhood Education major, meaning all of the classes that one has to do to get their degree. For example, I like all of the practicum classes one has to take, because it gives that person more in-field experiences that some other colleges or universities don't offer. Another thing that is nice about UMF is all of the clubs that are there. I also like how nice and helpful everyone here is."
Freshman,4,"My experience with UMF is how eager the staff are to help students with any questions they might have on assignments, and the student are recommended by staff to assist other students who might need extra help. If anything has to change, I think that it should be teachers having longer office hours instead of being able to talk over e-mail."
Freshman,4,I enjoyed how welcoming the community was with little to no bad interactions between people. I would like for the campus to feel safer with actual security in multiple areas.
Sophomore,4,"I like the small hometown campus feel. Not many students but enough to create an academic and social atmosphere; while gaining the knowledge necessary to progress towards graduation. I also enjoy the interaction with the professors, as you are a student and not a number. The one to one attention is greater than many other schools. Outside of academics, there are many opportunities for socializing and creating life long friendships. This is done through clubs, athletics, programming, and options to hike, bike, and enjoy many facets of what the town has to offer."
Freshman,4,I liked the small classes and it really seemed like each professor cared about each student. The community is amazing. Everyone is free to be who they want to be with no real judgement. Definitely feels like everyone is a part of this giant family.
Freshman,4,"I love the overall welcoming feel of the campus, the students were very friendly and eager to help and the location is perfect for anyone who likes the outdoors."
Sophomore,4,"This is a great small town college, friendly people and excellent staff, though the college does not treat every department fairly"
Junior,4,"The University of Maine at Farmington is perfect if you're looking for a small town campus where nearly everything but the hospital and walmart are within walking distance. Professors are generally very warm and willing to help with any difficulty you are having with classes, and the class sizes are rarely larger than low 30's, usually around low 20's.  Honestly the only things that I wish were improved were the availability of decent parking and the timely removal of snow and ice from sidewalks after winter storms so that no one ends up falling down stairs leaving the dorm at 9 in the morning for class."
Sophomore,4,If you are coming for a degree in Education then for sure come to UMF!  It is well known all around for the teachers they produce.  Would also recommend getting an apartment and making your own food as the food here is not good at all.
Senior,4,"I love UMF. Its beautiful, small, and intimate. Im very passionate about my program and I'm proud to graduate next year."
Sophomore,4,Love the people and the community. Everyone is super friendly. The scenery is absolutely beautiful! It's small but that only makes it more homey.
Sophomore,4,I really enjoy the ORBA bachelor's program that I am enrolled in. ORBA is Outdoor Recreation Business Administration. I have been here for nearly two years now and just changed to ORBA at the end of my fall semester as a sophomore.
Sophomore,4,"I really like the school. The Professors are all super helpful. Classes are fairly small so it easy to get help when you need it. They have plenty of resources here on campus to help you. There are lots of activities. The people her are fairly nice. The walk into town is great, as well as the little shops in town."
Junior,4,"I like the sense of community here on the Farmington campus. The classes are not too big, yet not too small either and the professors are really understanding and know all their students by their first name by the end of the first week."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Maine at Farmington is a pretty friendly community.  Classes are extremely small, 12-15 people, so you have the opportunity to get one-on-one help if need be.   Farmington is also a neat town, small but chill.  The Professors are always willing to lend a helping hand with work and even personal issues.  The food isn't bad either, so that's a plus."
Sophomore,4,"The University of Maine at Farmington is not only a school but truly a second home. The campus is only a short walk from downtown and with that, you are able to interact with the community. Everyone is extremely  friendly and truly make you feel safe in this small town. As for the school itself, you are able to tell that the professor are passionate about their lessons and adore their students and want them to succeed. Classes are both challenging and enjoyable. In the social aspect of the school, there is always something happening on campus whether it be a sporting event, a show for the newest collection at the art gallery, concerts, or even yoga where members of the community are also welcome. This is a fantastic place to go to school and I wouldn't want to attend anywhere else."
Freshman,4,"A great first transition if you're looking for a small campus size. The location itself is fairly convenient though most people prefer driving. About half live at home or rent apartments on weekends, which become like a ""ghost town"""
Freshman,4,I really enjoyed the experience with my professors and the student life overall. Everyone is so friendly and there is always something to do on campus. Also the professors were always open to help as much as they could.
Freshman,4,"I am a first year student at UMF. I love the school and I'm so happy I chose to attend UMF. I am an Early Childhood Special Education major and I'm impressed with the quality of the program. I am offered many opportunities at UMF in all areas. I have had some professors that are better than others I've had, but it will be that way at any school. The price is also very reasonable. The residence halls aren't great, but you get what you pay for. I do wish UMF didn't switch to Sodexo food service, though."
College Freshman,4,The university does a great job with their student involvement. There are always folks greeting you with new club opportunities. The facilities on campus are great and the staff at them are always helpful to answer any questions you may have.
College Junior,4,I love my professors for my major and the courses I have taken so far are interesting
College Junior,4,I know that Farmington will provide me with a great chance of getting a job after graduation
College Junior,4,Just like any dorm living
College Junior,4,I play field hockey and lacrosse at college and love it! The coaches and my teammates are awesome!
College Junior,4,I have loved my two years at Farmington so far! I live off campus but still feel connected to the college life.
College Sophomore,4,The farmington community supports UMF athletes and usually fans come to games.
College Sophomore,4,Definitely have learned a lot about Early Childhood Education. I did a practicum at the on-site preschool and it was very helpful because it was so hands on.
College Junior,4,"Some halls are better than others. But, it depends on preference"
College Junior,4,"There is no football, basketball, and baseball are the big sports"
College Sophomore,4,"Sports is fairly big as UMF, the athletic facilities are great for both athletes and non athletes. Our fan support is pretty good as well."
College Freshman,4,"There is plenty of opportunities our school offers throughout the year, the students just need to take initiative and ask plenty of questions so they understand what the opportunities can do for them and how they work."
College Freshman,4,"There are a few things needed to make this school better such as food quality and housing, but I love waking up every morning and being able to get my chai, get to my classes and having wonderful education and intellectual conversations. Class size and style have always benefited how I learned, and I feel like I can succeed easily."
College Freshman,4,"I don't pay much attention to sports, but there are nice facilities here for the people that do"
College Freshman,4,"I feel pretty safe on campus. I prefer not to walk alone late at night but, otherwise I feel safe"
College Freshman,4,"There are always career fairs, internship fairs, and thing like that going on that offer students an opportunity to explore what options are available here"
College Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed all my professors so far, even if I didn't particularly like the course itself."
College Sophomore,4,Our public safety is great. They are there whenever need them!
College Sophomore,4,The professors are here to help the students. They put in several hours of their time to help us succeed in their classes
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on campus from sexual assault and violence. There are plenty of emergency buttons around and there are usually a bunch of people around that discourage any predators form approaching people alone. Drugs don't seem to be a problem around here. My only issue is that traffic is heavy on two roads that are necessary for people to cross everyday but a lot of drivers do not stop for students and I even saw a girl get hit by a car the 3rd or 4th week on campus. Luckily she was okay, but many drivers who are supposed to stop for crosswalks do not seem to care and just speed past making walking across alone scary now and then. Police are very passionate about giving parking and speeding tickets unfortunately. Not from personal experience or anything...."
College Freshman,4,"Overall a good school. The only thing I would like to point out is being able to get the classes I want. As a freshman I struggled to get any classes that I wanted to do. I had a wish list of four classes and I got locked out of all of them the morning of sign-up and the only way I got into one class I wanted was because it was required my freshman year. I hope it becomes easier to get into classes for the next three years as it really did stress me out and disappoint me to not be able to get into the classes I want to be in. The good thing is that it is mostly just general studies for now but I would be very angry when I get into classes for my major and I am unable to get into material I want to learn because it is filled up or unavailable that year. Also, the teachers are great and relatable."
College Freshman,4,"I have not tried any career services on campus besides learning a bit about work study opportunities. From what I have seen from advertisements online and around campus, there are lots of career and internship opportunities from companies. They are always advertising these opportunities so I do not feel like it would be hard to find a job or internship in the future."
College Freshman,4,"So far it is only my first year so I haven't been learning materials for my major yet but the teachers are always available to help either in person or by email. Everyone here is very friendly and make me feel comfortable when asking for help. The teachers are always passionate about their lessons and often let us know how these lessons apply to real life which makes the class seem worth attending for. As a science major, I really do like going outside, labs and doing interactive things and I hope I am able to do more of that into the future. So far, most of my classes are just general studies so it feels like high school all over again for some of them. In the next couple years, I hope to give the school a higher rating due to loving my classes because they are stuff I actually want to learn. The only reason I gave a 4 was because I feel like the required PE class is a waste of time as it interferes with fitting in a fourth class that actually gives credits."
College Freshman,4,"The housing process is fairly easy here. It's pretty smooth to get into the dorm you want. My roommate and I changed rooms mid semester and the housing staff were very helpful and quick in getting our paperwork done. The CA's, community assistants, are all very friendly, but enforce the rules to the necessary extent."
College Sophomore,4,When it comes to sports at UMF there is a lot of school spirit. My favorite part about athletics at the college is the gym. The gym is s nice and well kept and there are so many different exercises and exercise equipment for you to use. There are different exercise classes that you can attend and take part in. There are also trainers that are great and will help you reach a goal that you have set for yourself. My favorite part of the gym though is the track.
College Freshman,4,There's some great dorms around the area and a lot of apartment choices
College Freshman,4,I love the close knit community and the program I'm in
College Sophomore,4,What ever you want to do its your journey to step on and walk the way you want to go.
College Sophomore,4,"It been a joy, being somewhere new. It's like stsrtign a new life, making new friends and experiencing something you have never seen before. Its different then high school and its all about you. Which kind of makes you feel like a king of your own world."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel as thought it has been a great experience, being a first year I have gotten a taste of what's its like living a college life. Everyone around me is very friendly and all the teachers are always eager to help students with what ever question they have. I'm very pleased with my choice and I can't think of a better school out their that would fit the needs that my college provides."
College Senior,4,"Careers in writing often take a while to develop successfully, but UMF has both current and former students who are selling their work."
College Senior,4,"Professors have been fantastic, both in class and with out of class help.  Class size has mostly been small, especially in the creative writing classes which only allow 15 students per class due to work-shopping."
College Senior,4,I'm not really aware of the extent of Greek Life on campus since I am a commuter.
College Senior,4,"It's not fair for me to answer this question since I'm an older student, someone who commutes to campus daily, and have little involvement with the University's athletic teams or scene.  Still, from what I've heard from others, our sports teams do quite well and fan support is pretty good.  The athletic facility offers free membership to all students, but also offers paid memberships for family members and members of the community."
College Sophomore,4,We aren't the number one school for varsity sports but people enjoy being in them and they have fun.
College Freshman,4,"Not much to do on weekends, but class sizes are great! All of my teachers know me by name, which I love."
College Freshman,4,The academics are great. The social life is medium
College Sophomore,4,"-Proactive President/Staff

-Need financial leniency 

-Student Government is un-involved

-Campus is very active

-Wide variety of classes"
College Sophomore,4,"There are many opportunities at this school, and the courses have all been wonderful."
College Sophomore,4,"My favorite aspect of this campus is how involved the students are, not only with the university itself, but with the entire community of Farmington."
College Junior,4,"I love UMF. The professors are approachable and knowledgable, as well as there being a small student to teacher ratio. Getting in clubs and extracurriculars is also extremely easy. I am currently a part of two, Girls Talk and Bust-A-Move Beavers, a service group and dance group. My only complaint would be that some of the buildings are out of date, such as the student center, and the food is subpar."
Freshman,2,"Classes are in-depth and challenging and people are nice here so it's a good school for getting an education.  However, there's absolutely NOTHING to do in Farmington, Maine.  If you're someone who likes to party, you've come to the wrong place.  You will not find a single party on campus; I haven't been to one this year because there aren't any.  Weekends are an absolute snooze-fest.  The only way you're even sniffing a party is if you know certain upperclassmen with apartments who like to party.  I will be transferring next year because I can't take any more boring weekends."
College Sophomore,2,There is no Greek life at Umaine Farmington but it doesn't take away from the college experience
College Freshman,2,"Generally, our campus has events to talk about issues we as a society and community are facing however there has been people who have reported sexual assaults who have been failed by the campus police and the system."
College Sophomore,2,"We have sports, but they are not what our school runs off of. Most students focus on academics and not the sports."
College Freshman,2,"From my experiences in the dining hall this semester, I found that the dining hall staff is very uneducated about food allergies. Also, there aren't enough options for people with food allergies. I am allergic to eggs and peanuts, and the food service workers seem not to know how serious food allergies actually are. The food options aren't labeled correctly for allergens either."
College Senior,2,There isnt a lot of affordable places for with student discounts to eat at. There is a burger king and a dunkin donuts and that is about it.
College Senior,2,Everything is very clicky between the girls and guys on campus. Most girls are overweight and wear sweatshirts and leggings and most guys wear tshirts with socks and sandals.
College Freshman,2,There is no night life. The only things that are worth seeing are the trees in the fall.
College Freshman,2,There is one shuttle so having a car or a friend with a car is a must.
College Sophomore,2,"In terms of racial diversity there's like none. Its mostly white Mainers who have never left the state.  Sexual orientation though is extremely diverse gay, lesbian, transgender, bisexual, everything under then sun. "
College Sophomore,2,"Between November and April the sun disappears and its constantly gray. There's also a lot of snow, ice, and cold precipitation. But it's Maine. When Spring hits, usually after March its a beautiful thing. "
College Sophomore,2,"Its difficult to arrange taking the shuttle to go places. Also the only way to get to campus is by car as the closest bus station is 40 min away, and the closest train station is an hour and a half away. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"Most people at this school are pretty homely and shut in. There are definitely a good amount of cool, outgoing people, but they are all in athletics and sciences. Do not attend this school if you want to have a riveting social life."
College Freshman,2,There are different groups but very little and they stand out in the small town itself.
College Junior,2,"The dining on campus is often interesting to say the least. The dining hall is almost always open when you need it, but the food is not of the highest quality, and the options are always changing. For all the other times though there is the snack bar, which does have good food, but is frightfully expensive. The food though is reliable and unless it's the last week before the semester ends, has fairly good selection."
College Sophomore,2,"UMF does have a weekly van to major stores, but it can be hard when trying to get anywhere else. Finding a friend with a car is much more easier."
College Sophomore,2,"The choices are McDonald's or a sandwich from Irving's, either choice, not very appitizing."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you live off-campus, parking can be horrible. You really do need to aim to get there 30 minutes before just in case. Be prepared to walk a long distance or drive around until a space frees up."
College Junior,2,"There are so many sports that are offered, and the teams do have fun while still being very competitive!"
College Freshman,2,"As a vegetarian, I already have a limited diet, and the dining hall doesn't offer much in the way of options. Even the non-veges are eating the same unhealthy things over and over again for lack of better choices. This has been addressed with food services, and they blame the students for not knowing how to feed themselves away from home."
Sophomore,1,As  a student who is part of the LGBTQA community I feel UMF is pretty poor when it comes to diversity and keeping it's minorities safe.
College Junior,1,Well we dont have one
College Freshman,1,We don't have any frats or sororites as they aren't allowed on campus
College Sophomore,1,I've gotten food poisoning from both the snack bar and the dining hall on multiple occasions. I would seriously recommend not eating there. Ever.
College Freshman,1,Winters in Maine are just brutal. People can not go anymore and are forced to stay indoors.
College Sophomore,1,"Food is pretty rough here. Its like one step below prison quality. There's a lot of variety but not much you want to eat. Basically the only edible options in the dining hall are sandwiches, stir fry, pizza, and cereal & bagel. Everything else is sketchy. We also have a snack bar but its over priced. "
College Junior,1,"Farmington is very far out from any of the major cities or towns that would have public transportation. There is a sort of bus that makes it's way from Farmington to Auburn, but it seems very irregular. Often times though you can find someone going in your general direction that will be nice and let you catch a ride with them to a more major transportation hub."
College Freshman,1,There is about 70% girls and 30% guys. This didn't seem like a big deal to me at first but I do miss having guy friends. I have classes with all girls and 2 guys but this may be mostly because I am an elementary education major.
College Freshman,1,No Frats or Sororities – There is only one frat. They don't throw parties and its basically just another club except you have to pay for it.
College Junior,1,"Don't Know Much – I would say that I don't know much about our school athletics other than we are Division 3, which basically means we're not the best, and I never hear of us winning anything."
College Sophomore,1,"Can't Get There from Here – Unless you have a car or want to stay in town, you're going to feel pretty stuck. The campus offers transportation between Hannaford, Walmart, and the Student Center on Wednesdays, but that's it. Fortunately, downtown is right near by."

Junior,5,"My learning experience has been incredible! The professors truly have a passion for what they teach, and they communicate it so well! I have only ever had one bad professor the whole time I have attended, and the rest were absolutely wonderful! My love for God has grown so much, as well as my knowledge about him. A great learning experience!"
Senior,5,"Love the profs. They honestly care. And they really want you to publish.  Plus Elliot Park is an incredible place to live and play. Restaurants, art galleries, parks, concerts—everything is at the doorstep. Including internships!

Niche User,5,"I liked how everyone there was so friendly to me. Nice campus, multiple cool areas to hang out at on campus. Security is everywhere though which makes me feel a lot more safe on campus considering what's going on in the world right now. The dorms are cool, I like them. I'm from up north so the fact in a building the air condition is in the window doesn't bother me like it might someone else."
Sophomore,5,North Central University offers me an amazing atmosphere with supportive students and faculty. My professors are phenomenal and never fail to push me towards and help me reach my goals.
Freshman,5,"North Central is great! The location is great, they have some very good music and production programs that are hard to find elsewhere, and the culture is really good. The staff and facility are great to work with and very helpful. Graduates for North Central that I have meet have also been great. The band is also really good."
Graduate Student,5,I've just started with the school and I love the attentiveness to my enrollment and care of my academics. I love the one on one rapport. Nothing to change.
Niche User,5,Visiting here was a great experience. I could come to this university many times and probably live here. I am a prospective student to the university and my experience with the application process has been very influential in my decision on where to go to college.
Graduate Student,5,Their online instructors are amazing. I recommend this school to anyone studying Psychology on a busy schedule.
Sophomore,5,"North Central has a great spiritual atmosphere and is a very friendly community. They have great clubs and academics. Some classes are a bit more challenging than others, but they provide excellent material that is very useful. There are on-campus jobs available, as well as a great community of believers to connect with."
Freshman,5,North Central University is a beautiful collage stationed in the middle of busy Down town Minneapolis. You can live on campus in the decent sized dorms or you can commute from the suburbs with the easy to use metro system.
Sophomore,5,I chose North Central University to be the college I transferred to after attending another college for three years. I felt completely at home when I got to Minnesota and especially to NCU even though I travel over seven hours from my home town.
Graduate Student,5,"I love the one on one with professors while getting your graduate degree. The admissions, finance and disability services are wonderful. All are friendly and very helpful and willing to help you in any way possible."
Sophomore,5,"I love North Central University and have enjoyed my professors, dorm, floor, and classes! The professors are extremely caring and helpful. I can tell that the professors want to see me succeed. I have met so many amazing people and have made so many new friends."
Sophomore,5,"Best school ever! The professors really care, and there is a strong Christian community within the college itself."
Junior,5,"Overall, I have enjoyed my time at North Central.  I was involved in two years of full-time PSEO at the school, and am now a full-time undergrad student with three semesters of work left.  The environment is very nice; students, faculty, and professors are very easy to work and get along with.  The campus is located a couple blocks out of downtown Minneapolis, so it is a beautiful setting.  The school also has an extremely good business program, with many students able to find jobs immediately out of school because of the connections and skills they learn in the School of Business.  I would recommend this school to anyone looking for a smaller, private school in the Minneapolis area; it is well worth the investment!"
Graduate Student,5,My experience with this institution is great. Everyone I've come in contact with has been excellent in assisting me with everything. Each counselor was great. They don't leave you out in left field and make certain your questions are answered and you don't walk away confused. They help encourage everyone so their goals are ney.
Freshman,5,"North Central is AWESOME. Great location in downtown Minneapolis, and awesome staff. The school has great events and the culture here is fantastic."
Sophomore,5,Everyone is so nice and accepting! Professors are great and they really want you to reach your full potential!
Sophomore,5,"North Central University is an amazing place to grow academically, socially and spiritually. It has amazing professors that are willing to guide you and take extra steps to ensure that you learn and achieve your potential. They are also Christ minded people that can help you with your walk with the Lord. These professors exhibit the love of Christ on a day to day basis. I also love the social aspect about North Central and I have made some life long friends here that I love. It's an overall great college and a place that I now get to call home for the next few years or maybe beyond."
Junior,5,NCU is a great campus and community in the heart of downtown Minneapolis. The atmosphere is diverse and authentic with God as their focus on everything they do.
Junior,5,"I really love the atmosphere at North Central. It is a faith based school, and the community reflects that in every aspect. Student relationships are fostered and tended to, and relationships with the staff and faculty are among the greatest possible in higher education."
Alum,5,"North Central is a unique school.  The faculty and staff impacted my life in a profound way while attending.  I have fond memories of attending chapel, making new friends, and investing in my future.  "
Freshman,5,Excellent academic and spiritual environment. Ten out of ten! The downtown location in Minneapolis provides hands on learning experience. The professors are knowledgable (the majority have earned a PHD) and each class contributes to your knowledge. Most students are passionate about what they are studying. There is a wide variety of majors offered.
College Senior,5,"I honestly believe I go to the best school around. The community is so tight-knit and welcoming, the professors are phenomenal, and the staff is superb. The teachers go out of their way to make sure their students do well, and the staff go to extra lengths to make sure the student is well cared for and has all the tools they need to succeed. Everyone strives to dive deeper in relationship with Jesus and works together to make the atmosphere compassionate and caring. At home, I am involved in the greatest young adults group I could ever imagine, and it kills me inside every time I have to leave them, but the reward of being able to go to such a wonderful school with such a powerful, God-filled focus and atmosphere makes it all worth it. I wouldn't trade this school or my experiences for the world."
College Freshman,5,"Attending this fall, applying was easy and quick."
College Freshman,5,"I have yet to attend North Central, but so far all the staff that has helped me with registration and financial aid have been great!"
College Freshman,5,No known or obvious drug problems
College Sophomore,5,I am taking classes online in another state. I am not sure of the involvement in athletics.
Recent Alumnus,5,Never worried about walking on campus at night by myself.  The skyways are a great bonus. Keep you safe and warm.
Recent Alumnus,5,I love living in Miller Hall.
Recent Alumnus,5,I made the right choice.
College Junior,5,NCU is one of the only places that AG churches will hire pastors.
College Junior,5,"There are two main subjects regarding housing- the physical housing and the relationship in the housing. The physical housing is ok, 2/3 main on-campus housing (excluding apartments) are fairly old but still spacious. Although, they recently updated the furniture in them so that's good. There's Wi-Fi and also a network if you want to ""game"" with your friends who live in a different building. Then, there's the relational part of housing. NCU does community very amazingly great--it's one of the specialties of NCU."
College Junior,5,"Especially having a heart for going into the vocational ministry, NCU is second to non--especially in the midwest US. Go to any AG church in the midwest and it's pretty much guaranteed that AT LEAST ONE of the pastors on staff graduated from NCU, if not multiple. NCU is the ""Harvard"" of Christian colleges. Over the years, NCU has become more and more of a liberal arts school but it's bible college roots are still very strong. Those roots makes it perfect for the student who wants to grow towards God, while getting an undergrad or maybe generally just college credits."
College Freshman,5,"North Central is very safe. You never have to worry about walking alone, security will pick you up anywhere within 5 mi"
College Junior,5,They offer a wide ragw of topics to study
College Junior,5,Having a Docatord degree puts me above the rest in the business world
College Sophomore,5,"It's a good school with a community beyond compare and great spiritual atmosphere, awesome location in downtown Minneapolis too. I just wish it was less expensive."
College Freshman,5,This school has a great academic program while also being Christ-centered.
College Sophomore,5,The Program I attended through NCU is a stellar program where I could not have received a better education elsewhere. This is an  great school with so much going on in the community around the campus.
College Sophomore,5,The staff at NCU really cares about their students and wants them to succeed.
College Senior,5,I have had an internship for a few months and have found it to be very helpful so far. I am in the Social Work program at North Central. My internship is at the Bridge for Youth which is located in Minneapolis. The Bridge for Youth is a homeless shelter for youth between the ages of ten and seventeen. They have their interns do everything that their paid staff does which has been challenging but also very helpful. I feel like I have learned a lot about the social work field from my internship so far.
College Senior,5,"I have really enjoyed living on campus because of the great atmosphere and sense of community. I have spent the past three years in the dorms and have loved every year. The dorm rooms are somewhat small and crammed, but I think that the bonding that takes place among people in the dorms more than makes up for it."
College Freshman,5,I love my major because it is exactly what I want to do. The recording studio is top-notch and my instructors are very helpful in teaching what we need to know.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on my campus and the security is very nice and work with you with whatever you need
College Senior,5,"Being downtown is amazing! You can go to local parks, lakes and what not. You can also see the beautiful skyline and the Stonearch Bridge."
Recent Alumnus,5,i like to do internship and every school must have internship programs every year for students so that they can innovate themselves and craft their carrier.
College Sophomore,5,"Great professors, God centered, great chapel time! Extra curricular activities are booming!"
College Junior,5,"The specific Education Program I am enrolled in is a high speed and full-time process. Once accepted into the Education Department the student is assigned to a different school in the community each semester with a cooperating teacher. During the assignment the student does lesson planning, test proctoring, teaching, and all other aspects of the full-time teacher. The hands-on environment makes it possible to learn what the profession is really like from the inside, and because each semester is in a different school, the student also gets to see his/her field (Social Studies for me) presented in different ways to students from various communities. A very attractive aspect of this program is that almost seven of ten students obtain work in the school they did their final student teaching semester. All of this is combined with the academic work in Teaching Foundations, Lesson Planning, and course specific classes - American History, Geography, Political Science, etc. I do enjoy the program and the professors teaching and guiding us through the program. While structured tightly, and challenging often, it remains an enjoyable and pleasant environment to learn the teaching profession."
College Junior,5,"I am a Secondary Social Studies Education Major and believe the program is solid. I would select it again because it has an approximate placement rate over 70% of its graduates, prepares each of us for the real world classroom, and does a variety of assessments in an ongoing manner that continuously monitors progress towards teaching licensure. 

My goals are simple - graduate, become a full-time Social Studies teacher in a Middle-School, and teach for as many years as health and job available exist.

Jobs in Education are always a challenge so I do have the concern of a position upon graduation, but due to the quality of the program at NCU and their placement history, this is not as big a potential problem as it might otherwise be for finding work."
College Junior,5,"Twin Cities Minnesota has cultural, historical, sports, theater, and political activities for ever enjoyment."
College Junior,5,"Financial Aid officers are knowledgeable, friendly, and keep an open door policy. Their emphasis on preparing and planning, and borrowing as little as necessary is refreshing."
College Junior,5,The Education Department maintains currency with state and federal guidelines on what the students will be required to know to obtain teacher licensing. Very attentive to students as well as curriculum.
College Junior,5,"When you come to North Central you sign a contract that says you will not drink alcohol or do drugs. If you are caught it can be a basis of expulsion from the school. It makes sense because many students coming here plan on becoming pastors, youth pastors, missionaries, or in some form of ministry."
College Junior,5,"Our security at school is recognized nationally and the head of the security department has been recruited by homeland security before. Overall, our security is pretty top notch at North Central. Whenever there are thefts or non-northcentral people  within our buildings it is always due to students or other north central affiliates propping doors open. I also trust all the girls on my floor and I tend to leave my door unlocked. I've never had any theft or robbery. For someone to rob someone on our floor first they would have to get into the building which is by ID only, then they would have to get through a locked floor door, then they would have to get into a suite which could be locked and finally into a room door which could also be locked. That's four sets of locks, so I'd say it's pretty secure."
College Junior,5,"Living in Minneapolis there are countless places to go to. There is dinky town, uptown, down town, the warehouse district etc. There are multiple ethnic restaurants and your places to eat are endless and various."
College Freshman,5,I LOVE NCU so much! I would not change it for the world!
College Freshman,5,"I am 100% safe at NCU. There has never been a rape, drugs, murder or gang violence on campus. Off campus is another story, we always make sure we have buddies to walk with, especially men. The health at NCU is great but I do not think we have a nurse, which is not fully a problem since we live right next to a hospital. "
College Freshman,5,"The typical student has a classy, classy rocker or hipster style. I would say we have plenty of attractive students who love God and know how to dress. Also if you love dressing funky, go for it! You will definitely not be bullied or judged. The relationships here are amazing! The one thing I love about NCU is the amazing community we have!  "
College Freshman,5,There are many options everyday. I love being healthy and they provide me with great salad options. My favorite part is the smoothie bar.
Junior,4,"An incredible school where my love for the Lord has only grown more! NCU was the best decision I have made and I don't regret attending whatsoever. My one issue with the school however is how difficult the financial services has made it. Not just for me, but for other peers as well. They don't notify students when tuition increases, and they basically don't help the students when their financial aid decreases or a random charge is put on their account. I struggle so much financially because I have rarely gotten any help from the financial services and wish that they would do better at helping the students."
Junior,4,"Online learning wasn't that bad, personally I preferred online over in-person instruction. It made the environment feel safer."
Senior,4,Overall great experience here. Small class sizes provide better opportunities for more interaction with professors. The professors genuinely care about the students success and well being.
Sophomore,4,"I haven't had any planned classes online although, due to COVID-19 I was able to experience it. It was a big adjustment but my professors were extremely helpful and offered a lot of grace during this time to fit our needs."
Sophomore,4,"The location is awesome, there's a lot to do right off of campus. I always feel safe while on campus even though i'm in the heart of the city. It offers an amazing spiritual experience which is my favorite part. The professors and education that you'll receive is amazing! The food wasn't the best but they're renovating the entire cafeteria which is something to look forward to."
Junior,4,"I enjoy the education that I am getting. The business program is excellent and the Christian Studies minor is very interesting.
However, the codes and standards that students are held to can be very restricting."
Junior,4,"I personally am very happy with the time I have spent at North Central University. Overall, I do not have any complaints. The time I have been at North Central has been as a commuter. And in regards to life at North Central as a commuter I do believe there is a need for growth, but since I started I have seen efforts to change the lack of opportunities we receive. Such examples are social events being during later hours and constant information being brought not only to those who live on campus, but those who do not.

Even so, the staff at North Central are what I always tell people make the experience the best for me. They are kind, intelligent, willing to hear all opinions, and genuinely care about the education you receive. They give the best education I could have asked for and every dollar that comes out of my pocket worth the investment of receiving my education at North Central University."
Niche User,4,"The school is small, but the teachers are very involved and are always willing to help students with anything. They encourage students to be involved in the community."
Freshman,4,"North Central has a great atmosphere.  While it has its hang ups, like the food, there's no other place like this campus. We have teachers that are following God and you Chapel every day to be encouraged by other students searching after God. We have a very lively campus and it an ideal place for anyone looking for community during college."
Freshman,4,"The worship atmosphere. Everyone was incredibly friendly. I felt right at home, and even though my husband isn't going at the same time as me, he did too. The city is definitely the place for us."
Junior,4,At North Central University people are not just numbers. People are people. They care about forming relationships that will last forever. The teacher are amazing and are always helpful if one is struggling academically. The programs are amazing programs to help change the world. I wouldn’t choose any other school.
Freshman,4,I really enjoy the school. I’m not much of a city person but love the small school atmosphere. The professors here really care about you as a student and want to see you succeed. I would recommend this school as a positive environment to learn in. I would like to see more things available for students to do on weekends.
Freshman,4,"I love North Central because the small community of around 1500 students, make me feel very welcome! It's easier to make friends here  because everybody knows everybody! When you go to a class room and know 95% of the people in there, it makes me feel a lot more relaxed and I'm able to learn a lot better!"
College Senior,4,"I don't personally get involved with the athletic scene very much, however many of my friends attend the games; both varsity and intramural. The few times I have attended they have always been well put-together, high-energy, and loads of fun. Actually, as I reflect back on it, it is making me begin to wonder why I don't attend more often. They always make for good times and fun memories."
College Freshman,4,Don't know much. Haven't moved onto campus yet.
College Freshman,4,From what I've experienced everything seems great!
College Freshman,4,"Haven't attended school yet, but I've heard great things!"
College Sophomore,4,"Academics are great, depending on your professor depends on how the class will be"
College Freshman,4,Pretty average. Profressors and advisors are great!
College Freshman,4,Security is always there.  Crime is always reported.
College Freshman,4,Empasize the career opprountunities. I think theur should encourage students to start looking early and do somethings on their own. College is an interesting part of ones life where there are many opprountunities that students just don't take.
College Freshman,4,Professors are great. All very good at their craft. Love their students and care about their education.
College Sophomore,4,Very helpful and understanding staff! They will not let you fail!
College Junior,4,"Professors love talking with students, especially about class but even more of a mentor-type relationship."
College Junior,4,"NCU's security team is pretty amazing and actually lend a hand when they have the opportunity. They get have great trainings and have a fermented relationship with the Minneapolis Police Department. The whole campus is on lock down, so there are not any doors that open from the outside without a student/staff ID access card. There are also 24/7 security cameras that are watched 24/7, too, so if there is a crime--you could bet it's on camera. The only negative thing related to safety is sometimes cars get broken in-to in the parking lot or street parking, but that's all from the fact it's in the heart of Minneapolis."
College Junior,4,"Athletics are definitely at a huge climax at NCU and keep growing. The University is in the middle of downtown Minneapolis, next to Elliot Park, and they just transformed an average city park into an amazing soccer field--with terf. They just transformed the gym with new flooring, bleechers, scoreboard, ect and even have expanded the fitness center while making it free for all students. Last year, one of the sports even won either the division title or championship!"
College Junior,4,Its convient and most of the teachers are helpful
College Junior,4,I like the school because it js a great school. What makes it unique is the online option that allowed me to attend school in my own time.
College Sophomore,4,North Central has a carewire where you can search for jobs.
College Sophomore,4,I haven't taken many on campus classes yet but some class sizes are smaller than others and some bigger.
College Sophomore,4,There is some crime that happens on and around campus. Students are sent out an email stating what happened an where. There is always campus security walking around campus and if you ever don't feel safe you can call them and they will help in any way they can.
College Junior,4,The school has a great atmosphere. The faculty really cares about their students and wants to see them succeed.
College Freshman,4,The school I went to had a great environment. All the students and teachers were friendly and wanted to help each other perform well academically. The classes were challenging but there were many available ways to get help if needed.
College Senior,4,"I love my School, my teachers, and my fellow classmates"
College Junior,4,I really respect NCU's policies on strictness in the areas highlighted and how they keep us accountable and responsible.
College Junior,4,"We know how to have fun, but clean parties!"
College Freshman,4,"I live in the suites in Phillipps hall, and it's really nice to live in. There's 4 to 6 people for one bathroom and the rooms are very nice!"
College Junior,4,"The community at North Central University is top notch. They really value community life, especially in the dorms. There is a bond that is formed with the people on your floor and the Resident Staff really foster an encouraging and fun environment for the students living on campus. Being that NCU is a private school, it is more expensive but in comparison to other private schools, it is a pretty good deal."
College Senior,4,"There are a large variety of restaurants in the area around North Central which is very nice. This includes Italian, Oriental, Mexican, and many other different restaurants."
College Senior,4,"The financial aid process has traditionally gone poorly for me, but I think that is due to a problem with myself and not with the financial aid office at the school. One tip I have is to get everything done as soon as possible. There are some scholarships and grants that are awarded at a first come, first serve basis."
College Freshman,4,They recently remodeled the building so it is much nicer. I love my floor and the girls I live with
College Junior,4,"Living in downtown Minneapolis has its ups and downs, but the NCU campus is an extremely safe environment. Campus security does a great job of being a constant and watchful presence, and emergency notifications work well. Students are only put in danger when they intentionally ignore warnings."
College Junior,4,Students are not allowed to party at NCU. It makes campus communities closer and gets you more creative with fun around the Twin Cities.
College Junior,4,Rules are laid out clearly and those desiring an honest college experience will have no problem complying. Staff is extremely understanding towards students who show desire to succeed.
College Junior,4,"Living in the dorms gives you a whole new family. They have a great system for matching brother and sister floors for you to meet different friends, and you are able to be as involved or not involved as you wish."
College Junior,4,"You are set up for major success in whatever major you choose, providing you take advantage of the connections available in staff and faculty. They not only pour on the wisdom in classes and chapel, they also will go out of their way to provide opportunities for networking."
College Junior,4,"The professors are wonderful if you're willing to communicate with them. They care about the student's ability to learn, not simply their grade."
College Sophomore,4,"If you are caught with drugs you get kicked out of school, so if it is going on its not noticeable"
College Sophomore,4,Rooms are small and old
College Sophomore,4,Some classes are super hard and some are the complete opposite
College Sophomore,4,there aren't many people of other ethnicity
College Sophomore,4,I would be more involved
College Sophomore,4,I'm not sure how to apply for financial aid...
College Sophomore,4,"there is nothing bad against the school, its the city thats the problem"
College Senior,4,"The Communications Department is wonderful. Class scheduling is pretty easy and you generally get what you want, the department isn't that big so you get to know the students in your classes and professors very well if you choose to. The workload depends on the class you are taking and how well you want to do."
College Senior,4,I did not encounter any issues when getting into my program.
College Senior,4,"Well you are in Minnesota, so the weather can be pretty unpredictable. The winters vary some are horrible some are okay. But the summers are nice and so are spring and fall when they decide to stay."
College Senior,4,"The housing is great where I have lived. Since you get to choose where you live, I feel like you can't complain because you chose to live there. All buildings are in good shape and some are getting remodeled."
College Senior,4,"We are located in downtown Minneapolis, which serves for a lot of ethnic food choices along with your normal fast food chains as well."
College Senior,4,There are a few people that partake but it isn't obvious.
College Freshman,2,Very very very lacking in diveristy. Need a lot of work. If you're not conservative don't mention it.
College Junior,2,"If you don't have a car, it does seem pretty hard to get around downtown to find places to eat. The places there are besides the numerous coffee places have extremely high prices that make a challenge for already financially struggling college students."
College Sophomore,2,It was hard to get the financial aid that I needed.
College Senior,2,North Central is not a party school at all and parties in the traditional sense of the word do not happen often if at all in my experience.
College Junior,2,"Would love to see more international students, mostly white mid-western students currently."
College Sophomore,2,If you don't have a car your aren't going anywhere by yourself
College Sophomore,2,If you park on the street your car will get stolen
College Sophomore,2,"It's Minnesota, we generally don't have good weather"
Recent Alumnus,2,"no party is allowed is allowed in our school, no bar is available in our school."
Recent Alumnus,2,it is bad for a student to spent almost his life in the campus.
College Junior,2,Up to -50 windchill and a couple feet of snow. Challenge accepted.
College Sophomore,2,"I personally am very frustrated at this topic, because we are not allowed to live off-campus unless we are like 23. I know nothing about off-campus housing, and am frustrated that it is unavailable to me."
College Freshman,2,"We really do not get in to sports. A lot of us are Fine Arts majors, Business, Pastoral, Education, Ministry and ext. We find other ways to have fun but Intramural's are a big part of campus. We compete with our floors and support our Brother and sister floors! It is fun and painful! The major sports we do not have are football, swimming and golf. "
College Freshman,2,"Really Cold, but I love the school"
College Sophomore,2,Really really strict school. But. that is good if you are looking to uphold moral standards
College Sophomore,2,Minneapolis doesn't have much night life.
College Sophomore,2,They won't let us live off campus until junior year
College Junior,2,People constantly make jokes about the NCU internet.... 
College Junior,2,Snow. Sometimes you never leave the schools sky way system. Also walking to classes in buildings such as Mensing which is two blocks away from the main campus can sometimes feel like an arctic expedition in the winter months. Snow emergencies also cause students to move parking constantly at the risk of being fined by the school and the city. 
College Junior,2,"There are only two options for students. The caf and the deli. The deli is more to go food and students can get a ""sack meal"" for lunch or dinner, which has maybe 5 different options for the main part, as well as two side options of which there are maybe 20 options. The deli is also open for purchase until 10pm. The caf is open for breakfast lunch and dinner. Although they try, a lot of the times it is repetitious and mysterious. The most popular day among students is ""tender tuesdays"" when they serve chicken tenders in the caf. Although not officially on campus there is the Bandbox Diner (featured in the movie Mighty Ducks"") its right at the edge of campus. Its a little bit pricey, and its only open until 9pm. "
Alum,1,"Absolute joke of a school. Got a 4 year degree only to realize I could have learned everything I needed in a 2 hour seminar. 

Pretty much a glorified High school. 

Petty in extreme and will take all your money for nothing in return."
Senior,1,"At least 3 of my Recording Arts classmates were entertaining the idea of suing for tuition reimbursement. Eventually, after many horrible bumps in the road that included canceling half a semester worth of class periods, and teachers quitting because NCU didn't want to fit the bill for what the program would actually cost, they scrapped it, and consolidated the program into a ""worship arts degree."" Yes, while students were expecting the delivery of a promised program. I'm not sure what happened to my classmates but I know a lot of them were even more upset than I was about how NCU handled the issue. No refunds, no apologies, no discussions on how to make it right. They asked for students to be involved in process of restructuring, but they did not do anything to knowledge the reasons we were trying rebuild a program that should have already existed... then gutted it and kept thousands of tuition dollars. I had one more year to go and I was too disgusted to set foot there again."
College Sophomore,1,I wish we had better options. I think a lot of the off-campus dining is really questionable.
College Senior,1,I live off campus does not apply
College Senior,1,I am an online student this does not apply to me why do I have to answer these questions?
College Junior,1,Have asked about scholarships with no success.
College Sophomore,1,we don't have greek life
College Sophomore,1,you cannot go anywhere at night and feel safe
College Sophomore,1,"There is no nightlife. Unless you count hall gatherings, which I don't as i am a commuter. Minneapolis is a hub of entertainment, art and live music, but most students don't venture out.  At least as far as I am aware."
College Senior,1,better to live in your own home
College Sophomore,1,"There is only a small diner that is right at the corner of campus. Other than that, there are hardly any off-campus dining area around the campus. The closest one would be 9-10 blocks away where all the business buildings and stores are at."
College Junior,1,The meal plan is only good for the cafeteria and the deli. The food is nasty.
Recent Alumnus,1,"The Campus is very strict. Drugs, alcohol, and tobacco products are prohibited. There are no coed dorms but there limited visiting hours. The school adheres to Christian standards to a degree that is almost ridiculous."
College Sophomore,1,Christian University – There is no nightlife whatsoever at North Central University. It is a very strict university and the general population of the school enjoys movie nights every weekend.
College Sophomore,1,"Get Married and Live – There isn't really an option for off-campus housing at North Central.  
You can only be a certain age or have accumulated a certain amount of points to even be considered to have an off campus housing.  There isn;t much option when it comes to where you want to live and still attend the school. 
The dorms are tiny and the apartments are even tinier and expensive."
College Sophomore,1,Speaking in Tongues – everyone thinks they can do it! its scary. they're very charismatic.
Recent Alumnus,1,"It's Unique... but Not in a Good Way. The school is in a fantastic city which is really the only highlight of the entire experience I had there. The academic programs are greatly lacking, unless you are interested in teaching. The social scene exists but all events are based around Christianity. The facilities are horrible, except for a few areas, but even then any other school in Minneapolis could top it. Campus life is centered around prayer and Christian community, preventing most students from being able to escape the ""bubble"" that this tiny school does it's best to enclose you in. If you attend this school, the best thing to do is find great places and people to spend time with that are not affiliated with or in agreement with this school's beliefs, standards, and prejudices."
Recent Alumnus,1,"From the website you would assume that this school is fairly diverse. However, those few people you see on the website pictures from different ethnicities and races are basically the only ones. As for acceptance, unless you fit into their better-than-thou Christian mindset, you're basically screwed. There are some fantastic people that attend this school, but those people who are free-thinkers and actually enjoy critically thinking and challenging the typical conservative, Pentacostal views are usually the outsiders who receive a lot of flack and prayer from the rest of the student body."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Horrible Tech – The computer labs are out of date and provide hardly any services that any other university charging such high tech fees would provide. Also, the internet and networks are continually down for days at a time and the IT department does little to correct the problems. The majority of the school campus does not have Wi-Fi and if you make the trek to one of the few areas that claims to have it, chances are you won't be able to log on or it won't be working."

I was a graduate of the MPA - Emergency and Disaster Management program and I can safely say the degree is not worth the paper it is printed on. I also graduated with a 3.98 GPA. After being coaxed into this program instead of an MBA, which was what I originally wanted, I was not able to find any work and the school has little to no resources to support you. A major disappointment and I would urge anyone to pick a different program."
Graduate Student,1,The MBA Finance program is a waste of time and money.  You are doing basic courses that you have already covered in an undergrad. You're spending thousands of dollars doing over classes with content that was covered in community college. WASTE OF MONEY!!! I regret going there for that semester. WASTED my time and money.

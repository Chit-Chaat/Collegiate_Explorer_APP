Sophomore,5,I love University Of Vermont. I am very happy I chose here and could not see myself at any other school. The people are so welcoming and nice that it just instantly makes you feel at home.
Senior,5,"UVM is a great school. It is full of excellent professors who genuinely care about their students. The campus is beautiful and very environmentally conscious. There are numerous clubs, teams, and extra circulars to choose from. Central Campus residential hall  is by far the nicest dorm on campus. The older dorms are dated and need work."
Sophomore,5,"UVM is amazing, it is such a chill place to go to school. As long as you get a good jacket the cold weather is no problem!"
Sophomore,5,"UVM is amazing, it is such a chill place to go to school. As long as you get a good jacket the cold weather is no problem!"
Alum,5,The University of Vermont has some really great humanities and natural sciences programs. The campus is gorgeous and the professors are mostly pretty great.
Freshman,5,It is a very welcoming community and a beautiful campus in an active city. There is always activities to part take in and good class options.
Freshman,5,"I am in love with the University of Vermont. It is the absolute perfect place for me. There are countless opportunities this college offers. The campus is beautiful, the professors are excited about what they are teaching, and I have found so many clubs and extracurriculars that align with who I am."
Freshman,5,I took my classes online after the COVID-19 spring plan after the students were all sent home. The professors really worked with us to make the transition smooth and the materials we needed easily accessible.
Sophomore,5,"Their online courses are excellent. The course was well thought out, and it was clear that the professor put time and effort into the topic."
Sophomore,5,"UVM is the best school. Not only does it provide an amazing education, but the people you will meet will change your life. I had the chance to attend Standford, but I chose UVM because it is better. Why choose a school where you will be pressured all the time? UVM gave me acidic rigor while also giving me time to explore life. Places like Standford or Harvard do not give you that opportunity. I choose UVM because I wanted to choose happiness over a name school."
Freshman,5,its goodits goodits goodits goodits goodits goodits goodits goodits goodits goodits goodits goodits goodits good
Freshman,5,"love being on campus, welcoming environment and everyone appreciates the presence of others. easy to make friends & professors are super helpful. party scene is exclusive for the most part (either be on a team (club or varsity), sorority/frat, or know people who are) but going off campus for parties isn't essential to have a good time. dorm life is pretty lively (even wellness at times)"
Freshman,5,its very very good during the application process. I have visited multiple times and the campus is beautiful and people seem very nice. I will be attending in the fall. One critique I would say is that it is very very expensive
Alum,5,"UVM was a fantastic choice for me, and Burlington was an amazing place to live. There is something for everybody in terms of student clubs and organizations, and the class sizes--which are small despite the overall university's size--allowed for direct communication with professors. UVM prepared me for grad school as well as the workforce."
Freshman,5,Love the community aspect and Burlington! The people are so nice and very focused on the environment.
Junior,5,"UVM is the perfect size - not too big, not too small. Everywhere I go I can find people I know, but I never feel claustrophobic and I am always meeting new people. I love that we get to live on campus for 2 years (1 year definitely didn't feel like enough and 2 helped me get really comfortable and really find my place at the school), and then have the option to live off campus for 2 years in a college neighborhood and feel like i'm gaining independence and real world knowledge. I also designed my own major and feel very prepared to go directly into my desired career in cognitive/behavioral sciences."
Sophomore,5,"UVM is an amazing place to explore both academic opportunities and social experiences. The passion students hold for their clubs and majors is infectious and it drives a lot of folks towards wanting that same passion for something. I personally have gotten involved in so many ways on campus, not because I feel an obligation to, but because I believe it will make my experience more memorable."
Sophomore,5,"I transferred here from another school. I’m not sure if my old school was bad or UVM kids don’t know what other colleges are like, but the food here is soooo much better than my old school and the professors are a lot more in love with their subject. I have Dr.Garnett for my public health class and she is amazing!! There’s so many activities going on every day on campus. My old school was a commenter school so most people left after class and everything was dead. The dorms are just regular dorms, but I was lucky and got a single in L/L, so that is nice. You will definitely need warm clothing as they rarely cancel classes for snow. I’m from NY, so it’s kinda expensive, but no more expensive than any private school I got into. Overall, so glad a came here, it’s definitely one of the best choices I’ve made."
Alum,5,"UVM is a an amazing school with breathtaking views, sunsets, and surroundings.  Burlington is its own little community and will truly welcome you and accept you to make it feel like a home that yo never want to leave. If you like skiing/snowboarding this is the school to go to, being only ~25 minutes to Bolton and ~45 minutes to bigger mountains like Stowe and Bush.  Theres North Beach by the lake in the summer where students will have fires and go swimming and hang out.  There are plenty of mountains to hike nearby and other outdoor activities nearby as well. The bike path along the lake is great also.  My major was smaller, so all the. professors and my advisor knew my name and truly cared about me."
Niche User,5,"Great college town and feel.The University of Vermont (UVM),[a] officially The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, is a public research university in Burlington, Vermont. It was founded in 1791 and is the state's land-grant university.[6] UVM is among the oldest universities in the United States and is the fifth institution of higher education established in the New England region of the U.S. northeast.[7] It is also listed as one of the original eight ""Public Ivy"" institutions in the United States."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love uvm. It was my super safety school and I never thought I would go here especially when I go into all my other schools: brandies, babson, smith... But when I visited I knew I had to come. You will meet the best people in the world, have great professors, and overall have a balanced experience. Everyone here cares about you and is passionate about something. Yeah some people  are huge stoners but they go to class and do well in school. Its college, the work is going to be hard, plan classes strategically it will be fine. You can find parties but you won't just come across them. UVM is NOT a party school. I think it was in 2005 or something. But, if your thing is experimenting with drugs..  Go somewhere you think will make you happy and where you can become who you want to be not what will get you the highest salary out of college. Were all going to in debt anyway why not just live it up :)"
Freshman,5,Everyone at UVM is super passionate about something. Everyone wants to try to make the world better in some way.
Sophomore,5,"Super accessible professors and very easy to explore many interests within multiple disciplines.  This is made even easier coming in with credits, as it gives you more flexibility, but many degrees are easy to complete in 4 years without credit coming in."
Sophomore,5,"I currently go to UVM. A lot of people have different opinions on the school. The education program is phenomenal. The food is fine, go on points when you can because most of the dining halls aren't that healthy except central."
Freshman,5,This is an amazing university. They are so open to everyone and the overall environment is beautiful.
Niche User,5,I loved the atmosphere. It was unlike anything I had ever experienced. I went on a college tour over the summer to see colleges I might like and this college stood out so much. The college town of Burlington is unlike any other it's small yet it feels like you are on a city block in a big city. I would love to get the opportunity to go there after seeing this college it is top of my list.
Junior,5,"The University of Vermont has no shortage of passionate individuals - both students and professors/staff. There is something here for everyone - intramural sports, art shows, skiing, great food, Lake Champlain. I wish there were more people who are incredibility driven and entrepreneurial. It's true that although UVM is a ""public Ivy"" it does not have a private ivy league student culture. Students get there work done and do a lot of fun and impressive things but still, there are many kids who smoke and sit around all day. But hey, there's some of that everywhere. No mater where you are, it about surrounding yourself with the right people."
Freshman,5,"Upon first visiting UVM, I was automatically welcomed into he very friendly and motivating atmosphere. Everyone is always very helpful and kind. No one will ever feel out of place here because there are plenty of opportunities to meet new people and find a spot in things that you enjoy."
Niche User,5,I enjoy the campus life and the fact that there is so much to do within the area. You can meet new people every day and still feel like you're not in the city.
Niche User,5,It has a great feeling when you visit - amazing facilities and small classes - good ratio  for teacher / student p I hope I get in!
Graduate Student,5,"My online experience with UVM has been great so far. The advisors are very available and offer a lot of assistance. The professors are knowledgeable and the interface is very user friendly. The assignments are tough, but you have plenty of resources to guide you."
Graduate Student,5,"It provided a wonderful undergraduate experience, and encouraged me to stay for graduate studies!  I met a great professor that I started working with during my sophomore year, and I'm continuing that work for my master's thesis."
Sophomore,5,"I love the green campus, friendly laid-back people, fun classes, food, upbeat downtown, very hometown like, less stressful city vibe. Coming from DC its the perfect balance of nature and the outdoors, with academics, only thing unpredictable is rough Weather."
Niche User,5,"I LOVE the environment! It is very upbeat. The faculty is cool and cares about you even when they have large classes. I love my major and courses. Good stuff, 100%. Just wish there was better food, but I guess it's not terrible. The campus is great, Burlington is a great place to live and learn. There are lots to do, like skiing and whatnot.  I want to join Greek life soon. Lots of clubs to join. Lots of people to meet. Cool school, expensive, but worth it I guess.  Please take the time to pick a cool major, don;t be boring. Bloop blop."
Graduate Student,5,UVM has provided me with a great education that I have continued through their accelerated master's program.  The professors have been great resources for both my academic and professional careers.
Freshman,5,"Amazing school in terms of the vibes & students who attend. There are so many people from so many places & backgrounds that it's certain you will find your ""people!"" The academics are well rounded & you will be able to experience all types of disciplines. The feeling that you get while visiting the school is just great. For me, I knew immediately that I had found my place."
Alum,5,Great teaching and support. It’s a real gem . The campus has an Ivy feel connected to a Lake front Vermont town with views and places to enjoy. I would do it all again in a heartbeat.
Niche User,5,"UVM is a remarkable school. I can not be more happier with each visit i have leading up to my future there. Each visit is a billion times better then the one prior! Between the gorgeous agriculture, medium size campus and community, the amazing food, and an unforgettable community. This school can easily be described as the perfect ""dream school"". I can go on and on about how amazing just the layout of the school is, but i can talk even more about the amazing community. each person is so loving, caring, and outgoing. the professors are so easy to talk to, students are very welcoming on campus, and other important staff are very easy to have a conversations with and helpful when needed. when looking for a homey, welcoming, and loving environment  UVM is definitely the way to go."
Freshman,5,"There is so much to like about the University of Vermont and Burlington, Vermont!!!   I am nearly finished with my first year as a full-time student. I am from Erie, Pennsylvania, which is a nine-hour drive to Burlington, but choosing UVM and a school far from home, was one of the best choices I made. It is a good sized school with approximately 12,000 students, with great diversity of students, professors and majors. I had a choice of 10 schools of which I was accepted, and UVM topped my list. !"
Graduate Student,5,"Great professors, but depends on your major of course. The administration tries too hard to be diverse, though, because their actions are not always inclusive."
Niche User,5,"Great Location, lots of outdoor opportunities. Tuition is pricy for out of state students; however, UVM offers a lot of great scholarships. There are also many housing options for students."
Niche User,5,"The tour and information session was amazing. The staff had a very welcoming and friendly atmosphere and were very informative. The campus was beautiful, from the environmental friendly
campus to it’s adorable college town, there was not a single aspect I disliked!"
Niche User,5,"Love it! Such a great campus with lots and lots of opportunities offered throughtout.  Many chances to intern and get connected with the outside world.  Great little safe city outside the college.  Easy to contact teachers and lots of things to get yourself involved in on campus and off campus.  Very pretty campus with average size dorms but very clean and organized rooms.  You’ll always find somebody or something to love at the university of Vermont.  They have a dairy bar where you can get all different flavors of ice cream at almost any time of the day right in the cafeteria.  There is also easy access to skiing and snowboarding mountains which is an activity a lot of students choose to involve themselves in here at University of Vermont.  Last but not least, there are thousands and thousands of clubs, sport teams and activities that every student is allowed to go into."
Senior,5,"I loved the community that you join when you come to UVM. The staff and students are all very welcoming and it is an extremely supportive environment to become a part of. The thing I would change are the library hours and providing more building access to the students, especially around the time of finals."
Graduate Student,5,I went to University of Vermont for undergrad and am currently attending as a graduate student. I had a great experience there and I think it's a good size- a larger school with a small school feel.
Senior,5,"The University of Vermont is a great school! The UVM community is close knit and allows students to learn about their passions and grow through connections with others. There are many opportunities for internships, studying abroad, and service learning courses which get students out into the world to learn more than they can learn in the classroom alone. Additionally, Burlington is a great place to go to school. There are great shops and restaurants, as well as arts and live performances. I would recommend UVM to any student who is looking for a stellar University experience!"
Niche User,5,"I loved Burlington, and I loved the campus when I visited. The school is perfect for Environmental Science, which is what I want to study. It is a medium sized school, which means that it isn't too big but it isn't too small."
Junior,5,"Love it here, UVM is a great place to combine your interests and passions for service, academics, extracurriculars, and all in a really awesome town.  Burlington is such a great place to be, amazing food, people, and outdoor experiences.  UVM is a great size too, with roughly 10.6 thousand students, I always feel like I can meet someone new, but also feel like I'm part of a small community that I can call home."
Alum,5,"UVM was an amazing school. It is in a beautiful location with access to small businesses and local grocery. Burlington itself is a larger city, but the community feel of UVM really stands out. In each School, advisors are always on hand and supportive of your dreams and endeavors."
Niche User,5,I like the fact that UVM is a smaller school and the pre-medical program is outstanding. the doors were also clean and spacious. I like the fact that it is close to my home town. If I were to change anything about UVM it would be that they should expand on their internship program.
Senior,5,"People complain about none sense but no school is perfect. The environment here is a perfect middle ground between a large state school and a small liberal arts college. Burlington and it’s surround areas provide plenty of activities, restaurants, and events to keep students involved and occupied. I have had more fun here than any other college I’ve visisted through my siblings or friends. It really is the best of both worlds."
Senior,5,I love how inclusive University of Vermont is. The environment is very supportive and not cut-throat competitive like other big universities can be. The departments are close knit and it’s easy to feel like there’s an adult advising you and guiding your future. The campus is beautiful and there’s lots to do all year round in Burlington.
Alum,5,"UVM is a university with Ivy League-level professors, curricula, and resources. But perhaps more importantly, it has a down-to-earth quality that's just about impossible to find on elite college campuses."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Vermont has been a very fun school.  I participate in a varsity sport which made adapting to the school much easier than if I did not participate.  The school offers me a lot of financial aid which is very nice.  The school is large which is a new experience for those who are used to a small town/school like myself.  Some professors are hard to like during lectures, but outside of classes they are very nice and very willing to work with any student who takes the time to see them.  The scenery is very appealing as well.  Overall, I enjoy UVM which is why I will return for another three years."
Niche User,5,"UVM is located in an amazing area. While not in class students are able to go downtown either by walking or a short bus ride to the many great restaurants, theaters, or to see lake Champlain. The campus has many different food options. The facilities are updated. The new Wellness building is a great addition to the campus."
Sophomore,5,"UVM is an excellent college. The professors are top notch.  The reputation of students being pot smoking hippies could not be further from the truth.  The students are extremely intelligent and hardworking students who take their academics and future very seriously, besides the campus environment being amazingly beautiful!"
Freshman,5,"I love UVM, its a great school! They have great academics and student life and the campus is really beautiful! I think that the campus is the prettiest campus in the world and I really enjoy being in nature!"
Freshman,5,I like the stoners and the the activism but I wish there were less rich white kids sometimes. There are plenty of clubs to be involved with and you can join the outdoor club thing in the beginning of the year to get to know people quickly.
Alum,5,"I transferred to UVM and it was by far the greatest decision I ever made. I could never imagine having gone anywhere else for my undergrad. There is a real sense of community within the school and the greater Burlington area. You will never be bored and the professors genuinely want to see you succeed but you must put in the work to do so. It's a work hard, play hard atmosphere."
Freshman,5,The University of Vermont is a great school that provides endless opportunities for all. My life has changed in all the best ways because of this school.
Sophomore,4,I am a current sophomore at UVM. I am involved in a few clubs and that is how I met most of my friends. Everyone is very welcoming and makes you feel very comfortable.  The professors are super nice and make it very easy to form relationships with them and prepare you to possibly due future research.
Junior,4,"There's something for everyone here at UVM!  Want to study hard? Courses and resources are incredibly rewarding and professors are incredibly knowledgeable.  Otherwise, party on!"
Junior,4,"Professors were very knowledgeable and engaged.  Those that knew how to use the online interface were incredibly flexible, understanding, and efficient."
Senior,4,"I have taken many online classes at UVM. Each professor conducts their course in their own way. Wether they use zoom, blackboard, or Microsoft teams, each professor is doing the best they can. They are always willing to help if needed."
Junior,4,"The transition has not been too difficult. Professors delivered the lectures as clearly as possible. However, the different platforms used by each professor made it difficult."
Junior,4,The university is very good at providing support to its students. There is also a lot of different options for majors and minors. There are a range of different clubs on campus. The professors are very nice and do all they can to help you succeed.
Alum,4,"It provides a good space to learn. The CDAE department is full of professors and students who work to change the world. There are plenty of chances to study abroad, weather it be short term or long term. My biggest negative was cost. I was an out of state student and graduated with $110,000+ in student loans even though I had the biggest scholarship that the school offers.  They say the average UVM graduate leaves with $30,000 in debt."
Sophomore,4,"University of Vermont is a great school. Its large but not too big. There is just about anything you can think of to study or do for fun. The Lake and mountain provide beautiful views. It is too expensive for on thing, and for a University who prides themselves on morals, and the environment, are invested in things like fossil fuels that go against the University as a wholes morals."
Sophomore,4,"The transition online was definitely a difficult one, but professors had extensive office hours to help with the transition to remote learning. Labs were also done well even online."
Sophomore,4,"UVM has been a great experience so far. The use of a smaller class for all first year students allows for a steadier transition from high school to college. the staff I have been privileged to have so far has been so incredible, doing the most to help all students even with large classes"
Freshman,4,"I transitioned to online classes half way through the spring semester due to coronavirus. The transition was a little rocky, but once all the teachers figured out how they were going to carry out the rest of the semester it all came together. Since I was taking foundational classes most of my classes were lectures that ended up being posted online to watch. Most of my teachers went to great lengths to make themselves available often to answer any kind of question about the material we were learning. The teaching assistants also made it very clear that they were available to help anyone who had any questions."
Freshman,4,"UVM was very welcoming, and made the initial process of transitioning to college very smooth. I enjoyed all the clubs and volunteer opportunities that were offered. The fitness classes at the gym were so fun and great workouts. My teachers were all friendly and willing to help with any questions. Additionally, the teaching assistants for most of my classes made themselves readily available to help with any of concepts that were confusing in the class material. The dining hall was decent, but sometimes lacked a variety of options. The community at UVM is very friendly and open. When I got there everyone was kind and there was a very accepting atmosphere."
Freshman,4,"I love the environment at UVM. The people are very genuine and the academics are of high quality (for the most part). The most frustrating thing about UVM is the administration and their lack of care for the students and their views. Other than that, I have had an amazing experience at UVM so far."
Freshman,4,The majority of my professors did a very good job transitioning to online learning and making information accessible to the students. Some professors had live classes and some had recorded lectures. This mix made my days more doable. The workload seemed to be lowered because of online learning to make sure we could be successful.
Senior,4,"Even though professors had to scramble to put together online classes because of COVID-19, I think that they did an excellent job given the circumstances."
Senior,4,"I've enjoyed all of my higher level classes, but the intro classes were half great and half mediocre."
Alum,4,"Most of my professors responded to their emails regularly. In my experience, the professors who were hard to get in touch with online were available to meet during their office hours."
Alum,4,"I graduated from UVM 1 year ago, and I am very happy with my decision to complete my undergrad there. I met life-long friends, had some amazing professors, and was able to obtain incredible academic opportunities. I went into UVM Undecided and graduated as an Environmental Studies major. It is very easy to meet with professors outside of class and to get involved in undergraduate research opportunities. 

The City of Burlington is beautiful - nothing beats a Burlington sunset - and very walkable. The mountains are a short 30-60 minute drive away for hiking, biking, skiing/snowboarding, and rock climbing. I loved it so much I moved here after graduation.

I'm applying to grad schools in the fall, and I'm confident that the courses I took, the internships I obtained, and the experiences I had at UVM make me a strong candidate. I am so thankful for my experience at UVM! 

Misc: I wish UVM had more therapists & psychiatrists on staff, weed is everywhere, parties are hard to come by"
Freshman,4,I love the University of Vermont! It is truly the perfect school for me. I am studying nursing and have truly enjoyed all my courses and professors. I also love the campus. It is beautiful at every time of year ad there is always something fun to do. The surrounding area of Burlington also has a lot to offer and is a great place for a college student.
Niche User,4,"Good professors. I am attending online undergraduate classes, so I am not on campus.  My ratings are for my online experience only."
Freshman,4,"Being at UVM has taught me a lot about myself. It taught me I could find warmth in people no matter how freezing cold it is outside, that I could learn how to ski no matter how scary it is and that it doesn't matter where you are it's the people you're with (cheesy but true). I always wanted to live in California and escape the winter (in which I ended up doing the opposite- long story) but Vermont has a certain charm about it that you can't find in a superficial city like LA. The people are down to earth, friendly and seriously caring. Sure the winter is rough, but you can always bundle up and go skiing. During the winter weekends everyone is out on the mountain shredding pow or in the summer hitting the farmer's market. The lake is gorgeous in all seasons, the fall foliage is stunning and downtown Burlington has great food and shopping. It's a really lovely place."
Alum,4,"Great programs, HUGE amount of offerings and social opportunities as well as student life and academia. Large student population but feels small. Burlington offers a lot in the way of entertainment and nightlife along with outdoor adventures."
Graduate Student,4,"UVM's location and campus are amazing. Burlington is hard to beat. Not everyone is there to study, but that's up to you."
Freshman,4,"The University of Vermont is in a very nice location. There is much to do in downtown Burlington and in the surrounding areas. The campus itself is beautiful and has decent view of the nearby Green Mountains. The majority of the professors are great, although my experience with the physics department hasn't been great so far. Most of the dorms are outdated and like a cinderblock prison but if you're lucky a few of them are brand new and really nice."
Senior,4,I love the people I've met here and the things I've learned! It's an amazing community and I've really found myself in my four years here and discovered new passions.
Freshman,4,"I am a first year at this institution and I found the first semester very difficult, as most first years will at any college but I was able to take advantage of the countless resources in order to do well academically. This semester it is my goal to take care of my self socially and mentally. I hope to use my ten free counseling sessions per semester."
Sophomore,4,At UVM the community is extremely kind which fosters a community where people want to get to know you and one that instigates support. The changes I would want to see at UVM are the times for dining halls to be open.
Sophomore,4,"B+ on diversity is a joke!! Seriously such a white campus... 
Professors and athletics are great, party scene has a niche for everybody, as do non-party scenes! but, there's a false sense of activism etc. when all students care about are environmental causes and refuse a lot of the time to acknowledge their own privilege and bias.... a lot of white kids without a false sense of understanding of their privilege...."
Freshman,4,"UVM professors are excellent and provide research opportunities for students. There are a wide variety of majors and courses and the academics are rigorous. Academic advisors really care about student success, and help guide students who are undecided. Student organizations provide many opportunities for sports and cultural activities."
Freshman,4,"Great environment, but the two year on campus living requirement is a downer. There are amazing new labs in innovation and discovery that would be a STEM kids dream!"
Junior,4,"I love how beautiful the campus is. It is set in a unique town in Burlington which is a perfect mix between urban and rural. The people are very nice. The classes are engaging. The chemistry department is exceptional. A flaw is the physics department, which needs a great deal in improving. There are many locations and resources to study on campus. Tutoring and the writing center are resources available for all. It is a great school!"
Junior,4,I'm a tranfer student at UVM and instantly fell in love with it. I'm a Natural Resources major and the classes actually get me out into the field to teach me hands on. We're also so close in proximity to the green mountains that I'm able to get out and explore on my off days
Sophomore,4,"The professors here care so much about us. I transferred in, and my SPAN095-SU instructor has impacted my life in a not-so-small way. I feel like every student can make a difference here, and it is easy to settle into a routine where you matter, can lead, and also be taught. My advisors are supportive of my academic plans, even though they are ambitious. I am especially grateful for the Japanese department, as it lets me feel connected to my major and the culture in it. I also like the honors college, as the instructors are actively researching in the field they are teaching!"
Sophomore,4,"There are a lot of classes to chose from, and there are many clubs to get involved with. You are sure to find something you are interested in. Also, the professors and advisors are willing to help you and give valuable advice."
Junior,4,"My time at UVM has been great -  people are very very friendly and the campus is  beautiful! Definitely ample opportunity to get involved on campus - winters are cold and nightlife can be a bit dull sometimes if you're under 21, but overall UVM has been amazing."
Senior,4,"People and community are awesome, some classes/professors are kind of crummy, but you’ll get that everywhere. Overall good school, good for people who like to be outdoors/ with nature."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy most of the aspects of UVM. The academics are very strong and most of the people are very chill and friendly. Sometimes it can feel like a very large school but it’s there are lots of resources available because of that.
Sophomore,4,I am looking forward to my first year experience as a transferred student from a community college to a campus experience.
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love my college and I'm so excited to go back for my next 3 years. It is a little hard to get around the area without a car like most first years but there's plenty to do in the area and on campus. There's plenty of resources on campus for activities after classes, academic support and mental health. Overall, I feel as thought is a welcoming university and truly one of a kind."
Sophomore,4,I am an upcoming Sophomore at The University of Vermont! I am Majoring in Human Development and Family Studies and minoring in ASL. All my professors are knowledgeable and love what they do! The over all campus is amazing just be prepared for a lot of snow! It is a very accepting community and has no tolerance for any illicit activities on the campus. Favorite thing is going to hockey games! You're missing out if you do not go!
Senior,4,"I really enjoyed my time spent at the University of Vermont. The school community puts a huge emphasis on health and promoting the local culture. The food on campus is often local and delicious. I enjoy spending weekends and free time on the lake, downtown, or on a hike. During the winter the mountains are great for skiing, snowboarding, snowshoeing etc. The only thing I dislike about UVM is the extreme lack of Diversity. As a transfer student from a college in  Quebec, the lack of diversity is a bit disappointing. I miss being able to interact and make friends with individuals across the world. Although there is a lack of diversity the overall vibe at the school is very friendly and supportive for all."
Niche User,4,"UVM is very exciting and its campus is very well student-oriented, lots of social events going on and the location is beautiful no matter the season. UVM brings a lot of smart students ready for discoveries with a wide variety of classes."
Sophomore,4,Love going to school at the University of Vermont! Burlington is the best college town. Skiing here is great.
Sophomore,4,"What I enjoy about studying at UVM is the many opportunities students have to get involved. There are so many clubs and organizations on campus, you can really pursue many different areas of interest at the university."
Alum,4,"UVM is well known as a green school and the place to go to study the environment. The student body is a good size and generally forward thinking. Burlington is a great location to go to school, not overwhelmingly large but large enough that there are opportunities."
Niche User,4,The campus was beautiful! Very nice animal science program and I have had a nice experience there. The staff is very helpful and willing to answer all of my questions.
Freshman,4,I love how friendly all the staff are at UVM as well as the great amount of activities every week. I would like to see a greater appreciation for the arts and more credits toward these groups and classes because much time is taken in them just like regular classes.
Freshman,4,"WE isn't a cult! Highly recommend joining the Wellness Environment for access to free fitness passes, in-dorm gyms, decently healthy-ish food. Class sizes range from an easy 300 students to smaller, 20-40 size classes as you become more specialized in your classes. Lots of people go out to the bars, house parties can be difficult to get into, Greek life is active but not overly so, and people are generally accepting and welcoming of all sorts of students. However, it's a very, very, very white school population."
Sophomore,4,"I love UVM!!! The atmosphere is great, and the people are all genuine and nice! Professors will anything to help you succeed. My favorite thing is that there is always something to do, whether on campus or in the area."
Junior,4,"Really relaxed feel but with challenging classes. Social movements start here. Parties aren't unavoidable, but you probably can't throw a stone without hitting someone who smokes pot. The administration seems efficient and overall seems like a good investment. Lots of resources and ways to get involved."
Sophomore,4,"UVM is a very embracing and open minded university filled with brilliant and fun minds. There is an incredibly diverse number of courses that are very educational. There is also plenty to do off campus: walk downtown, go skiing, go hiking, etc."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the environment, the living and learning dorm and the various opportunities that the school has to offer."
Sophomore,4,Very good school with lists of opportunities but very easy to get lost in all the people. Some professors are great while others lack a lot.
Sophomore,4,"Really nice campus most building have been renovated recently but still have ancient charm. Okay sports scene, teams are pretty good and depending on sport/ game there is good turnout. Enough varying extracurricular to find your niche. Teachers are good and Academics depend on the department but most are good. CALS in particular is exceptional. Teachers there really will put the student's education first and want to teach you rather than get you a good grade."
Junior,4,"I personally love it here, the professors are great and the people are better. The administration, like at all colleges, tends to need some work on their attention to social justice. The dorms are fairly livable, and the food definitely could be worse."
Senior,4,"I love UVM. UVM has given me numerous opportunities such as working on campus, meeting people through university organized events, and overall allowing students to make their college experience their own. The campus is beautiful and close to downtown. UVM is a great school and I wouldn't change a thing."
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed the dorms and how clean they were and how friendly people were with everyone. It was nice to be able to feel comfortable on campus and not worry about anything other than focusing on academics. The professors were good and I was able to have the privilege to be with a few that have actually stood out to myself and many of my friends.
Niche User,4,"It looks like a nice campus with lots of great opportunities, but when I have been there it seems to look a little run down and old. It could get fixed up a little bit."
Sophomore,4,"I truly love the atmosphere and all of the people. I am more than happy with my choice of this university. The campus is beautiful. It is a larger campus but accommodations were made. There are three different bus routes, one even takes students to downtown. The class sizes are a good number despite the fact there are around 12,000 undergraduates. Professors are always willing to help students. The quality of the dorms vary depending on the building and the food is better at some locations on campus, but there are multiple places to eat on campus. The library is in a very central location and there is always available seating. The campus is very safe. UVM has almost every club imaginable. If they don't have one you are interested in you can create it! Overall, The University of Vermont is a wonderful school. During breaks I can not wait to get back to campus. I can not imagine myself at another school. I am very pleased with my decision to attend this university."
Sophomore,4,I have made amazing memories at this school. The staff is very eager to teach and further the education of each student. I find that the recourses available are excellent and the school has each and every students best interest at heart. Although I have only attended one year here I feel like I have made memories of a life time. There is an excellent campus and a wide variety of courses available
Sophomore,2,"I was online before everyone else due to an injury that the University could not accommodate for. Some of the online classes really need to be evaluated and changed because mine were borderline unfair. I acknowledge that the transition has been tough, but I've been taking online courses before it was 'mainstream' and it's not much different now that everyone's pretty much online. Course loads are unrealistically heavy and inconsistent. One week you have nothing then BAM next week you have three tests, two essays, blog posts and a quiz (this is my actual week and I take three classes). Professors must not be able to gauge their course load accurately because I spend more time now satisfying 9 credits than I did satisfying 16 on campus. I've had to resort to taking the bare minimum to keep my sanity. Overall going online here is not great, the University was never really setup for online only and the transition for larger classes has been a tough one."
Sophomore,2,"Initially I liked UVM, the campus seemed beautiful, situated in a great area, we toured a nice dorm, but as soon as I moved in my perception changed. I was stuck in quite possibly the worst dorm I had ever seen. I couldn't sleep most nights because of noise and weed/cigarette smoke. Drugs dictate much of the social scene. I'm also very disappointed with a lot of the in-person and online class offerings, many of the classes I've taken have no substance and serve just as another credit. Some professors were amazing, others drove me nuts and made me question just how easy it is to become a professor. You become a number in the system. There's not much guidance. I tried to better my situation but no one listened. I wish my experience was better, but now I know that UVM is not for me. Don't solely base your assumptions on written reviews, visit the school, ask to see other dorms, and really think about what YOU want to accomplish. Everyone's different."
Freshman,2,"UVM academics are amazing, but if you are not liberal DON'T go there!! I will be transferring next semester, because there is nothing to do without a car. If you have someone visiting with a car, there's no parking anywhere on campus and in town. The school is so focused on sustainability, but the food is pasteurized and is gross. The price is not reasonable for the time spent here. If you are not automatically in a clique, you're screwed. I cannot wait to leave."
Freshman,2,"Vermont is the 2nd whitest state in the U.S. and our campus diversity expresses that. Club sports are taken very seriously because our athletics are sub-par (really, how are we D1?). School is ridiculously expensive for the education that you get and you pay so much in housing with very little return. Campus is constantly littered with rolling paper and beer cans; president says that the campus is ""tobacco free"" but you walk 10 feet and find that there are SO MANY CIGARETTES. Burlington is a nice little city but hard to find parking, full of overpriced housing, and expensive. 
UVM is not divesting from fossil fuels and green-washes its students/faculty into thinking that it is super environmentally friendly."
Freshman,2,"I am transferring out of UVM. The academics here are awesome and challenging, but the feeling of isolation is detrimental. There are a lot of things to do here at UVM- only if you like the outdoors, of course. I don't ski, snowboard, and rarely hike and the weekends are boring. UVM students are very judgmental if you do not wear Patagonia, North Face, or athletic clothes all the time. I have tried to make my own fun and friends but it hasn't worked. You will enjoy UVM if you are the UVM type of person. Be very careful if you have depression, though, because the sun doesn't shine in the winter. The hockey games are fun."
College Sophomore,2,"My overall experience at this school what, to be frank, underwhelming. I found myself unimpressed by the attempt the University made to help with the high school to college transition."
College Freshman,2,Our teams do fairly well but nobody really pays attention.  Intramural are very popular though
College Freshman,2,"It seems hard to get internships here. It's a small community and if you want to ""make it big"" and have a career outside of Burlington or Vermont then it's rather challenging. They have career fairs for students to meet employers from big cities like DC, New York, and Boston, which tells you something about how how frustrating it is to get internships in Vermont."
College Freshman,2,"There is a huge lack of diversity at UVM and it's a bit unsettling, especially if you are a person of color. 

Also, Burlington is nice, but gets very boring. There's not much to do around here if you don't have a car to count on because the bus system is unreliable."
College Freshman,2,"Coming from a Hispanic person UVM has very little diversity. To be honest, it'll feel pretty weird to be here if you were used to being in a diverse area, but UVM is a very accepting place so you won't feel odd or exiled in any way."
College Freshman,2,"Almost everyone smokes or drinks at UVM. That being said, there is no peer pressure at UVM. You are welcomed to join, but no one will force you into doing drugs - people just want others to feel comfortable. It's pretty hard to get caught with drugs, but if you are you'll get the consequences that UVM states."
College Freshman,2,"I like that I live in a dorm that has a dining hall, but that's the only good thing about it. The dorm I live in was originally designed to be ""riot free"". It's like living in a high school with the fake cement bricks."
College Senior,2,"Burlington is beautiful, but I've never felt more ignored by those in my major or advising. The most help I've found has been from outside resources and professors not a part of my major. Advising was an absolute nightmare."
College Student,2,Rooms are small. Often times three people are shoved into a double sized room.
College Freshman,2,"I'm unhappy at UVM because it seems much bigger than it is, it's too far from home, and feels unhomey for me."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The food situation is very poor. The points plan enables you better options (slightly) but is expensive and not good for those with large appetites. The unlimited plan is convenient, but it gets old very quickly and the options very rarely changed, even year to year."
College Sophomore,2,"Members of Greek Life at UVM clearly try very hard, but their effort consistently falls short. It's a good social outlet for people might be otherwise lost socially or for those who are just looking for a community that drinks a lot of alcohol. All things considered, they do the most 'good' for the UVM community through their community service; however, they also without a doubt do the most 'bad' through their concentrated alcohol abuse and frequent campus violations."
College Freshman,2,I live on Trinity Campus and it is not worth what it costs. The buildings are very dirty and lack up keep (mostly due to the residents). Rules are rarely enforced. Broken glass is all around the door to my building. Northside cafe is actually terrible.
College Sophomore,2,"Sodexo is absolutely horrible. They don't care if you complain about something wrong with your food. You are required to purchase a very expensive meal plan the first two years, but after that you can get off it when you move off campus. It takes a while for your stomach to adjust to Sodexo, but every once in a while there is a decent option."
College Junior,2,"Sodexo sucks, and they make all of the food. The Davis center food and Brennan's are the only okay places on Campus to eat sodexo products"
College Senior,2,I'm in-state and they don't give me s**t…..
College Senior,2,"The food is way too expensive, and needs more variety."
College Senior,2,"I think that the school way too strict, and the fines are ridiculous."
College Freshman,2,"It's hard to find somewhere to stay, burlington isn't very big."
College Freshman,2,"If you aren't in the frat or sports club, or good friends with someone who is, you don't go to parties. Guys never get in."
College Senior,2,The dorms are all pretty small and if you live anywhere other than on central campus it is a long distance from classes.
College Freshman,2,"From a non-Greek on Greek life, I think it's a waste of resources and time. I have friends in Greek life who are constantly stressed out about drama from it, or getting the correct clothes, etc. Some Greek groups have good housing, others have not-so-nice houses. They don't really affect non-Greek students, though, so it's fine."
College Freshman,2,"There is almost little to no diversity in my college, and even in the university as a whole. It is mainly comprised of white, middle class, democratic students from New England. This stereotype is slowly changing however as the school makes more efforts to incorporate diversity into the admissions process."
College Freshman,2,"The unlimited dining halls are really sub-par. Cook dining hall is by far the worst, but unfortunately for me it's the closest to my dorm, and everything else is a 20 minute walk. Redstone probably has the best unlimited dining hall, although it still isn't great. The points options have the best food, but the prices are absolutely ridiculous."
College Freshman,2,"The dorms are very old and in most cases really small. If you're on central, expect a ""shoebox"" dorm. Trinity has decent size rooms but it's pretty far from campus, although it tends to be a close-knit community. If you're in Jeanne Mance, you're basically out of luck. No dining hall, no gym, and a far walk from classes. Redstone and Athletic campuses tend to be favored for their location and dorm sizes. University Heights has the best/newest dorms and amenities."
College Freshman,2,"Everything is extremely exclusive and you can only get in if you have a ""ticket"". Lots of the hosts (sports houses) have a specific list of people they've invited or just shut down the party early. It's pretty lame."
College Sophomore,2,"Hallway smelled like a grow-op evey day. Nobody ever seemed to get in trouble. I guess it was hard to catch anyone since it litrally smelled everywhere. Rooms were small and although redstone campus is pretty much the best place to live by far, it still needed a facelift and the rooms were even smaller on that part of campus. Also carpet hallways were probably not covered with coffee stains..... The smell of the place was just terrible sometimes. I was very disappointed with the value since it was an expensive school. Especially the housing."
College Freshman,2,There is a party outside of my dorm with a ton of weed literally every single night and no one seems to care.
College Senior,2,"UVM is a huge party school. Theres parties in the dorms, frats and off-campus starting on thirsty thursday and throughout the weekend pretty much every week. I'm not much of a party person, so I don't find the party scene to be very positive at all. It can be difficult to relax when your neighbors are loud and noisy all the time and it really encourages alcoholism and drug misuse which is a growing problem at UVM."
College Sophomore,2,There's a small percentage of students on campus who are not white and an even smaller portion of students who are low-income. Religious beliefs are fairly uniform across campus.
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of people come to UVM with ideas of what Vermonters are like and try to emulate that. It drives me crazy to see people wearing brand new work boots and $100 flannels for no purpose other than to look the part of a New Englander. There's no need for you to spit shine your work boots (okay rant over)!! Anyways, many of the people around campus are from upper-class families. It's not a huge deal for them to drop a couple hundred bucks on random stuff, so that's a big adjustment if you're not used to that lifestyle. Just because there is a large population of students here that come from money, it's kind of hard to connect with people on campus. Thankfully, not everyone is like that, but the ones who are, are just a tad too superficial and materialistic for students like myself to understand and connect with them."
College Sophomore,2,It's not worth the money I'm shoveling out to be taught by incompetent faculty.
College Sophomore,2,Stay far away from anything they cook
College Sophomore,2,Honestly living in the dorms is like being a child again.
College Sophomore,2,There are a few minorities however it's a measly percentage and somewhat laughable.
College Freshman,2,"Drugs and alcohol are too accessible on campus. As a result, a great deal of vandalism ensues."
College Freshman,2,"Unless you enjoy the outdoors, there's little to do"
College Freshman,2,No real action taken. Just stern emails.
College Senior,2,I would rate my overall experience a 1 on a scale of 100. The winters suck and their is nothing to do in Vermont except snow ski and eat.
College Senior,2,It depends on the major
College Senior,2,No jobs in Vermont and you compete with other students who graduated in the city that you will apply to so the competition is difficult.
College Senior,2,"It really depends on the program, Nursing, Medical school, Music, Engineering and Agriculture are the only real programs at U.V.M"
College Senior,2,More expensive then you would imagine for a small farm town. $1200 a month for a 1bedroom.
College Senior,2,"Small house, and dorm parties, weak but what can you do?"
College Freshman,2,They don't have m desired major
College Junior,2,The campus police are ridiculous about giving tickets. Parking is hard to find in general and they make it even harder.
College Junior,2,The dorms are very old and run down. They are not insulated very well and are very small. The housing process is a pain and results in many unhappy people. The social atmosphere varies depending on the building.
College Sophomore,2,"Off campus housing is really kinda shitty. Burlington has only a few people who own many of the apartments, which means they don't get upkept as well as they should and are way overpriced."
College Senior,2,I do not know if you want bad in meaning its high or good meaning its high. Grass is welcome here no one gets really in trouble for it and are just told to leave unless you have a lot on you. I personally refuse to deal with people that do that crap. It is welcome here to do drugs however anything hardcore you will get in trouble (as you should).
College Senior,2,I never hear about them unless they have thrown a party or some do some community work but that's all I know.
College Freshman,2,"The athletics at University of Vermont do not tend to be very spirited, however, many of the sports teams that do pretty well but are overshadowed or not payed attention to."
College Freshman,2,"UVM is definitely not a party school. It is however a drug/smoking school. Parties don't really exist unless you're willing to walk a mile off campus, even then its mainly upperclassmen. Good luck finding anything worthy of your time."
College Freshman,2,"The curriculum is dreadful, far too easy"
College Freshman,2,They did not give very much in scholarship
College Freshman,2,Less than 10% of students go greek. The greek students tend to do their own thing; they're pretty much a non-factor.
Freshman,1,"If I could give this place 0 stars I would. The fact that these people get paid keeps me up at night. Just thinking about going back to that place gives me nightmares. I knew within the first couple of days that I had made a terrible mistake. 
The only people you will find at uvm are trashy, white skater boys and horse girls. The only normal people I met here wanted to transfer too. If you hate your life, this is probably the college for you. My friends and I decided to go on a hike with the outing club and after it being prolonged nearly two hours because we had to stop to look at every mushroom on the trail, we finally got to meditate peacefully at the side of a river and were terrified to look over and see two companions gnawing on a walking stick and sharing it for a snack."
Alum,1,"University of Vermont is THE breeding ground for racist faculties with their attitude and actions being constantly fed and reinforced by the Administration, Provost Office, and the Office of International Education. Believe me, I am still suffering because of the way I was treated there. I was the victim and they turned everything around to make it look like my fault. If you are a non-white international student better be careful!!!"
Senior,1,"Do your research.  There are many better options out there.  UVM for the money doesn’t have much to offer academically, socially, sports, etc."
Freshman,1,"Be warned: you’re wasting your money. UVM is beautiful yes, but all this school provides is the smell of weed, hard drugs, boredom, and food that looks, tastes, and makes you vomit. I lasted one semester, and left along with 15 other people in my dorm alone. I knew from the first day I got there it was a mistake. The social scene is an absolute joke. I went out only TWO times over the semester, and I am a very social person. 2/3 of the freshman class are put into triples, so be prepared to be in a double room with bunkbeds and no space to breathe. There is nothing to do because downtown gets boring so quickly, and the only other place to go is target. There is only one restaurant on campus, and a salad is $11. If you are a stoner, hippie, member of the LGBTQ community, or absolutely hate your life—you’ve found the right place. Otherwise, save your money and go somewhere where you can actually make good memories. If it were free, I still wouldn’t go back."
Alum,1,"The academics were not challenging and the expectations from professors and students were terrible.  The entire community is generally depressed with little health resources to help. The party scene is bleak and sad with groups who somewhat hold control, and if you aren't interested in the same things theres nowhere for you to go or anything to do. Overall, don't go here."
Freshman,1,"I have not had a good experience here and will be transferring at the end of the semester. To play intramural sports you have to take a test? Then when you try to join, unless you know someone on the team you’re sol. My experience with the professors has been 50/50- I withdrew from one class as the professor had 1 office hour a week, and taught through YouTube videos. Food has turned out to be nothing like what it was described as when I took a tour, but thankfully, I’ve had a fridge and can get food at City Matket. My folks spent a ton  of $$ for me to go here( I’m from out of state) and it has been disappointing all around to day the least. I’ve personally found it to be VERY cliquey and not very diverse, and will not at all be sorry to say goodbye in a few weeks!"
Freshman,1,"Do yourself a favor and don't come to UVM. It is so clear on-campus that the students are not cared about. The office of residential life is a joke, and everyone on campus will tell you so. The dining halls are bad, all but one serve pizza, pasta, burgers, and fries every single day, and there have been multiple reports of maggots in the dining locations across campus. Unless you are living on Central or Athletic campus, classes are very far away from dorms, and even though there are busses, there are not nearly as many as there should be and 6 weeks into the school year they have already run over two students. I am not sure what UVM puts first, but it definitely is not the students. If you have to go here, join Greek life and you will at least have some community that supports you."
Alum,1,"If you want to go to a university to become a more capable professional/academic, DO NOT GO HERE.  This school continues to surrender to far-left students who hijack the discourse and experiences for all UVM students.  They have pushed to cut funding to all student groups where diversity and equity are not the ""central pillars"" of a group's purpose.  At UVM, there is no free exchange of ideas.  I'm all for protecting students' ability to feel they can freely share their ideas, but popular speech is not the speech that needs protecting -- it's ""unpopular"" speech that UVM refuses to protect.  At UVM, students regurgitate the same narrative over and over.  They aren't learning, they aren't pushing the frontiers of knowledge, they aren't becoming more well-rounded adults.  They are becoming tyrants & I cannot support a school that encourages it to happen."
Freshman,1,"The University of Vermont is extremely boring. The academics are good, classes are interesting and challenging, but the life outside of the classroom is not special. There is very little to do, especially without a car. Downtown gets tiring pretty quick. The administration is also extremely liberal, to the point that it is unwelcoming and feels like you always have to be on edge, and that's coming from someone who considers themselves to be pretty liberal. My advice would be to find a cheaper place with comparable academics with more to do around."
Recent Alumnus,1,"LOL. Is it possible to hear ""UVM"" and not immediately think of weed? I was a stoner pre-college, then stopped before I got here, and it's definitely negatively influenced my social life. People are smoking all the time and rarely get in trouble for it. 

""Hard"" drugs are present too, especially at parties. I see them regularly but they're rare enough that I'm still shocked whenever I do. 

There is specific housing for substance-free living which is cool, and it is ~possible~ to have a social life without smoking or drinking."
College Freshman,1,It's filthy rich white kids.
College Freshman,1,"If you have a drug problem and you're considering coming here, it will get much, much worse. Drugs are abundant, unlimited, high quality. If you had one drug lord at your high school pushing 5 packs a week thinking he was the boy, understand that your dorm building will probably have 4 of those guys moving 4 times what he was. Seriously. You'll meet a million dab-tards and kids addicted to substances you've never heard of. Psychedelic drugs on the weekdays. Drinking Tuesday through Saturday. Get used to it."
College Freshman,1,Greek life's a joke and if you're coming here cause you wanna be a frat bro we don't want you. They throw bad parties that are usually always ticketed. You'll stop trying go after a month into your freshman year and probably have a dozen horror stories about things you saw or experienced at a frat.
College Freshman,1,The winters are the worst I've ever experienced.
College Senior,1,It snows from October to late April
College Senior,1,"Medical, Engineering and Nursing are the only beneficial programs for the high cost of this education system."
College Senior,1,"The advisor for the NMT program is also the professor for almost all of the classes. The lectures are unorganized, confusing and the professor states information incorrectly. 75% of the students leave the program after the first few semesters. The professor is never prepared for class and he is inaccessible. You are better attending another program that will prepare you for the state exams. U.V.M. has a 100% pass rate on the national boards but only 2 to 4 students pass the program. This program has a real problem and I suspect that they will be closing it soon."
College Senior,1,"No real sports at UVM except for hockey, but the ski club is big and quidditch is a thing."
College Senior,1,"Parking hard to find, expensive and lots of tickets are written"
College Senior,1,Vermont is not worth the cost of the education and the professors in the health programs are egotistical and really just lousy educators. Do not be fooled by the Image of the 60's this University is lacking unless you attend the medical school or music program. Go to a real University!!! I warned you!
College Freshman,1,"Loud, obnoxious, unsafe... the partying is the absolute worst thing about UVM. It's so dangerous for the students who do it and also frightening for those of us that don't. I can't walk across campus on a Friday evening to go visit my friend - who also doesn't party - without bringing pepper spray. And my suite always smells like marijuana. The music is loud everywhere, the people are loud, and the RA's can't or won't do anything about it."
College Freshman,1,"UVM is a party school but it's easy to escape the drugs and alcohol. Drinking and marijuana are pretty much everywhere but there really isn't any pressure to partake. As for enforcement, the school is very serious about infractions but RAs vary in strictness. Some will let it go others report eveything."
College Sophomore,1,Upgrades needed in all the labs. Computers are so gummed up with software it takes 20 min to book.
College Freshman,1,Did not receive any financial aid
College Senior,1,Such and small town and so many students! It is awful to park in Burlington. If you trying to find a parking spot off-campus past 11 you will be driving around for 15 minutes at least. The cost to park on campus is outrageous! Its almost 400 dollars for the year.
Recent Alumnus,1,parking sucks. but in VT a car is necessary.
College Sophomore,1,"On campus parking is simply atrocious, especially with the prices charged by the university to allow students who are already paying $50, 000 tuitions. I think that the students should be able to at least park in the outlying campuses for free instead of paying 300-nearly 600 dollars just for parking a vehicle."
College Junior,1,"The scholarships here are geared mostly to graduate students.  I have yet to see any available to students in my major, psychology.  Additionally, information regarding scholarships available at UVM is hidden.  I had to weed through multiple websites and people to get a glimpse of my (disappointing) options."
College Sophomore,1,"There are just too many people, too many cars and not enough room."
College Senior,1,"Bad slumlords, difficult off-street parking, expensive, and hard to find. You have to have at least 4 roommates to make it work."
College Sophomore,1,"Students typically pay around $400 for a parking permit on campus. However, there are major limitations on the parking permits. The permits are color coded, and if your color permit isn't listed on a sign in a lot, don't even think about parking there. Typically permits only cover a student in the lot outside of their dorm building. 
Ticketing & fines are a major issue, and unless you're really careful you better save up some money to fork over to the school. It isn't unheard of for students to get fined for parking too crooked. However, everyone gets a single ""warning"" ticket before they're fined.
There isn't a huge need for a car on campus, but it's really nice to have one so you can do things outside of Burlington. If you're into hitting up the mountains during the winter, you're best off to have your own car or to know someone with a car, even though the school does provide some transportation to & from the mountains (something to look into if you're interested, I'm not positive how that works)."
College Student,1,"Below Average – On campus parking sucks. There are very limited spots available for people who live on campus, and auxiliary parking for commuting students is nonexistent. This is unacceptable in such a car dependent location."
College Freshman,1,"There is no diversity at UVM unless you go to the ALANA house. In my case, I met some diverse students but only because they lived in my dorm."
College Junior,1,"Local Bus – Local bus is very disorganized, doesn't follow the schedule"
College Sophomore,1,"Impossible to Argue With. I didn't qualify for financial aid, but I got $4,000 in merit per year, but a girl who was in my school and had lower grades than me but applied earlier received $5,000. It just wasn't a fair system and they wouldn't budge at all. 

Super cheap in-state school for what it provides though."
College Junior,1,"Learn to Walk Places. Take the Bus. Get a Friend With a Car. Parking on campus is limited, and parking permits are really expensive. They are pretty harsh about ticketing/towing. I survived my first two years with no car, and very few friends with cars on campus. The bus system is pretty great, both on and off campus, and free for students. And walking is a fine option (though this requires: rainboots and umbrella, winter boots that are practical, a serious winter jacket), and will get you in shape fast, with all those hills!"
College Freshman,1,"You're Livestock. And the best part is, you're giving them $50k a year.  Lets clear the air; UVM not the party school it once was, the advisement sucks, there is minimal academic assistance, and the food will give you acid reflux like you've been eating 9-volt batteries.  Some professors are truly exceptional, but take it from an ex T.A., we do all the grading and office hours at UVM, and we're only making $9 an hour.  Think about where the rest goes when you're arm wrestling for a computer in Votey, or paying out the nose for a copy in Bailey Howe, or enjoying your $8 garden salad in the Davis Center."
College Freshman,1,"It's a very poorly kept secret that colleges actively recruit students to fill our their diversity requirements, but none go quite as far as UVM.  While there is surprising amounts of diversity at UVM, all students take REQUIRED DIVERSITY ELECTIVES, or classes which are supposed to harbor a greater understanding and acceptance diversity.  Some of the more moderate teachers can accomplish this task, but others openly discriminate, making stereotypical remarks at students, racially profiling, and even going so far as to clearly favor students who share their gender and race.

*BE VERY CAREFUL* when choosing these classes, take other students opinions more seriously than your advisers."
College Freshman,1,"I Only Enjoy the Classes. People here are all the same and they don't take too well to anyone different from themselves.  The dorms are horribly loud, I can hear everything that the people who live above me are doing.  There are always drunk people outside yelling at each other for some reason and then they come through the dorms and damage the buildings.  The weather here IS hell.  It doesn't stop raining until it gets too cold, then it never stops snowing and there is no sunlight during the majority of the year.  Classes are hard and you need to devote your time to them in order to succeed, the people who party all the time are not doing very well. The classes, however hard are really interesting and the professors are very friendly and very helpful, and the school helps a lot if you have learning disabilities.  That is the only good part that I have seen so far."
College Sophomore,1,If You're Not Loaded They Don't Know How to Help – The financial aid office is never any help. They look at you like you're crazy if you ask about ways to get more money for college because they deal with rich kids that don't even need financial aid. It's absolutely frustrating. Any problem you have with them is ongoing and lasts a few weeks before it's resolved. They also try to nickel and dime you any chance they get.

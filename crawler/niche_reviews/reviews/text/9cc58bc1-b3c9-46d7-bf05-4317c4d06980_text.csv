Freshman,5,I like that everyone is there to help you. They will answer every question that you ask the best that they can or they will find out the answer and get back to you. If you call or email them they will either get right back with you or will get back with you within the hour.
Freshman,5,The teachers are always willing to help with as much as they can and they are rooting for you. They will make sure that you understand the material and if you do not understand then they encourage you to ask questions.
Freshman,5,Everyone at Hondros has been very helpful.  The instructors all seem to really care about the students and are willing to help.
Freshman,5,I won’t be taking online courses I am completely in class for this certificate the hours work with my schedule completely
Freshman,5,I start October and everyone is very helpful and friendly they help me understand what classes will be like
Sophomore,5,I have not had an online course. I am a new student starting in October. My experience at this point has been great.
Sophomore,5,They have helped me understand my options that will guarantee me success and helped with the total admissions process. i am a new student in October for the RN program.
Freshman,5,I loved that some of the courses at Hondros were offered online! It made it easier to juggle other activities and getting things done during school.
Niche User,5,"I couldn’t rate the party scene too high, or the athletic seem too high. Because, will you attend the campus of Hondros College of nursing in Toledo Ohio, there’s no party scene, strictly education, and they do not have a athletic team."
Sophomore,5,Teacher are caring and want to make sure students succeed. Miss Patti is the most caring professional I have ever met. Not only because of her personal experiences and struggles but because of the passion we see in her to help her students.
Freshman,5,Very warm and welcoming atmosphere. Everyone that I came in contact with that works at the campus are very friendly. They are also more than eager to help you get your feet off the ground and pursue your dreams.
Sophomore,5,The Professors are very helpful/involved with each students success within and out of the program. They have a great variety of restaurants near by as well.
Freshman,5,Affordable tuition with community partners that help with college tuition. Very helpful supportive staff to help you achieve your goals. Lowering the tuition.
Freshman,5,really nice and they are small enough to where you wont get lost and they are extremely helpful especially the staff.
Freshman,5,"Hondros is great for those who know they want to become nurses. It is quick, detailed, and full of helpful employees that are easily accessible."
Freshman,5,"I was at a huge University for my first year of college. With having dyslexia, if I needed help the University did not help, I would have to wait weeks just to get an answer and sometimes they wouldn't even answer the question. But at Hondros they are the most helpful, they walk you through everything, and make sure things do make sense, so you are not wasting your time. They have even helped with the outside of the school environment and helping me become who I am today. I highly recommend Hondros if you want to become a nurse and want to learn hands on and small classrooms."
Niche User,5,i like everything so far about hondros. the schedule and hours of the classes work perfect for me. i haven't actually started yet but i'm very excited!
Sophomore,5,Great for the average working adult.  LPN to RN program is great way to expand degree and obtain gainful employment while also being a mom and working full time.
Sophomore,5,"Great learning environment, wonderful faculty, they give you the necessary tools for success, they also have great connections within the community"
Freshman,5,I enjoy my classes and professors. All of my courses are very hands on and it makes learning fun. I learn at Hondros College things I will need in my nursing career.
Freshman,5,Hondros College has been a great experience with the hands on teaching and one on one help during admissions.
Freshman,5,"Very straight forward college that lost everything you will need know about attending, enrollment and being accepted into the college"
Freshman,5,"The people at the college are very friendly and informational. The administration is very prompt in giving information and following up on questions and or concerns that you may have. This college also have wonderful incentives on attending, I am very excited  to begin my journey with Hondros."
Freshman,5,"I am just getting started, but the enrollment process is very smooth and the staff is very helpful. No prerequisites are required so it was a breeze getting all of the little tasks finished in plenty of time. The HESI exam was not hard to pass. Financial aid is really helpful. The cost is higher than the local community college, but there is no waiting list."
Junior,5,"Absolutely the best private nursing school around! I’ve been to a couple of private schools, and nothing else compares. The facility are amazing and really care about their students.  It is expensive, but it is competitive to other private nursing schools in the area. I like the PN-RN program. They require LPN before you can take the RN program. So you can work as a nurse while you finish your RN. Or you can choose to be LPN with IV certification after only a year of schooling."
Freshman,5,"I am new to this school, but so far, I have had a warm welcoming and a positive experience. My questions have been answered easily and efficiently."
Freshman,5,Friendly staff and clean building. Admissions has been incredibly helpful with my application process.
Freshman,5,"So far my total experience with Hondros College has been great. I have an older sister whom graduated from there as well and she spoke great about it. I actually have chosen Hondros because of my older sister. The people I have met from the college have been great, they've all done everything to help and encourage me to pursue my nursing career. Everyone has been super attentive and amazing. The communication between the students and the staff is exceptional, they make sure you know what you're doing, everything is well explained and you fully understand the courses and process"
Freshman,5,I haven't started yet but the whole process was a breeze! From the testing prepping to test and everything I need to get done they were there with all the information I needed and answers to all my questions. Nothing was stressful other than tuition fees.
Senior,5,"It is a great nursing school to go to! I would recommend people to go to them, they are always very helpful and put the students first."
Freshman,5,Everybody there is wonderful! The employees make sure that you have everything that is needed for you to be a great student!
Niche User,5,I am a non-traditional adult student returning to complete my BSN in nursing.  My experience with the admissions counselor and financial aide counselor have been absolutely exceptional.  I look forward to the same experience with the professors going forward this academic school year.
Freshman,5,I have just signed up to continue my education at this school. Everyone has been completely helpful and encouraging during this process. I am very excited to start in January and would recommend this school to anyone.
Graduate Student,5,Hondros is giving me the opportunity to pursue my Nursing Degree while continuing to work full time and raise 4 grand children. Great Staff and state of the art campus and cirriculum.
Freshman,5,The amount for tuition they are claiming it costs is very inaccurate! $21k approximately per year. But that is the base amount and if you have transfer credits your amount will be less. You can also opt out of a few things.
Freshman,5,"I love the Nurse program, how it's put together.. the promptness of the staff.. the student advisors are awesome"
Freshman,5,Everyone has been so helpful and educative. Stress free and everything is such a simple process. Very welcoming faculty and I am so glad I chose hondros for being my choice of a nursing program.
Freshman,5,The staff has been very helpful in getting me started at Hondros. They go out of their way to make sure I do not need any help finishing paperwork. They make the process simple.
College Junior,5,You can still interact with professors and students! Also can be convenient with a work schedule
College Junior,5,They enable you to get your bachelors degree here and switch to another branch to do masters
College Junior,5,Not to large!! you get one on one time
College Junior,5,They always have employers recruiting on the campus plus if you work with a community partner you can get a reduction in tuition.
College Junior,5,So wonderful!! One of the best things is they send you your books in the mail. Everything is setup to help you succeed.
College Senior,5,"once done with schooling, an exit exam is taken and then the state board which certify you for the job market."
College Senior,5,"After being in Hondros college, I found out that they are the best compared to other (chamberlain). they way the lecturers organized their notes and carry on with class, offering tutorial class at the very first week of classes. this is very helpful to students to pick up at the early weeks so the don't feel lacking behind."
College Freshman,5,"Not problem.  The school provided computer and printer as part of the cost and package.  Easy set up and then IT there along the way to help.  Online classes easy to get into, register and follow."
College Freshman,5,professors great to work with.  Students focused and challenge each other to be their best.
College Freshman,5,I know others that have finished there nursing degree in a shorter amount of time and already landed new jobs using their nursing degree at top local hospitals
College Freshman,5,"I think the overall books, notes, handouts and teachers have been outstanding.  I'm in nursing school and everything is geared to making that happen."
College Freshman,5,Great professors and they really take the time to make sure you understand the material.  They are open to 1 on 1 time if needed.
College Junior,5,The offer rn - bsn programs and then give sister schools for your msn.
College Junior,5,The school provide job fairs and on site staffs to help correctly prepare resume and cover letter.
College Junior,5,Every staff member I have meet is down to earth and classes are perfect sizes with will to teach teachers.
College Junior,5,I am a nursing and throughout the program you gain hands on experience to prepare for your job.
College Junior,5,The staffs explain how they assure their student will learn and gain a wonderful eduation.
College Junior,5,Very easy to go in and get everything ready for admission in one day. They work very hard to get all credits possible to transfer and go over the financial aid prior to school starting making sure that you are able to afford the payment before committing to school
College Junior,5,Can take as many or as few as you want to complete your degree in your time schedule. There is always assistance if you need it.
College Junior,5,Awesome post graduate services. You can always ask them for assistance even if you aren't a recent graduate. Once you are a student there you are a student for life.
College Junior,5,Regular job fairs are held. Many positions are posted throughout the year. Only actively hiring employers can attend the job fair and they help you find a career even if you graduated 10 years ago.
College Junior,5,Professors are nice and class styles really fit every learning style. Free tutoring is offered not only by fellow students but professors who will come in on weekends to help you.
Freshman,4,Hondros is a nice school. Very comforting environment. The professors are amazing. I would definitely recommend.
Freshman,4,I have not started my online course yet. I am a visual learner so I am almost positive I wont do well regardless of the structure of the course on line.
Freshman,4,"All of the staff have been welcoming and very knowledgable. I don’t have enough financial aid to cover my cost for school, so they sent me over scholarships I could apply for to cover my $7000 total. They took time to help me come up with a plan to cover my cost so that I could continue my education in becoming a nurse."
Freshman,4,I love Hondros College so far! They have been really easy to work with and have helped me through every step of the process.
Niche User,4,I took my classes in the classroom. The teachers very knowledgeable of the material. I do need Hydro college of nursing in Toledo Ohio.
Senior,4,"The accelerated program is definitely challenging, but it is worth it.  The program is concept based learning, which is challenging at first, but you get use to it by the end of the program. The biggest area that needs improvement is respect. Some of the facility & instructors are very respectful, but others are demeaning, disregard what students say, talk down to students, & contradict one another."
Alum,4,"Hondros is a great way to become a nurse if  you don't want to worry about taking classes to get into the nursing program. No waiting lists, it's great!"
Freshman,4,The staff is really nice and knowledgeable the only part I dont like is they have u do testing and paying enrollment fees before applying for financial aid. I feel finacial aid shoukd be the first step in the process.
Sophomore,4,I graduated from hondros college in 2015. I will be going back in April 2019. Overall my previous experience was good. I had very little trouble getting through the program. The instructors were very helpful at times.
Freshman,4,"I believe that if you want a good nursing program with the ability to still work Hondros is the school for you. The nursing instructors are experienced and convey their knowledge to the students well. Their is a lot of support  for the students. They have free peer tutoring, instructors are open to meeting with you to go over subjects. They have open lab so you can practice your competencies. We also have a staff member dedicated entirely for student support. I am glad I chose Hondros."
Freshman,4,"Hondros is very strict and very professional. Everything is very clear and to the point. You know exactly what is expected and what is going to happen. The staff is very friendly and very helpful. Be prepared for a lot of out of class work and self teaching. We have asked if the campus would consider putting in a cafeteria so we don't have to leave campus for food. The campus promotes healthy eating, but contradicts it self by having vending machines that offers otherwise unhealthy options."
Freshman,4,I like that they are very professional and at this time I would not change anything about Hondors. Hondors provides you with the tools and skills that you need to go into the Nursing field and be very successful in it. They equip you with the knowledge to work in any healthcare setting and save individual lives.
Freshman,4,I am doing there lpn to rn program and they have been great to get started. They help get you the education we deserve.  It is costly but our futures are worth it.
Freshman,4,This college is very dedicated to ensuring you have success. They provide many opportunities and resources for success.
Freshman,4,"It is a small buy structured school. Focused and organized. There are on site tutors, the professors are great and willing to answer any questions or concerns. The classrooms are medium size so you feel included. There are around thirty students to a class. The clinical labs have great stimulating equipment."
Freshman,4,I love the fast paced environment. I have had mostly an overall great experience at this school! Would highly recommend if you’re looking for a fast track for nursing.
Niche User,4,"The atmosphere is welcoming, bright, large class room it make you want to continue your education or started a new one, the people are friendly and answer any questions you may have. they offer two boot camp class a week if you want help in mathematics for your admission exam test. the location is convenient right off the highway, there are places to eat right in side the building so you don't have to go out if you don't want to. But if you go out there is restaurant near by."
Freshman,4,I think that Hondros is a very good school I believe the staff there want you to succeed. They make it a priority to get to know their students by name and that really does make a difference.
Freshman,4,The school if degree focused. They offer lots of tutoring and one on one time with the professors. They also include an NCLEX boot camp.
Freshman,4,"This is my second try at a nursing school and I must say I love Hondros. The teachers here so far are amazing. Whenever you need them, they are right there to help, even off campus hours. I have learned so much at this school so far and it actually sticks. I feel safe on campus and even the other staff members are friendly. One thing I would like to see change is the book policy. Because I went to a nursing school before I had some of the book already, I couldn't deny any of the hondros books because their policy is you took all the books or none at all. However, other than that no complaints, so far."
Recent Alumnus,4,My convenience at this school has been great. They have both morning and evening classes.
Recent Alumnus,4,The quality of post-grad services at my school are great. There's a high number of opportunity for post-grads that are motivated.
Recent Alumnus,4,"The courses at this school are tough but bearable if you put forth the work. Also, the professors are very helpful and go out of their way to help dedicated students."
Recent Alumnus,4,The student career prospects  and the value of a degree are very high since the percentage of students finding employment after graduating from this school is above 70%.
Recent Alumnus,4,After completing entrance exam you get right into your program of study. There is no wait list at this college.
Recent Alumnus,4,My overall experience at school so far has been great. The staff is wonderful and the school is great if you are trying to get into your program of study right away.
College Junior,4,I love the way its setup. Its like a ladder. You begin with the LPN then RN then RN-BSN.
College Senior,4,"LPN nursing is challenging, as there are new things you learn in school. so I need unlearned some of the things I learned from on work experience and make space for the new critical thinking steps involving my scope of study. the workload is much but I can deal with it, classes are every week, labs, lectures and tutorials keep me going. internship will be coming up by end of the second semister."
College Senior,4,I only had to request my transfer credit from previous school and it was reviewed and credited accordingly
College Senior,4,The only thing I noticed about post grad is that they have review session that are held in the school to assist students with Nclex exam fees and reviewing test materials.
College Senior,4,Most of the professors are well educated and possess professionalism. Most of them have ways of making difficult assignment or classwork easy to understand
College Senior,4,The school value their nursing program because they go all out to help students get study materials for Nclex exams.
College Senior,4,The program is well design not to only assist student with class test but to prepare student for Nclex exams
College Senior,4,I enjoy the way most of the teachers go all route to help students succeed. Some of the teachers go out of their way and schedule appointments for students that need help. They also show students resources that we benefitted from inorder to succeed.
College Junior,4,it is a very big workload
College Junior,4,it is a great survey
College Junior,4,real live in world use of the material.
College Junior,4,"the school so far is great, schedules and books were on time before the start of class."
College Junior,4,Awesome school!! Staff is incredibly helpful and go out of their way to fit into your schedule. You are set up for success from the moment you show interest in the school. You aren't just a number they truly care about you and want you to succeed.
College Junior,4,The school works with several different community partners that help their students with jobs and experience during and after school. If you get a job with one of these partners then the school offers discounts for your education. The school does a wonderful job bringing it's students and community together and encourages it also.
College Junior,4,So far my experience with this school has been great. Everyone has been very polite and treat you as an individual instead of a number. Any questions I've had have been answered in a very timely manner also.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of people seem to value Hondros as a school so we would probably have a good amount of job opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,We have a variety of class work to do and we can kind of do it at our own pace. There is a lot of reading at it may seem impossible to do all the assigned reading but you have to do it anyway. There are a lot of group activities that we do during class that involve our homework. I wish we wouldn't do group activities because I don't find them very beneficial. but the activities are usually about the homework.
College Sophomore,4,The workload is heavy. We're in nursing school so it's going to be a lot. Anatomy and Physiology specifically has a heavy work load and you can get behind quickly if you don't pay attention to what's going on in class. And even though they don't grade the homework you have to do it or you won't understand anything.
College Sophomore,4,So far my experience at Hondros has been great. My teachers are nice and informative and they actually care if you are passing or not. Though there has been a serious overhaul on the amount of credits that you take per term which is good for us. It used to be 18 credit hours per term and not it has gotten reduced to 12 which gives us more time to study. Though they've increased the price per credit hour which they didn't inform us of. Our academic advisors were supposed to inform us of the change before school started in the beginning of January but they didn't. They messed up my monthly payments on my tuition as well.
College Junior,4,The school is very nice. The faculty and staff is very attentive to the students needs.
College Junior,4,I drive roughly 45 minutes to school one way the class times are not convenient but with all things if you are motivated to achieve your goal you will
College Junior,4,They are convent and can be taken at your discretion
College Junior,4,It seems the staff is focused on your success
College Junior,4,The instructors seem to be very knowledgeable
College Junior,4,"Thus is my first quarter here at Hondros and though the school is very expensive, I feel the education received is valuable and very rewarding"
College Senior,4,"Convenience is something that everyone loves.  School is close off of the highway, and the flexibility of classes is nice to let you have some family time and some time to work."
College Senior,4,"Online courses are easy to navigate, and easy to understand.  If you need help there is IT help that can help you get around the online classroom."
College Senior,4,"Even after you graduate, the school is there to help you find a new job or career if you want, or need help."
College Senior,4,There are a bunch of different career options nurses can take.
College Junior,4,No problems as of yet..
College Junior,4,"The online course was easy to do. Getting in contact with the professor was simple. Submitting homework, taking quizzes and finals were easy.  Talking with fellow classmates through discussion or chat rooms was simple."
College Junior,4,"I work with nurses who have went to this school and graduated. I'm a STNA, and when I graduate I'm working as a nurse at the facility I am presently employed."
College Junior,4,"All of the professors have been really good. Except one. And it's not just my class that has had a issue, but a previous class also.. He's scattered with the course. Nothing really goes with the book.."
College Junior,4,"Job fairs often. Hospitals, nursing homes, doctor offices have been there looking to recruit .. that's real cool. Also a bulletin board with jobs on it for students and new grads."
Sophomore,2,I have yet to start but overall my experience has been good. Seems like the cost will be high. Thus far the instructors appear to be knowledgeable and approachable.
Sophomore,2,"Prices change, New curriculum is not beneficial for someone who has never worked in  health care.  It is harder to understand the programs because there is no build up to each program. "
College Freshman,2,"There is only one time slot for each class, so you have to make it work."
College Freshman,2,The school is so expensive and being in the lower middle class I will leave school with a great deal of debt. Having to pay off school for the rest of my life is not what I want to do. The financial aid office here has no clue how to do their job correctly it took them months to process my information that shouldve only taken a week or so.
College Junior,2,I have so far only taken one online course and it was for English composition and I was not satisfied. The teacher took a long time grading papers and did not always respond to emails within 48 hours. 
College Junior,2,"Paying for college almost seems impossible. Taking out loans was not the hard part. The hard part was receiving scholarships so taking out loans would not be as necessary. I currently have over $20,000 in loans and I am only in my first semester of my school. I have never received a scholarship so the amount of money I owe for my loans has always been overwhelming. "
College Senior,2,things were unorganized at times and it pushed dates and classes back and did not allow sufficient time for preparation and studying in some courses.
College Junior,2,They have no resouces available for the students. In one circumstance where we had to go to a weekend long ceminar for an NCLEX review they changed the location of it and it ended up being over an hour different of driving time for everyone. we asked for maybe a gas card or a rideshare for this but we were not accomodated for anything.
College Junior,2,I chose this school because the ratings were so high. I have been dissapointed though with the lack of support in the financial support area. I have also been dissapointed with the schedule for classes I drive over an hour for school and a lot of time it comes down to we only have school for an hour a day and then it is over where they could combine that day of school and another day and it would be less driving time. I was also told that there would be no evening classes which is not the case because some times we are there till after 5 pm. these are little dissapointments but dissapointments as they may be.
College Junior,2,Printing Issues – There are issues with nrtwork every now and then but the real issues lies with printing. We have a very complicated system with printing. You have to pay a certain amount of money into your student account to print and it's just way too complicated that students just prefer to go to a public library
College Junior,2,No Facilities – There are no facilities in school because the school is a small campus. It is basically a builiding with a bunch of classrooms and a few science labs
College Senior,2,"Tuition, Yuck! Each student has either cried or complained about the financial aid office. The Director of Financial Aid is a cold person, talks to you as if they would rather be doing something else. Also, the financial aid office doesnn't supply the students with the many options available such as grants, the NEALP for nursing students, scholarship links, etc. They are very forward with wanting their money, and if you choose to go here, make sure you have back up money for tuition coverage. I would recommend investigating further funding for your education and having that assistance available before signing your financial aid documents for the school. Enrollment is four times a year: January, April, July, and October. If you get accepted in March and they want to start you in April, postpone your enrollment until the next quarter. Trust me, every student has to pay something out of pocket, allow yourself the time to find extra funds because this school is exspensive!
     However, when it comes to the quality of education you are recieving, the hassle is worth it. Very seldomo would a student have to deal with the financial aid office, once things are in order, you can focus on you curriculum which is in fact challenging and time consuming."
Graduate Student,1,"If you are looking into going to a nursing school....definitely look further. The sweet little lady vicky at the front desk will win you over and you will think that everybody is so warm and welcoming, but that's not the case. It's a huge front. They care way more about money than the actual success of their students. They won't let you know what's going on until the very last min. I'm a 4th term PN student and classes start tomorrow and I still have no access to my EAQ's, dates are wrong in CAMS and when you email them you get told ""they should be correct"" yes they should be, but they are not. I like to be organized and it helps with your success. NOTHING here is organized. NOTHING. 0/10 wouldn't reccomend. This place is a joke. Also if you want to transfer none of your credits for your associates transfer so you have to repeat your anatomy and your English."
Graduate Student,1,During COVID we had to pay 350 for a lab we never even got to take. Don't ask them where your money is because they'll let you know their VCE's that didn't teach you anything is where your money went....
Niche User,1,is awful.  The class I was in lost so many people.  So much confusion.  Too much not knowing what's going on.  Try to add extra costs on to you.  Teachers tell you not to listen to another instructor.  They advertise no pre reqs.  It's all added at the same time you are doing your nursing.  When I was there one instructor got in trouble with the law.  Pretty serious charge.  So many left.  Or flunked and went somewhere else.  As did I.  They also give special privileges  to certain things.  This is in regards to the hondros in fairborn.. Awful
College Senior,1,We had our only 2 instructors for the second semester both quit on us. The instructors sometimes cannot control the classroom. Students like to talk more than learn from our instructors.
College Freshman,1,There is no flexibility unfortunately considering it is a nursing school.
College Senior,1,"Financial aid here can be a nightmare.  You must stay on top of and keep copies of everything including emails.  Plan on submitting everything 2 or 3 times, and constantly follow up."

Sophomore,5,Being at Wagner College feels like being at home. The small campus is beautiful and it's so nice to walk around it. You can always see people around and everyone is so friendly. The professors and employees are always nice and respectful around. I don't believe I would change anything really except for diversity around campus and better conditions for dorms which work is being done on some.
Freshman,5,"Wagner College has students who care about the student body and their college life on campus.  Campus Life, class rooms, Greek life and activities make the transition from high school to college easy."
Freshman,5,"Wagner College is a beautiful and encouraging place to got to school.  With it being so close to Manhattan, and having students from over 10 different countries, there is a variety of people and places to meet and explore.  The professors are extremely helpful, intelligent, and considerate.  The campus itself is beautiful and full of life.  There is no other place I would want to attend."
Senior,5,the school is located on a beautiful campus and i do not have any bad things to say about the school
Freshman,5,I am truly in love with Wagner's learning community curriculum. It's definitely the liberal arts program I wanted in my college experience.
Junior,5,very great campus and great staff. The only thing about this college is that the tuition is very expensive.
Sophomore,5,"I love Wagner. The campus is small, but very beautiful. The professors are incredible and have opened endless doors for my career."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Wagner College has been amazing. I'm approaching my sophmore year and I am more than ready to start my classes. The professors are very engaging and helpful and they make you feel like you are in a family more than just a statistic. I am a nursing major so the requirements are to take classes like Anatomy and Physiology which are not easy but with professors that make sure you understand the content, they put you in a position to succeed. Wagner College is also filled with many sports as we are nationally ranked in Water Polo, and we recently had our basketball team win a conference championship. These types of things bring the school and students closer together as it is something for everyone to enjoy and watch. Overall my experience is great and i'm already looking forward to starting the next semester and getting closer to my goals of getting into nursing school and becoming a nurse practitioner."
Alum,5,Wagner has the most beautiful view of the NYC skyline. The Academics of Learning Communities was introduced when I was a freshman by then Provost and Now Wagner College President Gurraci.  With being close to the City students are involved with the best companies in the world for internships.  Students also get the exposure of NCAA division 1 sports.  The experience U had at Wagner was the best years of my life while receiving a great education.
Junior,5,"I am in the Theater and Speech department ,  majoring in Musical Theater Performance. Wagner College's acting, vocal and dance training is staffed by former professionals in each of those areas including actors who have won Tony Awards or been in original Broadway productions which have won Tony Awards. I was excited to be accepted to the program and am EXTREMELY pleased with the instruction I have received while here. It is a shame the college does not do more to publicly highlight those who have gone on to be successful in the theater or theater arts because there are many!"
Freshman,5,Wagner College is a great college campus that challenges students academically and encourages students to be civically engaged. The liberal arts educations allows you to open your mind and learn about different fields outside of your major. It is very welcoming and incredibly beautiful.
Freshman,5,"At Wagner College, you get a mix of a beautiful campus and wonderful professors. Small class sizes allow for a personalized experience. You will be full prepared for a successful future. With a combination of extracurriculars, you will never be bored at Wagner."
Sophomore,5,"Wagner College is an incredible school. I could not be more impressed by the professors and staff. The classes are small and everyone on the campus is there to help you. I could not think of going to school anywhere else. The best part of Wagner is how close you are to NYC. It is only a short ferry ride away and the opportunities are endless. The internships you can receive are amazing. Wagner is also extremely safe. I have never felt uncomfortable on the campus. Everyone is like a family at Wagner which makes you feel right at home! Overall, I have had a wonderful experience at Wagner and would recommend this school to anyone considering it."
College Freshman,5,"Wagner is rated top 3 in the nation for my major,  so exciting!!!"
College Freshman,5,The professors are all extremely talented professionals who have the best interest of the students in mind.
College Freshman,5,So far I have had nothing but the easiest transition and have dealt with an amazing caring community of people.
College Junior,5,"My overall experience at Wagner College has been fantastic! I have worked hard, joined clubs, and forged many great friendships.  I love the convenience of the school and I do not regret anything.  I look forward to another three great years at the school and would recommend this college to my younger siblings and friends."
College Junior,5,"While I look ahead towards graduation, I am optimistic that employers will know the value of Wagner College and would consider me for employment over other possible candidates.  Wagner College is a well-known school and is known for its academic success and rigorous curriculum.  So, with that said, when applying for a job, I will exhibit the confidence and knowledge that Wagner College has provided me with."
College Junior,5,"Wagner College has been a great experience thus far, and I am looking forward to a great academic career, that will afford me with great career opportunities.  I am pursuing a nursing career because I am passionate on working with people and this field has always interested me since high school.  I hope you consider me for this scholarship as I will work hard to achieve academic success."
College Freshman,5,My school is unique because freshman year consists of learning communities where two classes in our major connect to create a balanced third class. I learn a lot from being in my learning community and hope to do it again next year.
College Sophomore,5,Very diverse. There are different clubs and greek life regarding different ethnicity and races.
College Sophomore,5,Before you enter the college you have to take an alcohol test online which tells you the safety of drinking and doing illegal drugs.
College Freshman,5,"There is security everywhere you go on campus morning, day and night. I feel extremely safe on campus. One morning I had a class in Campus Hall which is the furthest classroom from the parking lot. Campus security was driving around in the golf cart and offered me a ride to the classroom. I really appreciated it because I know that they are doing anything for the students to feel safe."
College Freshman,5,The career center will help anyone find the job that they are interested in. Wagner offers a lot.
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus.
College Freshman,5,There are a lot of internship options
College Freshman,5,"As you are on campus, you will notice that there is always some form of security around you. Wagner has security throughout the school to ensure that students are safe to roam all around. I never once felt unsafe on campus."
College Freshman,5,"Professors are truly invested in each student. They are always available and willing to help. Personally, I did not want to be 1 of the 100 students in a classroom - I wanted student and professor interaction. Wagner classes range from 20-30 students with professors working with each and every student."
College Freshman,5,We constantly receive emails for job opportunities or internship opportunities. Wagner makes sure that students will leave with an excellent education and have some type of job or internship for every student.
College Freshman,5,Wagner College has many sports that are consider D1. Students are constantly in the know with all events that are taking place and how we can take part in them. Wagner has one of the best school spirits!
College Freshman,5,"I commute to Wagner College everyday from North Jersey. At first, I was concerned since I commute, I would not be able to be as involved in school activities and make friends. However, for orientation freshman year, Wagner held a three day function for all incoming students to take part. Through this time we all interacted and I've made friends that I am still very close with at the beginning of my spring semester of sophomore year. Wagner allows me to remain involved in all events and makes sure there is something for every student to take part in."
College Sophomore,5,The quality of the classes is usually great and the professors really try to get to know you personally- which is easier due to small class sizes. This really makes the classes more interesting and fun.
College Sophomore,5,The career center works so hard to help us get internships and build our resumes. They also prepare us for such internships and interviews for them as well as jobs. They will do mock interviews and help you write resumes as long as you reach out to them. They are on of the most helpful offices and I don't think I could be more prepared for going out and interviewing without their help!
College Sophomore,5,"Wagner is a civically active school and without that sense of community and support around campus, as well as around Staten Island I wouldn't be where I am today as a sophomore. Without the tight knit community that Wagner puts incredible amounts of time to create and build, both on campus and off, I would be struggle in all fields. Wagner truly is like my second home and for some, it may be even considered their home. I could not be more happy with my choice, and hey, what is better then a beautiful campus in the middle of New York City... You won't find any other like it."
College Freshman,5,"Its NYC, if you want to do it we have it."
College Freshman,5,We are a diverse campus. People from all over the world come to Wagner and feel at home. I know from personal experience that we have the highest quality staff in the Center for Intercultural Advancement who will do everything to make everyone comfortable. They are incredible and work harder than one would ever expect.
College Freshman,5,"Professors are great. Curriculum provides challenge but not unnecessary pain. Registration is fair and easy. Workload is sufficient to keel you busy but give you time for other activities as well. You can study in the library, with teachers or in groups, plus you can study with your group in private study rooms."
College Freshman,5,"There is no safety issues at Wagner. Currently a new security review is being done to reassure people and new measures are being added all the time. I have never felt unsafe on campus, and dont think I ever would. I have walked around on campus at 3-5am and still felt safe. Wagner has a great team on campus that comprise Public Safety."
College Freshman,5,"Best experience you can get. Lots of options, great professors, small class sizes. Quality is at the top, both in teachers and classes."
College Freshman,5,"Wagner students have the best opportunities available being in New York City, plus Wagner has a 100% internship rate for it's students."
College Freshman,5,"Wagner housing is currently going through renovation, though there is a new building now. The views from some of the buildings are unbeatable as you can see everything from New Jersey to Coney Island. So the skyline of New York is your view every day. The towers residential complex isnt the best, but it's a great social atmosphere. Wagner housing gives you what you need, is clean and if you have issues they will be addressed. 

Best - Foundation Hall, Harborview Hall

Worst - Towers Residential Halls

Average - Guild Hall"
College Freshman,5,"Greeks are on campus and have fun. They have parties and everyone can come to them. The leaders of the greeks are great people and care about their frats and sororities. There is little to no problems associated with them too, which is great. Members of the frats and sororities can live on their respective groups floors in the towers residential hall. Most of the people on those floors are part of the group and thus are all together."
College Freshman,5,"The schools teams may not be the best in the country, but for such a small school we dont do bad. It's fun to go to football games, but they dont clear out the entire campus. If you want to exercise but aren't an athlete, there are still high class gym facilities for you too. People really come out to support everyone and there are many opportunities. Come to Wagner and you will find out."
College Junior,5,"No one cares about political beliefs, religion or sexual orientation."
College Junior,5,I feel that Wagner plan helps students be a well rounded person.
College Junior,5,The school gives a lot of internship opportunities to students.
College Junior,5,Professors are nice and knowledgeable. I respect them.
College Junior,5,I have never seen the safety issue on campus. I feel safe.
College Junior,5,Campus housing is better than other campuses where I used to stay.
College Junior,5,"School life has been nice so far. Especially, theatre program is so fantastic."
College Junior,5,The facility is clean and nice. Many students use regularly.
College Freshman,5,"The location, staff, and students of the school could not be better, it is a great college."
College Junior,5,They give you A LOT of money to go here!
College Freshman,5,We are a D1 school in most of our sports so athletes do get special privledges but people do go to football and basketball games. A large portion of the students are on a sport and are recruited and only at Wagner because of athletics.
College Junior,5,It is a very diverse school
College Junior,5,The connivence of how close it is to the city. It's literally a fairy ride away from New York City.
College Junior,5,As a theatre Performance major I am fortunate to have the access I do to such high end education and professional help.
College Sophomore,5,NYC is the greatest city
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is different and it's great
College Sophomore,5,"Like I said, it's NYC. You'll figure it out."
Sophomore,4,Being online in the spring term was okay as I was able to switch over from in person to online easily with the help of professors. Professors were able to switch over in the small notice. This term professors have also been able to keep up with online learning and be able to teach and assign assignments to us to complete. I do not have any issues.
Freshman,4,Wagner College has a great community feeling. The small campus is kept up very nicely and the grounds staff are very kind. Faculty of the school are very accommodating and seem to genuinely care for the well-being of their students. They are willing to work with students to meet their needs and fulfill goals.
Sophomore,4,"As a theater performance major, I am very grateful to be able to continue academic classes and also focus on my training in order to create a well-rounded education."
Junior,4,Wagner College is great in certain departments. The theatre department is excellent and has incredible professors. Same goes for the Nursing/PA department. The close proximity to the city is a plus. There are endless internship opportunities. The underclassmen dorms are not good... :(
Sophomore,4,"Wagner is a great community especially if you are a part of theatre or athletics. There are a lot of good resources including the library, tutoring and internship help. The food isn't great which makes it hard to stay healthy but New York City is an invaluable resource for not only food but internships and just general experiences."
Freshman,4,"I am a Theatre Performance Major Feshaman here at Wagner. I food can be great, can also be not so great. The campus is beautiful on the outside and is a little not so beautiful on the inside. Everyone is very nice, I hear the athectics and very good, and the professors are great if you pick the right ones. The party is very much what you make it, if you look for parties you’ll find them."
Junior,4,"I've loved Wagner ever since the first moment that i stepped onto campus. The scenery is gorgeous, and nothing beats sitting on the oval on a sunny day and either doing work or just hanging out with friends. The faculty and students are all amazing, and are going to go on to do amazing things. The school is small, so almost everybody know everybody. You'll never go into a class and not recognize at least one face."
Junior,4,"My experience at Wagner College has been amazing. I have met friends of a lifetime and am getting an unforgettable education. The professors truly care about their students and stay after their office hours to tutor us. This school challenges you to work hard, but it is really worth the tough hours of studying and dedication. The library is beautiful and makes you feel comfortable when you're stressed. The campus is beautiful with incredible architecture and landscaping. The staff is so kind and caring. Wagner College has many clubs and extra-curriculum activities for students to be involved in. All in all, my time has been a great one and I can't thank the Wagner community enough for providing me with an amazing college experience!"
Freshman,4,"I love the location of Wagner College. It’s on Staten Island which is one of the five boroughs of New York City so you’re in the city without having to deal with the overpopulation and noise of the Manhattan but still close enough to enjoy everything New York has to offer. 
The food at Wagner can definitely improve. There are only two dinning options and to many it’s just not enough."
Freshman,4,Highly recommend this school to people interested in theatre or nursing/Physician Assistant. The campus is old and has things about it that can be triggering but I've had a pretty solid experience so far.
Junior,4,"The overall learning environment is great and for the most part there are no problems with classes or professors. The campus is small and beautiful, however the dorms are less than stellar. Additionally, the food has a lot of room for improvement."
Senior,4,"Overall, I am happy with my decision. Most professors are caring and helpful. There are many internships available. Some offices and staff are helpful, such as CACE. Financial aid and student account offices are useless and rude. The registrar office is also incompetent, constantly losing my papers. The meals are pricey for the quality of food. The hawk's nest is a great option. The Starbucks associates, for the most part, are courteous, kind, and almost always get my order 100% correct. I was on campus for part of the summer taking classes and the worker there most often in July was extremely friendly, always getting my crazy orders right. During the regular semesters, it can get a little hectic though when some of the workers at starbucks constantly talk to the students while there are 20 people on line. The managers and supervisors in the business office are rude and do not help much."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I genuinely enjoy attending Wagner College. It is a liberal arts school, so there are a series of required courses to take in order to graduate. This may be overwhelming or unappealing at times, however, many of those extra curricular courses are interesting. The students I share my classes with hold a variety of personalities and the friendships I have made are very enjoyable."
Freshman,4,"I loved my experience at Wagner College so far as a freshman.  My learning community really help my decision to major in chemistry.  I enjoy living on Campus, I find that there is a lot to do even on weekend.  I take advantage of heading into Manhattan and love being so close to the city every day.    I really like my professors and know that I made the right choice on being a Wagner Student!"
Junior,4,I love the experience of being so close to the city. I wish they had better food options and the new suites were a little larger.
Niche User,4,My experience at Wagner was great. I enjoyed everything on campus expect the freshmen dorms they were pretty small and I'm not a fan of co-ed dorms
College Junior,4,The career center wants nothing more than to see all of its students succeed and find internships and work after they graduate.
College Junior,4,"I have only had one bad experience with a professor at Wagner. They are all passionate about their courses, and it inspires me to learn and stay focused in class."
College Junior,4,"Safety on campus is a top priority for campus officials, and campus security is always on guard and patrolling campus."
College Junior,4,"Athletics are a massive part of campus life, especially during the Fall semester. Football is incredibly popular, and the school spirit is out of this world."
College Junior,4,"I'm a commuter student who doesn't spend much time on campus, but when I am there I truly enjoy myself. It is a warm environment with amazing professors and friendly students. Wagner College is my home away from home, as cheesy as it sounds, and I wouldn't see myself at any other school."
College Freshman,4,The social atmosphere is amazing and that is so important for me as a freshman.  It helps me feel comfortable in a new environment.
College Freshman,4,I do not play sports but there is a strong sense of school spirit at Wagner.
College Junior,4,"Wagner College is a safe place for all students.  I have had a great experience and, fortunately, have not encountered any sexual assaults of any kind.  They take pride of their campus and they assure all students that their safety at the college is their priority."
College Junior,4,"There is a wide range of athletics programs at Wagner College.  I know many people who participate in these programs and excel.  I am not currently involved in any sports, as my studies occupy  most of my time.  I would encourage others to inquire on the numerous sports programs that the college has to offer, as they can benefit them in the future."
College Freshman,4,"The curriculum is vigorous and makes sure that you get along in your degree. The workload is heavy, but if you stay on top of your work, you'll do great!"
College Freshman,4,This school is known for having a great medical program.
College Freshman,4,Classes never go above thirty students and usually are small (15-20 students)
College Freshman,4,There are many dorms for campus housing as there are many buildings. Some dorms even have the luxury of having a view of NYC.
College Sophomore,4,The professors are okay. Workload isnt bad. STudey areas are great especially the library.
College Sophomore,4,"Class sizes are typically between 10 and 20 people, though I have had one class that only had four students (hooray for Italian!).  All of the professors I have had so far have been very engaging and passionate about their subject."
College Sophomore,4,"I have many friends in a local sorority on campus, and I plan on trying my hardest this coming semester to join as well.  I have spent quite a bit of time on their floors and hanging out, whether casually or at parties, and have had nothing but wonderful experiences.  Greek housing at Wagner isn't anything special, most just have a designated floor and lounge, with normally-sized rooms.  As far as I can tell, there's no real division between Greeks and non-Greeks in normal campus life."
College Sophomore,4,"Wagner isn't the greatest college in the world.  It really isn't.  But personally, I don't know if I would enjoy going to school anywhere else.  All of my experience with professors have been wonderful, and the small student body makes it easier to have personal connections with others.

I made friends very quickly, in fact, during orientation weekend!  I loved the Learning Community program in place for first semester Freshman, and look forward to my ILC in the coming years.

Perhaps it is because I have such a great love of theatre and the arts, despite being ultimately a history major, but I have found an incredible community here at Wagner, and enjoy frequent trips with my friends into Manhattan to catch a show or just hang out at the park."
College Junior,4,Wagner College offers good machines and weight sections to workout.
College Junior,4,The school has been helpful in assisting me in office hours when I am confused with the topics we are learning. The Wagner College community has welcomed me with open arms and has amazing teachers and staff.
College Freshman,4,My anatomy teacher is excellent. Even though he is sometimes hard to understand he is very active in his lessons and he is brilliant in the topics. My music teacher on the other hand is probably the worst professor that I have ever had. This class is the hardest class even though it is supposed to be an introduction class.
College Freshman,4,"The Greek life at my college is really great. They do nice fundraisers throughout the year. The Greeks take part in every activity on campus. They have their own event called ""Song Fest"" and all the sororities and fraternities take part in it, it is almost like a dance competition. The fraternities and sororities have their own floor housing."
College Freshman,4,"We have amazing opportunities for internships. Being right by NYC, there are many opportunities for great internships."
College Freshman,4,I have had great experiences with my professors so far. I had Dr. Kiss and still have her and she is the best professor ever. She is accommodating to student needs and listens to everyone. She is also very sweet. I enjoy Otto Raths as well. He is one of the funniest professors I've had. I get the help I need in all my classes and feel comfortable. I enjoy the small class sizes as well.
College Freshman,4,I enjoy my classes and have found that my professors largely care about their students and bring excitement and passion to the classroom most days.
College Freshman,4,"The professor are great. They definitely know their area to a great extent, there are a lot of courses available, the size class is perfect."
College Freshman,4,It is good but not amazing
College Freshman,4,"The gym, stadium, etc.; are great. There is a lot of school spirit."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is nice and helpful. The professor are really good and know their areas very well.
College Freshman,4,The health center is great. Nurse Kathy is so sweet and caring. The counseling center is very accessible and helpful.
College Freshman,4,"All of my professors have been great so far. They really try to get to know you, especially in the first year Learning Community experience. First semester of the first year, you have three out of your four or five classes with the same exact people. Two classes are taught by two separate professors, and the third class is team-taught. I definitely benefited from this model of learning. I actually had a class with the president of the college and another amazing professor, which is something you cannot get at a larger school. My smallest class was 8 people, and my larger classes right now are around 25-33. I have had discussion orientated classes and lecture style. Personally I perfer discussions, but the lecture style isn't even in a lecture hall so it's not terribly impersonal."
College Freshman,4,"Most students here want to become famous, rich, and/or make a difference. Wagner definitely has the tools to allow you to do anything and everything. However, it's not like going to a name-brand school. The opportunities will not be handed to you sitting down. The city is at your fingertips at Wagner, so you have to take advantage of what's out there. I have not explored the career center at all, but the Center for Ledership and Civic Engagement is a wonderful resource if you're looking to spend time volunteering or gain experience for a career in public service or education."
College Freshman,4,"Wagner College has one of the most beautiful campuses that I've been to. Hence, there's always a movie set taking place to get our gorgeous building, Main Hall, in their clips. Wagner classrooms and bathrooms are always fairly cleaned. Students feel very safe on campus and are always walking throughout campus without a concern."
College Freshman,4,"Unfortunately, Wagner does not have some type of housing for Greek students. Yet, there are still many students that take part of Greek life and love it."
College Sophomore,4,"Health services are usually quite helpful, but sometimes could be a hassle. Public safety is mostly great. They are such nice people and will do anything needed to keep the campus and every single student on the campus safe. They do what they do because they truly do care for the students on campus."
College Sophomore,4,"I love attending the sporting events at Wagner, but right next to our D1 sports teams, is our theatre department! Two of the equally big campus life events- sports and shows on our main stage and stage one. Sometimes you may even see an athlete take charge on the field, but be a star on that stage. It is awesome how involved the athletes can be besides just being an athlete at Wagner."
College Junior,4,Some people take drugs. But they don't pressure others.
College Senior,4,There are a few things that could be made better but otherwise I love the school !
College Sophomore,4,I love the people and the community atmosphere of my campus. There's something for everyone and it's a very homey environment in a big city. Sometimes I wish there were more students but I can always just leave campus and go into the city whenever I want to feel anonymous.
College Freshman,4,Everyone uses grubhub and gets most of the local places to deliver. Otherwise people walk to the bagel store.
College Freshman,4,"It's not too strict, but things are enforced when they truly need to be."
College Freshman,4,A lot of people get Presidential Scholarships for their grades and that's for like almost half of your tuition. Lots of people have work-study jobs too.
College Freshman,4,I love living on such a small campus where everything and everyone is just a short walk away. It feels very homey and good.
College Junior,4,"Order out, have a car to go to restaurants on the island, or you can go to the city"
College Freshman,4,"Most students on Wagner come to Wagner for a reason. Most students are theater majors, in the physician assistant program or are nursing majors. There are also a lot of arts administration majors who are usually students who tried out for theater and didnt get in. Other students who are different majors usually are on a sport and there arent many students who go to Wagner for any other major."
Junior,2,Tuition is too high for the quality of schooling and campus life. I’d like to see more course opportunities and new professors along with better living and food.
Graduate Student,2,"After college, a student is propelled into the real world and some people may not land on their feet. While attending Wagner, I felt mislead on the career path I wanted to take until one counselor helped me explore ideas and find a suitable career that works for me. There wasn't enough courses for my career path. If Wagner had more classes and programs for the field that there offering, it can benefit not only the students but the interest in the programs as well."
Junior,2,"Wow, it kind of sucks. I already considered transferring out after my freshmen year, but with the way our units work and the kinds of classes we have, it wouldn't have been easy to transfer out without having to take another semester or year at another institution. Administration and financial aid are very hard to work with, I've gotten food poisoning a few times, and we have horrible problems with each and every dorm building, problems that someone could definitely sue over."
College Freshman,2,There are barely any parties at the school. People just go to bars near campus.
College Freshman,2,There are barely any parties at the school or on campus.
College Freshman,2,There are barely any parties at this school. People usually go to nearby bars.
College Freshman,2,There are not many parties on campus or in general.
College Sophomore,2,Towers is a great dorm where the upper clansmen live.
College Sophomore,2,"Internships suck unless you go through Wagner, I had a very negative situation with that. Professors are not active in fields and I can't express how important that is, especially in theatre."
College Sophomore,2,"Really crappy. Professors are not active in fields, which is very frustrating. And they are very cocky, which is weird. Not just one or two professors, pretty much all of them are very cocky. I did really well academically, I thought it was TOO easy. I learned very little, my classes were silly and unnecessary."
College Sophomore,2,"It sucks. 

Your only decent bets are Guild and Foundation.

But in Guild, there's no AC (which is REALLY BAD), a lot of stuff is broken or really shabby/old, and the shower heads are ridiculous (in the MIDDLE of the shower and way too low)

Foundation is advertised as ""apartment-style living"" but doesn't even have a proper kitchen or anything, only like a sink. And the windows don't open!! It's also really not homey or comfortable and has a weird sterile vibe

Don't even get me started on Harborview and Towers oh my god"
College Freshman,2,"Drugs are noticeable on campus. Drinking is very big, but that's also how the majority of college campuses are. You will probably feel a little left out if you do not drink, smoke, or party, especially since the campus is so small."
College Freshman,2,"About 25% of the students on campus are athletes, and a large majority of them would not have chosen this school otherwise. School spirit and fan support is generally high for Football and Men's Basketball, but noticeably lower for other sports. The athletic facilities are usable, but very poor and largely inadequate. As a Division 1 school, Wagner College should have better facilities and services for student-athletes."
College Sophomore,2,Nothing like this happens on wagners campus
College Junior,2,Poor grade for parking violations--dont ticket or boot cars for parking illegally in handicap spots.. Worse for underage drinking (I've taken care of way too many drunk under age students in the emergency room)
College Junior,2,Still looking to get some sort of scholarship.  Only get alumni discount :(
College Junior,2,"If you dont belong to a meal plan food is very pricy in the cafeteria.  Hawksnest is okay if you want prepackaged food or greasy, unhealthy options.  Hawksnest is way overpriced"
College Freshman,2,Majority of students live on campus except some sports do have a house off campus
College Freshman,2,"The food in dining hall is usually bad but there is always cereal that most students end up eating after every meal. Occasionally there is something that is good but usually everyone ends up eating salad, waffles of sandwhiches. Hawks nest always has the same options which is Starbucks which is decent, a sandwhich station which is alright but is closed on the weekends and a grill which is just burgers, chicken fingers and fries which becomes very repetitive. Take out is usually the better option but it gets expensive after awhile."
Recent Alumnus,2,Safety is okay health and wellness suck.
College Junior,2,Science programs are very hard but they pay out in the end
College Junior,2,There is really no place to live off of campus. Everyone stays in a dorm.
College Junior,2,There is nothing around campus to eat besides Dunkin Donuts...
College Sophomore,2,Wagner is dead on the weekends
College Sophomore,2,Eat the hawks nest and invest in a microwave
College Sophomore,2,I still do not know what I want to be when I grow up!
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of majors
College Sophomore,2,"If you do not know what you want to do with your life, do not try to figure it out here!!!"
College Freshman,2,The only place with computers is the library and the wifi here at Wagner is horrible.  Its slow and sometimes doesn't work at all.
College Freshman,2,The only good dorm building is Foundation and you have to be a junior or senior to live there and it is very hard to live there.  The rest of the buildings are old and dirty.
College Freshman,2,You need a fake to go out to bars. The parties here suck and don't happen often but if you know people who go out a lot you will find more parties.
College Freshman,2,You have to drive anywhere worth going.  But the mall is nice and there are good places to eat if you know Staten Island.
College Freshman,2,No one lives off campus by themselves.  The people who commute live with their parents 99% of the time.
College Freshman,2,Tailgating isn't allowed during or after any games.  When there are big events even if you are 21 you aren't allowed to bring alcohol into the building.
College Freshman,2,Academics here are pretty easy honestly like I truly don't try and can get As and Bs it's a sad ecpxucse for college
College Senior,2,I am not a fan of the dining services provided. I avoid eating in the dining halls unless I absolutely have to or want a cup of coffee.
College Freshman,2,Honestly don't understand how this school does scholarships...some of the dumbest people are on a lot of academic money
College Freshman,2,Truthfully none of the off campus food is great. We usually end up ordering pizza which is hard to mess up
College Freshman,2,"If you have to call the front desk for a noise complaint during finals week when that person on your floor is scream singing their opera, they say they'll come and don't.  The Res Ed doesn't do anything about smoking and drinking and warn you about room checks.  "
College Freshman,2,"Almost no one attends the games, and there is a lack of school spirit.  There is a lot more support for the arts.  The closest you get to hearing about sports is from the random football player who sits behind you in class."
College Freshman,2,"You can't walk anywhere to go out to eat and there aren't any student discounts, but there are places that deliver and they are decent... you just tend to get the same places over and over again because they are the ones that aren't overpriced for a pizza."
College Sophomore,2,The campus dining sucks. There are no options and never any healthy options unless you eat a salad for every meal.
College Sophomore,2,There is hardly any parking and people usually have to create their own parking spots. It is very dangerous and there were over 30 break ins last semester. 
College Sophomore,2,The school does not have transportation to any where besides to the ferry and back to the school.
College Sophomore,2,"The library has computers and printing, but it is all pretty basic honestly. "
College Senior,2,"Staten Island is a burrough of New York City.There several other colleges available to visit. For animal lovers , there is the local zoo. Shoppers will enjoy a huge well stocked mall. The Grymes Hill/Howard Avenue neighborhood is the best place to socialize."
Recent Alumnus,2,Most students remain on campus for all 4 years. A new building was built for upperclassman which is nice. But it's difficult to find anywhere around campus or within walking distance.
College Sophomore,2,"don't see much drug use. very big drinking school. when caught, policy enforcement is fierce"
College Freshman,2,"The dorms at Wagner are old, small and disgusting. For such a nice school the dorms need work. Foundation is the new dorm but it is too new looking for an old school."
College Sophomore,2,"Harborview Hell – Every Freshman goes through the doors of Harborview for their first year, It's by far the worst dorm on campus. Needs a good deal of renovation. The room sizes aren't that bad especial if you get creative with the furniture arrangement. Nothing is sound-proof. There's about an inch gap at the bottom of your door so everything that goes on in the hall you'll be able to hearing very clearly. The bathroom are also pretty miserable; 20 people to three showers. For an expensive school you'd expect better. Once you get out you can look forward to Guild and then Foundation. If you want a party dorm though, don't look any further than Towers."
College Sophomore,2,Be Ready to Just Sit There – The library's wi-fi is terrible. If you plan on going there to just write an essay or read a book then it's a perfect quiet space for you. But if you actually want to use the internet and do some research then you'll be sitting there for a good 15 minutes waiting for google to load. There are computers in the front that you can use but they're Windows so a lot of what you do can't transfer to your personal computer if you own a mac. Also most of the computers are already being used so you have to wait around until one's free. Very frustrating.
College Senior,2,"Don't Judge a Book by It's Cover – Wagner College, academics wise is non-challenging. I am a double major and my only difficulties is completing all of the different classes that I am not allowed to work with an academic advisor to organize a way to graduate on time. The school has a different style of weighting classes then ANY OTHER SCHOOL-- forcing you to stay at the school or lose all those classes. Over all no challenge and there is no way to be challenge yourself without losing all the money that has been put into the school."
College Sophomore,2,"Zero Diversity – Wagner is known for it's theatre program, so about 70% of the students are girls. About 70% of the remaining male population is gay, so girls; don't come here if you're looking for a boyfriend. As for the girls, there is a lot of them and some are pretty, some aren't, just like any school. The greek life is ridiculous at Wagner and the best way to date someone is to join a sorority or frat, because they have mixers all the time and are very involved with each other."
College Freshman,2,"Food Is Not Great – Unfortunately, the food is not great at Wagner.  It is a challenge to find healthy options that are worth eating.  They recently changed food service (mid year) and the food has not gotten any better.  I am not overly picky, but struggle to find multiple options.  I seem to eat the same foods over and over again."
College Freshman,2,"Great, If You're Gay – The guys here are pretty much all gay, and if they're not they're a jock. The girls are very ""Jersey Shore"". The people here are more interested in hooking up than anything else and the only people with relationships tend to be those that have them outside of school."
College Sophomore,2,"Everything Revolves Around Them – Everything revolves around them, and they get away with everything. They are mean."
College Freshman,2,"Wagner College does have its parties on campus-what college doesn't? But seeing that Wagner does not have frat houses, it is very hard to find a house party to go to. Also, the clubs and bars on Staten Island are very accessible if you can pay for the cab, cover charge, and then drinks themselves. It is possible to drink here, it is just a little more difficult than a larger school."
College Freshman,2,"Wagner may be D-I, but it is definitely not the best in the division. But, even though Wagner may lack in some of the athletics points, they make up for it with the work ethic put into each sport. I have never seen so many athletes try so hard every day doing two-a-days at god-awful hours."
College Freshman,2,"Alcohol enforcement is good. However, there are a large amount of people who smoke on campus. I do not smoke and personally don't want to be around smoking areas. There should be designated areas to smoke and have the rest of the campus be smoke-free so the non-smokers don't have to suffer with smoky smells and second-hand smoke effects."
College Freshman,2,"The facilities are very old-fashioned, and especially the theatre needs a lot of improvements. It is outdated and rundown. The dorms could also use major improvements in modernizing."
Sophomore,1,"Wagner has a good location and that’s about it. Don’t go if you’re not going for a theatre, sports, PA, or nursing degree. Financial aid will take advantage of you and you’ll get screwed with loans. (unless ur tuition is covered) made life long friends with only three semesters there but then again you can make those at any school. BTW college is a scam yo y’all should focus on what happens after college. They want us slaving but we ain’t in the Industrial Age no more."
College Sophomore,1,"Hated, hated, hated housing at Wagner. Sure you could say you're gonna live off campus eventually, but the apartments off campus are way more expensive and the commute is not worth it for what you get at Wagner.

The only good thing was the RAs. They were okay and helpful in most situations. I got lucky and my roommate moved out a few weeks in, so I had the whole dorm room to myself for a semester. And my RA was nice enough, he wasn't very bright but he kept everyone in check. I was lucky my floor was quiet, but you could hear everything through the walls. Whole conversations. Singing. Lots of singing.

They never check IDs in the lobby. Ever. I would put this in the safety section, but sometimes we had middle-aged people slip advertisements under our doors. It was really scary, I have no idea how they got into the building. Some of them approached my friends. Not okay."
College Sophomore,1,"I hated Wagner. I was lucky I got to transfer out of there when I got the chance, only wasted one semester's worth of money. I learned absolutely nothing but will also get absolutely no credit from the one semester. They force you to take ridiculous classes your first semester that have nothing or very little to do with your intended major. And these ridiculous classes are so weird that no school will ever accept credit from them. Wagner also uses a unit system instead of credits for courses. That's why the retention rate is so high. Not because it's a great school, but because you can't transfer out. All Wagner cares about is money. The school is incredibly expensive, and even if you have a scholarship every kid here is spoiled and rude. Don't get me wrong, I made a ton of friends in one semester, but they were the outliers. I think I am spoiled sometimes, but these students expected everything to be handed to them on a silver platter. 

Besides the money, the credits, and the horrible people, my biggest complaint is with the professors. Once I got there, I researched the background of the professors in my major's department. Despite Wagner's advertising that they are all still very active in the field I want to study, this is not really the case. The only things they did were teach at Wagner and a few other schools in the area. That's not as ""active"" as I would like, it is really important to have that leg up and Wagner could not promise me that.

A total waste of time and a LOT of money. Do not go here."
College Sophomore,1,"Please, for your own good, don't come here. Save yourself. I can't even express how disgustingly unhappy I am here. I wish I could transfer, but I'm stuck at this point. Wagner's crap about transferring credits and helping you at all, anyway. 

Maybe you'll like it if you're a theater kid or involved with any of their other specialized programs- sports, PA, nursing, arts admin. But if you're not (even if your department is pretty good like mine!) you'll most likely hate it lol"
College Freshman,1,"Besides Foundation Hall, the dorms are outdated, cramped, not aesthetically pleasing, and heavily over-priced. Harborview Hall does not have lighting, while Towers is dimly lit and does not have A/C. Wagner College likely has some of the worst housing and lack of options in the country."
College Sophomore,1,"Towers is terrible. No AC, broken heat, cockroaches, no elevator"
Recent Alumnus,1,The worst thing I have ever experienced was the lies on tours and the hard reality of being here
Recent Alumnus,1,Sucks so bad I want to leave but I'm sticking it out
Recent Alumnus,1,Drinking alone in a room that's what wagner calls a party whooooo
Recent Alumnus,1,"Work load is so light I'm board, teachers suck students suck english is my passion and it get abused here"
Recent Alumnus,1,My review is honest the school blows. Everything sucks execpt for a few bearable moments that kept me here but I suffered enough and I'm glad to leave and never return I hate this school.
Recent Alumnus,1,If you're anything but a nursing or PA major you will not get a job it's so obvious. The school covers up how there are no jobs in the arts by employing you on campus to work/intern its retarded the alumni at this school never return for sheer embarrassment there is no wagner pride.
Recent Alumnus,1,Let's just say if you plan on eating anything at all plan on diarrhea.
Recent Alumnus,1,"They don't care if you do drugs or burn the school down, but if you leave a paper towel on the bathroom floor expect a fine. They over hype every little thing. And they can't drive their golf carts. They average two accidents a semester they took out a brick wall just yesterday"
Recent Alumnus,1,The school is terrible you learn nothing professors are idiots.
College Sophomore,1,There are no places besides the bagel store.
College Junior,1,They are very cheap with aid
College Junior,1,Only 1 place to eat and the food is gross
College Junior,1,They only care if administration is happy not the students
College Sophomore,1,I hate going to this school! I want to leave everyday that I am here!
College Sophomore,1,Please don't go to this school.
College Sophomore,1,Sucks on-campus! Might as well go kill yourself...
College Sophomore,1,"By far, the worst in the country! If your of a minority do not expect to be unified or have support. Your on your own, either sink or swim!

No one is open to new things at this school. Almost everyone lives in a little box, fairy tale world, and is stubborn to make a difference or be of change!"
College Sophomore,1,"Lack of Diversity!!! Ignorant people, If you want to have a lot of sex and one-night stands, do not come here!!!"
College Freshman,1,Cars are a must unless you need to get to the ferry then the shuttle is awesome. But going to the grocery store or to the mall you need a car.
College Freshman,1,Do sports.  Thats the only way you will get a good amount of financial aid.
College Freshman,1,Honestly most buildings are rundown and the school is too cheap to renovate them. Harbor view is disgusting and that's where freshman live...
College Freshman,1,Its honestly terrible. I love going out and having a good time but apparently that's not something that happens at this school its so annoying. If you wanna have a little fun you have to go to the city which is a long trip
College Freshman,1,This school is terrible when it comes to greek life! I honestly forget there are frats and sororities on campus. I would never join one at wagner
College Freshman,1,"DON'T BE FOOLED BY THE ""NEARBY CITY"" it takes a good 30-45 min to get to the lowest point in Manhattan, and another 30-45 to get to midtown manhattan.  There is NOTHING to do off of the campus on Staten Island.  You walk off of campus and you have to walk five minutes just to get to a bagel shop.  No college town, no close restaurants, no nearby activities, no campus life.  Find good friends and enjoy Netflix and take the long journey into the city when you can."
College Freshman,1,"Small rooms with barely enough space for two people to stand next to each other (in between the beds) in the housing for first year students.  The bathrooms are disgusting and all yellow colored with cracked tiles and old appliances.  Don't be surprised if you see bugs, or if something doesn't appear to be cleaned / never fixed.

Oh, and enjoy it because Wagner requires you to live on campus for all four years, unless you get permission to move off of campus (which is not what they want because of the small class size)."
College Freshman,1,"The tech team is weak, and the wifi fails ALL of the time...even with an ethernet chord.  If you do get internet, good luck because it is slow.  The classrooms have white boards, and some only have chalk boards.  Some rooms have projectors (some not even from the ceiling), and there are no smart boards."
College Freshman,1,I met a few (3) people who were born in different countries... Other than that mostly people from NY and NJ.
College Sophomore,1,"There is a free shuttle to the Staten Island Ferry to get you into NY, but it is the only open form of transportation. Basically, the situation is awful."
College Senior,1,Students seeking nightlife activities usually leave campus and head to Brooklyn or Manhattan.
College Freshman,1,They don't really care except for Homecoming Weekend. Kind of. They still don't really care that much.
College Freshman,1,"No Second Time Around – My time at Wagner has been, for the most part, terrible. The school is terribly cliquey, if you aren't in the theater program, greek life, the physician assistant program, or sports you don't really have a place. The students are very closed off, and the whole atmosphere of the place is very cold. I plan to transfer, as do many students who go to Wagner and realize the same thing. It is rumor that by junior year, 40 percent of the grade will have transferred. I believe it, and if given the chance I would have picked any other school."
College Freshman,1,"Economic Background – If you don't have money, you aren't cool. money controls a lot at wagner!"
College Senior,1,"Don't Judge a Book by It's Cover – Wagner College, is sold as this perfect school that is an easy in and out of the city, yet still offers the close-knit small campus feel. Well yes, you can get into the city but to get to mid-town it will take you an hour and a half-- which if you are looking for a job in the city really eats up the time you could be working. It claims it is the second best theater school in the country- please read the fine print (that's if you don't include Ivy League schools, public school or just about anything else.) They claim to have majors they don't. The price of the school is of the upper tier school- go there instead. Oh, and you can't transfer out if you don't want to lose all that money you put in- because they have a 1 credit system for courses instead of the traditional 3-4 credit classes. I'm glad that in my field your undergrad is unimportant, but if I had the opportunity to go back in time I would have gone to an upper-tier school instead."
College Senior,1,"The majority of the black and hispanic students are student athletes. It's ridiculous to go to the games and see an all black football/basketball team and an all white cheerleading squad and dance team. It speaks volumes to the way Wagner recruits students.

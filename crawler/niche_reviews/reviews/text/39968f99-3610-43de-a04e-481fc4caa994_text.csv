Alum,5,"I graduated ESU in the late 90s. I loved everything about it. I learned a lot about life and being independent as an adult. The balance between academics and athletics combined with an available social life, meets an appropriate level. Looking back, I made a great choice. I am now a VP at large organization and I owe a lot to my time at ESU."
Sophomore,5,"I believe East Stroudsburg University is a great school. It opened a new world of diversity to me. Compared to my hometown ESU is like a culture shock. My hometown is predominantly white people and there is little of anyone different. There are so many opportunities to meet people, join clubs, and make friends."
Junior,5,They keep it very through and well kept. Nothing gets confusing at all. And if so it’s easy to contact professors.
Junior,5,I took an online class it was great very informational it was a good choice i would recommend it for sure
Junior,5,"East Stroudsburg University is a great place to go, beautiful campus, lots of people and food, its great"
Sophomore,5,"During the spring semester, we had online learning and my professors were very communicative during this period of time. Being aware of assignments and their deadlines weren't too much of a struggle since we were notified ahead of time."
Sophomore,5,"Plenty of great resources, the environment is beautiful so many things to do with friends and family"
Sophomore,5,"Some of my classes were online.. in my opinion I feel like online is hard because sometimes professors don’t really do their job as their supposed to, for example I had an assignment that was completed and turned it, and my professors put a zero at the end of the semester, I emailed the professors and ofc they took a long time to get back. So eventually I had to talk to the dean because this happened more than once. Many professors just put in zeros more than they grade assignments and I feel some professors need to take the time do do certain things because we as students pay for school and take our classes seriously"
Niche User,5,They were very friendly and welcoming. All the professors are very nice and willing to help out with anything.
Freshman,5,"Moment I arrived on campus already felt comfortable and safe, just like home. All of my professors on an education standpoint were all willing to work with students depending on their situations."
Sophomore,5,"East Stroudsburg University is located near the Poconos. East Stroudsburg University has caring and great professors. East Stroudsburg is very diverse and everyone gets along. The food menu could be better but, the food is okay. Definitely would recommend ESU for someone looking for a future college."
Freshman,5,"ESU is a diverse school, one big family. I don't think I could've picked a better school, I genuinely love it here at ESU. Everyone is super welcoming and nice.  ESU offers so much for the student life. Professors only want success for you, they're not out to get you. Sports teams are very good."
Freshman,5,Great Open House.  You need to go to experience it.  Feels like Home. We were also impressed with the students that took us on the tour.
Freshman,5,"Everyone is super friendly, I made tons of new friends, the atmosphere here is incredible, and the academics offered are amazing."
Alum,5,The only thing I would change about ESU would be its security for off campus housing that it still considered campus housing.
Freshman,5,"I’ve only been here for a short amount of time, but I already feel at home. There are so many reasons to love it here. It’s not too far from my home. Every professor I have come in contact with has been super nice and helpful. The classes are really beneficial to me, and to others with different majors. I love the activities that take place on and off campus. It’s such a welcoming school and you’ll always feel like you belong here."
Senior,5,"ESU is a great school and offers a lot to their students. This is my fourth year and I love that atmosphere and campus life, but I would like to see their food options improve more and also have more of a diverse faculty and administration."
Freshman,5,I like the environment of the campus. The atmosphere is very welcoming as well as both students and staff.
Sophomore,5,"I would like to see an improvement on the traditional buildings for undergraduate students. Although they’ve been there for years, it’s difficult to live in, especially during the fall and spring if you don’t have a fan or A/C. Along with that, there are some occasions where students are placed in dorms with 3 people, which creates an issue in regards to privacy and space. The lack of proper space for each student causes amounts of frustration, and that’s not the goal to make student-living amazing at ESU."
Alum,5,"I loved attending East Stroudsburg University. There was always something to do, the location is close to many mountains, and the professors are super helpful."
Senior,5,East Stroudsbourg is a very well maintained school and i am very excited to be apart of it this coming fall.
Sophomore,5,Very friendly campus. My experience at ESU has been a very positive one. I am looking forward to next semester.
Freshman,5,"Going into college, I wasn't sure what to expect, especially because I would be moving away from home and wouldn't be in a familiar area or have any of the friends that I have created close relationships with for years. But, I must say coming here was one of the best experiences of my life. I decided to become and Athletic Training major and all of the professors are super professional and know exactly what they're talking about and are able to explain it in a simplistic way so that everyone knows what they're talking about. My classmates are all also very nice and friendly, which is something that you don't always expect when starting a new school."
Freshman,5,East Stroudsburg may be a small school but I love it. The students here are nice and welcoming. I have a job on campus and participate in student clubs. My major is athletic training and the program and professors are excellent. East Stroudsburg is a great school and have had a good experience so far.
Freshman,5,"Amazing staff, programs, and campus. A+ school that is extremely affordable. Staff is extremely friendly and helpful with any student needs. Students are happy to be here and are able to take part in any club or program they want. With so many programs offered it is hard to find something that won't spark your interest!"
Freshman,5,My experience so far has been amazing. I’ll be getting my bachelors in business management. I feel so at home here I made the right choice for my 4 years
Freshman,5,"I originally did not want to go to ESU when I first visited. However, the second I moved in I instantly felt at home. ESU is a very fun school and I've met so many great friends. The only thing I think that needs to be fixed is the food vendor and the fact that the dining hall closes at 6 pm on the weekends. My friends and I have had many experiences where we're starving because 6 pm is usually when we eat dinner, and the other food place doesn't open until 8 pm. Overall though, I love this school and am glad I made the decision to go here."
Freshman,5,I love it at East Stroudsburg University! The newer suite style dorms are great. The location in the Poconos is ideal for me. Class sizes are not overwhelming. The professors are available and willing to help. It's my home away from home.
Sophomore,5,"My sophmore year is my first time dorming and I must say that i am really enjoying my time on campus. The darms are not loud and annying. I have my study time and alone time. All the dorms are central and close to all other builllding on campus. The professors in the STEM department are willing to answer your questions and they are very helpful with subjects other than just class work. Overall, my time at ESU has been amazing so far."
Senior,5,Everything is wonderful! I would reccomend this school to anyone! I am a very proud warrior! I met such wonderful people here including the professors! They are all extremely accommodating and willing to go out of their way to help their students. It has an upbeat and outgoing exteriority and appearance and has the same feeling from the inside. THERE IS NOT ONE BAD THING to say about this university!
Sophomore,5,"It's a very open and friendly place to be. It's in the center of town, so there's things to do nearby, and everyone is very helpful. Staff are willing to go out of there way to assist, and even the departments such as Financial or Billing will do everything that they can to help and make attending ESU easy and comfortable."
Sophomore,5,I feel as if East Stroudsburg is my second home. I am a full time student who lives on campus. I absolutely love all of the opportunities available to you. It is a very diverse college. You have many choices of what classes that you would like to take. The professors really want everyone to succeed and do all that they can to help you understand the material. There are many clubs and activities on campus so you will never be bored. The local area of East Stroudsburg is a very cute townt that has a lot of good food choices. I can not wait to continue my education and get my degree from East Stroudsburg University.
Senior,5,"As I've had the opportunity as a non-traditional student to be associated with professors that takes the time the energy to teach a class to explain themselves and to be available when needed by student I've also gain more knowledge and all different way of thinking in the field of Social Work I've learned the availability of what's needed in a community, society where homelessness and hunger is at all-time high, as well as mental illness. I am given the skills to apply to those who are in need of assistance and availability of resources to them, leadership skills is a great asset in their teaching, facilitating groups as well as family sessions is a must-have for any social worker."
Junior,5,"I love how its a small school, it makes me feel at home. I always feel welcomed wherever I go. I joined Tri Sigma and it was the best decision I've made since I started ESU"
Junior,5,"East Stroudsburg University is just right for me. It carries what I want to major in, there are a ton of activities to attend to, and my professors were excellent. They were also a lot of help when I had trouble with my tuition; they answered any questions I had and were extremely patient."
Freshman,5,"During my visit to East Stroudsburg University, I was amazed at the variety of activities and organizations. There was a sense of community throughout the campus. The atmosphere was that of productivity and focus. Professors are very passionate about their topics of discussion. I instantly fell in love with ESU."

With several friendly professors willing to help you, it is very motivating and evident that you are being led down the right path to a future filled with success. There are wonderful academic programs, a helpful tutoring and mentor program, community service and volunteer opportunities, many work study positions available, and many more resources on this campus."

To go to this school, one needs to have an open mind and be accepting of people from all backgrounds."
Graduate Student,5,"East Stroudsburg University of PA is one of 14 state-owned universities in PA. It is located in the Pocono region of PA and is situated in a populated area. It has a quaint college town atmosphere and very diverse campus. The teaching faculty at ESU are top-notch. ESU is known as a teaching institution, therefore instruction is of primary importance. There is a wide range of activities available for anyone to engage in. Housing in and around campus is a mixture of very old Victorian and newer styles."

Freshman,5,"Being on the cross country team here, I noticed the athletics here are really outstanding.  The coaches care so much about not only your athletics, but your academics as well.  The professors are also very personable and always available.  So far, I am loving my first semester here."
Senior,5,"Honestly, even though I don't know many people on campus who are not a theatre major, as a graduating senior, I have to say I've enjoyed my time at ESU. They have lots of activities to get people involved and to meet new people. In the theater department especially, the campus loves the work that we do and they do support it by coming to see our shows. ESU is pretty close knit and after you've adjusted to the campus life and are no longer feeling homesick, it really is a nice humble college."
Senior,5,I love East Stroudsburg University! The Art and Design program has given me a lot of great opportunities! The teachers really show that they care and will always help you. Our Art program with 3D printing has made our program grow and I have learned so much about 3D Printing.
Junior,5,"I transferred from another college to ESU and I can't even fathom the difference. Not only are the students so much more willing to grow, learn, and care for other people but the faculty all takes those extra crucial moments to connect with their students on a personal and academic level. I feel no only safe at ESU, but I feel as though I'm in an environment where my beliefs and skills are fostered and tuned so that I can feel confident when I graduate and enter my field."
Freshman,5,East Stroudsberg University has demonstrated that they have a very diverse and beneficial campus that nearly anyone can thrive on.
Freshman,5,"I love attending East Stroudsburg University because the professors work with the students, the campus is very diverse, and there are tons of activities around campus that allow all students to participate in.

Freshman,5,"My experience at ESU was great for the first semester. I had the chance to meet people from all over the world. Also had the chance to experience life on campus and away from home, this makes you become more of an adult. Things I like on campus are the way how everyone is polite to each other, there are barely any conflicts. Also I like how there is an average cafeteria, that serves okay food. Lastly I like how the professors will try to work with you and not just leave you hanging but you have to show effort."
Freshman,5,"Overall, I really like ESU. It is simple to navigate through due to the size of campus not being too large."
Sophomore,5,I love the campus and the environment! All the staff and faculty are always so nice and helpful! During fall the campus is absolutely breathtaking making me excited to go during the week.
Freshman,5,I loved it at East Stroudsburg University. The people giving the tours were so nice and polite. I can not wait to start my my freshman year of college in fall 2016. 
Niche User,5,"      East Stroudsburg University is a good school. I went there the summer of 2016 for a program for 2020 high school graduates. We stayed in the dorms for a few days and went to classes 8:30 am to 6:00 pm. The professors I know are within the theater program and are so nice. Their classes are so wonderful, hands on and you can actually talk to the professors. Diversity is definitely there. The food is great. One tip is to bring in snacks and Air conditioning.   "
College Senior,5,The school has a wonderful football field.
College Freshman,5,"My overall experience at East Stroudsburg University has been breathtaking. My courses were challenging, however, I received a bountiful amount of help.

College Freshman,5,"During my experience at East Stroudsburg University, I was fortunate enough to live in a suite. This was an amazing experience, though it is expensive, it is worth it. Since I was chosen to be apart of the Early Start Pogram I did not have to pay full price. The rooms and halls were very clean and spacious. Also, the suites allow you to have your own privacy, however, you are still social with you roommate(s)."
College Freshman,5,"My overall experience at East Stroudsburg University has been spectacular! Having the ability to connect with my professors and obtaining a better understanding has been ideal.  Also, receiving an advanced experience through the Early Start Program has given me an advantage overall especially, being the first in my family to go to college.

Junior,4,It has been a good experience. It is a very diverse community. Lots of clubs and activities to get involved in. All of my professors have been very helpful.
Sophomore,4,At ESU you can receive a credible degree with a good knowledge base behind it for a reasonable tuition price. Since the university is smaller in size it lets students get more attention from faculty and professors which is always great.
Sophomore,4,When forced to change to an online learning structure many of my professors adapted very well. Communication stayed consistent and they were always available to answer questions.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy East Stroudsburg University. I am a commuter student, and transferred to ESU a year ago, so I haven't gotten the chance to really familiarize myself with the whole campus. However, I do enjoy being on campus, and this past semester I found some more excuses TO be on campus."
Sophomore,4,"My professors are all very helpful. Living on campus offers a variety of resources. The staff know how to help their students for the most part. ESU also offers a variety of opportunities including on campus jobs, overseas educational programs etc."
Junior,4,Great experience.  Student atmosphere is fun. I am apart of 90.3 WESS radio station and have made many friends and memories. ESU gives me as a communication major most of the tools to succeed.
Senior,4,I loved my full 4 years here wouldn't take it back. I am so thankful for coming here and being accepted into the field that i ended up pursuing. ESU welcomed me with open arms and helped me succeed in many ways i could not imagine.
Freshman,4,This school is actually really really nice it’s always clean on campus and the staff are really invonlved with the students. The only thing I would like to see change is the weather it’s just really cold winters. But the campus is a decent size. Never had any problems
Freshman,4,"I like the diversity of the school. I am able to interact with people from many different cultures. The teachers are friendly, however the financial aid is horrible at helping."
Sophomore,4,It was a good learning environment with plenty of on campus activities and events. Not many different food options however.
Senior,4,"This is a great school that is affordable. Good to both live on campus or commuting. People complain about parking a lot but they are just lazy, its really not bad. Plenty of things to do outside of campus and bars are very close."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at East Stroudsburg University! So far, the school is great as far as academics. The environment is very welcoming, and most of the faculty are very helpful. I honestly am starting my college career off with a very positive experience here at East Stroudsburg University. The university is very diverse and offers a lot of great opportunities!"

Freshman,4,East Stroudsburg University of Pennsylvania is a great university. It has great professors and buildings. The campus is very diverse. The students are excellent. Some issues are that activities aren't vocalized well and that there's barely around campus.
Sophomore,4,"I am very thankful for ESU in the fact that I learned to become comfortable with myself as a person. I was able to express myself and join many clubs for my interest and my degree. I've had amazing professor's that were willing to help whenever I needed. The only minor change that I wish I could make is the amount of activities there are to do locally; without a car it's hard to really ""get off campus"" since everything is kind of far."
Freshman,4,This school is so beautiful. When you go there it feels like home. Nothing felt more comfortable than this area.
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Esu that it’s not to far from where I’m from and it helps me learn how to do things on my own. Something that choirs change is the communication that the school has with its students, I also believe that it can be a little bit more diverse when it comes down to some of the other activities that the school has, I also think that the school can also help people learn how to be more active in the some and some of that activities that they have"
Senior,4,I love Esu’s Education program. The professors are super helpful and nice. Everyone there is very helpful and look to help you succeed. The only issues I have had are with the financial aid department.

Niche User,4,Went for an open house visit. Very welcoming. Very willing to answer questions. Good correspondence. Many amenities close to campus. Many opportunities for involvement.
Freshman,4,Campus traditional housing needs to be updated. Dansbury commons food needs to be improved. The education portion of the school is great.
Sophomore,4,"I wish the school would offer more scholarships than what they do now. The food is the same all the time, but that is most colleges. The campus is nice and small easy to find your classes. I enjoy the biology department professor wise all are helpful and you can tell they enjoy what they are doing."
Senior,4,My experience at East Stroudsburg has been an exciting roller coaster. When I came to ESU i instantly felt at home. The welcome that every warrior get when they step foot onto this campus is life changing. I know I made the right decision to attend ESU. The community of East Stroudsburg is valued by the college and the College values the community. As a senior I am proud to say I came to East Stroudsburg University
Sophomore,4,I really like the process of housing and the dorms themselves. The options that we have access to really make for a pleasurable experience.
Freshman,4,"As a transfer student that went into a city school it was such a relief to find a school that had such warm and welcoming atmosphere that brought you in. Community is everything, and just looking around it really was a home away from home."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the environment and the people here. There are a lot of great people I have met and I look forward to going back next semester.
Sophomore,4,"East Stroudsburg University is a very welcoming school. I enjoy it because it’s very diverse. The teachers that I have had so far have been all helpful and useful in ways I, a Early Childhood Education can learn from!"
Junior,4,"Academics and Student Life definitely thrives here at ESU. The sizable campus is big enough that you can always meet someone new, yet small enough that you always see a familiar face walking to class. Classes and professors that I have taken/had in the past two years have been wonderful. The courses are great, and all of the professors work with their students and are very helpful. One thing I wish that would be different about campus would be food and parking. There should be better/healthier as well as a bigger variety of food choices in all of the places around campus where food in accessible. As for parking, I wish that ""Resident Parking"" was not so far away from everything, especially dorms. Walking home at night to your dorm you should feel safe and not worried about your 10 minute walk back to your bed."
Freshman,4,"Very nice environment. I love how diverse it is here. Some professors care deeply about their students, while most do not. The food is ok, would not say the worst, but definitely not the best. Traditional dorms are nice for being cheap."
Senior,4,East Stroudsburg is a very good school for the affordable tuition costs. They have excellent professors and a great campus.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is very diverse and has a lot to offer to the students. I am a commuter student and I still found ways to be involved such as a joining the Stroud Courier, the student newspaper, and Public Relations Student Association. Communications professors were awesome."
Sophomore,4,"Diverse campus and community. You see the money you spend coming back to you in a multitude of different improvements on campus. TONS of clubs and organizations as well as Greek Life. Lots of housing options, and very friendly faculty and staff. Student faculty in admissions are some of the best I've experienced in my college search."
Freshman,4,"The school is diversity in culture that and the professors are easy to get hold of. The dorm room are old and in need of some major repair and update.
The academics is terrific and there are a lot of resource for help if you need it."
Alum,4,"Good overall experience. Had a really good social and night life scene, and classes were easy. The biology department needs new professors, most of them do not care about students doing well."
Sophomore,4,"Education/ Professors; I feel the professors at ESU have a large knowledge of the subject they teach and that they truly want the students to succeed.
Campus; The ESU campus is well maintained and has a lot of amenities for their students. However, parking could be better."
Freshman,4,"The Clubs that are available, mentors that help freshman with any questions, RA's in the halls are always welcoming and free for any questions that need to be answered"
Freshman,4,I like East Stroudsburg University. When I talked to the admissions counselor even doing my own research I fell in love with the university. I feel like it’s meant for me to go there like this college is meant for me.

Senior,4,My professors are my favorite part here in the school. They are all very involved with my studies and help me out every time I have an issue or have a question.
Freshman,4,Campus is a nice size; not too many lecture classes. Computer Science Department at least seems very accessible. Strong program.
Junior,4,"My experience with this school has been satisfactory. In the beginning, I was unable to keep up. However, as time went on and began to use the facilities more, I was able to catch up. The professors never gave up on me and continued to help me get on the right track. This school also supplies enough entertainment to allow for students to never be bored."
Senior,4,ESU is a great school. It's a place where you can make a lot of new people and get a great education. ESU also provides a good safe environment for everyone.
Freshman,4,The campus is pretty big despite the way it looks ESU has a lot to offer to incoming freshmen or kids that are transferring.
Graduate Student,4,"I graduated from ESU with a B.S. in public health.  There are some really great professors,  but some were less than qualified, in my opinion. I transferred in junior year and had a hard time finding a niche, but you meet the mosf people by getting involved in clubs and organizations. I enjoyed my time here."
Freshman,4,"I'm an incoming freshmen to ESU but already I can tell that the next four years are going to be good. ESU has got a quality campus with a wide range of groups and activities, academically ESU is a fine school with good connections for future internships."
Sophomore,4,"The professors at East Stroudsburg are very helpful. It is very obvious that they want their students to succeed. Also, the campus is very nice."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the academics is probably the best thing they have going for them. There is nothing all too special about anything else. The local area is boring unless you have a car to actually go anywhere."
Sophomore,4,East Stroudsburg University is a great school with wonderful teachers that motivate you to do better. The atmosphere is great and you can always find a friend.
Freshman,4,"At first I felt scared when I came here because I was the only person from my highschool to choose this school, however I met friendly people instantly and even ones in my major , I can honestly say I feel supported and challenged by my peers and my professors and president they're always improving things and it feels like home"
Sophomore,4,"East Stroudsburg University in known to be the most diverse of the fourteen PASSHE schools. Initially, this is what attracted me to this university. When I was researching colleges, I felt that was a very important aspect for the college of my choice to have. Besides the high level of diversity at this school, I really appreciate the several professors that I have been able to meet, and get to know on a more personal level. The professors at ESU truly care about their students succeeding and push them to go as far as possible. Overall, it's is important to get involved with the numerous clubs and organizations on campus to truly make your college experience all it can be."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a student and an athlete at Eastbound Stroudsburg University. I play tennis during my season and work out when it's off season. So far, what I enjoyed the most from ESU is how diverse it is. Although I've only been here for a short amount of time, I've grown and always looking for ways to improve my life. I'm currently juggling my life in school and out of my classes. I've met so many people, to the point I just forget some names. They are so open minded and accepting. This is definitely the school you or live one would like to be!"
Junior,4,"East Stroudsburg University was actually on my back-up school list when I started applying to colleges. When I visited campus for the first time, I knew this was the college I was going to be deciding on. The size of campus is perfect for a student who has always been in a small high school. Campus is very much together; you could walk to all of your classes. There's a shuttle bus that runs every 15-20 minutes that will take you around campus when you're feeling lazy or the weather is bad. The faculty members I've experienced the past 3 years I've been there have been AMAZING. I've met the most knowledgeable individuals at the Psychology Department. They are my favorite and most loved department at ESU! The dorms and housing are constantly improving which makes it hard to pick a hall to live in. The only thing I would like to see improve at ESU is the food vendor."
Freshman,4,I enjoyed my first semester at East Stroudsburg University.  I think all of my classes were taught well and went successfully.  The only thing I would change is the food situation.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a somphomore at ESU. As a freshman, i recommend tradtional dorming. They aren't lavavish but it's a great way to meet new people and make friends. Go to all the events they have every year you are there. Professors are very helpful. Food could be better but friendly staff."
Freshman,4,"East Stroudsburg University has a wide selection of majors you can choose from, helpful professors and staff, and a fairly decent mental and physical health center on campus. The dorms are fairly nice and most students are friendly and willing to help you out."
Alum,2,Poor financial aid packages for out of state students.  Retention is poor.  It is a big party school so that is a plus if you do not mind that scene.  Athletic facilities are average at best.
Freshman,2,School really doesn't seem to car about students. The reason why i feel this way is because they make all these mistakes with your things and don't even make an attempt to fix it or even tell you know it is a problem.
College Junior,2,There isn't a lot of diversity on campus. There are very few minority groups.
College Junior,2,Many students smell like marijuana when going from class to class. Students always smoke in the dorms and drink alcohol too.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There's a lot of underage drinking here. It's not hard to go to a party as a freshman and find a drink. As for the house parties, they're very lackluster. No dancing, bad music, and boring. Just a bunch of drunk kids standing in a crowd, talking to one another."
College Senior,2,I really have no idea what the athletics are like. Most of the times I don't even know how the teams are doing because they aren't really advertised. I'd say school spirit was more prevalent in high school.
College Sophomore,2,No one really cares if you get a degree from this school
College Sophomore,2,The athletics at my school is pretty mediocre. This is not a respected athletic school.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the traditional dorms are very old, run down and so dirty"
College Sophomore,2,"Greeks are snobby and cliquey. They treat anybody who's a non-Greek and not attractive poorly. Greeks choose their participants on basis of appearance, and not academics or personality. Greeks mainly party and often get into lost of trouble on campus. Nobody takes the Greeks seriously on campus."
College Sophomore,2,Students do not take the courses seriously. Professors also do not take the courses seriously and encourage students to slack off. Professors do not attempt to keep students engaged in lectures and are more concerned about just getting the lecture finished as soon as possible and leaving. Students mainly go to this school to party and the people who are academically serious are often alienated because they don't had an interest in partying.
College Sophomore,2,"My friends and I have received food countless times that has been either undercooked or overcooked. We have worried about getting sick because the food is not cooked properly, so we would end up either not eating at all or eating cereal for dinner. The same food is served week after week, and it is very easy to get sick of how repetitive it is. The dining hall is consistently overcrowded, and there were many times where my friends and I were not able to find silverware, cups, and plates because they had all been taken. ESU needs another food option on campus, because it is not enough to have only the dining hall and the union."
College Sophomore,2,I received not scholarship money and loans help temporarily but of course we have to pay it back with interest.
College Sophomore,2,"Meal plans are too expensive for me because they serve food that I don't eat such as pork, fried foods, and unhealthy foods, daily."
College Freshman,2,Out of State Students don't get a lot of aid
College Freshman,2,They loose paperwork alot and do not offer many scholarships. For twins and being a minority I would think there would be more scholarships but there are basically none.
College Freshman,2,The athletic facility is nice.
College Sophomore,2,"The processing center for financial aid continued to ask for information we had sent to them multiple times. They stated that we once sent too much information so they disregarded all of it, so we then had to resend it. It look us a long time and a lot of phone calls, but fortunately we got the aid we were promised."
College Sophomore,2,From what i am aware of there is no special housing for Greek life. I would assume it is more of just a club. It doesn't have a big effect on the house but everything makes a difference.
College Senior,2,do it early and fast
College Sophomore,2,There are few greek lifes and they are not well known or doing anything significant
College Sophomore,2,There is nothing to do on campus for kids who don't do sports or drink and do drugs
College Junior,2,"Not the best neighborhood along with a high level of ""party"" individuals makes it a rather dismal selection"
College Junior,2,I hear about a lot of drinking.  I know certain fraternities have parties every night where there is constant drinking going on.
College Junior,2,I hear that there are a LOT of crazy parties that happen around campus and it's not something I involve myself in.
College Sophomore,2,I have not been able to receive hardly any aid due to the fact that I am simply out of state.
College Sophomore,2,"The Pocono Pony sucks...You do better calling a taxi. Once again, find friend's who have cars or think about getting a license and a car for yourself !"
College Freshman,2,"Campus police isn't available very often, crime on campus is relatively high, and the health center nurses and doctors are very helpful."
College Freshman,2,There are a number of sexual harassment reports.
College Freshman,2,"My school is not very strict with alcohol and partying. Weed is accessible but frowned upon, yet half the students take part in it. We are infamous for being the number one underrated party school."
College Freshman,2,"One inch of snow could possibly delay or cancel a class. If it's a combination of snow and rain, school is impossible to attend. This winter especially has not been the greatest because of all the winter storms and warnings."
College Freshman,2,Very Cold and a lot of Snow!
College Sophomore,2,nothing around here to do at all
College Senior,2,"This is the slowest system on the planet.  When you log in, it can take up to ten minutes to get up and running.  I have also lost papers and projects in cyberspace."
College Senior,2,Three classes that I needed for my senior year are now not being offered. What is left are 200 level that I have no intention of taking. Why learn something over and over again.  Financial aid held me up three weeks into the semester because they sat on my paperwork for two months.
College Freshman,2,"There is lots of skiiing and hiking near campus due to being in the mountains. The neighborhood surrounding ESU is not too safe. It is pretty creepy and run down, so I would definitely walk in a group. There is a crappy mall nearby but the outlets make up for that. A lot of the people that I have run into that live in the area are young blue collar families, homeless people begging for money, or creepy guys whistling out their window of their car as me and my girlfriends walk by. Don't walk anywhere alone at night off campus but that should be common sense. "
College Junior,2,"food is gross, and its always the same thing. over or under cooked. you will be running to the bathroom before you leave. also VERY EXPENSIVE "
College Junior,2,Dont join a club sport because the school doesnt care about you. lib is always filled and loud. 
College Junior,2,always has construction. not kept very well. the workers do take pride in what they do and work very hard with the limited supplies they are given! 
College Junior,2,hard to find. school gives you options but very expensice
College Junior,2,registration is always a struggle. hard to get into classes you need.
College Junior,2,Hard to get any kind of help. no one answers the phones to help you get aid. they don't care
College Junior,2,Wireless sucks in the dorms. Not enough computers for students to take their quizes and to study. 
College Senior,2,"The parking on campus for residents who live off campus is terrible if you don't get to the university by 9am. The fee to have a parking pass is absurd it was free for students my first two years than once my junior year hit it was 110$ to have a parking permit. The availability of parking is terrible, there are never enough parking spots for commuters or residents for that matter. The Ticketing and fines are not well. Now that parking is enforced 24 hours a day during the week its not right. For instance I came home from work one night late around 230 am and I parked in a commuter lot that was closer to my dorm that way I felt more safe going to my building because I parked near a safe light, and I go to move my car at 7 the next morning I had a 15$ ticket. "
College Senior,2,"This year the transportation has gotten better with the campus shuttle, it is still a hassle that it does not run on the weekends. The local transportation is terrible, most of the cab drivers are rude to the students I myself have seen it first hand. The prices for the local cab are equivalent to that of NYC I feel like. The long distance travelling is okay they do offer some discounts to college students but it isn't all the time, when I believe it should be more than what they offer. "
College Sophomore,2,"ESU is a very big party school. Mostly everyone here goes to parties every weekend, and it is known that underage drinking is very big."
College Sophomore,2,"This past semester, there have been numerous campus safety alerts involving robbery and sexual assault. It is definitely not a safe area to live in. "
College Junior,2,"I live off campus and have no problems but when I lived on campus it was horrible. Lived in the old dorms and NO parking.The new dorms I do not like.The were rushed and not completed withn I was there-no doors on closets....Did not like campus housing,"
College Sophomore,2,"The weather can get very bad in this area. Many people have to commute, and classes do not get cancelled that often, so it can sometimes put students in dangerous situations driving."
College Sophomore,2,"You can find weed any where, majority of students smoke week. Molly is also popular from time to time. Not many people do any hard core drugs as in coke, shrooms, lsd, and so on. Marijuana is the most popular. Mostly everyone drinks and loves to have a good time. Although there is drug and alcohol use everyone is, for the most part, very safe about it."
College Sophomore,2,It is not that strict. Of course they enforce the rules but if you are safe and careful it is easy to get away with some things.
Recent Alumnus,2,"This school bores me. I don't feel challenged in any of my courses. There need to be more options for food, and the bookstore is extremely overpriced."
College Junior,2,It's pretty difficult to find a parking space. It's also expensive.
College Senior,2,"There is not enough parking available for commuters or residents, to get parking will involve long periods of circling around parking lots in hoped of finding parking. There is also a charge for parking both as a resident and commuter. The parking enforcement is very strict during the week, however on the weekends it is hit or  miss. There is not too much of a need for a car unless you do not want to walk or take a cab to the bars. Walmart is a short walk away if you do not have a car, as well as Kmart."
Recent Alumnus,2,Same old stuff. Nothing new and interesting. Burgers...
College Sophomore,2,Not Very Interesting- The people here are mostly just your typical every day people
College Sophomore,2,"Another High School – ESU has felt like a second high school to me since I began attending. I do not feel challenged in an interesting or new manner.  It feels as if I am back in high school, with grade curves and teachers who teach right from the book.  There are some very good teachers, there is no doubt, but the majority of them are just kind of eeh."
College Sophomore,2,"Not Sure – It's hard for me to say, but in reviewing the scholarships available, they are very small... but I guess every little bit counts!"
College Sophomore,2,"If You're Lucky – Parking on campus can go one of two ways; really easy or go to Narnia and walk. You have to pay for a parking pass, but that's only good IF you can get a spot. The meters around campus only take quarters, so you're either underpaying and leaving class early, or overpaying to park. The commuters have it easier, since their pass lets them park anywhere. If you have a pass for a certain lot, well I wish you luck."
College Senior,2,"No Spots for Residents and Commuters Alike – Commuter and Resident lots are nowhere near large enough to provide an adequate amount of spots for the students. As a resident, it is a daily battle to get a spot and if there are none available the school expects you to park 15 minutes away and walk through the unsafe streets of East Stroudsburg. I would expect more from a public university charging $10,000 plus per semester."
Alum,1,I did not take any online classes as online learning was not as available in the late 90s. I participated in a combination of day/night classes.
Freshman,1,"I’m a freshman here and I hate it, I’m going to transfer next year. The food is always the same and not that good. There’s barely any places to eat on campus. The people are rude and judgmental. Kids don’t care about education. Some professors and advisors are bad. The parties are okay. The tutoring and health and wellness aren’t helpful. The campus is dirty, always litter everywhere. Clubs aren’t organized and poor communication. The town is run down and awful, there’s been stabbings last year and lots of people do drugs in town. The student activity association was good but then it got really dry. The only good things are academics, dorms, campus safety, and sports. The poconos are awesome but there’s not much fun stuff super close by unless you have a car."
College Sophomore,1,"I was placed into a random residence hall for my first year and it was absolutely filthy. The bathrooms were disgusting and if somebody threw up or had an accident, the janitor would not clean it up and they would let it sit for weeks. I did not get any choice that I wanted. They squeezed 3 people in a tiny room and people would often be rowdy after hours. This was an initiative for me to live off campus my following semester and following academia year."
College Sophomore,1,"Half the students should have never been accepted to college. They came in with 2.0s or lower. ESU has awful advisors who do not want to help you. Mine told me to quit the two sports I did at ESU... who does that? The professors tried their best, they were average at best. However, some did go above and beyond and were great. The courses that are mandatory are ridiculous."
College Junior,1,Drinking and partying is all I ever see. Not what I have any interest in.
College Freshman,1,This school cares more about the least important things.
College Freshman,1,The dorms on this campus are awful.
College Freshman,1,Campus doesn't let us keep our cars here which is very inconvenient.
College Freshman,1,"Even though this is a dry campus, so many students drink alcohol and do drugs."
College Freshman,1,The Wifi on campus is horrible!!! The printers never have ink or paper and the scanners never work.
College Freshman,1,"Little to no scholarships for out of state students. Out of state students have to pay double the price of instate students, which is fair yet one thing that is kind of annoying though is that in state students seem to get more opportunities for work study, jobs on campus, and scholarships when out of states students need them as well because they are paying way more money to go to school there. "
College Junior,1,always raining...not a lot of snow. sidewalks are not cleared 
College Junior,1,"awful teachers, awful enrollment services, awful classes."
College Sophomore,1,The price of parking on campus is extremely unfair. I do not think that as a student who is already paying tuition and other costs that I should have to pay $100 to park on campus.
College Sophomore,1,not nearly enough parking spaces for commuters
College Freshman,1,The local weather doesn't affect my campus experience. 
College Senior,1,The campus computers can take up to 10 minutes sometimes to log on. You are better off using your cell phone.
College Senior,1,More students than parking spaces.
College Sophomore,1,Parking sucks on campus and you have to get to school an hour or 2 before your class.
College Sophomore,1,The shuttle bus is for ridge members only and takes longer than walking does

Junior,5,"So far learning how to get myself set up with transferring to Carroll College has been a breeze. Online, I attended a Carroll 101 course where various staff and students helped address all of our questions regarding finances, living situations, campus life and much more at Carroll College. I am very excited to start my journey here."
Junior,5,"I will be attending Carroll College this upcoming August as a transfer student. I'll be attending the Anthrozoology program as well as double majoring in Psychology. I visited Helena last September and was greeted greatly by amazing people on a beautiful campus in the capital of Montana. I am all set to move to Carroll with the help of everyone there. Not to mention the amazing activities to do in Montana, hiking, relaxing in the hot springs, or visiting Yellowstone or the zoo in Billings."
Alum,5,"Carroll College is a wonderful school, especially for those looking to enter the medical field. The nursing program is well-regarded, and the pre-medicine program bosts an acceptance rate to medical school that is more than twice the national average."
Freshman,5,I really like the size of Carroll College!! All the staff are very helpful and are always willing to offer assistant. I really enjoy going to office hours and getting one on one help with the professors.
Alum,5,"I attended Carroll College for my undergraduate studies in Health Sciences on my pursuit to become an occupational therapist. I am incredibly grateful that I chose to spend four years in Helena, Montana and I cannot imagine having a better college experience. The relationships that I have established with my peers will last a lifetime, and the majority of people attending Carroll College are genuinely good people. The academic curriculum is advanced, and you will receive a top notch education from the best professors. With the small class sizes I was able to get to know my professors on a personal level, which was a huge advantage to learning. The campus of Carroll College is unbelievably beautiful, and there is ample opportunities for student involvement. Overall, Carroll College provided me with the best four years of my life (so far) and was the most positive experience I have had."
Sophomore,5,"Carroll College is located in Helena, MT. The location offers students with lot of outdoor recreation opportunities. The community is great.  Professors are great and invested in helping students achieve academic success in their area(s) of study. The school does a good job of representing their Catholic identity."
Sophomore,5,"Carroll College, there isnt a place quite like it. The community vibe is awesome and the professors really get to know each and every student. The classes are difficult but that is expected from a school of this caliber. Carroll provides each student with the tools to succeed in life."
Junior,5,"Carroll College is an excellent, small private college in Helena, MT. If you're in search of a rigorous liberal-arts degree with professors who are genuinely interested in their students and their learning processes. Classes are small--thirty people, or so, maximum--so professors have a chance to get to know you and are genuinely invested in helping students achieve their individual goals."
Alum,5,"Going to Carroll was an amazing and transformative experience in my life. In addition to receiving an education that prepared me for the rigors of law school and further graduate studies, it also helped mold me into the person I am today."
Freshman,5,"I am currently a freshman at Carroll College in Helena, MT. I'm so glad I chose to come to Carroll. It's small, family friendly, and feels like its own little community. I was choosing between another school and this one, and I couldn't be happier for deciding on Carroll! My intended major is Nursing with the intentions of going into Pediatrics/Neonatal and working at St. Jude one day. This school is well-known for its success in the medical programs that it offers. Once again, I couldn't be happier with my decision to attend Carroll and hope others think the same."
Junior,5,"This small liberal arts school is the perfect place to receive a high quality education. Carroll College is tucked away in the beautiful capital city of Montana. The Big Sky country allows for students to receive a prestigious education at the same time providing students with the chance to explore some of the most beautiful countryside in the nation. Just a couple hours away from Glacier National Park, this quaint little school provides students with the opportunity to learn during the week and then take off for great weekend adventures. Carroll College is not like many other schools. Carroll values the community aspect of the college. The small student population allows for strong student-professor relationships along with great connections to the world beyond Carroll."
Alum,5,"What resonates most through the years since my Carroll student days is how so many of us came away with such a strong sense of Carroll's purpose and place, a sense of belonging, a faith in the future, and a shared energy felt across so many generations and circumstances. This bond extends so quickly and so deeply among current students and alumni and faculty and staff. It  amazes me still that this excitement surfaces so frequently after these many years, whether in an unlikely airport conversation with any member of the 'Carroll family' you encounter, or during a campus visit, or at a sports or academic or alumni event across the country, or across the world.  Sign me, ""Always grateful to be a CC Saint!"""
Alum,5,"Carroll College was an absolutely amazing experience. Every school promises that you join a family, but that is especially true at Carroll. The professors go out of their way to meet you and often invite you over for games and dinner and what not. I've read some of the negative reviews and don't be mislead. Most are based on a single instance and they fail to look beyond it. Is Carroll 100% perfect? No. But I'd be hard pressed to find another school that is. It all depends on how invested you are. If you come to Carroll open and ready for a fun experience, you'll love it!"
Alum,5,I loved my Carroll experience! I always enjoy visiting the campus whenever I have the chance.  The classes I took and people I met changed my life---- my only regret is that none of my children went to Carroll.
Alum,5,"Carroll College will forever hold a special place in my heart. My experiences with faculty, peers, and the greater Helena community instilled a devotion for critical thinking and international travel that remain important aspects of my life today. I am presently an assistant professor of history at a regional college in South Dakota. I owe my four years at Carroll College for all of my professional accomplishments."
Alum,5,Carroll College has excellent academic programs and helps young adults to grow in their faith.  There are so many different opportunities for community engagement that there is a niche for everyone! I will be forever grateful for the mentors I had at Carroll College.
Alum,5,"Carroll allowed me to stretch my mind to the possibilities of what could be - my economics professor brought the world to our minds - in class and out of class.  He pushed me to look at what I wanted to do not what I ""should"" do.  I applied to graduate school and attended and that was my entry into sales, sales management and international finance."
Alum,5,"It was the BEST College opportunity from the Admission Office to the Pioneer Pit and every class and activity in between.  My college life from the classroom to the dorm events helped me to form my approach with people in my church, workplace, and community.  My investment of time, energy, and money at Carroll has paid off a hundredfold in all walks of my life.  I was Blessed by having been given the opportunity to attend Carroll and the Blessings have never ceased to continue."
Alum,5,"I loved my Carroll experience. The community is so welcoming. Despite being a Catholic college, you are in no way pressured to be religious. Most students and all of the faculty I came across were open-minded and thoughtful. The diversity is somewhat poor, being in rural Montana. However, the few people from diverse cultures were celebrated rather than judged. The community around the college is excellent."
Alum,5,"Carroll gives students an amazing, wholesome college experience. It is a well-rounded school with an investment in Catholic values. While it is a small school with limited courses, Carroll is rich with other opportunities with study abroad being widely available, multiple college clubs, intramural teams, and activities to get involved in the community. The goal of success is not just placed on you as a student, but on the whole of the school, with everyone invested in ensuring you are provided the education and experience that will get you where you need to be. While the school certainly isn't cheap, it gives a valuable education, and I have never doubted my time at Carroll."
Alum,5,"My experience was amazing.  I received a great education and learned things I wouldn't have at a larger institution.  The atmosphere and community on the Carroll College campus is very welcoming.  The town of Helena is amazing as well.  The tuition is rather high, but tuition assistance is pretty good.  I'd highly recommend Carroll College to anyone."
Alum,5,"Carroll College is an excellent small school, with a great ratio of students to professors, who were always willing to help.  It was a wonderful atmosphere for college.  I wouldn't change my college choice for anything!"
Alum,5,"I absolutely loved my time at Carroll.  The small class sizes were exactly what I needed to stay focused in my studies. I built life-long friendships, and made amazing memories. I was well prepared, after graduating, for success in my graduate program."
Alum,5,"Carroll College is incredibly unique not only because of the size or Catholic identity, but because of the people here. The Carroll family welcomes everyone with many different interests and beliefs. The students and faculty help each other out and are exceptionally friendly. With the combination of the community and the small size, I was not just a number here getting lost in a crowd of people. This, in conjunction with the academic rigor, is how Carroll prepares its students extremely well for after graduation."
Sophomore,5,"I greatly enjoy the smaller student population and class sizes. This allows us to be closer as a community and be on a personal basis with our professors. The academia isn't too hard, but classes definitely keep you busy. Most of the teachers have office hours that they are more than happy to have students use whenever we need help. 
The tuition is fairly high, but many scholarships are available. I am receiving assistance with more than half of the tuition.
There are also many opportunities to study abroad at Carroll, I am hoping to do so a year from now and study in Japan.
A few of the cons are with the cafeteria and dorms. The cafeteria staff are pleasant and the food is decent. The problem is that, overall, we don't have a lot of times we can go in to eat, especially on the weekends. 
The dorms are older so there are problems occasionally, but when reported things are fixed in a timely manner.
Overall, I have enjoyed my stay at Carroll and look forward to the rest of my time here."
Junior,5,I enjoy the experiences that are offered and the comradery that is shown through peers and professors. Everyone is friendly and willing to help in any way so the campus is given the spirit of family.  There are great programs and great professors
College Sophomore,5,Carroll does a great job of making sure students are responsible and safe.
College Sophomore,5,"There is no Greek life, so it's great."
College Sophomore,5,"It's just one of the best colleges in the northwest, plain and simple."
College Junior,5,Professors care greatly about your success. Any academic disabilities or needs are easily taken care of. I came to Carroll for the academics.
College Junior,5,Carroll has a great reputation
College Freshman,5,I love the small school atmosphere. I feel like I know everyone and it makes it easier to ask anyone for help.
College Freshman,5,Our school has a discussion every year in order to make students feel safe on campus. We have the help cell phone line in which one can call to have a securitas meet them for whatever their needs are.
College Junior,5,"The best in Montana, fan support is amazing, students are always involved in athletics such as student sections. Athletic facilities are pretty nice, could be better, but it gets the job done for our school athletic programs."
College Freshman,5,I have a high confidence that I will come out of Carroll with a job because of the quality of a degree from this school.
College Freshman,5,"I love college. From the classes, to the people, to the environment and freedom I love every bit of it."
College Sophomore,5,"The Carroll Campus has security on duty 24-7. I always feel safe and safety regulations are provided to each student in a variety of ways (i.e. email, etc.)"
College Sophomore,5,Carroll if very highly respected in the State of Montana and all over the country. We are rated as the #1 in Montana and potential employers really appreciate that status. Career Services is amazing and will help anyone who will take them up on it. There are several opportunities on campus to meet potential employers.
College Sophomore,5,I have gone from doing the minimum in high school to truly loving learning because of Carroll Professors. They are passionate and very well educated which makes me strive to be like them. I am lucky to learn from such an amazing group of people at Carroll.
College Sophomore,5,I am blessed to be at such an amazing school like Carroll College. I am growing in my education and my personal life by being at Carroll.
College Freshman,5,Carroll has everything I was looking for.
College Senior,5,"Carroll has an unique community. Despite having the disadvantages of going to such a small school, I feel it was the best choice for me. With close connections to professors and a welcoming atmosphere, it is a pleasant place to spend my college years."
College Sophomore,5,"I've been to two other colleges since I've graduated high school and in this time I've had the chance to experience how these schools operate and in this time I've realized that Carroll works hard to make sure that the students succeed. Their teachers work with the students, individually if necessary, to help the students get a deeper understanding of any material that the student does not understand."
College Freshman,5,The Community Advisers make campus living an enjoyable environment. Rooms are spacious. Buildings are very clean! Facilities are kept up to date and cleaned everyday.
College Freshman,5,academics are top notch at Carroll
College Freshman,5,I feel very safe on campus
College Freshman,5,"I am a health sciences major with a pre-physical therapy focus. Here at Carroll College, we not only have our program requirements to fulfill, but also a liberal arts studies requirement. This provides for students to get the best well-rounded education they can possibly get. For health sciences, many life science courses are required, as well as mathematics courses. The curriculum is very well structured, there are even online versions of four-year plans, so that a student may plan what classes need to be taken in each semester at Carroll College. The workload for this program is pretty demanding. Upwards of 3 science and math classes may be taken at a time. Most science classes also include a three-hour lab, once per week. On top of those program-specific classes, core requirements (i.e. history, English, Theology) must also be taken care of. There are many internship opportunities for the health sciences/pre-physical therapy major as there are many different places that utilize the greatness of physical therapy. There are many local physical therapy clinics around town, as well as St. Peter's Hospital which has a rehab center as well as a physical therapy center."
College Freshman,5,"The athletics teams at Carroll College are some of the best. Not only are they comprised of great students, they are also comprised of outstanding athletes. The football team recently reached the quarterfinals of the NAIA National Playoffs and the cross country team got second place in the Frontier Conference. Carroll College fans are definitely die-hards. Especially football fans. Carroll College has some of the best school spirit and I am so lucky to be apart of that. The students are genuinely respectful towards opposing teams. There are always large student sections at any sporting event and most students will sport their purple and gold attire. The athletic facilities for the athletes is some of the best there is available. This is probably why we have great athletes. Great training facilities make even greater athletes."
College Freshman,5,They take good care of us
College Junior,5,"This is a very safe campus. People leave their doors open, their backpacks on the floor in the common room etc. Many people even leave their cars unlocked on campus."
College Junior,5,"This question seems rather judgmental and shallow to me. However, I will give some other information. Everyone I have ever met here has been very nice, and I find people to be generally very accepting of uniqueness and individuality."
College Junior,5,I love Helena! Everyone is always nice!
College Junior,5,It is great if you enjoy the outdoors because you can take about ten to fifteen minutes to walk from the campus to the mountains and go on an amazing hike or bike ride and enjoy the woodland scenery.
College Student,5,I have always felt very secure on this campus.
College Student,5,I have never encountered any problems(knockonwood)
College Freshman,5,The school has high expectations of the students.
College Sophomore,5,We have some interesting classes and from the very first ed. department class we get to do field experience in the local schools.
College Freshman,5,the campus is very safe
College Freshman,5,"Carroll has one of the best academic programs in the state, and very high job placement after graduation"
College Freshman,5,The financial aid department is very knowledgeable and helpful
Senior,4,I would like to see a change to the cafeteria food. I didn't enjoy the food most of the time. Physics with calculus could be restructured to make it more enjoyable rather than a burden
Freshman,4,"Carroll College had very nice people and a beautiful campus. I love walking to classes because with the small enrollment classes, most people know each other."
Freshman,4,"I will be a freshman at Carroll College in the fall of 2020. It is an amazing school that dedicates a lot of time and effort to their students. They have a high retention and graduation rate, which is one of the most important things to me when looking at colleges to attend. Carroll College combines education and faith to make the perfect college experience."
Alum,4,"Overall it was a great experience. I was raised in LA so I wasn't sure what to expect but was blessed w/the opportunity to play college basketball here. 
The faculty&advisors truly care and want you to succeed. Academics are taken very seriously and teachers will hold you accountable regardless of if you play a sport, have a job, etc. But that's why they are ranked nationally and regionally. 
Dorms, classrooms, dining hall, and a grocery store are within walking distance. The athletic teams are generally solid with a variety of options. (Humbly: I graduated as part of the winningest bball class in school history.)  
Now, it starts to snow late fall to early to mid-spring. There aren't a ton of food options off of campus and CC doesn't have a busy downtown in terms of bars and clubs. 
A place for ppl who like the outdoors and mountain range."
Sophomore,4,"I love the welcoming atmosphere of Carroll College. There is definitely a sense of kinship among the students, which only grows stronger as you advance in your degree. The professors are willing to bend over backwards to assist students, and love to get to know you.

However, it is pricey. Close to 40,000 a year, though students usually receive upwards of 20, 000 in merit scholarships each year. It is academically minded, so if you are not in this for the education but the college experience go some where else"
Sophomore,4,I love the small school vibe. The professors are incredible and very personalized. The food is terrible and some of the buildings are....unique. Overall I have liked my time at Carroll so far.
Sophomore,4,Carroll College has an amazing sense of community. There are many student activities and clubs to get involved with and the overall community is very welcoming to all types of people.
Sophomore,4,"Very good college, great professors who care about you not just see you as a number. Although it is a very great institution it has its drawbacks as it is a very small school."
Alum,4,"Carroll is a fantastic school but the pre med program is overrated and outdated. Come to this school if you want a great education, but do not come solely for the pre med program. The advisor is not helpful and the statistics are inflated/not entirely true. The professors here are great, but you will earn your way into medical school entirely on your own and do not expect to receive the help the school advertises in the process. I would come here again in a heartbeat but wish I had known this before starting college."
Junior,4,"Carroll has outstanding professors and academic programs. I would suggest not living on campus, if possible."
Junior,4,"Carroll College is wonderful becuase it is small which allows personal interactions with all classes, students, professors.  One of the most unique aspects of Carroll College is they have a wonderful verteran represnetative and are also very supportive of global and abroad experiances."
Niche User,4,"I have never attended Carroll College, but on my campus visit all the students were very friendly. As I walked around, everyone seemed to have a smile on their face. The campus is beautiful, and the new renovations are amazing."
Sophomore,4,"I love the community on campus and how the professors all try to get to know you as a person. However, some of the buildings are a little rundown and the food isn't the best. It sometimes feels a bit too small for me."
Freshman,4,"The professors and administration at Carroll have been extremely welcoming to our incoming class, and has made the transition from high school to college smooth. Since the school is small, there is great relationships between upper and lower classmen, as well as professors. Many people would say that the school is very expensive, but I received a great amount of financial aid that actually made the cost of attending a private school less than a public school."
Sophomore,4,"Carroll College is arguably the best college within the state of Montana.  It is an academically rigorous school, and it has its perks by being small and building a community amongst its students and its faculty.  I know almost all of my professors very well, and I have the opportunity of knowing almost all of the students within my major.  While it is a Catholic institution, it is very ecumenical and does not discriminate its students in any way based on their individual spiritual beliefs.  The concepts of Catholic intellectual and social teaching are very evident in the college's academics and their student-lead clubs.  Overall, I would highly recommend Carroll for students who wish to have a more personal educational experience."
Sophomore,4,"The people at Carroll are great - once you find a solid group of friends.  Helena is a very small town  - it feels rural and although it is the capitol it seems like a very old fashioned place. 
I believe that I am getting a great education and feel like this is where I am supposed to be  - and believe it is a great foundation for my future academic pursuits."
Senior,4,"Carroll is a very small college, about 1800 students. I really liked this fact, because it allowed for students to have a ton of one-on-one attention from professors. Overall the college has a ton to offer, but there is one drawback. The food services leaves a lot to be desired. It has limited variety and is often not cooked properly."
Junior,4,"Carroll College is a pretty decent school with good teachers and interesting courses available to choose from. The amount of students per classroom is relatively small, as well as, the campus itself. I've been told a reason some students attend Carroll is for their anthrozoology program. 

However, to be honest, you should only go to Carroll if your scholarship will cover most of the cost because the tuition there is expensive and I've been told you can find other schools that are way cheaper yet give you the same educational experience as that school."
Alum,4,"I still look back on my college years as a time period I wish I could go back to. That time gave me some of the most fun and educational years of my life and I have Carroll to thank for that! I met wonderful friends, professors, classmates, and colleagues that I will never forget and a lot that I still keep in touch with to this day. Some are even best friends. There are so many interesting and unique classes, activities, and a beautiful campus that Carroll offers! I loved the community feeling that Carroll provides and enjoyed being involved in many activities on campus. Not going to lie, I also loved living in St. Charles! It was so cool to be able to reside somewhere that had so much history and is one of the main representations of the college. Love Carroll and wish I could go back!! Go Saints!"
Alum,4,"I've worked at several colleges after attending Carroll, and I can genuinely say that the quality of the faculty here matches or exceeds schools that are larger, more urban, more well-known, and with better academic reputations. I can also say that the sense of community, a vague ideal, is tangible every day at Carroll.

There are certain restrictions associated with attending a small, regional institution - almost every student is from Montana, Washington, Idaho, or Oregon, and almost all are white - but in spite of that I felt exposed to a broader way of thinking about the world at Carroll, mostly through the great faculty.

The Catholic element waxes and wanes - there are eras when a very conservative Catholic dogma takes hold, and those aren't the best years at Carroll. But if you happen to attend when a more social-justice oriented, communal, and inclusive aspect of the Catholic identity is in ascendance (and it really all depends on leadership), it's a very positive environment."
Freshman,4,I have loved my experience at Carroll College so far. The professors take interest in there students' and want them to succeed. Going to class and having your professor know who you are is great. Carroll also has many resources to help succeed in and after college that are extremely helpful. The campus is very welcoming and accepting of all which is a great thing to be a part of. The only bad thing I have to say is they require students to live on campus the first two years which is frustrating.
Freshman,4,"I really love Carroll College. The atmosphere is great and everyone here really does act like a big family. If you need help with anything, there is always someone excited to get you what you need. The academics are exquisite and the area is beatiful!"
Sophomore,4,Love Carroll! I even transferred from another college to attend this one because it's so much better. Great teachers and classes. Sadly the parking isn't great and you get ticketed for anything!
Alum,4,"Carroll College is an excellent school if you are serious about your academics and career plan. Carroll is one of those colleges that will make you jump through all the hoops out there if you are not on top of your own career. The teachers are passionate about their studies and all in all a great variety of human beings. Carroll does have a pretentious and religious atmosphere, but that comes from its rich heritage in both. There is a plethora of options for outside activities, sports and clubs. Carroll has excellent outreach and volunteer opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,"Great for me, depends on the person."
College Sophomore,4,"Great for me, but it depends on the person."
College Sophomore,4,The rate of students that get jobs right out of college here is one of the best.
College Sophomore,4,"I don't care about athletics, but it has a great reputation."
College Junior,4,As a female I feel safe walking on campus at night.
College Junior,4,I love Carroll. It was a softer school but I am so glad aI ended up here. My only qualm is the homologony of religious acceptance. To be anything other than Christian excludes you from a lot of on campus activities.
College Freshman,4,The campus could use a little bit more lighting. It is very dark to walk around on at night.
College Freshman,4,The professors here are all so helpful!
College Freshman,4,Carroll lives for football. It shows through the facilities available to the players.
College Sophomore,4,"There is little crime on campus, and I always feel safe walking around, even at night."
College Sophomore,4,"The school spirit around campus is very exciting, but doesn't take away from the academic aspects of the school."
College Freshman,4,It's a really good school for being how small that it is. Although it is challenging it offers great opportunities to improve your academic achievments. The students also are always up to something whether it be fundraising for St. Judes or appreciating the donors.
College Freshman,4,With being a small school Carroll's campus housing is conveinent to where classes are. They also offer on campus apartments to help students learn to take the next step in their life.
College Freshman,4,The athletics at my school is great. We have amazing student spirit for being as small as we are. The students take pride in the athletics here.
College Freshman,4,My overall experience at school so far is difficult. In high school I was an A and B student. Coming to college has made me a C student. This is hard for me to accept especially when I've been doing the best I can to raise my grades. My college offers free student tutoring and the teachers are very open with their office hours. I feel that these tools are useful into trying to approve my schooling overall.
College Freshman,4,"The support the athletic teams receive from students is great. Many students are athletes themselves and they try to be supportive of other teams on campus. The facilities are not what I expected at a college campus. Compared to high school, Carroll is lacking many things for a college that is very involved in sports."
College Junior,4,"I feel very safe when I walk around campus and I believe everyone else I know, feels the same way."
College Junior,4,"The dorms are a perfect size for freshman and they have sinks in almost all of them, which is awesome because then you don't have to walk back and forth to the bathroom. Sophomore year dorms are a little different because they don't have rooms with sinks. Spacious rooms though, which means a lot more room for activities. Junior and senior living is amazing, they dorms are big and they have everything you want."
College Junior,4,"School has been an amazing experience, I look forward to the jobs that I will be able to apply for due to the experience and education I am receiving. Businesses will look at where I went to college and be satisfied because my college has an amazing reputation."
College Freshman,4,"While there rarely are parties on the weekdays, on the weekends there are decent house parties. Big weekends like Homecoming, Halloween and Softball weekend are the weekends when the full blown ragers happen. While Carroll is a small school, people here know how to have a good time."
College Freshman,4,"Carroll is a great school, it puts education at the top of the priorities."
College Freshman,4,This school takes the safety of its students very seriously and does everything they can to keep everyone safe.
College Freshman,4,"I love Carroll. It's not perfect, but it's my dream school and I love the people and my experiences thus far. The only thing I would change are our dining services, but that's completely manageable for me in my book."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy the campus housing here. It is all very nice and the janitors do such a nice job keeping it nice and clean.
College Sophomore,4,I personally am not involved in the athletics department at Carroll but it is a huge part of our school.
College Freshman,4,"I feel very safe on this campus. Although, I do know someone who was sexually assaulted on this campus. That does not change how I feel about my safety. The doors to the residence halls are usually kept unlocked during the day but then lock at a certain time in the evening. I do not hear much about any other crime that happen on campus."
College Freshman,4,"There are so many different classes that are very interesting along with the standard classes. The Anthrozoology classes are very interesting. The professors are very helpful when it comes to helping out or scheduling due date for assignments and tests. My communications professor, before starting class, if someone was missing, she would have us call the person and would not start class with out contacting this person first. They care about you and your education."
College Freshman,4,"I love living on campus. It is so nice being able to go back to my room right after a class and relax until my next campus. It is really easy to get around campus because it is such a small campus. It can get pretty loud at times with people running around the halls all the time. I have visited some of my friends at different schools and their rooms are really small compared to mine. The halls are also very spacious. I love having a sink in my room, it's very convenient."
College Freshman,4,One of the only reasons that I am at this school is because or the Anthrozoology major. If there were more schools that offered this program I would have gone to a college closer to my home state. The school is great and the people are great but I would rather be closer to home. The Anthrozoology program it totally worth the distance.
College Freshman,4,It is a great place to be!
College Freshman,4,The dorms are fun and social.
College Freshman,4,School spirit is generally supportive.
College Freshman,4,Care of all kinds is available.
College Freshman,4,People think highly of Carroll Alumni
College Freshman,4,"This is a great school, wireless sucks though"
College Freshman,4,Everything but the freshman dorms are great.
Freshman,2,"I was very excited to go to carroll college, and despite the fact that I met one of my best friends there, it just wasn't the school for me. The school provides excellent adademic oppurtunities, however, I felt extremely unsafe while on campus for a variety of reasons."
Niche User,2,"It takes a very specific kind of person to succeed at Carroll, and I found that it was not for me. If you are not from Helena (or somewhere else in Montana), it can be very difficult to fit in. Many of the school’s alumni (most of whom are from Helena) all still live and work in town and/or have kids attending and are very involved on campus, so it can be tough to fit into that crowd. Good academics and professors overall, but not worth the price of tuition. Helena has nice scenery, but if you’re not outdoorsy or if you aren’t into going to the same bar every night, then it isn’t for you. Also, it’s fairly conservative (which could be good or bad depending on your beliefs)."
College Junior,2,"Diversity is lacking because of the location, price, and areas the college recruits from."
College Freshman,2,"There really are no job jars or employers recruiting on campus. While I have personally not been to the career center on campus, I heard that it is great."
College Senior,2,The football team would fail when it comes to Coke and Marijuana. Alcohol is everywhere. I've never been pressured into anything though.
Recent Alumnus,2,It's Montana and a Catholic School. Don't expect huge revelations about your liberal side.
Recent Alumnus,2,Sodexo needs to step up its game
College Freshman,2,Montana weather can change in five minutes.
College Freshman,2,"Drugs aren't really a problem, but if you don't go out and party and drink you don't really fit in."
College Freshman,2,Our campus is not diverse at all. I'm pretty sure there are 5 people of African-American descent on campus.
College Freshman,2,I say it's bad only because I see quite the number of inebriated students every evening/weekend. And I know that there are students here who do marijuana.
College Freshman,2,"I rarely see any parties going on, and the club scene is non-existent. "
College Sophomore,2,"Alot of students partake in drugs, and sell it."
College Junior,2,On campus parking is limited and fairly expensive. Off campus parking is almost non-existent without a long walk. 
College Junior,2,"I hardly see campus security or the medical staff, but I feel fairly safe. "
College Junior,2,There are not many restaurants in this area and the quality is lacking. 
College Junior,2,"I have had a paying internship and it was wonderful and the college I was at accepted that and allowed it to be used to graduate. However, my current college will not allow payed internships to be counted as an internship. I think with the economy the what it is this an unfair policy. I feel it is counteractive to being able to attend school and cover costs. "
College Freshman,2,"Most people at Carroll live on campus for all four years due to the close knit community and the ease of access to the school. There are apartments located on the edge of campus for privacy and ease of access that are amazing. However, when you are truly living off campus the options are limited and there isn't any transportation to school unless you have a car (or a bike when it isn't snowing)."
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus is expensive and at times confusing and frustrating. Permits are expensive and if you get the cheaper of the two permits they don't even guarantee you a spot. If you park in the wrong spot or area your pretty much going to get a ticket. Parking off campus on the side streets is a option, but if you don't have an early morning class you will have to park a couple of blocks away. However, cars are not a necessity and if you don't have one its really no big deal."
College Freshman,2,"Sociology at Carroll college is rather difficult due to the fact that it i s an overlooked major and there are few courses offered. There are only 4 sociology professors so there are a limited number of courses available and they rotate on which semesters they are available, making it difficult to schedule and take necessary courses."
Niche User,1,I might agree that another parent send a son here.  My daughter was attacked twice and the school covered it up. Don’t let the unlocked areas fool you. It is not safe. Find a school with more than just campus “police”.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek life on campus.
College Freshman,1,"It is frankly horrible. There is no public transportation at all, and other than buses for sports and a van or two for special events, there is no on-campus transportation. The only way I get around further than a mile or so away is by borrowing someones car."
College Junior,1,There are no fraternities or sororities on campus.
College Junior,1,"Terrible food most of the time. Way over priced. Terrible hours. Barely open on the weekends. Very, very little options."
College Junior,1,"No school shuttles, No public transportation; However, you can walk to some places in just a few minutes. Most shopping and restaurants require use of a car."
College Junior,1,We pay over a hundred dollars for parking permits and you have to walk so far to get the classes with all your books. 
College Freshman,1,"There is no public busses and walking and biking aren't a big thing around here. If you don't have a car, its hard. You can find friends with cars and do what you need to do but I would prefer have a car. Also, for those who have to fly between home and school, the Helena airport is very expensive."
College Freshman,1,The wifi is SO slow and they enjoy to do constant downtimes to 'update' when all it does is slow it down more. It also likes to kick users off of the server and not let them use the internet for long periods at a time.
College Freshman,1,Number 1 people just don't know how to park in general. #2 there's not enough parking to accommodate everyone with a car. Be sure to get the A lot parking passes! You can get snowed in if you park on the street with a B lot pass.
College Sophomore,1,They are strict on the parking on campus for the main purpose to gain more money
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is horrible. There is only one free parking lot which is the furthest parking lot from everything. There is one parking lot for visitors, in which they have to pay. For the rest of the parking lots a permit is required, unless you park on the street but if you plan on doing that you probably want to get up fairly early. Security is always out looking to give people tickets too, so you want to make sure your parked in the right spot!"
College Freshman,1,Public transportation is pretty bad around Helena. There are no city buses and I think there is only one taxi service. Buses out of the city are difficult to find and are expensive. It is possible to walk most places in Helena but a car would be recommended.
College Junior,1,Leaving Campus – There is very little going on at Carroll after 8 p.m. unless of course you like the library. Stdents who are 21 find themselves downtown at the bars. There are no clubs in this town.
College Sophomore,1,"Until you are old enough (or look old enough...) to go to the scummy bars, there is nothing legal to do after 8pm."
College Freshman,1,A Change in Fles Dollars – Carroll College recently changed our ability to use our flex dollars in the Helena community. This has caused the community businesses to discontinue their support of other Carroll activities and students. I believe that it is in the best interest of Carroll College to allow us to use our flex dollars in the community at local businesses.
College Freshman,1,There aren't any professional sports teams. Less attractions for college aged students.
College Junior,1,"Once you are here, you are out of luck.  What you get before arriving on campus is likely all you will ever get.  It is extremely difficult to work with financial aid when you are a student."
College Sophomore,1,THE WORST IN THE ENTIRE WORLD. THERE IS NO ROOM. DON'T EVEN GET ME STARTED ON HOW I HATE CARROLL AND THE HOUSING SYSTEM.
College Sophomore,1,There are no buses in Helena and Carroll provides no assistance in rides.

They also have a wonderful counseling center where, if you are going through hard times, you can receive free sessions.

College Junior,2,"This school is terrible in case of student relations. No one follows up and no gives guidance on how the process so work. I have for the second time missed my opportunity to utilize my military benefits for school due to no guidance. This has put a huge financial burden on my house hold of 5. Also I have never had the chance to speak to my counselor because there is one one person for science and he teaches all the time and of course provides the guidance for the science degrees and the school is mostly known for its their science department. No one can get a hold of this professor. 

Through getting started and continuing has been an issue the teachers are very knowledgeable and they do care about the students success. The business aspect needs to figure it out."

Sophomore,5,My experience has been pretty easy online. All of my professors were very understanding and if anyone ever has technical issues they always try to help you catch up. Workload is fair and tests  have been pretty fair.
Sophomore,5,"Although it has all been online due to Covid, LMU has been very fair and respectful towards their students. All of my professors care a lot about your well-being and want you to succeed. I'm also a part of the athletic department and have enjoyed my experience there. Overall, a positive experience!"
Alum,5,"LMU was a very inclusive University with activities for students of all interests. Their employment opportunities are numerous and the location is beautiful. The classes were varied, and professors successful."
Senior,5,I transferred to this school in January of 2019 and I have really enjoyed it. I think the professors are all very nice and respected. The campus is very welcoming and has an abundance of resources to aid my studies.
Alum,5,"The most amazing college experience. The faculty is impressive, the community is wonderful, and the chance to live in Los Angeles, CA is once in a lifetime!"
Sophomore,5,"professors were very accessible and LMU responded very promptly to situation, some classes held over Zoom"
Sophomore,5,Very small classes with one on one learning. Students and Professors are very motivated to educate the whole person.
Freshman,5,I took online courses due to the pandemic. The professors were all ver understanding and worked with the students if problems did arise.
Freshman,5,"It's a great campus that's on the smaller side--geographically and student populations wise. With that being said, it's smaller sizes allow for deeper connections with your peers and the faculty. I got an internship my first year here because of those connections and relationships that I made with my professors. If you're trying to go into the film or tech industry this school is a phenomenal place to do that because it's got a great location in LA."
Sophomore,5,"Overall, I love the school and am so honored to be a student. It was my dream school from the beginning of my high school career and could not imagine myself anywhere else."
Alum,5,"Everything about LMU was amazing. The classes were small enough to allow direct professor interaction, giving easier access to things like research and letters of rec. The people were amazing and my school was a very collaborative program that a lot of different people could benefit from."
Freshman,5,"Loyola Marymount is a beautiful university with a great view and safe surrounding neighborhoods. The student life is inclusive and positive. The faculty truly cares about the students, as shown by the large amount of quality resources provided for them. LMU is great in communication and will keep you updated even in troubling times such as those we are facing in 2020."
Freshman,5,"I have not taken any classes online through LMU, but I can vouch that my experience in registering for classes and preparing for the fall semester has been very easy and convenient with LMU's websites."
Freshman,5,"I had an amazing freshman year experience at LMU. The parties aren't as big as larger schools and can be more low-key but if you want to party you can usually find one to go to if you have friends who also party.  Teachers are mostly very helpful and understanding, they are usually available for office hours.  I went to a public highschool and I was a little surprised how many kids here went to private schools...I probably should have expected that.  I would say most people here come from rich families.  The campus is beautiful and very convenient being right near LAX.  The beach is also very close. On weekends we had fun exploring new places in LA, I wasn't sure about attending a smaller school but I think the size of LMU was actually nice.  You usually see people you know when walking to class and I feel like I got to meet a large portion of the freshman class.  If you make an effort socially it is not hard to make friends."
Alum,5,"I absolutely love this school; There is a club for any desire you have and if there isnt, the school is super open about starting a new club. There is a staff or faculty member that will help, support, and guide you if you need any help along the way. The students are super kind and welcoming; the spirit isnt of super competitiveness, and in fact, if you ask for help from upper division students, they are more than willing to assist. Overall would recommend this school."
Sophomore,5,"LMU is everything that I did and didn't know I would want from college. I chose LMU because I didn't want to go to a state school where I would be in 500 person classes. The biggest class I had at LMU was gen chem with 60 students and my professor even knew my name after 3 weeks. I think there is a huge sense of community at LMU, but I am super involved in extracurriculars. I read some of the other reviews and people talk about how no everyone is rude and rich white kids. Yes, there are a lot of wealthy students at LMU and some of them aren't very nice. But those people are dramatically outnumbered by the people who will go out of their way to chat with you on your way to class or ask to study with you in the library. I'm a big believer that college is what you make of it, being at LMU I see the kids who put effort in to join clubs, go to office hours, and get out of the comfort zone flourish. The one thing I wish was better were are sports, but that's literally my only criticism."
Sophomore,5,I LOVE LMU. The campus is beautiful and the people you meet here are like no other. The administration is one of my only issues. They're more so focused on the money aspect rather than the students.
Alum,5,"I loved loyola marymount university so much!! They truly care about the students, and not to mention that the faculty are amazing and that the campus is absolutely gorgeous."
Alum,5,I am a former LMU student. I completed my BBA and my MA degrees. I had a terrific time at LMU. It is worth every dollar to earn your education at this phenomenal academic institution.
Graduate Student,5,"An incredible school and excellent professors who want to see you succeed in the real world! Great environment, which is so important when you are trying to complete a master's degree in Education. Professors and administration really care about their students and help you make connections to take on the next step of your future endeavors."
Freshman,5,"My experience at LMU has been amazing, I have great professors and really like the personal investment professors have in students. The smaller classrooms help with direct learning."
Sophomore,5,"As a prospective intern in the Music Industry, I can say with confidence that LMU's campus and administration offers plenty of resources to succeed. Whether it be through employment opportunities at Mane Entertainment (an entertainment company on campus) or by way of the interview & resume preparations offered, LMU's atmosphere is ideal for students looking to make something of their college experience."
Freshman,5,"My freshman year experience at Loyola Marymount university was amazing. Academics were excellent, with teachers that taught me so much and got me hooked on the topics. Office hours were usually available, and teachers were. kind and supportive. Curriculum was great,  lots of interesting readings. The social life is great, people are very nice, friendly chill and supportive (for the most part).The party scene sucks (not that I care.) There are a bunch of cool clubs bars and beaches to go to, the location is great. The jesuit part isn't relevant unless you want it to be,  its really easy to be gay and jewish here. Campus is beautiful, only other downsides are that things on campus close a lot, the RA's are too strict, and there's no football team, but basketball games are fun. Also administration isn't great, I wish financial aid was better. And the food is mediocre. Also they close the front gates at night."
Senior,5,I am currently a senior at Loyola Marymount University and I am so grateful for all of the opportunities I have been given. I have made strong connections that have lead to internships. I strongly recommend this school if you love being in the center of Los Angeles (15 minutes from beach - 30 min from dtla) It really doesnt get better than this!
Niche User,5,"When had the opportunity to visit the LMU campus in the Spring of 2019, I fell in love with the school. The tour guides were warm and welcoming and enticed me with the mention of many programs I was interested in. I was so excited to learn about the Psychology major, and the opportunities to work in-depth with professors, as well as applying learning to contexts outside the classroom."
Niche User,5,Amazing campus with a lot of life. Variety of resources to use at the school with a strong academic curriculum.
Sophomore,5,Everybody is very friendly and the staff genuinely cares about the success of the students. It also doesn't hurt that the campus is maintained extremely well.
Sophomore,5,I absolutely fell in love with Loyola Marymount. I have been here for about 2 years now and I plan on staying here for two more. The campus is beautiful and the environment is very friendly.
Freshman,5,"The campus was gorgeous, my time was fantastic. I love the general vibe I felt when at this campus and my time could not have been better. I would recommend this school to anyone considering it"
Senior,5,"LMU School of Film and Television provided me a comprehensive film education that has prepared me for work in the professional industry. From famous directors, producers, sound editors, and more, the professors bring real-world experience and a support system to give you the greatest possible change to be successful."
Sophomore,5,"Loyola Marymount has been very helpful in the whole transfer process. I am currently transferring from El Camino Community College and going into LMU as a communication studies major. The whole transfer process has been quite nerve wrecking; however, Loyola Marymount's counselors have been a big help while also encouraging me as well as all the other students to do well and succeed."
Niche User,5,I am a senior in high school and recently visited Loyola marymount university. The campus was very beautiful and I loved the energy. The school is a little less than a mile so it is easy to get to class. The average class size is 20 so the professors will know you.
Niche User,5,"The campus is extraordinary. As I walked along campus, I had never felt so at home before. It's ratings for all of its programs are high and it's a big campus."
Freshman,5,En lo personal es la Universidad en la que siempre estoy interesado en estudiar y graduarme como Ingeniero mecanico y mas!
Freshman,5,LMU is an excellent college. It has a combination of strong academics with a variety of types of clubs to be a part of.  It gives off a real sense of community. And the professors are nice and really get to know you.
Senior,5,"This school is amazing, great location and great quality education. I loved my time at LMU! The school campus is gorgeous right on the bluff close to Santa Monica. Great education, loved all my professors!"
Niche User,5,"I toured Loyola Mary mount and I was amazed! I fell in love with the campus instantly, and couldn't seem to leave when the tour was over.  I toured the science building and saw the physical health and wellness wing and did not want to leave, it was so interesting to see them running tests and working together to find a common result."
Senior,5,I love the screenwriting program here. The professors are amazing and classes are designed to be like a writers' room. Being on the Division 1 Rowing team has also enhanced my experience here at LMU.
Freshman,5,"I have not yet attended, but I have been to multiple events and have seen the lifestyle they provide. I absolutely love the traditional college campus, but my favorite part is their resources. They truly integrate themselves into their students life in a positive way that shapes them into responsible young adults. I am beyond excited to attend this fall and would love for any kind of support financially to pursue a higher education."
Freshman,5,I love Loyola Marymount University! The adjustment from high school to college was really easy here and everyone was so welcoming and nice! I have made a lot of friends due to living in the dorms and from orientation and it is really easy to get involved on campus! I have found that the smaller class sizes are really helpful in getting more attention and all of my classes have been super rewarding.
Freshman,5,LMU has such a great campus and is in a great location. Social scene doesn't depend on greek life and most professors are really invested in each individual student's success.
Alum,5,"Despite the fact that this university was relatively small, it had plenty of opportunities for undergraduates to get involved- doing community service with my fellow undergrads was an invaluable experience."
Junior,5,A top-notch university that not only cares about a students academics but developing the person as a whole.
Freshman,5,"This university is something truly unique. There is such a sense of community here, and I honestly feel like I belong. I truly feel at home."
Junior,5,"It is an amazing school that fosters a sense of growth both academically and emotionally. The professors are easily accessible and promote a great environment for learning. I have nothing, but praise for LMU."
Alum,5,I think that it was a great place for those who are really passionate in furthering the world. I am personally interested in entreprenuership and loved the program they offered and had a great time looking at the hands on involvement they had for the program as well as the great location!
Junior,5,"I like the small, but active student body at LMU. The School of Film and Television has excellent faculty, resources, and location in Los Angeles is wonderful. I appreciate the Jesuit principles and code of ethics at LMU."
Niche User,5,"One of the most welcoming colleges ever ! Give you the truth about everything, gives many opportunities for visits and their tours are the best I've been to ! Faculty also very forward about private college costs and give options for students who have financial limitations !"
Freshman,5,I love the feeling of my campus. It is small but beautiful. Our academics are amazing. We are a diverse university and have a lot of fun.
Freshman,5,"This school has one of the best communities Ive ever seen, as soon as the first few weeks the campus begins to feel like a family. Best decision ive ever made!"
Niche User,5,I hope to be accepted here and learn a wide variety of academics with the amazing faculty and staff here!
Junior,5,I like being surrounded by focused and driven individuals like myself and the abundance of opportunities and connections in my area of study  I've gotten through the school.
Senior,5,"I love the school, because of the nature of the Jesuit education, and the diversity in student life, despite the size. However, size is not a drawback in academic settings because it affords the opportunity to allow for closer relationships with faculty. As a life sciences major, the LSB is one of the coolest buildings to be able to take advantage of. The only drawback is the cost of living in Los Angeles, but that is also an advantage for students in various disciplines."
Sophomore,5,"My first year at Loyola Marymount was rough at the beginning. I had just gone through a rough break-up, lost some family members and fell into a deep depression. I was all packed up and ready to go until a hall mate of mine convinced me to go to Student Psychological Services. It changed my life and I started to appreciate what I had surrounding me; genuine people that are there to help me. In the end, I am more than happy I did not leave first semester and pushed through the second to create unforgettable memories."
Junior,5,"I'm transferring in the fall but I was one campus twice and it was an amazing experience.  From the security that made me feel safe and the security guard who was so nice and informative since I was lost.  The counselors were so on top of it and had my schedule ready before I even had a chance to talk to her.  If felt the relief leave my body knowing I was in good hands.  The campus was beautiful, quite and tranquil.   Made me feel relaxed and calm which is good for me since I have a bit of anxiety. I recommend this school to everyone."
Sophomore,5,"I play softball at Loyola Marymount University. LMU has opened so many doors for me. This university has allowed me to meet life long friends. I love the faculty. It is easy to become apart of clubs and activities on campus. The people are freindly. The campus is very pretty. The food on campus is good, only go to comm table for the ice cream."
Alum,5,The professors are amazing and the class sizes are small. Overwhelming amount of clubs and organizations to get involved in. Five minutes from the beach and plenty of things to do over the weekend.
Alum,5,"I loved the community that students, staff and faculty helped create during my four years. What I hope to see change is the relationship that is had between students and advising faculty. From my experience I did not believe that my advisors within my department were as helpful as they could have been and I would hope that it improves over time in order to help clarify potential paths for students perusing specific career goals or unsure of what to pursues."
Niche User,5,The campus is beautiful and has some of the most amazing views. It is a relitively small campus but in my opinion it is one of the best campuses that i have ever visited.
Junior,5,"Loyola Marymount University excels in academics. The faculty here at LMU are extremely understanding, work with you to be successful, and because the class sizes are luckily so small, they care about each and every student. The campus is absolutely beautiful and there is a bluff overviewing all of Los Angeles to the ocean. LMU is located on the West side of LA, a perfect distance from Downtown  LA or Hollywood, and is very close to the beach.

LMU is a very expensive school and costs the average student, without aid, 60-65k. LMU is accommodating with their aid and I receive 35k in financial aid."
Junior,4,"Awesome school. Way too expensive for what you get though. On-campus food is absolutely horrendous. If you don't get a lot of scholarships, it's not worth it."
Junior,4,"I feel that the tuition is quite high, I know it is a private school but it is a lot of money for a college education.  The campus is really nice, with really clean and new facilities.  Most notable is the new dorms and the nice gym/recreation facility.  Most of the professors are really engaged and care about their students and want them to succeed.  The worst thing about this college is the food.  It is horrible  and expensive.  But after freshmen year, if you are lucky, you can get an apartment and cook your own food so that is good.  The price of housing is also really expensive in the Los Angeles area.  You have to know someone who is graduating and then get their house/apartment when they graduate.  The school is really convenient to the LAX airport of going home is easy.  The school also has a shuttle service to and from the airport so it is very convenient.  The shuttle also stops at some of the shopping malls and grocery stores in the areas."
Alum,4,"I did not intentionally take any classes online, however at the start of the pandemic the transition was very smooth. Most professors adapted well."
Senior,4,"Due to the smaller class sizes at LMU, transitioning to online classes was very easy. I still get the same amount of attention and learn the same materials as I would in person. However, there are just somethings that would be better in person like group projects."
Alum,4,"The mid-semester transition was tough for everybody, but the professors were able to quickly adapt their courses."
Sophomore,4,"beautiful campus situated on hill above city, suburbs go up the hills, very safe, food gets tiring very quickly but Whole Foods can be easily reached by LMU offered bus, expensive small town below hill"
Sophomore,4,Very small classes with one on one learning. Students and Professors are very motivated to educate the whole person.
Sophomore,4,"Due to Covid-19, I had to take the rest of my spring semester online. They adapted pretty well, but their were still some personal road bumps that needed to be dealt with."
Sophomore,4,"I love the community of the school. And their are many student organizations unique to the school that provide a place for everyone. Also, the location and campus are beautiful."
Alum,4,"It was different to have to learn online, but they did a good job of transitioning everyone over. None of my classes were supposed to be online, but due to COVID, they transferred everyone to online. I was still able to get my school work done and learn a lot to finish my major and graduate."
Alum,4,It is a really good school. I enjoyed the small class sizes and the easy access to a variety of resources.
Sophomore,4,"Online classes were a difficult shift for me personally, and I believe that most universities handled it as well as possible including LMU. Many of my teachers were extremely understanding of each students' circumstances, which was very appreciated."
Alum,4,I only had one class online and that was just a supplemental portion of a class so unfortunately I cannot comment too deeply on online courses here.
Freshman,4,WIth COVID-19 we weren't able to stay on campus and we switch to online classes. Although I was in a completely different state LMU still tried their best to make me and other students feel apart of the LMU community.
Freshman,4,"I loved everything about LMU. The community, students, staff and faculty. Everyone is so welcoming and caring. I found a lot of my classes to be quite difficult but I was easliy able to find people to help me."
Junior,4,"The vast majority of people at Loyola Marymount University are kind, positive, hard-working human beings.  Everyone I know has drive and passion for what they do, and I find that inspiring.  People form communities there where they can lift each other up and help each other achieve their dreams.  Being in Los Angeles, it is also a great place to go to college; there is so much to do and explore in the great city that surrounds us.  Also, L.A. provides endless of opportunities in every industry for aspiring members of the workforce.  The downside to Loyola Marymount University is that is can be very expensive; although scholarships and grants are available, the overall price tag is a consideration when choosing to commit to an institution like this one."
Freshman,4,"It is incredibly expensive and they definitely care about the money - the counselors I met with weren't entirely helpful, and the food in the main dining hall is not good. However, the people have been great and the resources are very good - there are always events going on to help students find jobs or meet with industry professionals to talk. The class sizes are always small so it's easy to get to know your professors and have a stronger relationship with them."
Senior,4,LMU is a very close knit community making it easy to become friends with professors and faculty. The faculty care about your success and are supportive of students. Small class sizes enhance learning and ability to connect with other students as well as professors. There are also tons of academic resources available to students and the bluff view is amazing!
Sophomore,4,"Very small class sizes, it is pretty easy to talk to professors. The small school size makes social groups very 'cliquey', and campus life is lacking due to the size. Quite a fun experience."
Sophomore,4,Overall I really enjoy Loyola Marymount. The campus is beautiful and the professors are great. The party scene isn’t as great as other schools but is still fun. My biggest complaint about the school is how expensive it is and that they don’t provide enough financial aid.
Sophomore,4,"The campus is wonderful. In the three semesters that I have been studying, I have yet to have a bad teacher. The food isn't the best but it's bearable. There is always something going on on campus which is nice."
Freshman,4,"Most teachers do not use our classroom portal, Brightspace, very effectively. This can make it more difficult as a student to stay up to date with grades and other assignments. There are also not many food options especially for anyone with any kind of allergy or disease, especially Celiac. Financial advisors cannot give very specific advice. However, the campus feels very safe, teachers are very accessible, and small class sizes facilitate the best learning."
Senior,4,"The calmness, cleanliness, and pure feel good spirit of this place makes LA look like Sodom and Gommorah. I am not a student here nor did I come here to find Jesus though it seems he can be found everywhere here I only came to study and have some pasta.

The campus layout and architecture gives you a feeling of a 1960's  bygone era experienced today's with today's technology and modernity. It feels like LA of 1970s back in the future.

Green grass and a clean environment makes you forget about global warming and a panda bear breaking the ice.

The cafeteria has a great selection. Especially their vegan stuff.

Magnificent library."
Graduate Student,4,"It is a beautiful school! Walking around campus and throughout the buildings makes you feel like you're at a top notch institution. Their recent rebranding was a total waste of money though..the old lion and letters were just fine, it really feels as though a graphic designer was hired that had experience doing graphics for elementary schools and such.
A lot of the graduate professors in the School of Education seem a bit novice, but eager to educate nonetheless."
Junior,4,The entire atmosphere and people at LMU are amazing. Everyone is very welcoming and the campus is gorgeous. Professors are great and truly want you to succeed. Only problem is how expensive it is.
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student. I entered Loyola Marymount University as a Sophomore from the University of Portland. I found the resources of LMU to exist but to be difficult to find. LMU has many programs and resources to enrich your college experience but you have to search and engage with them for them to engage with you. Its the fact that if you are looking for nothing, that is what you will find. However, the contrary is also true that if you are looking for something you will find it."
Freshman,4,The campus is really welcoming and feels easy to traverse. The science facilities are incredible and I can't wait to attend this upcoming Fall.
Junior,4,"LMU really tries hard to support its students: academically, emotionally, physically, and with future careers. The system of support is amazing - even from professors! Classes are small and intimate and events that take place several times a week help to cultivate community. The only down-side is the price... but it does pay for a great school!"
Freshman,4,Great school with amazing professors that tend to your needs. Beautiful Campus with lively students. Hard to get around without a car but only 3 miles away from the beach so that's a plus.
Freshman,4,"Overall my time at LMU has been great! I have had great professors who care about me and know who I am. The school is fairly expensive but provides a good amount of financial aide and opportunities for scholarships. The campus is beautiful, near the beach and LA. The food on campus is from SodeXo a bit expensive and not best quality but usually palatable. The athletics and party scene are ok they both are starting to resurge but people frequent UCLA or USC for parties. Despite this LMU is a great university to attend, you will receive a quality education here."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, I believe Loyola Marymount is a good school. There are so many things that can be done, whether it be cool events, community service, or even just classes. The school lives up to its Ignatian values, especially the one about ""education of the whole person"" because it is very easy to get involved in things outside of class that are just as fulfilling and useful as class. Now, it isn't perfect, like every school. The food isn't great overall, there are places on campus where you can get good food, but the main location isn't great. However, the school is located in a good location, near a lot of great food places, so going out to eat is always a good option. Another downside that I have experienced is that if you have any concerns with any of the offices, especially the Financial Aid or Housing offices, it can get really annoying really fast and fore this, I just recommend you go talk to them in person because email can be unreliable."
Niche User,4,"i loved the atmosphere it presented and the diversity as well. I love LA and the views that came long with the school, it was so soothing to watch the city. As for the campus itself seemed to fit me and i felt at home the first time i visited it."
Freshman,4,I would like to see more changes with muting racist and misogynistic white men on campus and implement more resources for the underrepresented students on campus who may or may not have the needs to pay for college fees.
Freshman,4,"As a student athlete, the student athlete community is a lot of fun to be a part of, even though it can be a bit exclusive at times. The food is sub-par at best, and the science department is much more difficult it feels than any other department. They try to weed people out first semester, but after that it's alright."
Freshman,4,I have really enjoyed LMU thus far. All of my professors have been amazingly helpful and actively engage with students both inside and outside of the classroom. The food is good and the people are very kind and welcoming.
Freshman,4,I really like the whole academic section of the university. The professors are amazing and they have excellent knowledge. The student life on campus is okay and I really wish there were more classes available when dealing with registration.
Graduate Student,4,"I like the beauty of the campus and the positive climate, students and organizations are very passionate and focused on success.
I feel like possibly changing the parking prices, they are a bit pricey."
Niche User,4,"Layola Marymount was a very big college. Everyone there does their own thing and looks like they focus on their studies and where they need to go. The campus is very clean and human friendly. They have places to eat there and gift shops where you can buy school merchandise. The library is huge, there were rows and rows of books all around the top floor. The inside of the meeting room is big and inside of that building is pretty cool, it's like a free and public place with nature all around it. The buildings inside are public-like which makes many feel comfortable like a known place and no feel home sick. Overall, it's a very sociable and community-like place where it seems like everyone is welcome."
Senior,4,"LMU has always felt like my home. The small classes, supportive and easy to talk to professors, and incredibly talented, driven students have made my experiences here amazing"
Freshman,4,Great experience so far! I have nothing to change :) The communication between the school and student is tremendous!
Sophomore,4,"After completing 1 year, I had an overall positive experience.Smaller classes+increased professor interaction worked in my benefit.Not usually a curve+you're not competing with other students.Labs+facilities are very nice.Cannot speak for other majors. Social/party scene:LMU is a little isolated. Closed off+not a part of the city like USC/UCLA.No Greek row,+the school in a residential neighborhood.All houses within the neighborhood,kind of far away.Usually get complaints from the neighbors+shut down early.You can go to USC/UCLA,not too far.In beginning of the year people go to USC game days. We’re next to LAX,beach,Santa Monica,Melrose,etc.Many go off campus on weekends.On-campus food:mediocre.You’ll get over it quick.Paid 4$ for a cup of cut strawberries.Get the cheapest meal plan!Housing: pretty nice,esp.newer dorm halls.Lived in Rosecrans,had a great time there.Got a huge triple w/ bathroom,made a lot of friends.Only ones you don't want are Huesman/Dudesman+Whelan."
Junior,4,"LMU is the place to be. Professors, counselors, advisors, and all other employees are very involved and helpful. Very grateful to be accepted to a wonderful university!"
Senior,4,"Loyola Marymount University is in a good location, theres lots of things to do outside of campus. The beach is 5 minutes from school, theres all kinds of restaurants that are near by, you're only 30-40 minutes (depending on traffic) away from Hollywood, and the view from the school's bluff is amazing. The academics at this school are for people who like small class sizes (20 - 30 people max) and want their professors to know them by a first name bases. If you're looking for a huge party scene this isn't the school. Yes, people throw parties here and there, and the Frats throw their parties too, but its not a huge party school to me. Again LMU is in a great location, UCLA and USC are very close so if you're looking for more parties you can always stop by those schools. For those of you who are 21 and older there are a lot of bars and clubs near by that are pretty fun too. Overall, LMU is a good school to attend and you will definitely meet some interesting people during your time here."
Senior,4,"My experience at Loyola Marymount University has been a great one for the most part. As a transfer student, it was tough adjusting at first. However, LMU has given me so many opportunities that I wouldn't have had without it. An amazing sorority full of friends, a trip to meet the owner of the Minnesota Vikings and tour their new stadium/facilities for a sport psychology class, as well as a study abroad summer program to Ghana."
Junior,4,"So far my experience was really good, the faculties and students really help me to be my best. The grounds are beautiful especially the green spaces and landscaping. There are diversity at the school and lot of group to choose from if you looking for a group to belong to."
Sophomore,4,I love LMU for its diversity and small classroom sizes because it allows you to make closer relationships with so many more people. I would like to see more advertisement of clubs and volunteer opportunities.
Graduate Student,4,"I have only been at Loyola for a little while, but from the second I stepped on campus I felt at home. The professors have a great knowledge of the subjects they teach and the campus itself is absolutely beautiful. It is on a bluff so you can see the marina on your left and the Los Angeles city skyline on your right. The view alone is a great reason to visit, but the academics and friendly atmosphere will keep you here."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus with great academics and caring professors. The food is barely average, though and I wish there were a greater variety of clubs."
Freshman,4,I love this school! There are many opportunities to get involved on campus. One thing I really like is its emphasis on social justice and service. There are 10 service organizations with different social justice issues focuses at LMU.
Freshman,4,"I like Loyola Marymount due to the fact that the location is central as it is not too far from the main attractions in Los Angeles. Despite this, one factor that can be improved is the staff as most of them seem to be hired for their research as opposed to their ability to be effective in their teaching. Even with this said, LMU is a great university with a very welcoming atmosphere where anyone can find their true place."
Freshman,4,"This university campus is beautiful! I've stopped by here on and off throughout the years, and now I have had a chance to come here and I have many friends who came here. Notably, many of my buddies that play basketball. This school is private and tuition is high, yes, but the quality is great. The facilities are clean, modern, and pleasing to the eye. The students here are pretty cool too. If you're looking for a private school, and want more of a quiet suburban feel, then LMU might be your place."
Sophomore,4,There is a great community of faculty and students at this school! I have loved being involved with the people because they are down to earth and very passionate.
Sophomore,4,"Loyola Marymount University is a great private university with a lot of opportunities to get involved with the student life, athletics, church, and service. Professors in some departments (especially math) are sub-par, however, philosophy, theater, and the hard sciences have excellent professors. Parties can be great but many are busted before the night can really come alive."
Freshman,4,I like the small class sizes because I feel that the learning and relationships with professors are a lot more intimate. I would love for there to be more diversity on campus.
Freshman,4,I am currently a freshman and love attending LMU. First semester can be hard to make friends but joining the many clubs and organizations on campus helps with that. There are only two dining halls so it is hard to eat at the same place every day. The classes are great and small number of students so the professors are able to get to know everyone in the class.
Senior,4,"At Loyola Marymount University I've been able to find myself as a writer. Throughout my journey at LMU I've had the pleasure of taking classes with instructors who were not only great at their craft, but had professional experience within their field. At LMU I've reignited my love for writing and literature, and have even had the pleasure of being featured in LMU's student publication La Miscellany, and have also received an award for ""Journalism Story of the Year, 2017."" Without my professors and LMU I would not have received these opportunities, nor would I have had the dedication to meet them head on."
Niche User,4,"What I found interesting about Loyola Marymount University was how classy it was. It made you feel at home, they made you feel wanted. I liked it because it's not too far from where I grew up.If you get homesick and you live in California I would really suggest lmu they respect there campus it's very clean and they have a lot to offer."
Junior,4,I love the small class sizes and availability to get help from professors. Everyone wants to see you succeed. Campus provides a lot of opportunities to get involved in tons of different things.
Junior,4,Great school. Everyone here is very friendly. Most of the professors are kind and fair but many are also stern at times. Great place to meet people from all walks of life. There are many opportunities to get involved in student life and campus activities.
Niche User,4,Went to visit on a school field trip looked nice had a good library. There was a good amount of diversity in the school student base.
Freshman,2,"Some good professors, that’s about it. Classes are soooo easy, classmates are dumb because they don’t care. The community is so unmotivated towards growth and success, honestly appalling. Grinded here, worked with professors, was judged for it, all good. Transferred to a much better rigorous school."
Junior,2,"Online learning has been a difficult transition, but I believe that to be applicable to every university (not just Loyola Marymount University, but including Loyola Marymount University).  Having been trained my entire life to go to class in person, I found it much harder to be in a learning environment that I did not face with my peers or professors in person.  It felt much more isolating to learn online, because it makes everyone feel as though now they have to learn everything by themselves, regardless of the resources put forth by the professor.  Because online learning was also new for my professors, I found that a few of them also struggled to adjust, which made their lesson plans as well as the required assignments a little less clear.  Because of this, there were times when myself nor my other classmates knew what we were supposed to be learning or what was expected of us from an assignment submission standpoint."
Freshman,2,"I applied to communications studies on the basis of it being a media-based program. The school sold it as such, so I decided to commit. I found out after the fact that this program is theory-based, basically making it sociology. This school has lied about so many things. They ""guarantee"" housing for 2 years, but this year they decided to give the best buildings to upperclassmen, taking away housing from half the sophomore class, forcing them to scramble for apartments off-campus. They lied about sorority and fraternity life being different here when it is completely focused on looks, not personality. Tour guides lie constantly, especially about the quality of food here. There are at least three cases of food poisoning every day. If you're on the fence, don't come here. They say kids transfer out fast for a reason. You'll be happy here if you're a rich white girl who likes to spend their parent's money on weekends. If you're anything else, pick a different school. TRUST ME."
Senior,2,"Where LMU has a good legacy and academic/career resources, they lack an understanding of student life that leaves many students feeling as if the university doesn't care. Every year more and more students are admitted without space to properly accommodate them. There are continuous cases of food poisoning. Their Student Psychological Services is unequipped to handle anything beyond an episodic depressive episode and it can take up to 3 weeks to be seen for a single appointment. So while academics at LMU may be rigorous, and the career services beyond graduation phenomenal, being an on-campus student is becoming increasingly unpleasant."
College Junior,2,"Breeding ground for douche bags. First hand experience that ""Brotherhood"" means nothing when you're own well-being is on the line."
College Junior,2,Lackluster support. I never know when events are and tailgates are non-existent.
College Sophomore,2,They are not as sensitive about the issue as they could be.
College Sophomore,2,It's typical dorm life but I feel ripped off because it's incredibly expensive.
College Sophomore,2,over priced for what you get. go off campus
College Freshman,2,"Greek Life is meant to be a brother or sisterhood with those you share commonalities with, who you can relate to on various levels.  The lack of ethnic diversity at LMU manifests itself as having ZERO Greek Fraternities/Sororities that represent anything other than Caucasians.  Basically, non-whites are excluded from being able to have the experience of Greek life that they might want to have.  I personally would love to pledge AKA but unfortunately there are no African American Sororities at my school."
College Freshman,2,Not always the most helpful teachers
College Freshman,2,Not too big at the school
College Freshman,2,"Very unsocial and not everyone is friendly. However, view and location is very nice."
Recent Alumnus,2,Greek life is for te person that is wealthy and likes to have fun.
College Sophomore,2,"I have heard HORRIBLE stories from friends of mine about the health and safety services offered on campus. Workers have been said to be rude, racist and insensitive when dealing with students seeking help."
College Sophomore,2,"I have an issue with LMU's greek life because there are ZERO organizations that represent the values and traditions of Black Men and Women. I think greek life is really just an organization for people to socialize and I personally see no value in joining them.  The organizations are 90% White and make it very difficult for Black students to join. LMU needs to get Divine Nine chapters on campus, ASAP."
College Freshman,2,"The fraternities and sororities are not very present on campus, since their houses are off-campus, and so they do not have a large presence or effect on our campus life. There is no Greek housing. Non-Greeks don't care about Greek life, especially since there are not many people involved in it."
College Sophomore,2,"Could be more options, especially for dietary restrictions"
College Freshman,2,"If you like parties that get cut short because of a visit from the LAPD, then LMU is the school for you. 

Honestly though, frats and sports teams throw the majority of the parties, and they are pretty tame. Since Westchester is a family area, the parties tend to be short or quiet (and maybe both!). There aren't a lot of on-campus events like parties that are well attended on the weekends that are comparable. 

I think the party scene divides the student body. Greeks host parties, and service orgs host parties, but they don't really mix. A lot of the ""party scene"" takes place in the dorms."
College Freshman,2,"It gets repetitive. It can be hard to be healthy. I feel like I eat a lot of snacky foods like granola bars and call it a meal. The best part about food on campus is the convenience stores on campus that accept meal plan money. Even though the prices are jacked up ($6 for a box of cereal!) it's a good option. Did I mention it gets repetitive? 

Iggy's and WoW are both horrendous. I've gotten flies or hair in my food multiple times. The quality of produce can be poor- bruised bananas, dry apples, sour grapes, mushy strawberries, and there's a general lack of vegetables. 

It's definitely gotten better. They re-did the Asian station and made it more customizable.

Did I mention it gets repetitive?"
College Sophomore,2,Typical housing. Just watch out for random assignments. Especially if you apply late you might end up with someone that forced their roommate out because they were a nutjob
College Sophomore,2,Only athletes themselves wear LMU gear. Just look around when you visit. There is no school spirit. No football team. And we have basketball but no one really goes. No crazy tailgating of that sort. Not your school if you were looking for school pride of some sort.
College Sophomore,2,Nothing really accessible without a car. Nothing but a KFC and Taco Bell. There's an in n out a little ways out
College Freshman,2,They are strict about noise but it's okay
College Junior,2,There aren't many scholarships for International students. I realised that after coming here from India
College Junior,2,"At LMU there are not any grants available for graduates students. Some departments have scholarships that they give away and they disperse the money until they run out, however it is not fair because some students get admitted before others and have a better chance to win the money. When I was admitted they were almost out of the scholarship money. LMU only offers loans for financial aid, and if a student is interested in grants and other scholarships, the students has to research and get it on his/her own. The only tip I would give, would be for each student to stay on top of their bills, and really research the options- if you don't get aid--don't give up!"
College Sophomore,2,They just kind of suck.
College Junior,2,"The lottery process makes it risky for older students. Also, the housing is old and outdated except for a few token Freshmen dorms. The price for housing is about 13,000 give or take so if you can afford to live off campus and commute, do it."
College Junior,2,Try to see if you can get all the paperwork you need at once instead of waiting for them to approve it piece by piece. Otherwise you'll have to wait days just for one task to be completed.
College Sophomore,2,"There are a limited number of places to buy food at LMU. There are two main cafeterias, one of which closes at 3 pm everyday. Because of this, the other main cafeteria gets unbelievably crowded and the buffet areas become quite messy. The food all tastes the same. There are a few restaurants- two fast food restaurants that take forever. They lack in food quality and it feels like a big waste of money. If you want to eat healthy, all you have to eat are salads and fruit."
College Junior,2,"My school is a private school and due to the high cost of attendance, there is a certain economic status that makes up the majority of students."
College Senior,2,Ridiculously expensive or poor value and questionable safety.
Recent Alumnus,2,"As a Catholic institution, LMU attracts a certain kind of background for its students.  With the high price tag, that background is slimmed down further.  Due to lack of open tolerance for LGBT students (until recently) this group may have also been driven away from the school, though there is an active presence on-campus."
College Freshman,2,"I haven't been happy with my LMU experience. I'm planning on transferring following the end of my first year. Classes are poorly taught, many students are spoiled and self-centered, and the school spirit is non-existent. It's definitely not worth the huge price tag."
College Freshman,2,"I was very disappointed with my financial aid award. I received much more aid from comparable schools (Gonzaga, USD)."
College Freshman,2,"Almost everyone drinks, and if you don't then you will feel left out. If you don't like to party, you probably won't like it here."
College Freshman,2,"Most professors are often knowledgeable but don't know how to teach very well. There is the occasional diamond in the rough, but most classes are poorly run and uninteresting."
College Freshman,2,"If you don't have a car, Zipcar is your best bet."
College Junior,2,"It's very difficult for students to take pride in the school's athletics. However, students still attend the games are do get involved with the sports"
College Freshman,2,"I dont really know anyone who takes the bus. If you live close, you can bike to campus (if you dont have to go up the giant hill). Other than that, if you don't have a car, youre pretty much stuck on campus. That is, unless you want to shell out lots of money for taxis/uber."
College Junior,2,"There is no school spirit!!!! I don't even know if we have a lot of fans left. It is very sad we don't have a football team, but that just means we should support our basketball team a lot more! Students don't really pay attention to sports, because there is so much going on at the same time."
College Junior,2,There is no on-campus nightlife.
College Sophomore,2,They are very strict on parking and the parking tickets are expensive.
College Junior,2,It is not a matter of them doing their job it is the excessive power they feel over this campus and over the students. We do not have campus police we have security guards with not as much power as actual police on other campuses and they feel just as entitled as any cop and they do't have laws or the constitution behind them for the way that they treat certain groups of student s on campus.
College Freshman,2,"The price is ridiculous, and it is really hard to find a park in anything but the side lot of the Freshmen parking lot. (Which is completely isolated). Public Safety continually enforces insane policies and tickets. "
College Senior,2,"The school simply does not provide enough financial aid. Based on my parents' income my sister received ten times more aid at her private college than I did at LMU. LMU is a top notch school, with a price tag to match that, their financial aid is pretty abominable. I have loved the school, but after I lost the Cal Grant when the laws changed after my freshman year the school did nothing to help compensate for that loss, even though it amounted to almost $30,000 more than we had anticipated paying. Everything is by the book and I rarely have felt as if anyone in the financial aid department cared. Same thing for the screen writing department when I asked if there were any special scholarships in my major. I emailed three people about this and not one of them responded to me. I also had a friend who had a much lower GPA in high school, and NO extracurriculars, and he got a $15,000 leadership scholarship, which makes no sense. How is this determined?"
College Senior,2,"While the housing is clean, all the housing is very small and cramped. The apartments are the worst, very small living area for four people and yet over $1000 a month in rent per person. "
College Freshman,2,"Ridiculous tickets given, over-priced, crowded"
College Sophomore,2,"For students to stay on campus, Loyola Marymount asks for way to much money.  The housing prices are crazy. I lived on campus my freshmen year, which was very beneficial as far as being a part of campus-life, getting active, and going to the library when I needed or wanted too.  However, because housing is so expensive I am not going to be able to live on campus again my sophomore year, which is unfortunate. I pray that having to commute does not affect my desire to go to school. I have seen it in some of my high school friends already, who commute to their schools."
College Sophomore,2,"Food at LMU is extremely overpriced, and the quality is only average. I have heard people getting food poisoning various times. Dining hall hours are also very inconvenient, and its sometimes impossible to find a healthy meal on campus past 8'oclock, as the main dining halls close."
College Junior,2,I heard that the facilities were pretty good however I would not know because you cannot enter the building without a paid membership which is pricey.
College Junior,2,Campus housing do not include any A.C. or updated appliances.
College Sophomore,2,"If your looking to enjoy weekend tailgates and painting your whole body school colors, don't look toward LMU. Students don't attend many athletic events except basketball. There seems to be a lack of athletic enthusiasm, yet there is a few games/rivalries people really get excited about. However, the facilities, the gym specifically, is well equipped with an olympic sized pool, fitness classes, personal trainers, fairly new work out equipment and indoor basketball court and make it enjoyable to work out."
College Senior,2,"LMU has very little parking available on campus, making students who live off campus have to arrive an hour before their classes just to find a spot.  In Spring 2013, our school added parking passes for all faculty, students, and visitors due to the remodel of Seaver College of Science and Engineering. Not only is it hard to find parking, but we also now have to pay over $300 a semester."
College Freshman,2,"the food gets old VERY quickly, and a lot of the places are closed during the weekend. they charge too much, the workers are rude, sodexo is a terrible supplier"
College Junior,2,"I wasn't happy with the financial aid that I received.  My dad makes enough to keep us happy and making a living, but that doesn't mean we're rich.  We're still middle class and LMU didn't really offer me much because of that, but it's so expensive here that I don't think that's fair."
College Freshman,2,"The counselor/department is TERRIBLE. They won't help you and are kinda mean. The general business classes are terrible and causes alot of people to change majors, but i here it gets better."
College Freshman,2,"The only sporting event anyone ever goes to is basketball, and we were terrible this year. All the sports are Division 1 though."
College Freshman,2,"As a commuter student, I was hoping for some leniency when it came to parking restrictions. I personally think it was unfair to have to pay a semesterly permit of $300+, especially since commuters are limited to just a few parking areas that are already overly-crowded with cars belonging to students living on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"P-safe is pretty strict about on campus drinking.  If you want to party, lave campus!"
Junior,1,Its even worse online bro. Like my god. Except for organic chemistry. They have their stuff together. And maybe cell function. But really teaching this semester bc of corona they forgot that peoples lives are changed because of corona. Like im now being quizzed on content they haven't taught us yet. 2 hour lectures outside of class only to go in class on zoom to sit in breakout rooms which we all know how those are. SAVE YOUR MONEY
Niche User,1,"Administration covers up all drug and alcohol offenses by students, even when students are underage. Students providing alcohol to minors receive a fine and are allowed to remain on campus. As a parent, this is 100% unacceptable."
Freshman,1,the academics are not challenging at all. I would dread going to class because the work was so simple and felt like I wasting my parents’ money on elementary school things. Everyone in my classes would complain excessively  if we had to write a little paper. You basically need a car to do anything fun but the permits to park are so expensive and I almost spent $1000 on lyft’s my time at lmu. It’s fun going to Hollywood or DTLA but you have to account for Uber costs and then whatever you’ll spend going out. It’s frustrating.There is rly no party scene. Everyone here just seems to want to live the LA lifestyle and don’t rly care about school. There’s basically one dining hall bc the other one has weird short hours and is closed on the weekend. The dining hall has no variety and after a week you’re over all the limited options. I got sick almost 10 times from the food. I was so excited to come here from the Midwest but I’m very disappointed.
Sophomore,1,"Rich kids school full of self absorbed materialistic individuals - just cruise the parking lot and see all the range rovers, Mercedes....  Worse is the school - often can't get into required classes - school response is just plan on doing a fifth year!  Faculty is full of inept, don't care, and can barely speak English professors.  They over fill the dorms every year and by junior year you are on your own to find housing.  This is not a ""catholic"" school its a FOR PROFIT ENTITY making it big off of California's rich kids who can't get into the UC system.  STAY AWAY"
Sophomore,1,"Take it from someone who is transferring, if you want any sort of traditional college experience, a cohesive/friendly/school spirited student body, love sports, or think Conservatively in any way, save your parents the 67k and go somewhere else... There are a lot of international students, but almost everybody comes from the Bay Area/Southern California so diversity in background and thought is nonexistent compared to other schools. If you're not an artsy rich white Liberal stoner here, GOOD LUCK."
Freshman,1,"LMU has to be the worst college this side of the United States. The course work is an entire joke as well as the staff. Every time there is a college tour I am amazed at how many lies are told, blatantly. No one is here to learn, it seems like the majority of people are here to live the LA lifestyle comfortably without putting emphasis on education. This school is a moshposh of the most mediocre students across the nation with the most average scores who do not care about education. The racial tensions at this school have been at an all time high. There is no such thing as racial unity on campus. The campus is a 24/7 dead zone, no one is ever here because they are constantly flocking to USC where there are actual fun activities going on. It is best that you go to JC and not waste the $60k on these simple classes, and wait it out until you are able to go to a school that is actually worth the money."
Freshman,1,"Do not apply to LMU if you intend to have a ""traditional"" college experience. There are no football games, school spirit/color wearing, traditional greek houses, etc. It is also very small so you will bump into everyone you know here, even if its just to walk to your car. If you enjoy small class sizes, are super indie/artsy, are really into engineering, are a stoner who isn't too into the party/social scene, then this is the school for you. The view here is to die for and the location is great. The people here are extremely rich, preppy, and well dressed (even on finals week). Many girls here have lip/nose jobs, super noticeable fake tans, and Goyard totes. If you have unlimited cash and enjoy ""keeping up with the jones'"" this is the school for you!"
Senior,1,"This review is for the communications school to be specific.

I was super excited coming into LMU, and before I started, everyone at the school seemed to genuinely care. Once the semester began, that all changed. The advisement here is a joke. My advisor never knows anything, and has given me the wrong advice multiple times. Be careful, if you don't do your own research, you will not graduate based on what they tell you. Thankfully I questioned everything my advisor told me. They are also completely unsupportive of students' internship schedules, and do not want them to succeed outside of school. There was just one class I needed to fit my schedule, but needed an override for, and they wouldn't do it. They wanted me to drop out of a paid internship that I had already accepted and was going to start soon. Weird considering I represent the school as a student."
College Junior,1,Too many affluent kids living in a bubble. Dining choices are poor. Everything is overpriced. The golf carts buzzing around are really distracting. It's too much like a resort. Not really my style.
College Sophomore,1,"As an Asian American male on campus, I can attest to the racism here, both indirect and direct. I have talked with my therapist at Student Psychological Services on campus. She used to work at other college campus and she told me how there is nothing like LMU in the country. It is such a unique school. On the surface, you think everything is perfect. I fell for it on my campus tour. It is a hostile environment and I have felt threatened because of my identity. Going to this school has made me more conscious of my racial identity. It's like looking through muddy water when it should be clear. You can't really describe it but you know something is there. I come from a city that is mostly white, so I'm used to being around lots of white people but it is different here. I have felt victimized. Racism is a topic that is thrown under the rug at this school. If you do not fall within the affluent and white category, please seriously consider if this school is a good fit for you. It certainly wasn't for me. And I am glad that I am transferring."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life at LMU is unfortunately a joke. There is no frat row like at other big schools like USC and UCLA. Trust me, you need a frat row. Don't think you can easily party hop across the neighborhood. The top fraternities tend to be hard to get into, especially if you're not white. Typically the whitewashed kids get in easily. If you don't think you can get into a fraternity here you will have no party life. You'll have to settle with other friends who don't party and/or try to have lame dorm parties. Bottom line: it will be difficult to have good weekends here if you're a party-goer type and do not fit into the ""rich/white"" category that defines a typical LMU student. (Like most schools, girls can get into frat parties anytime. It's only the guys that will really need to make friends in greek life or go gree themselves - easier said than done)"
College Junior,1,"You don't feel a presence of Greek Life at all, especially different ethnic sororities and fraternities."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is pretty awful.  From what I understand, the fees are modest compared to the UCs, but considering the difference in tuition fees, it's pretty bad.  Put on top of that the neighbourhood around the school is becoming more and more anti-LMU by the day and it becomes frustrating."
College Junior,1,"I didn't get any help!!! I am one of the ones in the category of ""too rich for financial aid, too poor for college,"" so my past 3 years have all been on loans! I don't think I can even do one more year at LMU because we're already in debt, and I want my sisters to be able to go to college. I love LMU, but I am currently looking at transferring because of the lack of financial aid."
College Senior,1,"As far as I know, there is no campus transportation. Also, this year they started charging students to park on campus. I understand the need for this, but we went from $0 to almost $700 for the year. I think this fee should have been prorated for the students. New students could pay the full price, sophomores a little less, then less for juniors and seniors the least. It was a big addition all at once."
College Junior,1,"There is no spirit, fun, or open minds. Most kids are arrogant, rude, and close minded and fake. I had a very hard time making friends with genuine people. Class discussions even suffer from this, the kids are afraid and inexperienced."
College Sophomore,1,"There are many computers on campus, especially in the library. But the wireless service is absolutely horrible. It is every difficult to complete tasks when using a personal computer in relation to wifi"
College Sophomore,1,"Very stingy with scholarships and aid, and will put your account on hold so you can't register for classes etc. if you are even a day late on a payment."
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is terrible. There will be times when you cannot get a spot in your designated sector so you are forced to park in a different sector and end up getting a ticket.
College Freshman,1,"Finding parking on campus isn't an issue, but that's probably because of the $300+ fee of a parking permit."

Sophomore,5,"Albany College of Pharmacy has really been beneficial for me. Some courses may be hard, but professors are always open to meet with you to discuss material outside of class. The campus is beautiful and the people are really nice. There are also a number of resources at the school such as the peer tutoring program as well as the writing center both of which are made by appointment and helped me boost my grades last year."
Sophomore,5,"Prepares you for the future and gives a lot of opportunities for work, internships, and involvement."
Senior,5,"Before coming to ACPHS I was initially worried that I would not enjoy my experience here as much as my other friends who were going to various liberal arts schools. Now three years in I'm so glad this is the decision I made. ACPHS's tight-knit community, dedicated professors & staff, and overall values have far exceeded my expectations. Everything here is very student-oriented, and even though the curriculum is tough, they make it so you have plenty of opportunities to find help and succeed. I've made so many friends in the various clubs and organizations available on campus, and between these and other events held, I never felt like I was missing out on the traditional ""college experience"". It is an amazing school and I would highly recommend any student looking into a healthcare career look at ACPHS."
Sophomore,5,"ACPHS is a small college that gives me so many great opportunities. I made real connections with my peers and college staff as well. I love being involved on campus and staying active throughout the day.  Since ACPHS has 40  clubs and professional organizations, there is always an opportunity for students to get involved. As the ACPHS community grows, the college grows as well. Planning multiple college renovations makes ACPHS look very modern and more interesting for incoming students. Throughout my struggles during the first year I was never afraid to ask for help from peer tutors and my peer mentor. So many helpful resources made me successfully progress into second year of pre-PharmD program and now I can help students be successful as well."
Sophomore,5,I am currently during hybrid (On campus with couple online lectures) and I really like this new set up. It puts more responsibility on me for staying on top of my work but it makes it safer for everyone on campus. I rely on my time management a lot as well as on my Outlook calendar to stay active and not miss any classes/meetings
Junior,5,I am a current student at ACPHS and I am grateful for the attentive staff and learning experiences that I have had. The campus is beautiful and there are so many clubs and activities on a weekly basis that it helps to ease the feeling of homesickness that students often get in the first few weeks away from home. Amazing professors and an overall great college experience.
Freshman,5,This school is perfect for me! Very small and focused on their students and always doing what is in their students best interest! I feel right at home.
Niche User,5,"I visited the college at an Open House. I really enjoyed the visit and how well organized and planned it was. Also, the choices the college gave the student such as creating your own schedule for the mini sessions which included all the programs. Besides the programs, there was mini information sessions that were helpful such as the ""Admissions and Financial Aid"", which gave an idea to the students and the parents about the cost."
Sophomore,5,"ACPHS is a great college with an even better community of professors and students. The professors truly want you to succeed and are always willing to help a student who asks. The dorms are really nice and modern which make for a very comfortable living environment. I never feel unsafe on campus because everywhere you look there is a public safety officer. The food on campus is very diverse and even includes an ice cream and topping bar. The class sizes are small which makes it really easy to ask questions and get help from professors. The small class sizes also make it easy to make connections with professors and faculty that will help advance your career in the future. We donâ€™t really have huge athletic events on campus due to our focus on education and career preparation. Overall, ACPHS has been an amazing place to spend the last two years of my life and I look forward to many more."
Sophomore,5,"ACPHS prepares students not only academically, but also personally and professionally. This school provides that knowledge that you need to succeed in any future career. Although the workload is rigorous, we are taught to manage our time to finish everything and still have room to enjoy college. Because it is a small school, the student-to-faculty ratio is perfect and allows students to reach out for help whenever it is needed. Everyone is extremely friendly and it is overall, a great community to be in."
Senior,5,"ACPHS has always been my dream school since I was young. Although I started college as an engineering student I quickly saw that my passion lies within science and pharmacy was the path I took. ACPHS has opened many doors of opportunity for me to become the pharmacist I will one day be. As you have probably read the curriculum is intensive and time demanding but that doesn't mean you can't do it, it just means you have to put in the work and the effort to achieve your goal. The professors are very helpful most of them have open door policy they are always ready to help. We also have peer tutoring and professional tutoring so you can always get help via any of these avenues. In terms of activities outside of campus that solely depend on what your interest lies. There are off campus community activities that students are involve in but you have to look into it. I love ACPHS and I believe I choose the right school for me because ACPHS education will get me to where I want to be"
Freshman,5,The atmosphere here at ACPHS is truly inspiring. The faculty and staff are always willing to accommodate students in whatever ways they can. The on-campus environment is safe and comfortable. A great school for a health care major!
Niche User,5,"Great people, everyone is willing to help. Awesome food and fantastic programs. I enjoyed my time visiting and can't wait to attend. Their programs are really great and the scene is wonderful. The location is very nice and the dorms are absolutely perfect. The campus is small, which is perfect for easily getting around. I felt very safe while visiting and it is a very friendly neighborhood. I definitely recommend checking it out, the advisors are great to talk with and work hard to help with the application process."
Senior,5,"I am in my fourth year here at ACPHS and I have enjoyed my entire experience since being here. The school is small, which is nice because professors know who you are. It is easy to get involved and there is a great professional scene."
Sophomore,5,This school is amazing for anyone interested in pursuing a career in healthcare.  It has a very tight-knit community.
Freshman,5,"I am a first-year student here at Albany College of Pharmacy. Originally, I did not like it here and I was extremely homesick. However, as the year progressed I became very good friends with all of the other students. All of the staff and students here are so friendly. The campus is such a positive and welcoming environment."
Sophomore,5,"Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is an academic heavy school. It prides itself on preparing students for furthering their education and being successful. The faculty is great and everyone wants you to suceed. Although it is not easy, it is worth it!"
Junior,5,"I can honestly say there is no other school for me.  ACPHS is a family. Do we hate it sometimes? Of course, but there is a love for it too. The college is extremely difficult, but the student body is extremely supportive. It is awesome to have faculty recognize my face and know my name. You are not a number here. If you want a leadership opportunity this is a place for you! All you have to do is reach out to faculty and they will help you become a campus leader. It is easy to see why this place has a good reputation in the community. Just be warned, your experience here will not be like your friends. We do not have a big college campus, there are not a million clubs or even a ton of Greek Life. You will have to study often and hard. Not going to sugar coat it, academics are tough. However, you are given opportunities to succeed so take advantage of all resources and you will be fine!"
Senior,5,"ACPHS is a great school for students who are goal-oriented and who are willing to work hard to reach their their goal. The school provides many resources/services to help students succeed, and professors are very helpful and always willing to take the time to meet with students outside of the designated class time to provide them with the help needed. Despite the rigorous program(s), the school provides many opportunities to stay involved and maintain a balanced student life!"
Sophomore,5,"ACPHS is a wonderful school that has really developed into my home; the small school makes for a great sense of community, the rigorous course work challenges us every day, and the people you meet and the friendships you make here are so amazing. The student to faculty ratio makes it so easy to get help whenever needed; the professors here really seem to care about their students and want to see every student succeed. Although small, the campus is beautiful, especially at this time of year! The surrounding Albany area has tons to do- there are great restaurants, places to shop, festivals, and more. The food on campus could use some work, but since there are so many restaurants in the area, it's easy to get a break from ""cafeteria food"" and get something different. The dorms here are very spacious and far above the average dorm at a typical college. Overall, if you're looking for a small school with specialized, rigorous science and health programs , ACPHS is the school for you."
Sophomore,5,"I have had a great experience thus far at Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. It is very easy to get involved, and there is a good balance between academic and social life."
Sophomore,5,"I'm a second year international student at ACPHS, there is always something fun going on campus. The professors are super friendly and have flexible office hours for students to pass by and ask  questions. Try to be involved in clubs/ sports on campus in order to make friends and get involved. Being an international student far away from home, I was very glad that I picked ACPHS, a school that is diverse ,and welcomes students to their next 4/6 years of your life with open arms."
College Student,5,"we have to have internships and although I haven't had one yet, people I know have talked very highly of them"
College Student,5,My career goal is to be work as a pharmacist. I don't have any concerns about finding a job. I would go to ACPHS again if I had to do it all over again.
College Student,5,Have great computers in the library that is very useful along with the printers.
College Student,5,"Our girls basketball team won national championships and we have a really good cross country, soccer, and boys basketball team too."
College Student,5,ACP is such a great community feel! There are so many social opportunities and the administration encourages students to be active.
College Student,5,The Global Experience opportunities are amazing and growing every year!!
College Student,5,Everyone is very friendly and always willing to help a fellow student who looks a bit lost! It is a small quiet campus full of open honest people.
College Student,5,Everyone is very accepting towards others and gets along great
College Student,5,Parking is really close to everything and convenient
College Junior,5,Can have a can on campus starting your freshman year. Can use the CDTA Bus system for free with your ID card.
College Sophomore,5,very diverse and so many to choose from. students are all welcome to try any sports. trainers are all good and they all make sure that the practice schedule will not conflict with academics.
College Student,5,The program is very focused on just what you need to know for your degree. I enjoy it because it is very interesting. It may be a lot of work but due to the small number of students in the program it is easy to get a good relationship with the facualty.
College Student,5,Parking is great. There is always spots for the people living at the dorm and the commuters.
College Student,5,"Transportation is great. Most students have their cars but there is a bus, taxis and the amtrack is very close to the school."
College Student,5,"Public Safety is great. There is always a number to call if there is a problem. Also, around campus there are buttons to press if a person feels threatened."
College Student,5,I absolutely love my school. I love the dorms for the 1st year and 2nd year students. The student center is beautiful and easy to get to.
College Student,5,No problems.  Once incident on campus and was notified immediately
College Senior,5,"I have never worried about walking alone on campus alone at night. There is a health center right next to campus, although you have to pay for your own visits through your own insurance unless you buy insurance from the school which is painfully expensive."
Sophomore,4,"This semester all of my classes are online. Some professors have made the material and exams harder because of it to avoid cheating, however, it has not made the class itself easier either. Other professors understand how online learning shouldn't change the difficulty of the class and have kept the level the same. Labs have been easier than they would be in-person, however, because it is online, the individual labs that take place each week is worth a lot more than it would be in-person."
Sophomore,4,"Some classes are made to be more difficult online and it costs your GPA, but professors are easy to contact."
Senior,4,"Luckily, before the pandemic hit and everything was virtual,  ACPHS was already using the Zoom platform to record lectures and other videos. I believe this really helped the transition from in person instruction to online instruction go so much smoother. While being online isn't ideal for anyone, ACPHS professors and staff have handled it really well and managed to stay organized and on-task."
Sophomore,4,"Due to moving online, all of my professors have been very good at reminding students of deadlines, sending out the zoom links on time, and are understanding if a technical difficulty occurs."
Sophomore,4,Overall ACP is a great place to be at. All of the students here are driven like me and care about their academics. The professors are all very willing to help if needed and ACP has a lot to offer.
Junior,4,"The online learning experience is not the same as the in person learning experience, but it is still better than expected. The professors have weekly office hours via zoom and open discussion boards to encourage participation and questions."
Alum,4,"A small, tight-knit school. Very rigorous programs with tons of opportunities for growth and professional and academic advancement. If you're looking for a rigorous school that's not impossible to get into, ACPHS is for you. Most well known for the accelerated pharmacy program, they also offer degrees like MIcrobiology and Public Health. I was a Micro student. They have a good library, decent parking, great campus housing (especially for upperclassmen) and I always felt safe on campus. Lots of opportunities for lab work. Overall good professors, especially for freshmen. Food is pretty good, lots of options and lots of places to get food nearby. Not a party school. Like any college, there is a little partying (mostly after finals), people on the whole take their college experience here very seriously. So it's good if you're a no-nonsense student."
Freshman,4,"Its a good school. The teachers are kid and proficient in their subjects and there is a lot of emphasis put on being focused on school and studying. As well, the students are, in general, cool and kind. There is not really anything I'd change regarding the school."
Niche User,4,"When I first visited ACPHS, I did not care for the university at all. I disliked the campus, the rooms, the laboratories, and the academics. However, ever since I matured and became more serious about my medical career, ACPHS was the first place I turned to. I figured out ACPHS has an extensive six-year pharmacy program with several out of state universities like Castleton University in Vermont. It also has various duel degree programs with direct entry into various programs. Including PA school at AMC, JD at Albany Law, DO/MD schools, and the MS/PharmD here. Best of all, the small size of the school - it is an advantage when getting to know faculty and making friends. I think a student looking to pursue a healthcare profession should really consider making a trip to this top-notch university"
Freshman,4,"I love the academics and staff here, but I donâ€™t feel like I fit in with others students. The classes can be a little much at times, but it is definitely worth it to get your doctor of pharmacy degree in 5-6 years."
Sophomore,4,"The education is top notch but there is no messing around at this school. You have to be driven to succeed and thus not let any common distraction get in the way or else you won't keep up. 
The school is a very small community where you will be welcomed immediately and its quite easy to make friends on campus. Located in the middle of Albany, there is plenty to do such as go to the mall or go to the many parks or eat at one of many restaurants."
Freshman,4,"Being a student at Albany college of Pharmacy and Health sciences so far has been an overall pleasant experience  the cost is reasonable for the education and the perks of being at this college. If you're interested in Sports, Greek life, or partying then this is not a school for you."
Junior,4,"Coming to ACPHS may be one of the best decisions I've ever made. The quality instruction, helpful professors and great campus atmosphere motivate me to succeed. Academically, socially and professionally, I feel confident that amazing things are on the horizon. I encourage all prospective students to check out the campus."
Junior,4,"Best decision I've made to further my education in medicine. As a student in the Biomed Tech B.S./AMCs PA Program, Iâ€™m appreciative for the focus of classes. If I'd chosen Pre-Med elsewhere, I wouldn't be exposed to as many health sciences so early. Coursework is rigorous. Professors are passionate/knowledgeable. There are many resources to succeed at the difficult courses including office hours, review sessions, peer tutoring, writing center, the Science Assistance Center, and the Center for Student Success.  They have various duel degree programs with direct entry into various programs. Including PA school at AMC, JD at Albany Law, DO/MD schools, and the MS/PharmD here. Res life is supportive, and dorms have AC and private bathrooms! 2nd year most students have private bedrooms. Food's been steadily improving. The cafe on campus is unique and popular. The dining hall is receptive to critiques/change. I highly recommend to anyone seeking a rigorous and well-known degree in health."
Graduate Student,4,I enjoy the close-knit community on campus and the accessibility of professors here. The early assurance program takes a lot of pressure off about entry into the professional pharmacy program and creates a less negative competitive environment. The college directors have some room for improvement in gathering student input before making large decisions and being more in touch with our needs and wants.
Freshman,4,"I chose to attend Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences more for the potential benefit the school offers, and I can definitely say I am not let down. This school has it's ups and downs, but it is golden for the focused students who attend. The school provides everything for it's students to ensure success, and it's up to the students to utilize it's full capabilities. Other than education, the campus is small so attention is individualized and everybody can receive the help they deserve. On the downside however, extracurricular activities such as sports and parties aren't ACPHS's strong suit. If you aren't doing work or studying, there isn't much else left for students to do on campus to entertain themselves. Overall the school is definitely worth it and the connections you can make are definitely helpful to the students and their respective career paths and futures."
Niche User,4,"A prospective incoming freshman, I applied for the early action because I was interested in becoming a pharmacy technician. I got the enrolled information right after Christmas, and they contacted me through texts, emails, and facebook group. Because I was in California, I couldn't make it to the virtual tour, so they were generous enough to schedule a time to have a FaceTiming communication."
Freshman,4,"I think that the Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is the type of college where you can find a home and a strong academic community to support you throughout your years. While the college course work is very difficult and lacks in certain areas of student engagement, there is an effort to connect the members of the community in all programs. The college does encourage students to be engaged they lack in understanding the course load that students are under and their inability to participate in such activities. Should the college change the way students and faculty interact with equal communication between the two groups, there would be a better understanding for the students' needs and the faculty's expectations."
Sophomore,4,"PROS: I chose to attend ACPHS because of the genuine passion amongst the collegesâ€™ professors & advisors. Two years ago, during a program for incoming freshmen, I had the opportunity to speak with the professors & the way they deeply valued teaching and facilitated learning endeavors inspired my decision to come here. I felt (and still feel) that students can receive a well-rounded education with a supportive & enjoyable learning environment at ACPHS. 

CONS: If the Pharmacy or healthcare field is not a passion of yours, I would advise you to not attend the school. If you leave, it may be difficult to transfer credits into other institutions. ACPHS is not a very diverse institution. Although it is trying to improve on diversity & multiculturalism, if you are a person of color you'll definitely experience some culture shock when you arrive on campus. Lastly, receiving sufficient financial aid from the school can be difficult, so you need to be persistent when discussing your aid."
Freshman,4,"It's always what you make of it. Professors are always willing to meet if you ask because they want you to do well, but you have to take the initiative. Being such a small school doesn't afford a lot of sports but the ones that are established do very well. This past fall both the cross country team and the women's soccer team went to nationals. As a rigorous school, there aren't as many parties but there are neighboring colleges that have more. As a community, it's very close and when you're in clubs and teams it makes it all better. Making ties with upperclassmen is nice because they are always willing to lend a helping hand with adjustments or academics. There is always something going on, on or off campus, so you're never bored."
Junior,4,"ACPHS is a good college. The administration is pro-student, they are always available to help and answer any questions. I think the administrative employees in financial aid, admission, are amazing. They always tried to help me when I had issues. In a great extent, I am studying here because of them, they were so nice to me and helped me so much during my application process and that's something I did not find in any other college. The classes can be hard, according to the rigor that any professional program have.  SOME classes are recorded and that's a great tool to go over the material again.  Also, there are a lot of professional organizations and clubs so If you are a person that like to be involved in several extracurricular activities that might be a good option for you. Overall, ACPHS is an excellent college that prepare their student properly to practice their profession correctly with integrity and responsibility. It was the best choice for me, and I don't regret it at all!"
Sophomore,4,"As much as it may be stated in other reviews, I really admire the small size of the school - it is an advantage when getting to know faculty and making friends. I am very close with my academic advisors, and the department that oversees my program has been very helpful in guiding me academically. Academic rigor varies with each program, but overall, it is very difficult. A majority of students are focused and driven, and the environment can be very competitive at times. Although coursework is challenging, it is for a reason: ACPHS seeks to prepare students to become future healthcare professionals. That being said, there are student-run tutoring programs that offer to help students with coursework, and the faculty is very welcoming and open to offering help if you just ask! Overall, as a student who knows they want to develop a career as a healthcare professional, I believe attending ACPHS was one of the best decisions I could have made."
Freshman,4,"ACPHS is a great college choice if you're ready to work hard to achieve your goals and step out of your comfort zone. The academics are extremely challenging, but the support you get from students and faculty around campus make it worth while. At ACPHS you're not just a student in a lecture hall, faculty will get to know you if you put in the effort to get to know them too. I did have a difficult time adjusting from a high school learning/study to the rigorous course-load that ACPHS has to offer, but the experience has been proven worth it through all of the leadership experience, the professional experience, and the volunteer experiences I've had at ACPHS thus far."
Junior,4,I like most of the professors at the college and I love the small campus. Being so close to almost everyone at the school is very comforting and the professors really take time out of their days to help you. They all truly want to see you succeed.
Niche User,4,"Though I have just visited ACPHS, the small and interconnected campus makes any student feel as if they fit right in the community. The faculty and staff are always willing to answer any question an individual may have, and remain connected with the student through personal emails and discussions."
Niche User,4,I think that the atmosphere at the school is good and the people around me are very helpful and willing to support you
Junior,4,"Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is a great school for a prospective pharmacy student to look at. The community is supportive, and small enough to allow you to get to know everyone. There are plenty of opportunities on campus, and a challenging, yet engaging class structure."
Junior,4,"ACPHS is a great place for students passionate about a future in healthcare, especially in pharmacy. Academics are rigorous, but there are plenty of resources available for students to succeed. Campus community is very tight-knit and professors are always looking out for their students."
Freshman,4,I like that its close to home and the teachers are very nice. As long as you keep up with the work although sometimes highly demanding it is possible. Some things i would like to see change is more sports available and more clubs.  The food in the dining hall could improve as well.
Graduate Student,4,"ACPHS is a small college with a lot to offer students. The professors are very helpful and available outside of class time. The workload is difficult, but definitely manageable. It is easy to get involved on campus, and there are plenty of events and activities to do around Albany, NY."
Graduate Student,4,"ACPHS is a great school when it comes to preparation for your future with regard to the Pharmaceutical/ Health Sciences field. While ACP does have a rigorous program, if one has the heart and dedication to apply themselves in addition to finding enjoyment in the field of health sciences, this school is definitely the right spot to be. Nestled right next to Albany Medical Center, ACPHS has a great networking capabilities and, through the use of the right resources, amazing opportunities both while attending and after graduation. Having such a small size, the school has a tight-knit community and a smaller campus as well. If smallness doesn't bother you and you are content with building life-long relationships with your peers who all have the same interests as you, then ACPHS is definitely the right choice."
Senior,4,"Albany college of pharmacy (ACPHS) is a great place to achieve your goal as becoming a pharmacist. ACPHS has a small community which allows for personalized connection among students and with the professors. All the students from ACPHS share a similar goal in working in Health care community in the future. We all major in either doctor of pharmacy, or other health care related topics. This allows the students to work together and build stronger relationships as many of us share the same classes. Because there is a lower ratio of students to Professors compared to bigger schools, it is easy to set up a meeting with the professors to ask any question regarding lecture materials and get to know them on a  personal level. 
If you are looking for a place to further your education in health sciences/ pharmacy, ACPHS is a good place to be."
Junior,4,"ACPHS is definitely a great school of choice if you are dead-set on a career in pharmacy or health sciences. While the education is rigorous and challenging, it's the sort of challenging that has you feeling accomplished after you do well on a difficult assignment--stressful, but overall worthwhile. The food does get old after a few weeks, but it's by no means bad. It's just the frequency of eating the same things over and over, due to the little variety. But overall, picking this school is a decision I do not regret and I look forward to continuing my education throughout the next few years."
Junior,4,"It is a great school if you're willing to work very hard and prioritize academics and studying over partying and relaxing. Most classes are difficult but very manageable if you keep on top of your work. The majority of teachers are very interested in you learning the information and are very easy to meet with. Pharmacy school is going to be hard no matter where you go, but it's nice being at a school where most people are majoring in the same thing so it is very easy to get help from people. It also helps you stay focused compared to bigger schools because before a big test everyone else will also be studying for it."
Sophomore,4,"Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is a place that has turned into my second home. The students, faculty and professors are always there in support of each other. Professors are available outside of class to help explain a topic in more detail or whatever you may need. If you want to have a career in the health field, you must consider ACPHS!"
Junior,4,"ACPHS is rigorous but rewarding. I would not recommend this school to anyone who is not seriously invested in their future. It is nice to have such a close community. Unfortunately, administration rarely listens to student opinion."
Junior,4,ACPHS has given me to chance to achieve my dreams of becoming a clinical pharmacist. Through the faculty and programs offered at ACPHS I am confident that my future will go the way I want it to go.
Junior,4,"Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences (ACPHS) is a great up and coming school for students looking to get involved in the healthcare field, especially pharmacy. The campus is small and there are not a ton of students, making the community very tight-knit and close. There are a ton of academic resources to help you succeed in your academics and a lot of faculty that are willing to mentor you through your program. The courses are challenging, but if you're looking for a pharmacy program that isn't challenging you're not going to find one. The dorms are the best I have ever seen. The food is average but gets the job done. The gym is nothing spectacular but again gets the job done. The location is nice because its close to downtown Albany and only ten minutes from SUNY Albany. It is also only 15 minutes away from both Crossgates Mall and Colonie Center Mall. The school is definitely on the rise under new leadership and is becoming one of the top pharmacy schools in the country."
Sophomore,4,"ACPHS has been a roller coaster ride: it is full of ups and downs and twists and turns. I have really enjoyed my time, and still look forward to the years ahead. The campus is very small, just like the student body, though both are currently growing. The campus is right in the middle of Albany, so there are plenty of things to do around town; not so much on the actual campus. The academics definitely stand out to me and are very challenging, but very rewarding. It's incredible looking back at the year and seeing all the material I've learned. The professors here are all really caring and genuinely want you to succeed. It's a small school, and one of the advantages that stem from this is the close and personal relationships you develop with the faculty. I do not regret coming here. If you want to be a medical professional or be involved in healthcare, there just isn't a better or more focused school."
Graduate Student,4,"I love ACPHS because of the close knit community it provides. Students at ACPHS are on the same schedule for the most part, therefore, we work together and relax together. The professors are very accommodating and are willing to help. There are many professional and recreational clubs and activities on campus so it is easy to keep busy. The city of Albany provides an eclectic mix of recreation for all of your interests and hobbies."
Junior,4,"While it is a rigorous program (PharmD), at the end of the day I know I am getting a very high-level education, and all the campus resources make it manageable. I chose this school for its close-knit feeling, and the connections made through this school can't be beat."
Graduate Student,4,"Overall, I have enjoyed going to school. I like the small school feel and the accessibility of professors. However, like many schools, some professors are terrible. Another pro is that it is easy to get involved in clubs and research on campus. I do wish that the administration was more open to change and to student opinion into consideration more often."
Junior,4,"Overall my experience here at ACPHS has been very good. The classes for the most part take place in a lecture hall, but aren't too big. The professors always have office hours and want to help each and every student to succeed. One big positive about ACPHS is that everyone at the school are taking the same classes, and all want to pursue a medical-field related career. If you're interested in pursuing a career in the medical-field, I would definitely consider ACPHS and attend one of the open houses to get a feel for what the college has to offer and all the programs."
Sophomore,4,"Very good school- academically challenging, but when you graduate with a pharmacy degree, you get a doctorate in six years and are immediately prepared to be working efficiently in your field. Totally worth it in my book!"
Junior,4,My experience at ACPHS has been very good overall. This college is very small which allows you to have more personal connections with other students and professors.  The bachelor of science students have more research opportunities and the pharmacy students have more opportunity to talk to different professors who are pharmacists in different fields. Every one is very friendly and helpful because every one is here to reach the same goal which is to help people. This is not an easy school but if you feel you are up for a challenge this is a good school for you!
Junior,4,"I am currently a junior at ACPHS and have had an amazing few years here at the college. I am enrolled in the PharmD program and am currently in my P1 year. I love the school because the attention you get from professors because of the smaller class size is extremely helpful and has completely altered my learning experience. Professors at the college are proactive in helping their students when you seek help. It's also so easy to get involved on campus and find things to do outside of the classroom. Everyone is there to help one another and there are wide array of resources on campus to help any individual that is struggling or needs extra guidance. I'm really excited for my next four years with ACPHS and for the location, program and campus this school was perfect for me."
Graduate Student,4,"Overall, I feel like I've learned so much at this school. It can be quite stressful and frustrating at times, but I think it has given me a good education and has set me up for a successful future."
Senior,4,"I love that ACPHS is a small campus. Even though we are small, there are so many resources for us students (Writing center, Science Assistance Center, tutoring services, etc). Furthermore, all the faculty are super helpful and accessible. I know I can turn to them if I have any questions/concerns with the course material. Lastly, the small campus feel allows students to form personal bonds with each other."
Junior,4,"The reason I chose ACPHS was for the research opportunities. I was able to work in a lab with material I was interested in. Not only did the professor provide me with the procedure, but also explained the importance and function of each element. Everything was explained in an applicable way and I was able to work around my class schedule. Working in a lab gave me the basic entry level I needed to start applying to internships and to further my career. (Pharmaceutical Sciences major)"
Junior,4,This is a great school for students who are enrolled in the pharm D program. Otherwise they tend to overlook the BS students
College Freshman,4,There are little to no campus crimes or sexual assaults on this campus. Public safety is always available if you call them but sometimes it can take a little for them to get to you. There are little blue lights that you can press if you feel unsafe and public safety will speak to you over the speaker there and come to you to walk you home.
College Student,4,"The course load is heavy, the professors know this. The majority of courses are well set up."
College Student,4,Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences is a very science oriented school. It is a small campus with exceptional facilities and staff. Though the food is sub-par.
College Student,4,Easy to get to know the professors
College Student,4,Pretty easy to get an internship
College Student,4,Lots of space and a bathroom in every room
College Student,4,Athletics is payed attention to
College Student,4,Workload is tough but atmosphere is good
College Freshman,4,public safety patrols and they take threats seriously
College Student,4,it was interesting and excited I learn a lot of staff
Freshman,2,"In the first week school my roommate dropped out it's that bad here. Classes are insanely hard, I haven't eaten in days due to the food being so bad, there is nothing to do on campus (even though you'll never have free time), and no one in the area is competent; especially at the medical center near by. They also tell you the wrong books to buy, then when class comes you have to buy a whole new set. Also the busses WILL hit you while crossing the street. Flex dollars are BS as well."
College Freshman,2,Atmosphere is really bad. Most people in my grade dropped out/transferred because it was too stifling.
College Freshman,2,"Atmosphere is very bad. Mindset is tight and strict; people resort to gossip, bullying, and pushing others out of their small circles in order to vent stress (there's hardly anything else to do). Teachers do not encourage you to think for yourself; they prefer for you to follow their lessons word for word. I left this college and never looked back."
College Freshman,2,the kids here support the athletes because we are a small school and we are all friends. but the facilities aren't very nice and the school doesn't set any records.
College Junior,2,Work load and amount of mental breakdowns
College Sophomore,2,"Sports are not well-represented at ACPHS. I have done cross country for the past four years, but many students don't even know who does sports and who don't. I wish there was more spirit and focus on the sports teams, especially cross country. Basketball and soccer get more support, because they have activities on campus."
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid office was very easy to talk to but, I received little to no money. It depends on income solely."
College Freshman,2,"Cold, windy, and snowy a majority of the time on campus"
College Student,2,Not many frats or involvement in social scenes
College Student,2,"Pretty hard to find apartments off campus, first come first serve and you're on your own"
College Student,2,My school is 90% Pharm D students who study all the time. We have limited sports programs.
College Student,2,"The most popular major at Albany College of Pharmacy is the Pharm.D. degree, which is the most difficult. Some professors have a strong accent which makes classes confusing and difficult."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no room to chose your path to get to your degree, the courses are all planned out in front of you. "
College Sophomore,2,"It was easy to apply and hear back from the financial aid committee but the maximum financial aid is ridiculous. They are incredibly stingy when it comes to giving any money out, I'd recommend applying for external aid. "
College Sophomore,2,Everyone just studies. There are barely any parties during the year besides first week and the guys at the school all lock themselves in their rooms and don't talk to anyone. 
College Sophomore,2,"Although the campus safety officers always roam around the halls, they only address students if their music is too loud. There haven't been any big busts so far this year and many students drink and do drugs. "
College Sophomore,2,"Really it is the Albany College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences. That's all there is. I'd say about 85% of the students are in the Pharm.D program and then there are the B.S. students. There is no variety, as we're all there for the same thing. Everyone is antisocial and just studies all the time. "
College Sophomore,2,"People at ACPHS rarely go off campus, for the reasons that there is absolutely nothing to do, and the students never break away from their books and studying long enough to leave the library or their dorm. Although the campus is in the middle of Albany, it's not an exciting city at all. "
College Sophomore,2,It feels like 4/7 days its raining out during the fall/spring. The winter is just as bad with the snow. Classes are not cancelled very often.
College Sophomore,2,"There is a single on campus food place. The food is much better than is has been in recent years.. but that is not saying a lot. You can get pretty bored of the food very quickly, and you usually tend to falling in to the habit of eating the same thing almost every single day. The staff is pretty good for the most part, but I always wish the food was better."
Graduate Student,1,"Sure the dorms are pretty and the college tells you a bunch of wonderful things about it when you tour, but in actuality, most of it isnt true. My last 3 years here have been a living nightmare. The people are rude, the administration is a nightmare, there are zero school activities, and the classes are taught horribly. I am not getting the education I want. They've also implemented a policy where if you score less than a C, you fail. One poor exam means you're probably going to have to retake the class. Half of my class year has failed out so far due to the inability of these professors to teach. I'm taking an absurd amount of credits right now because that is what's mandatory. Honestly, deciding to go to this college was the worst decision I've made. I have never seen such a miserable group of students until I came here. Sure, there's great return on investment, but it isn't worth the mental toll. The food and facilities are horrible too."
Freshman,1,Amazing school would recommend it to everyone canâ€™t see my self going anywhere else. I am so happy that i came here it really makes me one step closer to my dreams.
College Freshman,1,We don't have Greek Life!!! We have one Fraternity that is barely even noticed and no one wants to join. There is a professional fraternity but you are only allowed in if you have a great GPA; probably above a 3.5.
College Senior,1,"Don't Attend, This school hasn't taught me a thing.  I don't know how I plan to become a pharmacist one day or how I passed."
College Sophomore,1,"I really don't like much of the administration. They really seem to not care much about students and make it very challenging to get a new club started on campus. One example that is really crappy is we had the time to turn in our housing application, which is first come first serve, happen during Organic Chemistry II where we might have had a pop quiz, and the administration didn't care that they were forcing students to skip class to make sure to be able to have a room on campus. I'm not a fan..."
College Freshman,1,Horrible food choices.  Been to many colleges to visit friends and I think we have the worse.
College Student,1,There are not a lot of parties at my school.
College Sophomore,1,I don't even know if there are any computer labs on campus. There are probably like 3 desktops in the library but the school pretty much makes you purchase a laptop during the summer before  your first year. The laptops they recommend are very nice and in my opinion worth the extra money. 
College Sophomore,1,"The professors are gossipy and uptight, and they don't understand the stress of the program. Right now I'm learning from one professor who has ANY experience in Pharmacy and she doesn't even have a Pharm.D. "
College Student,1,There is no Greek life here. There is a club but they never have meetings or really do anything.
College Student,1,there basically is no Greek life   you do not see them on campus
College Freshman,1,"Chartwells is very expensive, has a poor selection, and is your only real option."
College Freshman,1,"Just don't go here, really. It's not a good school."
College Student,1,"Don't buy the school computer, they are expensive and pieces of crap. Better off spending the same amount of money on a macbook or something of higher quality. Wireless coverage is decent but pretty unreliable and slow"
College Freshman,1,There are no computer labs. It is required that each student bring his/her own laptops or buy one from the school.
College Student,1,"If there is any transportation here it is by people who cannot drive a bus, or a bus that does not fit into your schedule. your best bet here for transportation is to find a friend with a car!"
College Student,1,There are not very many places to eat that are close to the college. The restaurants suggested by the college have horrible reviews they do not have the most flavorful or healthy food. Some of the places are cheap but getting to the places that don't deliver can be a pain if you do not have your own way of transportation.
College Student,1,"This is an incredibly small campus. There are four residence halls, one classrooms building, one building for lab and lecture, the student center for lectures, one library, one fitness center and the student center as a dining hall. The only two big sports that are played here are soccer and basketball and we just reached Division 3. The school tries its very best to set up different kinds of activities, but most of them aren't very interesting and don't attract many people."
College Student,1,"Very Strict College â€“ This is a professional school and ACPHS requires their students to uphold to very high standards.  The student body is always representing the school and anything a student does wrong reflects badly on them.  Drug use, underage drinking, and partying are not allowed.  If caught you could face expulsion from the college.  They will give you a few chances with drinking, such as a warning, fine, and mandatory alcohol classes, but drug use is not tolerated whatsoever."
College Freshman,1,"Two Total â€“ there are a total of two houses and they are fraturnies only, no sororities."

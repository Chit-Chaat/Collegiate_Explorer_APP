Alum,5,"This is a school that is easily underestimated and ignored by people. The school is small in size and has only two buildings, but it is a very cost-effective school to learn Fine art. PAFA offers as many courses and student services as possible in a limited space.   All faculty members are very helpful and kind."
Graduate Student,5,"The moment that I step foot into the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts for the first time, I knew it was something special. The program, community, and teachers are amazing."
College Sophomore,5,"I just started a few weeks ago. I transferred from another school after a lot of research into what kind of school I really wanted to be at and what I needed to be successful as an artist. The program here is very small, but the professors and administration are so invested, and they make such an effort to help students in any way that they can both in and out of the classroom. They put so much effort into cultivating a sense of community among all the people who study and work at the school and museum, and it really does feel like a family. We encourage, critique, and support one another. So far, I'm very happy. This school is exactly what I wanted: a small-school feel with access to a lot of opportunities (location in the heart of Philadelphia!) and a rigorous, traditional program."
College Freshman,5,"Compared to the weather in Chicago, Philadelphia is never too cold. I can still wear shorts with leggings in the winter time and it barely snows there too. The summer is not too hot, but its still kind of hot. The highest its been since I've been in Philadelphia is 90 degrees which is okay and you can still wear long sleeves without sweating in that temperature."
College Freshman,5,"Amazing Experience – i love everything about this school, from the students to the classrooms to the teachers and all of the faculty. everyone is very knowledgable and very kind. as an art student, i fit right in. im free to be myself, and no one judges me."
College Sophomore,5,"Love It – I wouldnt trade my school for anything in the world, I love the students, the teachers, the city its in, and how its helped me as an artist."
College Sophomore,5,"Would Rather Make Art Than Care About Appearance – Students are well dressed and conservative, even though its an art school. The students care more about their art then their appearance, which is inspiring."
College Sophomore,4,"PAFA is tiny, so there are not that many classes offered and the whole school is on the same schedule: two classes a day, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, with a 90-minute lunch break in between. You have to know you want to be at a program like this to be happy here. The instructors are so knowledgeable and are experts in their respective fields; it is primarily a painting school, and it is EXTREMELY steeped in tradition, so they still teach traditionally. The program is pretty intense but you learn a lot and the instructors are extremely encouraging of their students. Freshman classes probably have about 15 students, maybe even a few more, and that's about as big as the classrooms can handle. If you took art classes in high school, you know how much space all those projects can take up! Higher level classes can have anywhere from 5-12 students depending on the popularity of the class, number of sections offered, and the amount of freedom older students have in their schedules. Many of the teachers have been here a fairly long time and some even went to PAFA themselves."
College Sophomore,4,"The alumni network, from what I've seen, is pretty tight. The school has a definite sense of camaraderie among its graduates, and many students go on to work for the school or museum, or at least remain connected and in contact with old instructors. Career services is very helpful and holds bi-weekly workshops that focus on various topics and also talk about what other PAFA alumni have gone on to do."
College Sophomore,4,"Security is in the building and courtyard 24/7; off campus, you are in center city, which is generally fine during the day. Every student has key cards which have to be swiped to enter the building and again at the entrance to any of the interior floors and stairwells. There's a shuttle that runs every night at 10:30, after the building closes, to get students back to the dorms safely. There is information available for sexual assault, domestic violence, emotional support, psychological help, and other topics posted around the campus, and that information was advertised to us during orientation. I haven't heard of any sexual assault at school, and it's hard to believe there could be much of an issue at such a small school.

The school has an agreement with a local health provider that lets students see a general practitioner free of charge. There is also a thing set up with the University of Pennsylvania's psych center that will counsel students for free (for a limited number of visits) and give 24/7 support."
College Senior,4,everyone really knows theirstuff & can impart that to others
College Junior,4,"Center City! Affordable and Close! PAFA has no on-campus housing. However, located in the center of the city there is plenty of excellent options in the surrounding districts. Have a talk with admissions, they will for sure help you out!"
College Freshman,4,"Amazing School! This school is absolutely perfect for art majors. the people are amazing, artists will fit right in. everyone is genuinely nice. there is no faking here. you are free to be yourself, however that may be."
College Sophomore,4,"Sometimes Crowded but Always Useful – Our school library has about a dozen computers, that are sometimes crowded but always in great condition, can be used for anything."
Freshman,2,"PAFA is a fantastic place if you want to be an artist that focuses on fine arts traditions and nothing more. Having access to a museum is very helpful. But, if you want to learn about anything else, and I mean anything, its not the place for you.  The student body is predominantly white. Good luck finding anyone that is interested in anything other than art. If you want to converse about another topic, talk to the professors. They are very knowledgable and caring. While to building is gorgeous, it's not in the best area. My bike, that was locked up, was stolen in front of guards on campus. "
College Senior,2,it's the middle of the city: you take your chances!

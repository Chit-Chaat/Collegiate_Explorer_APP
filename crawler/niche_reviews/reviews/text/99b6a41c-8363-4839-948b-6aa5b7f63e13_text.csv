The teachers at University of Baltimore prepare you for the working world.  Henceforth if you are having problems with your classes, there are resources to help you. A tutor will also assist you.

The campus is in the middle of downtown Baltimore with many sights and activities. This school is awesome and very rewarding."

College Freshman,5,our school is very diverse and allows you to meet a lot of dif people
College Student,5,"It's Baltimore. Going out after dark isn't recommended, but just be vigilant. It's a big city filled with history and quirkiness, so there's a lot to explore and do. Just be smart about the neighborhoods you go to after dark, that's all."
College Junior,5,State of the art computer labs and very secure
College Senior,5,Learn very practical and hands on lessons that i will actually use  in my career field

College Sophomore,5,I did not encounter any difficulties.  The process was very smooth and pleasant.  Standard application process. There are knowledgeable and professional people in the  Admission office.  
College Sophomore,5,"It is excellent. Never had problems with network.  There are plenty of PCs and Macs.  School has excellent support as to any technology. Tech support can assist with any problems from basic to advanced.  If one forgot a laptop, school can loan a laptop. "

Alum,4,"Learning online is fairly easy here. There is still room to grow, but they have done this quite well."
Alum,4,"I did not take any online classes as I learn better being in person.  However,  I did have to submit assignments online. The program used was Blackboard which was user friendly and easy to navigate."
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at UB. I have learned alot, gained internships and improved my resume. I also made alot of money."
Sophomore,4,"I've just recently taken my first semester at UB, and most of the people I have encountered so far have been so helpful. The professors give critical feedback and are passionate about their expertise. Advisers give you great advice and they want you to succeed."
Freshman,4,"University is a small school compared to most, and I happen to really like this as it meant I was able to get the required attention and assistance from professors"
Junior,4,"I like the fact that professors are very knowledgeable. However, there is too much group work in my degree program, and occasionally I notice classmates struggling with equal contribution."
Graduate Student,4,The professors are amazing. In person transactions within various administrative offices are smooth but they could work on phone and email communications for students that are not local to the Baltimore City area.
Junior,4,"University of Baltimore is a really good school. The professors are really educated and the classes aren't that big therefore, you are able to learn a little better as well as get to know your professor on a smaller scale. I do wish that the part scene was a little better as well as more eatery places surrounding campus."
Graduate Student,4,"The professors are great at what they teach, the staff is always willing to help at any moment's notice!"
Junior,4,"It is a very friendly staff, and the buildings are pretty easy to find. I only wish there was more communication among the departments. I was working with my adviser for classes and the phone number she gave me for housing was no longer working. Other than that small issue, I love it"
Freshman,4,I like the school. It is in a nice area that has everything close by. As a student everything I’d ever possibly need is in walking distance from campus. Transportation by the school is nice to. They have shuttles that take you from the school to the subway or where ever you want to go. I’d like just the school to have some more school spirit.
Graduate Student,4,"The professors of the Yale Gordon college of arts and sciences are extremely adept in multicultural practices and procedures in the clinical psychology realm. The university system itself is, like many universities, focused on financial gain."
Alum,4,"The diversity at University of Baltimore is unmatched. You get an opportunity to meet people from all walks of life. The result to the diversity on campus is that each student has the chance to see different peoples perspectives, who they normally might not have the chance to hear."
Junior,4,I am very happy with my experience with my higher learning within University of Baltimore.  I would love to see better communication with between students and professors dealing with return emails.
Graduate Student,4,"The teachers in the masters program are very knowledgeable and care for the students to understand the material. If you need help, they will stay after class and assist you. The classes are small so that everyone can have one on one time if needed. My only complaint is that some classes are only taught during a specific time a day. I wish they had more options."
Junior,4,"I have attended other universities and there are pros and cons to all of them. However, the University of Baltimore is the most student focused. Professors, advisers, and even Deans are accessible any time you have a question; they know that they are there for you. Further, with the majors offered, there is no doubt that there is a real world opportunity to use the skills and knowledge earned as a student.

I am a Baltimore native and I love that the campus is s right in the middle of midtown with plenty of diversity and cultural events."
Freshman,4,I weneed here because it is close to home and I am able to have easy transportation to get there. I love the college experience and how it is different from grade school. I feel more independent to do things and it is fun. When I need help it is a lot of resources to help me with what I need. I cannot wait to evolve into a better person with this experience.
Junior,4,This college is great. Good professors and good area considering it is in the city of Baltimore. If you are looking for a sports team here. You might want to overlook this school  because there are no sports teams. Although there are intramural and club teams. There are local food spots to eat and drink. Everyone for the most part is friendly. Professors are helpful and their for you whenever you need help.   
College Senior,4,Most of the issues happen around the outskirts of campus since the campus is located in downtown Baltimore.
College Senior,4,This school has been great. I appreciate how all the classes contribute to the overall learning experience of the degree I am looking to obtain
College Sophomore,4,There are a lot of courses and majors to choose from. I am able to take any classes I want and the professors really want us to succeed in what we do. They help students and find time for them. The work varies but it's nothing you can't handle.
College Sophomore,4,"We have great security on campus. We have our own police unite that's recognized by the state. We haven't had to many problems with sexual assault or robbery or assault, that I know of. Campus life is very relaxing."
College Sophomore,4,"The classes are great and the grounds are excellent. The schools main focus is getting students into the career they want to be in. It's a small school and it's in the middle of the city so access is easy. The diversity is amazing. Any type of person you can think of, they go to that school. I don't think I could have picked a better university."
College Senior,4,I feel as though the campus police are very active and they make their presence known quite frequently. Sometimes they ask if a ride is needed or if someone can walk you home. I live fairly close to school but being offered a walking buddy is always helpful. They take it a step further and ask if we feel safe. I think that's an integral part of living close to my school.
College Senior,4,They implore you to explore and expand
Recent Alumnus,4,We have a softball tournament that almost every one attends every spring. Its fun and its a way for you to get to know others in the school and at other universities.
Recent Alumnus,4,UB Law is a great university. It is very diverse and practical. UB Law has programs available where you can get internships with judges and lawyers which will help develop you to work in the real world. Also UB Law has incredibly knowledgeable and passionate professors that encourage you to be your best!
College Junior,4,I've never felt unsafe on campus.
College Junior,4,"Good atmosphere,nice area, small college."
College Freshman,4,My overall experience has been phenomenal considering all of my teachers want each student to succeed. UB is very diverse personality and culture wise. Each person is unique in their own way and this can be seen daily by just walking around the campus.
College Sophomore,4,"For me it was a matter of transitioning from High School into college, in college no one was checking for homework, telling you to go to class nothing. In college it was hard for me to adapt to that environment and I took that as a huge freedom but as I went on it was a great responsibility that I had to learn to work with. I learned a lot about myself as a person and a scholar. And that is the one thing I want other incoming students to learn."
Recent Alumnus,4,This school has diverse faculty and students
College Freshman,4,"The teachers are great, as well as, the campus!"
College Junior,4,The admissions office has been very helpful in getting all my paperwork processed.
College Sophomore,4,It's not bad but it's not my scene. Some are sketchy.
College Sophomore,4,SRU is fairly good with writing and following policies. Our school really does utilize student feedback and the administration listens often.
College Sophomore,4,"SRU offers a variety of options: pizza, tacos, wings, fried food, burgers, salads, chinese, wraps, subs, sandwiches, and everything you could imagine both for dining in and to go. They have Boozel, Rocky's, Starbucks, Quaker Stake, the library coffee shop, weisenfluh, and the campus grille. There are options for everything you want and even to-go options."
College Sophomore,4,I thought the campus housing at SRU was amazing! It was all brand new and had amazing quality in each of the room designs and buildings. I would definitely rate this higher than at most college campuses.
Recent Alumnus,4,There are great eateries around the campus- many different cuisines are available.
College Junior,4,There is a lot of diversity when it comes to off-campus dining - from Chinese food to indian food to italian. There are restaurants to accommodate the needs of almost all ethnicities.
College Junior,4,Academics are great at U.B as the professors are generally helpful and lenient.
College Junior,4,University of Baltimore is a good college overall. Safety can be a concern sometimes but campus police is usually there to protect student safety.
College Senior,4,There are plenty of options of places to eat - all of which are fair prices and some places do offer a Student Discount.
College Senior,4,The social atmosphere is good. Once you turn 21 you will have a lot of social opportunities. Until then there are many interesting museum and things to do close by.
Recent Alumnus,4,"Most of the professors, once you get to know them, are really great. You need to get to know them though. Great class sizes. The biggest class I had was 60 students."
Recent Alumnus,4,The Career Center and thief workshops are underutilized. Use them and use them often!
Recent Alumnus,4,The campus is very diverse! It's probably the most diverse university in the Baltimore metropolitan area.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There's a lot around the campus to get involved in, such as museums, clubs, free events, and local universities such as MICA, Coppin, Morgan, Loyola, College of Notre Dame, Hopkins, and Towson, that are always having an event. We also have the O's and Ravens play and we have close access to DC via the MARC train."
College Sophomore,4,"I have not seen any obvious sign of drug exchanges, public smoking or anything of the sort. I do however occasionally get a whiff of it on some individuals, but it does not disrupt my learning in anyway."
College Sophomore,4,"We are close to Penn station, which is very convenient for those who live or may want to travel to DC, N.Y, Shady grove e.t.c. We also have access to a variety of cabs that are usually coming from Penn station that can help transport you to where you need to go."
College Sophomore,4,There is a lot of bars and clubs to attend
College Freshman,4,The computers have not let me down yet. The wireless activity is very fast.
College Freshman,4,It's many opportunities. You just have to stay on top of the workload.
College Freshman,4,"We have a Chipotle, Subway, Pizza place, Italian place, Deli, Sub shop,Sushi, Starbucks, and Potbelly. You can eat breakfast, lunch and dinner.  It is definitely a lot to get fat from, but they all taste great. Some places give us discounts."
College Freshman,4,I'm just concerned I won't find a job when I graduate.
College Freshman,4,The campus authority is strict where it needs to be and lenient where it needs to be.
College Freshman,4,"Considering the time I've been here, the weather is absolutely fantastic."
College Freshman,4,It's easy to find scholarship options and offers.
College Freshman,4,The courses are challenging and the professors encourage me to be willing to take risks and learn.
Senior,2,"University of Baltimore has people and personnel that the institution does not deserve.  The institution has poor communications with its students, no athletic program, no cafeteria (but a convenience store), and no housing options. the school is continuously out of money, and keeps cutting funding for non-law programs/issues. there are curriculums in the university is split among other schools, with students having to either wait a full year to take the classes that they need or to take the class in another institution. of these classes, most are required to graduate and these splits cause students to transfer out or to stay for additional years. the main appeal of the school is the students attending and the area surrounding it. Like previously stated, the institution is filled with people and personnel that it does not deserve. The University of Baltimore is laden with problems and issues that makes it unappealing, but the people inside almost make the experience worth it"
College Junior,2,There aren't any emphasis on sports or athletics.
College Senior,2,"Being in grad school athletics are not as important anymore. UB does not have a huge athletics spirit, but it is there if you want to join for fun."
College Junior,2,We don't have a team that I know of.
College Freshman,2,We have no type of sports activities unless it's playing basketball or flag football in the gym. We're located in the city near Amtrak so most students do not expect over the top sporting events here.
College Junior,2,"There is no meal plan so we have to rely on restaurants deals and incentives offered by participating merchants in the ""BeeCard"" payment plan. Either way, vending machines are the only option on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Athletics at the University of Baltimore is not a big part of campus life. We have intramural sports, which include, soccer, basket ball and volleyball. However students rarely participate in these activities except for those dedicated sports enthusiasts. The previous years had better student involvement and fan support especially in basketball and soccer, where as the present year has not had much luck. Perhaps we need to advertise these programs better and encourage the younger students, especially to participate."
College Sophomore,2,The winter can really be distracting and not motivating. A lot of the time class is canceled because of the harsh winter.
College Freshman,2,It's bad because I dislike the city environment and I like suburban areas more.
College Student,2,"Parking is usually a far walk, but it's a generally good price."
College Junior,2,"Many people have their vice, smoking or alcohol.
You can find people who hang out without partaking but its like a culture here in Maryland to drink or partake in smoking."
College Sophomore,2,"it not really much to do in Baltimore, unless you know people."
College Sophomore,2,It is extremely hard when it start to snow and rain it hard to get around
College Sophomore,2,Granted the housing located around UB is nice the prices are still extremely high. It's nearly unforeseeable for college students.
College Freshman,2,"Housing Off Campus – I live off campus and it's decent. I live in an apartment with my boyfriend, who is also in college and my two pets in Perry Hall, which is about 20 minutes away from school. I honestly wish I could have found housing that would accept my dog further into the city and closer to campus. I understand that not everybody can accommodate such a large breed animal, but my options were SO slim. This disappointed me."
College Junior,2,"Its Ok – Campus is in a ""Gay neighborhood"" and attracts ""that element""."
College Junior,2,"Limited Availability – Computers are ""OK"".  Not readily available. Only 24 hour lab has no windows and poor ventilation. Campus tends to shut down on the weekend"
College Junior,2,"Campus Activities – One of the things UB lacks is the campus activities. Since it is downtown there isn't much room for a tennis court, football field, etc. There are computer labs and lounges, but these are very small and are often packed."
College Senior,2,"On campus there could be more dining options, but as University of Baltimore is in the middle of the city, there are always options for good eats within a short walk."
College Junior,2,"People in financial aid, bursars office, admissions, etc seem to be CLUELESS. I have a scholarship I am getting that NO ONE can seem to tell me what I have to do to maintain it, or any other information about it."
College Junior,1,I really want Greek life
College Sophomore,1,I wasn't allowed to receive scholarships because it would take away my grant money - not my loan money.
College Sophomore,1,I like it because It gives me the chance to socialize.
College Freshman,1,Its really hard to find money in this university.
College Freshman,1,"Nothing for underage but the Varsity, but I haven't heard about many parties."
College Freshman,1,"I wish we had huge teams, that played numerous amount of schools. But instead we have intramural sports people don't really play. I wish we could have huge sports events to have the BEE spirit at games."
College Sophomore,1,there is not an office for health as in like a infirmary but the school police are very active in making sure the students know about staying safe
College Sophomore,1,"After transferring to the University of Baltimore I discovered the school is typically for those not accepted into the University of Maryland, UMBC, even Towson University. Consider this school an extension of a poor performing community college. The curriculum is not engaging and the majority of students are not prepared for the most remedial of tasks. The biggest academic challenge is completing all the busywork assigned. "
College Freshman,1,Living in the varsity is expensive. 
College Freshman,1,"The charm city circulator and the light rail are the only ways to get around the campus/city and they're public. However, we are a very small college (about 2 blocks wide) so any transportation efforts are pretty well useless."
College Freshman,1,What Sports? I have never heard of a single sporting event at school EVER. Do they even have sports teams?! I suppose the professional sports here (Baseball and football) kind of over shadow any sort of college team.
Recent Alumnus,1,We Have a Campus Police Force? The general are around UB is just OK. You always hear of cars getting broken into even in the UB parking garrages. There have been a few robbery's and assults within a couple blocks of campus. If you venture off further than a couple blocks you run into North Ave. which is one of the worsts streets in the US as far as crime is concerned. The campus police force is non existent they don't do anything for the students. Most of the time they pull into an empty space in the parking garrage or street and sleep. You would never know that from attending a UB open house though.
College Senior,1,Off Campus Only – There are an abundance of little restaurants in the near area to get quick eats but the school doesn't directly provide any of them. The have a Starbucks and a small convenience mart in the student center that sells snack but nothing made to order.
College Junior,1,No Campus Dorms – Lack of on campus houseing impacts academic night life
College Freshman,1,"Maryland weather is awful. Snowing one day, 70 and sunny the next!"
College Sophomore,1,The parking sucks I mean they have a few garages around campus but you have to pay for it. The last price I saw for parking for the semseter was $500.00 CRAZY. Also they took the only piece of free parking and started charging for it I hate it.
College Junior,1,"Not Much Here – A high percentage of UB Students are 25+ years old and have family and work obligations. Therefore, the average student does not have time to participate in traditional college Greek Life events."

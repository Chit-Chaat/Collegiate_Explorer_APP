Sophomore,5,"Toccoa Falls College is a warm hearted, God loving campus where everyone is welcomed and loved on. The Professors take time to really get to know the students and I have never felt like just another number. Between the people and the Professors I can't think of another school that I would be more proud to say I am apart of. The student government does a wonderful job of putting on fun events throughout the year for the perfect balance of work and play. The only thing that needs improvement on campus are the housing situations. The girls dorms especially are very outdated and need remodeling. Overall, Toccoa is a beautiful and exceptional school."
Junior,5,"I have only ever taken online classes at TFC, but have truly loved every class! The teachers do everything in their power to make sure you are not just understanding the material, but will be able to thrive at your future career. Toccoa Falls is committed to your education and watching you flourish!!!"
Sophomore,5,TFC is one of the most amazing schools I have ever been enrolled in. The staff are caring and very understanding in all areas of life. I want to stay and finish my degree at Toccoa!
Sophomore,5,I have never had a bad experience with my TFC online schooling. All of my classes and professors are eager to help you learn and understand the material. I have been blessed to be able to be enrolled with such a fantastic school. There are more than enough online classes to take in order to pursue your chosen career. The teachers are also very flexible when it comes to your personal life.
Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year at Toccoa Falls College and it has been the perfect fit. The setting of the mountains, the small town, and the tight knit community of the campus (it has its faults as well, but all places do), and the dedication of the staff and professors has been excellent for my mental well being and my striving to have a great education. I have made the best friends, and while they are only a few clubs, it has been an excellent place to make connections with students and professors alike. The farm has been a huge plus as it has added greatly to my studies in Sustainable Community Development, and it has been great to have a breath away from academics and spend time among animals and plants. The dorms are not the greatest, and the food is not excellent everyday, but they are not the things I will remember when I graduate."
Freshman,5,"I have been accepted for the fall semester of 2020 so I do not have heaps of experience. However, what I have seen has been amazing. The Community that I have experienced at the campus has been an amazing thing to witness. As a first-generation college student, the support I have received from both the current students and the staff has been very informative and helpful. The dorms are clean and the campus is beautiful. You are constantly surrounded by nature and people who love nature. There is a large variety of food options on campus. The menu is constantly changing and they provide healthy options. Laundry is also free so put away your quarters. There are a lot of campus events and clubs as well. Truly an amazing place."
Niche User,5,"Great school with a great community! Almost every professor I have had was helpful, likeable and showed personal interest in my success."
Sophomore,5,"I went on a campus tour and met with some Admissions Counselors, and the entire experience was supreme. The people were so friendly and offered the right information, and if they did not have the answer to a question, they were sure to find it out. The faculty there were very kind and made the atmosphere feel like home. My tour guide was so nice and he had all the right information about the campus and the school in general. My conversations with everyone there were not awkward but full of life and ease. A wonderful experience, truly."
Niche User,5,"Toccoa Falls College is a small and very closely knit community of students and staff who are truly striving to get the most out of the amazing educational experience offered there. With classes available online, as well as on campus for resident and commuter students, you will not be disappointed. Caring staff, good food, growth in your faith, and amazing friends are sure to also be a part of your encounter with TFC!!"
Niche User,5,"What I love most about TFC is the community, everyone knows everyone, they hang out all the time. The academics are amazing, incredible teachers, incredible staff there. They work so hard to give us the best experience possible, and the campus is absolutely beautiful!"
Alum,5,"Wonderful school! I loved it! Small, friendly, and beautiful campus. I made some many life long friends and connections. I talk about it fondly and reminisce on my time here."
Sophomore,5,"Toccoa Falls College is such an asset to Toccoa. It is a heart warming, welcoming campus and continues to produce students that are very successful. I’m so thankful to call TFC my home!"
Freshman,5,"I have loved my college experience at Toccoa Falls so far.  The campus is beautiful and the community here is so encouraging.  I can tell the professors care about me as a person and not just how I am doing academically.  The only thing I do not really like about the college is the food, which could be better.  Overall, I enjoy attending and learning at this college very much."
Niche User,5,"Toccoa Falls College is such an amazing school. It is known for the on-site waterfall that is beautiful and an easy walk to. The campus is incredibly serene, small, and a great place to hang out, play games, study, etc. The people and staff at TFC are friendly and are eager to get to know you personally. The staff are known to have invited students to their homes for dinner with their family occasionally and are always open to meet with the student according to the students' schedule when they are in need of further explanation on an assignment or even just to answer some thought-provoking questions they may have. There are not many things that the college needs to change, but could have some updates for the dorm rooms and some things around the campus such as the roads and sidewalks. Other than those minor fixes Toccoa Falls College is a great place to go!"
Niche User,5,"I fell in love with Toccoa Falls College from the moment that I stepped foot on campus! The campus was so beautiful and seemed to take you always from the outside world and brought to somewhere very peaceful with very little distractions. Moreover, the student life was amazing and being able to see how the professor really connected and cared for their students was really cool to see. It was also interesting to see the connections between the students and how they cared for each other and just how they wanted to see them succeed. I wouldn’t change a thing about the college because it is a very good place to go if you are interesting in anything religious or such things as teaching, or nursing."
Freshman,5,This school is amazing. The community is awesome and everybody there just wants to get to know you. the professors are always available and they really care about you and your academic journey. They want what is best. The only thing I would like to change is the chapel services. A lot of times it's just a lecture rather than an actual message.
Junior,5,I love the atmosphere of the campus with the beautiful water fall on campus. I love the friendliness of everyone you meet.
Senior,5,I have greatly enjoyed my experience at TFC. The students are friendly and the faculty are immensely helpful. The diversity of the students and proffessors was especially beneficial in forming my education.
Alum,5,"Toccoa Falls College is truly a Christ-focused community that values truth (the word of God), love, and relationships. It will always have a special place in my heart because it is where the Lord matured me in his Word, in rich relationships with others, and in my academics (I was a History-Education major), preparing me for life beyond college. It is also where I met my husband, and we are actually currently working as staff at TFC in our first year of marriage."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love my college. The faculty and staff go above and beyond to make sure that you are fed academically and spiritually. They make sure that there are so many options so that you can strengthen and grow in your relationship with Christ.
Junior,5,I have been at Toccoa Falls College for three years and my experience has been wonderful! The professors are amazing! The college also has a very good atmosphere and focuses a lot on the spiritual growth of the students.
Freshman,5,"There is no where else I'd rather attend college. The professors truly care about you, the classes are small which allows students to get help when needed. The student body is like family."
Sophomore,5,Toccoa Falls College is amazing. The professors are so loving and truly do their best to help their students grow in their education. The community here is great. I love everything about it except minus the cost of tuition. But we are a private institution so that explains the high cost. It is definitely a kingdom investment.
College Sophomore,5,"There is very little crime on campus. I feel very safe on campus, even when walking alone at night. There is an adequate number of security guards on patrol and the school has banned alcohol on campus and even drinking off campus, which I think really helps keep crime down."
College Sophomore,5,"I've really enjoyed and appreciated every professor that I've had. On average they are passionate about their subject, warm and encouraging to students, and academically challenging. They really want students to learn and succeed, both in class and in life. Class sizes are usually small (the smallest class I've been in had only 4 students, the largest around 20), which is really great. It makes it a lot easier to really participate in class and for the professor to get to know you."
College Sophomore,5,"I really love my school. The atmosphere on campus and the emphasis placed on developing a loving, godly community is one of the things I value most. The professors are also great. Most are experts in their field and very passionate about the subjects that they teach. That passion makes the classes more enjoyable and the ways that they apply to me personally easier to see."
College Sophomore,5,They are great. Everything is focused on making th student better
College Sophomore,5,This is the greatest school. Sure we are small but w have such a community that it helps people grow. There are times where I wish I had gone to s bigger school but I would by change the time I have had at Toccoa Falls College. I would do it all again!
College Junior,5,The class room size are small but are beneficial.
College Freshman,5,"This school is such an amazing place to find those who are on fire for God and are pursuing him fully! It's a great place to learn about God and ministry in your field as well as learn about your specific major in depth! I love the school, the academics, the school spirit, and the love from each student and teacher."
College Senior,5,The school is incredibly safe. There is hardly any crime or drunkenness on the campus. We have security on our campus 24/7 that monitors who can get onto the campus.
College Senior,5,"The professors at this school are unbelievable. If you ever have a question, they are quick to help. They are knowledgeable and personal. The classes are usually fairly small and open to asking questions. The courses are fairly laid back."
College Sophomore,5,"The faculty truly care about the students. The coursework is rigorous, but the professors set you up to succeed.  The choice of textbooks is excellent.  The online program is a great option for non-traditional students."
College Junior,5,"Just under 1000 students, so not too huge. The professors are the best. They are interested in investing personally in their students lives. TFC has a 14 to 1 student/professor ratio. Toccoa is a small town, and the community is amazing-- whether on campus or in town. If given the choice to choose again, I wouldn't trade these experiences that Toccoa has provided me for the world."
College Sophomore,5,"I've loved every minute at Toccoa, even with the usual difficulties that come with the first year. The professors all care and enjoy getting to know you, Res Life is incredibly involved and acts as a seamless replacement for Greek Life. I've met and bonded with so many incredible people, and the campus in extremely diverse with hundreds of opportunities for travel and fresh, new studies."
College Junior,5,The off campus dining options that we are given in Toccoa are amazing. There are plenty of real nice restaurants that provides amazing discounts for students and also gives plenty of late night snacking options as well
College Junior,5,Living on campus at Toccoa Falls College has been an incredible experience. The dorms are extremely nice and well set up and provides more than enough room to live comfortably inside the dorm. The social atmosphere there is wonderful as well and provides countless opportunities for the college community to gather and fellowship together while we grow closer to the Lord. Living on campus at Toccoa Falls College has made making lifelong friends very easy and has also helped for me personally to grow up fully into adulthood and to be the responsible young man that God intended for me to be.
College Sophomore,5,"Staff is great and extremely knowledgeable. Cares immensely for each student's individual understanding of material. The  best part is developing a spiritual foundation alongside the liberal education. It synthesizes the study of life with faith for believers, while preparing them for the desired field."
College Sophomore,5,Very diverse! We have many Hmong students
College Sophomore,5,"Students on campus are dressed like normal people, but follow rules of modesty. Very respectful and adventurous and outdoorsy."
College Sophomore,5,I have never heard of anything violent or crime related happening on campus!
College Sophomore,5,It is such a small campus! But absolutely beautiful. We have a 186 foot waterfall  on campus and a lot of hiking with smaller waterfalls around in the mountains. We also have a pond for swimming!
College Sophomore,5,It is a very small campus which provide a lot off community building!
College Sophomore,5,I applied online. Choose the major I wanted - Outdoor Leadership Education... I am checking off my tasks on the admissions list... Tips for admissions processes... Follow their rules... It is the only way...
College Sophomore,5,Outdoor Leadership is and will be an exciting degree to study and finish with.  I love it.  The workload and curriculum are challenging.  TFC's modern facilities allow students to learn at the 'head of the curve.'  These multiple factors will lead to an exciting internships and job opportunities in the near future...
College Sophomore,5,It is a well lit campus with enough security.  Campus safety is appropriately addressed so that safety is not an issue.
College Sophomore,5,Each food management plan has its own variety of options... to eat their heart out...
College Sophomore,5,The night life is whatever you make of it... Parties are non alcoholic and full of smiling faces...
College Sophomore,5,Communicate with the counselors... and they will help you... Come ready with answers to their questions... Be prepared...
College Sophomore,5,"Living off campus is the best option for me... The amenities are great, and convenience favors the consumer, and the housing process is easy..."
College Sophomore,5,"Student involvement is voluntary and fan support is good, school spirit is contagious, athletic facilities are clean and spacious, and usually available to use."
College Sophomore,5,"The computer labs are plenty on campus, network reliability and speed is constantly good, wireless access is far reaching, and/or the need for a personal computer or printer is imperative."
College Sophomore,5,Outdoor Leadership - Let's go EXPLORING and Adventuring!
College Freshman,5,I have always felt very safe on campus. We have security that checks campus at different times of the day. We are also very near to a police department that helps us feel better about being on campus.
College Freshman,5,"I love my school. I love the Christian influence around campus. I have made great friends, and would never trade them. The professors actually care about the students. I have been to many of my professors houses, and they are all very caring to us. The student life is excellent. SGA is great at organzing fun student events that helps us get to know the student body better.  "
College Freshman,5,"I LOVE my dorm and the social events do not stop. The director of residency is always warm and welcoming, and (especially with Fant) it does not take too long to feel at home. "
College Freshman,5,"Intramural sports are a lot of fun, and the games are very lively and competitive!"
College Freshman,5,"I love my professors, and they truly open your eyes on necessary foundations of biology. The workload is more reading based and lab based than the other majors, but it's doable with dedication. The science building is small, but comfortable with great chemistry and biology lab set ups. 
"
College Freshman,5,"The apartments and small houses around campus are very comfortable, and the price is extremely reasonable. Often times, the professors will sponsor students to live in their own homes.  "
College Freshman,5,"The rules of this college is no use of drugs and alcohol during attendance, so for the most part this is not an issue. If when a rare chance happens that there is a drug or alcohol issue, that individual resolves the issue with authority in private.   "
Sophomore,4,"Online learning is no easy task and I was a little worried it would be a lot harder but the online class I took this summer was laid out perfectly, the Professor was quick with responses to emails and helping us and it fit my schedule well. We had one exercise a week where we could converse with the rest of the students in the class online. This discussion forum was my favorite because we were able to express how we felt on certain topics, listen to our peers and provide and receive feedback. Overall it was a pleasant experience that I would look into doing again."
Junior,4,"I have only ever taken online classes at TFC, but have truly loved every class! The teachers do everything in their power to make sure you are not just understanding the material, but will be able to thrive at your future career. Toccoa Falls is committed to your education and watching you flourish!!!"
Sophomore,4,"We had to switch online for the last two months of the spring semester of 2020. Having taken online classes before, it was not difficult for me to adjust, but I knew it was much harder for some. However, I do believe that the staff, professors, and our president of the school, poured every bit of energy into trying to make our online experience enjoyable and enriching. My grades did not suffer greatly, but they were definitely experiences and learning opportunities that I missed with not having those classes in person."
Freshman,4,My first year has been okay. I struggled to switch from high school to college and it wasn't easy. My first semester was pretty difficult because I didn't get along with my roommate and we finally started getting along and then the school year got canceled due to COVID-19. I'm really looking forward to the fall of 2020 because we are rooming together.
Freshman,4,"There are so many great things about TFC. You have the falls right on campus. The scenery on campus and the areas around it are absolutely beautiful. We have free counseling, free use of washing machines, intramural sports, numerous on-campus job opportunities, and free health services. Campus life is great because of how small it is. You get to know so many people so easily, so it is really easy to make friends. The only things I would improve is some of the dorm bathrooms, and I would want faster wifi as well."
Freshman,4,"I loved the atmosphere most of all. The area is breathtaking and it is a wonderful place to get away to study and to become closer with people and God. The student life can be very intimate and helpful, with everyone reachimg similar goals and becoming better people. The professors are reasonable and kind for the most part. The food is amazing and the staff are incredible."
Sophomore,4,"Toccoa Falls is a great place to be with a great community. With being such a small school, you get to know a lot of people and you build relationships and grow in your faith as well."
Junior,4,"Toccoa Falls College places a heavy emphasis on community and development of the whole person, not just in academics. Professors are personable and make it their goal to teach the importance of their material for your major even if it’s just a gen ed class."
Junior,4,"I love the college! People here are very friendly, and there is an emphasis on the Christian faith. There are many events and activities you can choose from. There are sports teams, theatrical society, student mission fellowship, and even a rock climbing club. The college encourages you to get out of the ""TFC bubble"" and engage in the local community, and especially to participate in a local church. Another reason I love it, is the beauty of the campus. I have been to three waterfalls on campus. There are also plenty of hiking trails to be found."
Sophomore,4,"The faculty is caring, great leaders of God, and wants to see you succeed. You just have to pick the right major if you want to get a good education (anything ministry, cross-cultural, education, are good. Music [unless it's worship arts], business, communications, not so much.) Since it's small, there isn't much options for friends, you just have to really look. Once you find your set, you should be good. Popularity unfortunately still matters and you may feel like you are still in high school."
Freshman,4,So far it’s been a really good experience. The professors are experienced and genuinely interested in their students.
Sophomore,4,I love TFC! I'm studying Youth Minitries. The professors are amazing. Id like to see the dorms get upgrades
Sophomore,4,I love the environment of Toccoa Falls College. It's a definitely a community. The only change I would like to see is maybe a little more support for our sports teams.
College Sophomore,4,"I haven't really explored job options yet, but I'm confident that finding employment with my degree won't be a problem."
College Sophomore,4,"Academics come first, but athletics are a valued part of campus life. The facilities are adequate and well maintained. Students are encouraged to attend games and most do. There's a lot of school spirit and pride among the student body."
College Junior,4,"I love TFC because it's flexible, passionate about raising up strong followers of Christ, and committed to academic success. I have loved my classes, and I've been able to immediately apply what I'm learning to my life. The staff is very friendly and helpful, and the campus provides a lot of fun activities for students. I especially love the history of the school,and that it is a part of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Knowing that I'm pursuing a ministry degree from a C&MA college gives me assurance that I'll be able to find a job when I complete my degree. I would recommend TFC to anyone!"
College Sophomore,4,Not the best in the world but always feel safe!
College Junior,4,Our safety and health play an important role.
College Junior,4,The career services try there best to work with us.
College Junior,4,Our basketball games are always incredible.
College Junior,4,I attended Toccoa Falls College to follow God.
College Freshman,4,"If you study hard and love what you're major is, you'll do great! The professors are great and God-fearing. Workload depends on your major. I'm a music major and it's somewhat a lot but I love it so it's completely worth it!"
College Freshman,4,It's an alcohol and drug free campus and almost all of the students love the lord and wouldn't dream of hurting anyone or anything
College Freshman,4,The classes are great and the professors incorporate God into their lessons!
College Freshman,4,"I love it! It is old, yet o love the history of each building, that's one of my favorite things about toccoa, the uniqueness of its history"
College Senior,4,"The buildings are a little run down but are all getting renovated at this time. There are several housing options on campus. The social life is great at Toccoa Falls College! People get along well and talk to everybody. There are houses, terraces, and dorms on campus."
College Senior,4,"I love my school because the campus is large, but mainly woods area. There are several hiking trails and waterfalls on my campus because it is in the mountains of Northeast Georgia. The professors care about the students and are very personable. The people are friendly and the classes are engaging."
College Freshman,4,"I enjoy being at Toccoa Falls to receive my education. The professors are wonderful and counseling is available anytime you need help. I enjoy going to church and getting closer to GOD, I have learned so much. I enjoy meeting the students that come from all over the United States and beyond. It is nice to experience the different cultures that many of the the students come from, learning of their life and how they came to Toccoa Falls College. I especially like being on campus, we are like one big family and everyone is eager to help you in any situation. I think the sports program are extremely well put together, the coaches are amazing. I play basketball and I am not just part of the the team, but part of a family.

 at Toccoa, they want you to succeed and be the best person you can be. I love Toccoa !"
College Junior,4,The off- campus housing provides plenty of options for students to live at and they are also very cheap which works perfectly for any college student.
College Junior,4,The campus security does an incredible job at the college. The School itself is amazing when it comes to the strictness about drugs and alcohol and tobacco on campus which helps to provide a much better and safer environment
College Junior,4,The financial aid at Toccoa Falls College has been wonderful. They have helped me find money and helped make it possible for me to be able to attend the College with ease and they work very well with payment plans when it comes to loans.
College Freshman,4,"The community life at Toccoa Falls College creates an atmosphere of community that is very enjoyable. It is a small campus, which allows one to know the majority of the students on campus on a first name basis. Living on  campus allows one to get to know others well and create great relationships."
College Sophomore,4,"Very pretty and isolated in nature, but there's a small town o Toccoa where lots of outreach can happen. Peaceful."
College Sophomore,4,"It's a small campus where the staff and residents assistants receive training that makes the students very secure. The teachers personally will step in and aid whenever needed. The campus knows one another by face, and teachers and adults are commonly present at all times."
College Sophomore,4,"Biology majors make up about 5% of the school. It's a hard program to get into, but the training is great and aimed to prepare for the MCAT. I've heard good things about continuing after undergrad studies here."
College Freshman,4,"i love the campus housing, it is very spacey and easy to get around"
College Sophomore,4,The historical events of the pass and memorials on campus serve great for giving thanks and learning more about the past.
College Sophomore,4,The diversity of the weather here sets up so many different events and awesome experiences.
College Sophomore,4,"I can only give four stars because of the fact that often the faculty and staff are as disorganized as the students. However, the general feeling around campus is that our education is important and that what we are learning as students is valuable to our field of study."
College Sophomore,4,Intramural sports are huge on campus. Most students are involved with them in one way or another and they are usually more popular than varsity sporting events.
College Sophomore,4,"I love living on campus. Everything is beautiful and although some buildings are less kept up with than others, it is generally a good place to live. The housing, with a few exceptions. is at the heart of campus and everything is easy to get to."
College Sophomore,4,"It is a 'first come, first serve deal'... so getting early to the student parking lots is worth the effort."
College Freshman,4,"There are many long term relationships around campus. The guys and girls are very appropiate when it comes to clothing. There is many musical talent around campus, and everyone is seeking God with all their hearts. Guys and girls are friends, and usually plan many fun events together.  "
College Freshman,4,"The atmosphere in Toccoa is very peaceful. We are located near the police station, and have a hospital walking distance to the school. We have Wal-Mart which is very helpful in buying all our daily needs. We have a lot of gas stations that have cheap prices. There are also many thrift stores, which makes it easy to find good cheap clothing. "
College Freshman,4,"The professors are so passionate and willing to help the students. The curriculum, especially after the generals, becomes very challenging and measures up well when compared state-wise. "
College Freshman,4,"The people one campus are super nice, and they are each inspiring in their own way, with their own walks. Everyone knows one another, and the games and school activities are always lively!"
College Freshman,4,"The computers in the library are many and work well! The only issue is getting wifi on your laptop during the night or when in your dorms. Only sometimes, will this present itself as a problem. "
College Sophomore,4,"TFC administration works hard to keep students safe.  This is a Christian school with clear rules and boundaries for the students' own good, but also grace is often extended when students mess up.  There are curfews, but it's not super strict as long as you talk to your RA and follow the appropriate guidelines.  Curfews also get later as you become an upperclassman.  There are appropriate, clearly-outlined consequences when rules are broken."
College Sophomore,4,"One thing I really appreciate about TFC is how everyone is so different, yet we all get along so well and learn from each other.  All students are evangelical Christians, but there is a lot of diversity within that broad category.  People come from many different denominations and church backgrounds, and we also have a lot of third-culture kids from far away countries."
College Sophomore,4,"Has had significant improvement as of recent years. We have seen a big jump in quality and desirable items. Still is a little too much fried ""cheap"" food choices that pop up close to restocking day but it is okay because there are other options less than five minutes away in town."
College Sophomore,4,"It is not the absolute best, but for a college this small too much security would be a waste of valuable money that could be used elsewhere. The health care places like the nurses areas should be upgraded, but generally you just avoid them and go to the adjoining hospital literally a short walk away for any issues."
College Sophomore,4,The community at the dorms and campus housing are absolutely huge at this college. People feel welcomed and have a blast hanging out and living with their peers. Getting to know the experiences that others have faced has strengthened my faith and grew my maturity far more than any nice Jacuzzi or other unnecessary amenity could have.
College Senior,4,"Our facilities are appropriate to a college our size.  The student center includes the cafeteria, post office, a small, fast-food type restaurant (that isn't fast), a student lounge (which includes about three couches, a few tables, and a tv), and a new convenience store inside of the student lounge.  

The gym includes a new cardio room, and there is also a weight room that was a new addition in the spring of '13.  We don't have a football team, but we have a soccer field, a baseball diamond, an intramural field where various sports teams practice, and a beautiful, mostly soft-surface, cross country course, which is a favorite of teams in our league."
College Senior,4,"The size of TFC, in my opinon, is almost perfect.  At about 750 students, it's big enough to have a variety of opportunities, but small enough that you know a significant portion of the student body, even the people you don't know all look familiar, and the professors not only remember your name, but take the time to get to know you and become your friends and mentors.  
The facilities vary in quality, since it's an old campus and there are a variety of newer and older buildings.  The setting of the campus really can't be beat.  Nestled in the North Georgia mountains, it would be pretty enough even if it weren't home to the highest free-falling waterfall east of the Mississippi River."
College Sophomore,4,"To get accepted to the music department I had to audition as well as get accepted to the school, and then declare my major after my first semester."
College Sophomore,4,"TFC is in the mountains, so there are a lot of hiking trails and other fun things to do nearby.  The town is not so great, it's very small, so for people who don't like outdoor fun there's not much to do."
Recent Alumnus,4,A lot of kids come from around the country and the world because of missions.
College Sophomore,4,"I am very satisfied with the professors in my program because each of them have had many years of experience under their belts! They have a lot of knowledge to pass on to their students (us). They don't hold back when it comes to talking about the negatives of the program the careers. That is something that it very respectable in my opinion. I would rather have someone be blunt with me about the program and career I am going into than have someone sugar coat and tell me what I want to hear. The workload is something else! I have only been in a few classes that really go into depth about my program, but I have quite a few friends that are taking the classes that require a lot more attention and they say the workload is tremendous and the exams are exhausting! I just know that when I am able to graduate, I will have some connections to help me find a job after school. That's a huge plus!"
College Senior,4,Getting all of my transcripts was a little frustrating because I had transferred from two other colleges. Other than that it was pretty easy.
College Senior,4,"My career goal is basically to get a job that I can afford to live off of. I want to teach, and love working with children, so I'm glad to be getting a degree in early childhood education. I can't say that I would have chosen a different college because I met the man I'm going to marry, but if that was not a factor, I would definitely have gone to community college for all of general education and transferred to a school with a more affordable program to finish. The education in my particular program at this college is not worth the debt. I have positive opinions of the college for many many other reasons, but right now the head of the education department is someone that I think was overextended while I was a student and micromanaged a lot of things and inefficiently at that."
Alum,2,"Professors were great; the financial aid department (when I was there) was in over their head with stealing money from students.  The alumni association is out for money, and for a private ""Christian"" (which has since become a joke) college, they were certainly very greedy and unhelpful.  Poor communication until last minute. BEAUTIFUL scenery around the area and tiny town, though!"
College Freshman,2,It's a Christian school and you need to be Christian to attend
College Sophomore,2,They give little to no help for off campus living.
College Sophomore,2,"Their is nothing to do at all at night, every single night."
College Sophomore,2,"There are no local ways of getting around if you don't have a car or have a friend who has a car. I was fortunate enough to bring mine all the way from Maine the first semester, but when it broke down I was without a car for the better part of six months and it was a humbling, trying, and extremely frustrating time."
College Junior,2,"We Need Help – There are no transportation options available. You either have a car, a friend, or your two legs."
College Junior,2,Dorm Life – Cost and amenities aren't great. If you're coming to TFC then it's most likely for the Biblical teaching and preparation for ministry. The social atmosphere in the dorms is good for building a future network. Try and get a terrace or off-campus ASAP! Student life is up to you to find something interesting to do.
College Freshman,2,"I do not like that housing options here at school. We have to live in the dorms unless we are a Jr. or Senior, and then we can live in the apartments on campus. I think the cost is expensive and that I am being treated as a child. I would rather live off campus, but that is not a choice. I do like being near stuff and my friends, but that is about it."
College Freshman,2,"Dining Hall – The Dining Hall is a quick way to get food. I do not think the quality is great for the price we pay to eat there and as a student we have to. The Eagles Nest has better tasting food, but it cost a lot of many that us poor college students don't have. The variety is continually increasing, but the food is still not that great. We do have the option to decrease the amount of meals we eat in the dining hall and with that we get a deducting balance for other places on campus."
College Freshman,2,Same Old Stuff – Theres many fast food places and only a few actual restraunts. So it gets very old after awhile.
College Sophomore,2,"It's College Cafeteria Food It's Not Going to Be Filet Mignon!!! The food is ok at TFC. I have some stomach issues so my choices are sometimes limited, but I manage to deal with it and survive. It is better than having no food at all. We do have the Eagle's Nest restaurant on campus and their food is pretty good. They are always a good back up."
College Freshman,2,"don't own a care or bike, but one's necessary for getting into town because of the lack of a bus stop on campus, and the countryside location of the college."
College Freshman,2,Depends on Your Cravings – I have food allergies so I have had a hard time finding places to eat out.  There are a few places but I haven't been able to try them.  Las Palmos is reasonably priced and the food is good.  The waiters are very friendly.
College Senior,2,"There is not much diversity on campus, everyone is christian there maybe a few people with different political beliefs, but most of the issues between people we have are between what kind of bible they read of if the believe in predestination or not."
College Senior,2,"General Campus Aesthetics – There is really no place for students to hang out in a co-ed environment besides the small coffee shop that gets crowded very easily. Out student center is only for going to eat at and as a meeting place, there is no where for people to really just hang out at. The computer labs and Library are pretty good and easily accessible most of the time. Our Gym and athletic center is not very good at all, we have a small weight room that mostly only guys use, there are no bikes or treadmills, just basic weight lifting equipment, most people that want to work out have to get gym memberships in town or just run around campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The Seen, Unseen, and Untalked About – Nightlife on campus is not quite exciting unless you get into trouble or know people that have great ideas. Generally our campus consistes of work-a-holoics, play-a-holics, sport-a-holics, and even some alcoholics.
Most of the activities that students get inolved with are the randomn giving back to the community, spending time with friends, hiking, intermural sports, running, volleyball, basketball games, perk-up cafe, Java cafe, wal-mart, or even a brisk walk around the park. For the most part the movie theaters areound here are crap and the bowling alley is way less than average, but it is something to do when everyone is bored.
Although, people who say they are populare are the ones going out to buy beer or get drugs and they hang around shadowy places and people to keep their nightlife interesting."
Alum,1,"Expect excessive, significant student loan debt, with a job that doesn't pay as well as needed to pay off these loans. Expect instructors and others to gossip. 
Expect a type of nepotism (long lines of families attending for generations with a lot of preference towards those students in a variety of ways.) Expect to be sent to collections if there is campus debt, even if you make arrangements with the business office. Don't expect grace to be given with regards to those debts, regardless of your circumstances."
College Junior,1,We currently do not have Greek Life.
College Freshman,1,There is no Greek life
College Sophomore,1,There is no reliability on the wifi networks.
College Sophomore,1,There is so much room for improvement.
College Sophomore,1,Their is one place open late at night every night besides walmart.
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have a Greek life society and it isn't very likely we will ever have one, which is fine by most students."
College Sophomore,1,Here is the bottom line when it comes to this page. Regardless of whether you live off or on campus you are not allowed to do such immoral things. Sexual immorality is not something that is at all justified even outside of a Christian college setting.
Recent Alumnus,1,The dorms are sad. You cannot live off campus until you are 23 and the only way you can live off campus is to live near the school. The dorms are old and since Toccoa had a flood like 30 years ago some of the buildings are infected with mold. Some RAs (girls) are super strict too.
College Student,1,The Education here is under qualified and not worth what it costs.I am in the Counseling College and the professors tend to bring their personal experiences in over what the book teaches. And they seem to be depressed and under motivated.
College Freshman,1,"The college is just outside of a small country town. In the mountains. The result is a very isolated atmosphere. No local mall, most of the town and county is poor."
College Freshman,1,Everything's run down. The view is good but nothing close to state-of-the-art here.
College Student,1,"Food at TFC – The food here on campus is not good at all. There are days when it is okay but for the most part, the food is not good. There is not really that much variety, and sometimes the food is old."
College Sophomore,1,"There is SO much rain. Rainy days really make things miserable, and it rains a lot, and when there is rain, it rains all day.  But when its sunny, its very beautiful."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Mediocrity at Best – The food at the dining hall of Toccoa Falls College is mediocre at best especially when i is any other monday. On the exception of wednesday when they have mexican food day. They seem to have a desire to make variety, which is encouraging, but most of the time the meals are less than appetizing.
I dislike the food options so much that I am comforted by the option to buy my on groceries eat in my apartment than to go into the cafeteria on any other week day wheere most of the social activities take place. 
The best meal that they have is in the morning with their omletes and bacon, but most of the time their pre-cooked eggs are revolting and their hasbrowns are stail, so Overall I would give them a rating of 2 in the 1-10 range."

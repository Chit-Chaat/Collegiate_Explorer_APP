Alum,5,"Attending Johns Hopkins after four years at a mediocre public high school in Rhode Island changed my life. JHU taught me many things in addition to all the book learning such as independence, time management, the value of hard work, and the knowledge that I could compete with the smartest kids around."
Alum,5,No online experience as I am far too old for that. I’m sure it would have been fine but I can’t comment on it.
Freshman,5,"Johns Hopkins is one of the best schools in the country to attend! If you want to do undergraduate research, then look no further; you have found the perfect place. The campus is small, so it is pretty easy to get to where you want to be. If you don't have a car, then you shouldn't worry because you won't have to drive anywhere. Johns Hopkins is also very strong for STEM and pretty much anything medical related."
Alum,5,"I had a lovely time in my undergraduate experience at Hopkins. I learned a lot, and your classmates are extremely intelligent. There are issues and areas where the school could improve, but overall I learned a lot and met great people."
Graduate Student,5,"Tremendous faculty. Blend between business and public health programs enables using different lenses to view problems from different angles. Online programs are well-considered, and alumni network is amazing."
Graduate Student,5,Amazing online experience - particularly in the middle of the pandemic. Faculty are exceptional online teachers and are available every day of the week.
Sophomore,5,"I am a rising sophomore at the Hopkins Whiting School of Engineering majoring in engineering and computer science. I had a great freshman year despite finishing with 44 credits in some very challenging courses. Professors not TA's taught my courses and they as well as their TA's did a great job of being accessible when I needed assistance. Hopkins offers additonal tutoring and review sessions which were very helpful. The classes were small and intimate and I felt comfortable and engaged and the content was right on target with my expectations. I was also able to obtain a research assistant position as a freshman and was able to meet directly with the department chair which was thrilling. Johns Hopkins has met and exceeded my expectations. I have found the environment to be challenging but collaborative and not competitive at all. Even with the pandemic, my freshman year turned out to be a great one THANKS to Johns Hopkins!"
Sophomore,5,"My online learning experience has been great with little or no disruption from my in-person coursework. The professors, TA's and Hopkins administration have been wonderful, understanding, compassionate and patient due to COVID-19. Being at Hopkins online and in-person have both been a great experience!"
Niche User,5,It was a great experience. The professors were phenomenal as always. I learned a lot as they were very knowledgeable
Graduate Student,5,"I have taken three online classes. My main class was one to one and worked great. We planned all the classes on zoom and sometimes send some files before connecting, so we could review them together while the zoom class."
Niche User,5,Great academics. Students are very driven and hardworking. Professors are great too. Lots of resources to be the best student you can
Freshman,5,"I'm attending the Johns Hopkins Peabody Conservatory of Music, and I can firmly say that it's the perfect fit for me. The campus is small but very charming with a lot of history. Everyone is very nice, and I feel at home even though I moved across the country to attend."
Niche User,5,Great place! Lovely resources and campus and people! This is definitely a top choice for STEM students.
Niche User,5,"I love John Hopkins University! The different diversity that the school has to offer is incredible. The Campus is amazing, the athletes are so determined when it comes to their sport. The dorms are super! They are spacious and comfortable. If you ever get bored on campus, you can always go off campus; it's amazing.The campus food is spectacular, you'll never get tired of eating at the cafeteria."

Junior,5,"I transferred here as a junior and I absolutely enjoyed my my experience at Hopkins. I will go into academia in the future so I really wanted to attend a college with strong academic background. Most classes here are challenging, even for the majors that don’t have a high national ranking. I went to a very competitive high school, so I think Hopkins is manageable. Also I don’t care about social life so I have a lot of time to study"
Freshman,5,"Hopkins is my second home. I feel supported and encouraged to pursue my dreams, and the pre-professional counselors are really helpful. We certainly are the best research university in the country. They are very focused on student development as well as student health, physically and mentally."
Freshman,5,"So far, there's been a lot of emphasis on academics. I've also noticed that, while not widespread, some people are extremely competitive due to the huge premed population."
Junior,5,"Yes, Hopkins is stressful (yay stress culture) and yes, it has its issues. However, I feel as thought Hopkins truly excelled in the areas that matter to me. I feel like there are genuinely some many different types of people that making friends shouldn't be hard for everyone, that professors are helpful and willing to work with you, and that there is plenty of research!
The real key to success here, as in any other school, is to do your work early, reach out to teachers and TAs and chill out!
At Hopkins your experience is truly what you make it."
Freshman,5,stellar academic opportunities! there are many research opportunities and i love the faculty and the students. the campus is very beautiful
Graduate Student,5,Excellent learning experience. Exceptionally knowledgeable Professors. Friendly atmosphere. Safe student life. Well equipped library.Gives prime importance for research. I consider it a great privilege to be a student at this University. #1 DNP program. #1 Online education. # 1 Graduate nursing school.
Sophomore,5,I love that Hopkins has all of the research opportunities that I was looking for as an incoming freshman. Hopkins does have certain political alliances that I do not agree with and is known for being very financially motivated in their policies.
Senior,5,"Tough school, but great resources, students, and teachers! I learned a lot in and was given the opportunities to push myself and learn what I want to learn."
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful and they put a big focus on their students. I love how the campus is not far from many exciting things in Baltimore like the Inner Harbor, which is full of great stores, food, and other attractions. The dorms at the college are great, and the walks to class are not too bad. There are so many amazing clubs you can be a part of, which is great if you want to be involved while you are at college!"
Alum,5,I earned my master's degree at JHU.  It has been the foundation for my entire career since then.  I was fortunate to have great teachers and professors.
Graduate Student,5,"The professors here want you to learn. They're personable and usually available through multiple contacts, such as email and by text. 
The campus community strives for inclusion and development."
Niche User,5,nice environment that promotes students to push their boundaries and expand their knowledge. Great school over all in terms of academics.
Sophomore,5,"At Hopkins, everyone is motivated to learn and work hard in their academics. There is a fair amount of pressure to do well through peer competition, but I think it is a beneficial amount. The school has a beautiful campus and a good number of facilities for studying and socializing. The majority of instructors and professors care deeply for the students and the material that they teach. There could be improvements in student-administration communication."
Sophomore,5,"The school location is good. Convenient transportation. Shopping is very convenient.

The food in the cafeteria is always not fresh,  hope to improve, and the meal is too expensive"
Graduate Student,5,"An outstanding college that lives up to its reputation. A world-class education. For a grad program, this is where you want to go."
Alum,5,"Johns Hopkins will open doors for you for the rest of your life. Students here are committed to academics at the highest level of achievement, but rather than breeding competition and ill will, the shared experience of rigor and hard work creates a sense of community and camaraderie among students. It can be difficult to strike a balance between study and student life at Hopkins, but there are opportunities available to students who are interested in being social. Hopkins has hundreds of clubs, Greek Life, sports, and events like Spring Fair, which is easily the most fun weekend of the year."
Alum,5,"I had a really amazing time during my undergraduate years at Hopkins. I made lifelong friends and was able to create a lot of meaningful memories even while I was busy with all my pre-med activities and other academics. Hopkins is not as cut-throat as people make it to be, but it is challenging and it can be quite a humbling experience when you first get here."
Niche User,5,"Phenomenal! This school is single-handedly one of the most prestigious medical schools that one can attend. Although, this is at the depravity of athletics."
Graduate Student,5,"The Financial Aid process has gone really well, and the person appointed to my account has been really dedicated to getting back to me quickly."
Graduate Student,5,I am waiting the answers for my admittance into JHU and I have never received such support and help as I have from this school.
Works Here,5,My research work here has been at great experience and had led to live changing career opportunities. I am led by world renown professors in cutting edge research every day.
Graduate Student,5,I'm just getting started in an online program in applied and computational mathematics but so far the advisors and staff have been incredibly helpful and supportive. If only it wasn't so expensive.
Graduate Student,5,"As an online- grad student, my experience ""at"" JHU has been more fufullining than my time as an undergraduate [elsewhere]. The professors are all wonderful- knowledgable and helpful and my fellow classmates have been great students and connections."
Freshman,5,"Johns Hopkins is a very excellent school overall! There are many different clubs for almost anything you can thing of, if there isn't something your interested in it is very easy to create a new club! The academic program are amazing and the professors are very nice and helpful."
Freshman,5,"I'm at Peabody Conservatory at Johns Hopkins, so far I'm loving it! As a performing artist in dance there are many opportunities to not only perform, but to collaborate with musical instruments. It's a great university to be at to be pushed everyday to try something new."
Sophomore,5,"Hopkins is a great school with great academics. If you find your place and people, your years here will be amazing."
Alum,5,Attending Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing was an excellent experience that provided me with an exceptional education as well as lifelong friendships. I would highly recommend attending if given the opportunity. It was a second degree program for me and we were not at the Homewood campus so I cannot attest to the dorms or campus food. The city of Baltimore was so much fun to be a part of!
Freshman,5,My experience with Johns Hopkins University has proven to be positive.  The courses are challenging to prepare students for real-world encounters.
Sophomore,5,"Johns Hopkins is an amazing school, and although the curriculum can be very difficult and is very challenging, the opportunities are endless, especially if you're on the engineering/science/premed path."
Sophomore,5,"This University is a very rigorous one, but the hard work definitely pays off. The study body is quite divided however, and not many students leave the library! Greek life is really good at Hopkins and not as pretentious as some other schools of the same caliber. The athletes don't socialize much with other students, but besides that I have made some great friends!"
Niche User,5,Lovely camps and great programs. I'd definitely recommend for those wishing to get a higher education in the medical field.
Sophomore,5,"The school is highly competitive in its academics as all top-20 universities are, but there is a lot of outreach and resources for students to thrive like PILOT and the Learning Den. There is a lack of direct attention from faculty and professors unless you seek it out."
Sophomore,5,"I have had so many opportunities at Hopkins, and I can't imagine I'd be exposed to as much as I am had I gone elsewhere. The coursework is doable if you are willing to work hard, but it will definitely be a shock to anyone coming from any high school. Be prepared to fail a few times before you get the hang of things, but you will love to people here and all of the experiences."
Graduate Student,5,"For years, Johns Hopkins has been my dream school. I just got accepted for the graduate program, and I am so excited, but unfortunately that means I can't review the school based off experience yet. However, it is a very prestigious institution and I have heard nothing but great things. So far, for the most part, the staff have been very nice and helpful during my registration and financial aid process."
Graduate Student,5,"I am a first year graduate student in their online Museum Studies program. So far, I love everything about Johns Hopkins University. My professors have been very attentive and answer all my questions quickly, the work is very relevant and there are so many resources to help me. JHU's admissions office and academic advisors have been in constant contact with me, making sure I was all set for the semester. My student alumni ambassador is a wonderful person who has been helping me with JHU on a personally experienced level as she has graduated from the same program. I am proud to be a part of the JHU community!"
Graduate Student,5,"Johns hopkins has access to many resources including options for not only in academia but as part of your field of study. The buildings provide an positive academic environment and the campus is filled with so much activity (including clubs, sports and green space). Go blue jays"
Graduate Student,5,"John Hopkins is one of the top 100 schools in the world, rating it to number 20 to the scale. They have the greatest hospitals in the entire universities. I am really competitive and ready to take on the whole world. My doctor path starts here."
Niche User,5,It is a very fun school. Being at Johns Hopkins University is like a roller coaster. There may be ups and downs but you could make it through in the end.
Graduate Student,5,Fabulous experience so far! I feel like I'm getting the best possible education in my chosen career path as a nurse. Definitely recommend it to everyone interested in pursuing a nursing degree.
Graduate Student,5,"I love the MS Biotechnology program at JHU. I love the professors, they are very knowledgeable and help one to succeed. The workload is more byt wut worth all the money spent."
Freshman,5,"Johns Hopkins is really what you make of it, and it certainly isn't for everyone. If you are looking for a school where you can get an easy 4.0 and go to graduate or medical school, this is not the place.
If you want a school where you can do incredible research as early as your freshman year and continue that for grad school, this is a good place.

I personally intend on going into industry and my average GPA (3.3) has landed me several internships with Fortune 500 companies already (I'm going to be making almost $15,000 this summer alone). Doing well here requires a lot of work, but if you manage your time well then you can also have a great social life. I go out to bars and parties on average 4 nights a week, and still get pretty good grades."
Senior,5,"Love the people- if you find the right group, they'll be the ones to help carry you through four years of college and beyond. Academics is challenging. Learn how to be independent. Wish there were better good options nearby though. And more things to do off campus. But living in Baltimore gives us a chance to see real world crises... And how great a necessity there is to serve those who are less fortunate in social justice areas."
Niche User,5,"Johns Hopkins is a beautiful campus. The food is delicious, the people are accepting,  and the city is gorgeous. Besides having amazing academics Johns Hopkins also has a great athletic program."
Niche User,5,Accepted early decision to Johns Hopkins.  Everyone at the university has been wonderful so far.  Looking forward to attending in the fall.
Graduate Student,5,"A very prestigious university with top-notch classes, professors, and student advising. Baltimore can be a gem if you know where to go, and are aware of your surroundings!"
Junior,4,"Hopkins undoubtedly challenges you academically. This may be due to the coursework/material itself, or because some professors can lack basic teaching skills."
Sophomore,4,"The online classes I took were due to the COVID-19 crisis, so the professors weren't really prepared to teach a course online, but it ended up being okay."
Sophomore,4,"It's a great place to go to college! I love the people and the campus, and everything is amazing! However, if there were one thing to work on, they need to do a better job of communication. Especially with the COVID-19 crisis going on, they never really told us anything about their plans until less than a week ago, and students need more time to make a decision about their plans."
Freshman,4,"My online learning experience at Johns Hopkins has been hard to adjust to since I am used to being taught in person. Despite the challenges that I faced, I will try my best to keep learning and to never give up even when the obstacles are stacked against me."
Sophomore,4,"Johns Hopkins has very challenging courses and greatly promotes innovative and divergent thinking. Although the rigorous workload can be overwhelming at times, it is very beneficial in terms of dealing with stress, time management, and finding your true passion in life."
Sophomore,4,I took online courses for the spring semester due to the covid-19 cases that arose and resulted in the closing of the school. The classes were mostly updated online and put on Blackboard which was beneficial for future reference and maintaining the neatness of the class notes. The teachers are very understanding of the situation and do their best to help with the change of learning format.
Junior,4,Academic rigor is definitely there! I feel that I will be more than prepared for my future career with all the lessons and important material I've learned here.
Junior,4,"The faculty and staff at Johns Hopkins University are wonderful.  The academic rigor can be overbearing at times, but most of the courses are interactive and engaging.  There are hundreds research opportunities and I would recommend applying to Hopkins if you are interested in the medical field or engineering.
However, the cost of attendance is very high and the offered financial aid is often not enough to support accepted students.  Scholarships and student loans are essential if your parents cannot afford to pay the required amount."
Junior,4,"The academics are what really make the university amazing- the professors are considerate and inspiring.  The social life and student life is what you make of it, though it is definitely difficult to connect with most of the students because they are very intense and competitive. It is definitely a very difficult 4 years and hard to get through. But, in the end it makes you stronger and you learn so much and have so many fantastic opportunities."
Graduate Student,4,I've studied at Johns Hopkins University for two years. The faculty was great and I felt how the university takes care of the students.
Junior,4,"It is a great university for people who are interested in research. The career center is not as great as it can be, and it lacks some resources that some other universities may have. Nonetheless, it is a great research institution that puts a lot of emphasis on undergrad research. The academics are excellent, and the professors are some of the best in the country in terms of research potentials, so you get to do amazing stuff with them, but that does not mean that their teaching is great. Sometimes the professors are only focused on their research so that they do not care too much about the undergrad courses that they teach. Things are pretty overpriced in and out of campus (surrounding area). Students here are very passionate about what they study and they put all into their studies, which means that social life is sometimes lacking. There will be more students interested in studying than the students who are interested in partying and socializing."
Senior,4,"Endless opportunities to get involved in research. For many majors, research is even required. Rigorous coursework if you are pursuing STEM. Relatively diverse and progressive campus. Baltimore is a great city. I wish the university did more to support the Baltimore community and inspired its students to get plugged into the community. Many students are involved in social justice work, but the university does not encourage it."
Senior,4,"Johns Hopkins is very strong academically. The campus itself is very safe and I've come to appreciate living in Baltimore. Some things I don't like are the high cost of tuition, that the student life office is not very responsive, and the campus has poor drainage when it rains."
Sophomore,4,"I love the people that I have met and formed friendships with. I think the only thing that gets really overwhelming is the fact that most students want to go to medical school. So, if you're pre-med, you often feel like you're up against a lot of competition, since it is so easy to feel like you're not doing enough or as much as someone else is doing. However, having good friends is very important, as well as joining clubs and organizations that matter to you."
Niche User,4,"An ivy-league type school right in the state of Maryland. Diverse university with great professors, rigorous courses, and like-minded students."
Freshman,4,Johns Hopkins have so many available resources on campus to help freshmen and everyone academically. As a first year international student it was really hard being away from home but it having caring ppl around me really helped me to adjust. The food could be a bit better.
Niche User,4,"yes i done courses some of them by internships and projects i was from India overall good friendly atmosphere nice infrastructure and top class professors

you can do some online courses provided by them which is online by coursera if you do those believe me you want to go to university at any cost 


the research institute was excellent with great and well manned hardworking people here mostly not only focus on studies but also for sports and other activities which are some them are even went to nationals and some of them went for internationals   

campus life was awesome its very good atmosphere where you can enjoy and study a lot and have fun with friends 

accommodations  was there you can book online or reach student council there or you can stay outside the campus .

overall very good"
Niche User,4,All about the academics. There is not a huge party scene but there are activities in the near by area.
Alum,4,"I loved my time at Hopkins, but it was definitely a pressure cooker. I've heard some majors are very cutthroat, but I didn't have that experience at all - honestly I would not have gotten through all four years without my friends. Personally, I loved my professors and thought they were all pretty approachable (especially in the Mechanical Engineering department)"
Freshman,4,"Johns Hopkins University has been a place of growth for me. With limitless academic advising and a deep sense of service within the community, it is a university for the next leaders in science."
Sophomore,4,"It's a nice school with strong academics and lots of opportunities for research and more. GPA deflation isn't really a thing, but it feels like it is sometimes. The local area isn't as safe as it could be, but if you have some common sense as you walk around you'll be fine."
Niche User,4,"Nice campus, but small community area to move with. The safety is always a concern for a freshman. But the quality of professors and academic environments are good. The food varieties and qualities need to be improved."
Freshman,4,The community has been really supportive and there is such a positive atmosphere. I wish that more of the opportunities for students such as SOHOP and ED day weren't as expensive to attend.
Sophomore,4,"Johns Hopkins provides all of the tools academically to succeed. Being a liberal arts research institute, there are a large number of opportunities to branch out and study in multiple disciplines. You are able to have a well-rounded, full academic experience all while receiving top-notch teaching in all areas. The workload is heavy and the coursework can be difficult. The campus is very nice and secure. The surrounding area is full of life and provides an opportunity to understand the surrounding city. The students are collaborative and are willing to help each other when in need. The dorms and food around campus are very good as well."
Freshman,4,"I definitely recommend this school for biomedical engineering or anything medical; my friend from UCLA says that my biomedical engineering experiences seem much better or more interesting/comprehensive than those of hers at UCLA. Unless you have a good financial aid package, I'd recommend an assumably cheaper public state university over JHU if you're not interested in medicine or music."
Freshman,4,"Overall, my school experience has been pretty good. I like my classes because they emulate the expected rigor. However, the party scene is horrible and I wish there were more options to get away and de stress without spending some money."
Graduate Student,4,100% online advanced degrees with unique program offerings. This is the only program of its kind that I was able to find.
Freshman,4,"very good

Alum,4,"This school lives up to its reputation of cut-throat competitive culture, complete with raging stress that has resulted in many of my friends having to take a semester or year off. However, the best thing that can be pulled from this school is its networking power. Drop the name anywhere, and people trust you for no reason in your field of work. If you want to go anywhere in the world, there will be someone in power in he right department to take you there. It has done me good while I've started my career path, even if I did completely loathe the four years I was physically there."
Freshman,4,"Johns Hopkins is a wonderful institute for students planning to go into medicine. All of the professors really take the time to make sure students are learning the material. It is really easy to set up an appointment with your professors to go over the material, and they are more than willing to help. One of the big downsides is the safety. Baltimore is a crime-ridden and it is very dangerious walking alone at night."
Graduate Student,4,I like the support from the professor. They really are here to help you. The dean is very approachable and wants to make sure your experience is great. There are lots of activities and opportunities to network.
Sophomore,4,"I love that JHU is such an inclusive campus. Also, the campus is very beautiful all year round. Couldn't be happier with my decision!"
Junior,4,"The best thing about Hopkins is the great number of career/research opportunities that are available to you. You can quite easily start working in world-class labs starting from your first year of college (not a common opportunity at other schools). However, due to having a big academic focus, the workload gets heavy and there is grade deflation. It stops me from attempting to try out new courses because I'm fearful of bad grades (when college should be a time to explore into your interests). But even so, if you endure that and really take advantage of the numerous career opportunities you have, the effort and work pay off in the end. Also, because you have to try really hard for good grades, you really end up learning a lot academically. 

In terms of campus life, unfortunately, Baltimore is not the safest neighbourhood and while the campus is safe, it gets pretty boring. There aren't very many club activities as people are more focused on their academics..."
Junior,4,"Johns Hopkins is a very challenging school, but has many resources to help students succeed. The alumni network is great for connecting students to careers, and professors are willing to help students. The social culture can definitely be improved, along with school spirit."
Niche User,4,Various academic resources are available across the spectrum of majors at JHU. Professors and teaching assistants are extremely helpful as long as students are taking initiative to reach out and work hard. There are so many different extracurricular activities it's hard to not find your own little group or place to fit in and thrive.
Sophomore,4,There is a strong emphasis on academics. A large percentage of the students are constantly stressed about their courses.
Sophomore,4,"Be prepared to work hard if you want to go here. The vast majority of the students go above and beyond to succeed or else they wouldn't be here. Despite the impressive work ethic of the student body, most students still manage to have a good time on the weekends and after classes. Hopkins' reputation as being a soul sucking university really only applies to the pre-med students who stick it out until senior year, so unless you plan to be one, never fear!"
Sophomore,4,"Hopkins is a place most people have a love/hate relationship with. The academics are brutal, and the social life can be limited, but overall the school is filled with brilliant professors and hardworking students. You will rarely find yourself outside the library, but when you do the campus is scenic and has lots of great spaces to hangout outside. Most students are involved in research, which is very easy to find. The club offerings are wide and it’s highly recommended you join some. The social scene is small but lively. Most people looking for more social events join a club or fraternity. Location wise, Baltimore is not the best city or college town, but is at least cheap. There isn’t too much to do in the surrounding area."
Graduate Student,4,Very quick turnaround process for the application for graduate school! I received my decision within 2 weeks of submitting my application
Niche User,4,Very clean with great security. There’s no worries of feeling unsafe. Very active and lively in the evening including the early mornings.
Sophomore,4,"The overall student atmosphere is very welcoming and pleasant, you definitely get the sense of a family on campus, and the teachers are effective at conveying the material. Unfortunately, there has been a lot of robberies/mugging occurrences lately which really hurts my opinion on the school. The food is also not the best, though that is apparently being changed moving forward."
Alum,4,"Great school, not as scary or competitive as some rumors would suggest. I had an amazing time in the vibrant Jewish community and the phenomenal a cappella scene!"
Sophomore,4,"Johns Hopkins offers an incredible academic experience. The professors are approachable and eager to help students succeed, as are the students who work to help one another. Opportunities will continually present themselves, and the networking chances are abundant. From STEM majors to the arts, Hopkins provides an enriching educational experience."
Sophomore,4,"The most valuable aspects of an education at JH are the small class sizes and the renowned professors, who are extremely accessible to undergrads, despite their busy professional lives and world-class credentials. The class environment is typically very lively and dynamic, encouraging student participation and direct learning with the teacher."
Freshman,4,"I liked Johns Hopkins diversity of students from all around. The campus is beautiful and definitely a place some may get lost in. I recommend taking a college tour before actually applying to the university, only because the looks can be deceiving  from the website. I do think that Johns Hopkins should widen its ranges of majors and allow for students with lower GPAs to attend, GPA should NOT be accounted for admissions purposes because numbers do not make a person."
Freshman,4,Academics are strong. Professors care. Lots to learn. Diverse student body. Lots of student organizations to join.
Sophomore,4,"I have a view of Johns Hopkins University that a significant portion of students also have but yet is still unique. As a student who has worked with a case manager in the Office of Student Life to handle the logistics for a semester away as  a Medical Leave of Absence, I can say with utmost confidence that they really care about their students. They want to see you succeed and will do anything in their power to meet you where you are due to disabilities or mental illnesses. I also feel energized and intrigued my courses so much so, that long hours and endless all-nighters reap a sense of fulfillment."
Freshman,4,"Overall, the experience has been good. I have made a few new friends. The number one struggle I faced this year was dealing with a teacher who tried to take points away from me on a test, but I was able to clear that up. Overall this is a great university. It's extremely challenging, but it is definitely worth the struggle."
Graduate Student,4,The education level is excellent. There are a lot of resources available to a student. Johns Hopkins University is slow to adapt to current market requirements such as AI and Machine Learning for its MBA course and needs to improve its Career Development Team to get more companies on campus.
Freshman,4,"Hopkins has a beautiful cohesive campus and great facilities. Freshman housing is standard, no frills. The FFC dining hall food is actually decent catering to a wide variety of diets. The library is very nice with study environments for different occasions including dead silent reading rooms, cubicles, and group study rooms that can be reserved ahead of time. Because it is always poppin' even on weekends, this can become problematic especially during finals week as students struggle to find a nice quiet study space. Students here are smart quirky, and down to earth. Many many premeds. Although social scene isn't great, nightlife is there for those who seek it. The work is challenging but the atmosphere here is not ""cut throat"" contrary to popular belief. Overall I have enjoyed my experiences here making meaningful friendships with students who are talented, driven, and genuinely passionate about what they are studying."
Alum,4,"It's not as hardcore as one would expect. There are a lot of resources to utilize, many student organizations, active greek life, and the neighborhood has many stores, restaurants, etc. Great school!"
Senior,4,I like everything about the school! The professors where well versed on their areas of expertise and special topic interest. We were well instructed on how to do proper researches.
Junior,4,"It's a tough university with a grueling curriculum and lots of professors that are usually there for research first, students second. However, that being said, the students know what they're in for and a surprisingly supportive community (albeit self-deprecating) has risen from this high-ranked college."
Graduate Student,4,The facilities and professors are top notch.  The alumni network is able to help with networking and establishing your career after graduation.
Niche User,4,I was overall very pleased with the campus and the living environment. I would recommended anyone to Hopkins that want to go into the medical field.
Freshman,4,The best part of Johns Hopkins University is that they have a scenic campus and mouth-watering food. The academics are rigorous but will eventually ready you for your future career.
Graduate Student,4,Johns Hopkins Advanced Academic Programs' online courses are identical to their in-class courses.  They are often taught by the same professors.  They make up in spade for the lack of face-to-face with their Discussion boards where participation is mandatory and graded.  Tests are typically easier because they are intrinsically open-book.  So projects are used to demonstrate application of the knowledge.
Alum,4,Attending Johns Hopkins University was a great college for my undergraduate degree. It was by far the most academically challenging experience I have ever had. The campus is beautiful and very safe for students studying there. There are many extracurriculars available and research opportunities for all students. It was definitely worth the money spent on tuition and the hours and hours of studying!
Graduate Student,4,Johns Hopkins University provides a well-rounded education. The campus is always being watched by security. The library is fantastic and the university online services provides many resources. There is diversity among the students and faculty members. Close attractions of Towson and downtown Baltimore provide opportunities for nightlife and food. There is a lot of pride in Hopkins Lacrosse.
Graduate Student,4,I'm having an incredible experience at Johns Hopkins School of Nursing. The clinical rotations are especially rewarding. Program organization still needs some work.

Junior,2,"Hopkins has classes you can take in every subject imaginable and expansive academic resources. But if you're a student of color on campus (especially if you're black like me), those resources have the power to make a fundamental difference in your experience. I’m not always sure the prestige is worth it as the school is very demoralizing for all students. The library operates as a student center because there is no other option. The school’s Facebook meme page is only filled with stress-inspired depressing self-deprecating jokes. The atmosphere lacks joy and new college experiences. It's sad, anxiety-inducing, and academic resources do not equal personal ones, with a month-long waitlist for the counseling center. I lament my decision to attend this school so much that I explicitly tell admitted students-of-color to not come here. If you take anything from this review, take this: when every student feels the exact same way about a school, you should stop and wonder why."
Senior,2,"Johns Hopkins' reputation precedes it, but the student experience leaves much to be desired. As a senior, I've found that my time at Hopkins has been unnecessarily stressful, which has caused me to frequently forego basic human needs in the way of social interaction, nutrition, and mental health just so that I can keep up with my coursework. Of course, it would be easy to rationalize these sacrifices in retrospect if the reward were tremendous as well. I've found the opposite to be true. The career center and advising are extremely unimpressive. If you're a student here, it feels like being cast out to sea with no life preserver. I wish I could say something better about my soon-to-be alma mater, but this just isn't the case. I now feel bereft of my passion, curiosity, and energy. Hopefully things will improve with time."
College Junior,2,"Although everyone roots for our school, it is not the same as state schools that are big on sports like UCLA."
College Senior,2,"I had a unique experience. Freshman year, I was placed in a converted bed-and-breakfast (overflow housing). I didn't choose it, I was just placed into it. It was horrible socially and not worth the cost. While I paid as much as a student living in a single room in Wolman or McCoy, I essentially lived in a large triple as my two suitemates had to go through my room to get to their room."
College Senior,2,"Lacrosse is the only Division I sport, and it does attract spectators during the spring. But for the majority of students it seems that athletics aren't that important, which is not necessarily a bad thing!"
College Freshman,2,Athletics are meaningless on campus and the only supported team is our Lacrosse team.  Everyone spends most of their time in the library.  To go to a sporting event would be detrimental.
College Freshman,2,"I love going to games here, but most students don't. There are definitely large divides between the athletes and normal student population. School spirit really needs to be improved upon."
College Freshman,2,"Definitely a good school, but a rather depressing environment. Students are somewhat cutthroat, not in a way that they'll sabotage other students but are just very focused on there work as if it's the only important thing. The curriculum is also very focused and lacks a core curriculum/gen ed requirements, making it difficult to find room to take classes outside of your major (if that's something you want to do). Lots of opportunities, particularly in the medical fields, but a lot of students come to Hopkins to do something medical so it can be rather stressful to be surrounded by all the crazy pre-meds."
College Junior,2,"Only division one sport that matters here is Lacross, I grew up in Miami Florida so I am biased to this."
College Sophomore,2,"drinkers and teenagers wanting to be grown ups.

A lot of sexual incidents apparently."
College Sophomore,2,my high school has bigger and nicer facilities
College Sophomore,2,there are like no parties
College Freshman,2,"A few restaurants are around. Subway, Coldstone Creamery, Niwana, and Chipotle  are a few. There isn't much else. Everything is super repetitive."
College Junior,2,"As a graduagraduate program, almost no one participates in such a club. Nonetheless, student body has some clubs for soccer and running."
College Junior,2,The finanacial situation does not seem very robust. Limited admission letters are with financial aids and almost all scholarships are not need-based but merit-based.
College Freshman,2,"There are some cool restaurants around the city, I'm sure of it, but they're not convenient to get to at all! And the touristy part of Baltimore - Inner Harbor - while it looks nice, has pretty bad food and stores (low-quality, not high-end). So the good restaurants, that means, are in the sketchier parts of town where teenage girls should probably not go. Variety is bad, Asian food is bad, and the food in general is really not that good in Baltimore. Wish there was more variety and more convenience."
College Senior,2,"The school lures you in with a better package-but don't expect that package to stay the same the next year. Most of my friends on financial aid were given smaller packages (grants, loans) after the first year."
College Junior,2,"Applying is ridiculously difficult, getting notification of your package takes ages, financial aid counselors mean well but take ages to respond to emails or calls because there's so many of them. Getting a good package really depends and you just never know how your aid will look. Lots of bureaucratic bullshit."
College Freshman,2,City parking is always terrible.
College Freshman,2,NO VARIETY AND FFC IS ALWAYS OILY. DON'T EVEN TRY.
College Freshman,2,Having a car is vital for traveling to anywhere other than inner harbor and Towson
College Sophomore,2,"It rains SO MUCH in Baltimore.  I only live two hours away, and there is a big difference in the amount of precipitation that we get.  Definitely don't forget your rain gear.  Our campus is beautiful though, and the rainy days make the sunny ones so much more precious."
College Sophomore,2,"Here, there is a phenomenon called Hopkins goggles which is an effect caused by being constantly surrounded by unattractive people so much so that they become attractive in your eyes, and thus you forget what attractive really means.  On the brighter side, I know a few couples that met here and are in happy relationships.  In fact, what I like about the student body is how we are all so similar and like-minded, yet diverse because we come from so many various backgrounds.  So basically if you have reflected yourself well in your application, and you get accepted here, you will fit in pretty well."
College Sophomore,2,"Parties are rare, hot girls are even rarer..."
College Sophomore,2,Kinda cold in the winter
College Sophomore,2,"Very dangerous, people get put to gunpoint daily"
College Sophomore,2,"Not many normal people, 2 hot girls per grade"
College Senior,2,It took at least 15 min to access to the internet. Some places are fast and some places takes a long time.
College Senior,2,"The bus service is totally a bad and worst thing that happen to me. Since there is no train station around my house, I have to take nearby bus and transfer to another bus and walk about 5-6 blocks."
Recent Alumnus,2,Very expensive and we must find on our own with no assistance from the school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Our program is not respected at our school,"
Recent Alumnus,2,It's not your typical campus.
College Senior,2,Local weather typically isn't a big deal if you're used to snow.
College Senior,2,It's tough to use your own computer because you have to login to hopkins but it's alright if it works properly.
College Senior,2,The nursing program is cool because of clinicals but I thought it would be much more organized.
College Senior,2,I don't think the financial aid problem is necessarily with the school as much as not being able to receive any aid.
College Senior,2,I'm just not sure that the program is worth how much I pay.
College Senior,2,"Workload is tough in most programs, especially if you aren't willing to work."
College Sophomore,2,There is a few places to get food right around campus but other than those stores there is not many options.
College Sophomore,2,Pretty average nightlife. Most weekends there are a couple of frat parties happening.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid process is one that is extremely tedious and seems unnecessary at times. However the school was very generous in their financial aid amount given to me.
College Senior,2,Based on official fraternities which are below average unless you know the re-emerging secret society (brotherhood).
College Freshman,2,"The social scene is horrendous. I'd be especially careful if you're not from the east coast. I know that I ignored warnings of the ubiquitous unfriendliness of the east coast, and I regret that quite a lot. The people who come to this school are often very ambitious and see friendship as an advantage and nothing more. Campus life is split into two categories: there are the party kids and the book kids. About a third of students love getting wasted, and the other two thirds see college as an opportunity to study, get good grades, and get good internships."
Recent Alumnus,2,It depends on where you like to hang out and who you associate yourself with.
College Junior,2,"The off-campus dining options are limited.  Hopkins is a smaller school tucked into the city, so there isn't many great spots for dining that are very close. If you want to take a date to a nice restaurant you have to go downtown. However, you can always find something to eat. Although you may wind up eating at the same place very often."
College Junior,2,"I am a commuter student that just found out that no undergrads are allowed to park in the parking garages anymore so now I have to find somewhere else to park. The only other spots that are available around the campus are metered parking which normally cost 50 cents for an hour. It's important to read every sign around you when you park your car because if parked in the wrong spot, the city will quickly tow your car. Normally, if you live in the dorms, there really is no need for a car, but if you decide to bring a car, there is very limited parking that is rarely open."
College Freshman,2,Hit or Miss – The people here are either attractive or hideous. There is no in between.
College Sophomore,2,Anything Near/Associated With Hopkins Is Expensive – Whether it be Hopkins meal plans or finding places to eat off-campus it's all expensive. Everyone knows it's a collegetown so they use that to charge ridiculous amounts for the smallest things.
College Freshman,2,"Covered Grades – JHU has a ""covered grades"" policy for the first semester for freshmen, where all freshmen first semester grades are only graded on a pass/fail basis. More specific letter grades are awarded, and are available for students to view, but will not show up on any official transcripts. While this is supposed to be so students can focus on making friends and joining student groups as they settle into college life, I feel like this unfairly discriminates against smarter students who do end up earning superior GPAs and would like that to be reflected in their overall GPAs."
College Junior,2,Girls are not that great. Most are way too involved in their studies and don't know how to have fun. That is why I am dating a girl from the art school 10 minutes away (MICA).
College Sophomore,2,"Not Great – There are very limited options for food off campus. The go-to seems to be Subway which is open 24/7, but there's also a pizza place, chinese take-out, sandwich stores, and a few restaurants. Most of these places offer average to below average quality food. To find food worth your money, you would need to head further off campus into the Inner Harbor or Towson."
College Junior,2,"Guys and girls are generally okay looking. Athletes are always fun to hang out with and are more or less the better looking people on campus. Everyone is very fun though, and likes to socialize"
College Junior,2,Really limited to a few over priced places to eat.
College Sophomore,2,"Low School Spirit – Not many people attend the sporting events.  This may be because of all sports other than lacrosse being DIII.  Even with an amazing lacrosse team, many people are not supportive."
College Sophomore,2,"Social Life – Freshmen dorms range from very social to not social at all.  I suggest living in the AMR's which are the most social. Everyone leaves their doors open and walks in and out of rooms freely.  However, they do not have air conditioning and are the typical college dorm with common bathrooms.  The ""nicer"" dorm Building A and B are suite style.  However, the students living there are usually less social.  They do not go out as much.  Wolman is the nicest freshmen door.  The rooms are suite style and most are spacious.  There is a common room with tv on each floor.  However, most students living in Wolman do not go out as much and are usually only social with the students on their floor."
College Freshman,2,"Fresh Feces Cafe – The freshman dining hall aso known as the Fresh Food Cafe is also colloquially known as the Fresh Feces Cafe, it's one redeeming quality is the unlimited meal plan and late night which is breakfast food from 9-12."
College Sophomore,2,"There are places to park, you just have to pay to get those places.  Also, not a lot of people have cars on campus because everything is nearby and convenient to walk to.  I do not have a car on campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Few and Far Between – You will find that there aren't hot girls crawling around the JHU campus.  Of course, there are some beautiful girls but they quickly get swept up.  Also, the tier of girls below hot get this false identity that they are superior when in reality, they would be just another girl anywhere else."
College Junior,2,"Smarts Not Hots – People come here because they are smart and talented, not for their looks. This isn't a fashion school so if you're interested in eye candy or ""hot"" whatever, look somewhere else. That doesn't mean that we're an ugly campus... every college will have a diversity of how people look, and we are just part of the rule."
Niche User,1,"The audacity of a university to effectively charge a late fee in the tune of $649 for being one day late to cancel from a class. I understand having a policy but the appeal process would have proven that an honest misunderstanding of the cutoff date from the summer and fall semesters was just that, a misunderstanding. Being a  good student with no prior history of payment issues, did not matter either. They don't charge enough tuition to forgive a one day mistake. This maybe nothing to John Hopkins but to a financially struggling student, this is extortion."
Graduate Student,1,"It parades itself as having the #1 nursing program who’s all about diversity blah blah blah but honestly, it’s just a mediocre school. In the nursing program, the workload is childish, a lot of the faculty are low key bigoted/racist. And some of my classmates are simply med school/ PA school rejects smh. Just don’t believe the hype about Johns Hopkins."
Graduate Student,1,Beware of the applied economics (master's).  Instructors are TERRIBLE.  Admissions will tell you it's about 10 hours of work a week.  You will spend more time than that trying to decipher poorly written assignments that contain tons of mistakes.
Sophomore,1,"If you're pre-med, do not come here. Go to another school where you can get a higher GPA and be able to do more extracurriculars. It's honestly not worth it."
College Freshman,1,"Before coming to Hopkins I thought alcohol use was going to be very limited for underage students and no one would be doing hard core drugs like cocaine, but I was completely wrong, and those who do drugs do it all the time sometimes multiple at the same time.  Some people make smoking weed and drinking alcohol daily things, and they'll drop acid or snort cocaine on the weekends and take vyvanse or adderall during the times when they need to study.  I honestly don't know how there bodies can handle it, but trust me there are a decent amount of hardcore drug users who have an insanely high tolerance.  I'd say about 97% of the school drinks alcohol of that percentage 60% smoke weed and of that percentage  65% have participated in the use of more serious drugs like cocaine, LSD, shrooms, painkillers, ecstasy, or crosses between two or more drugs at least once."
College Freshman,1,"Financial aid promised a specific amount when I first applied for the school, that amount then changed (decreased) when I accepted their offer, then changed once more (decreased again) promptly before the first few weeks of school. I understood that all of the numbers before the amount was actually due were just ""estimates"" but I found it quite obnoxious that the amount I owed the school more than quadrupled from the time that I applied to the time that I entered. Even after contacting the school and informing them of my hardship to pay the amount asked for, nothing changed and ZERO efforts were made to help accommodate my financial NEED, something that factored in very much so in my initial acceptance of their offer."
College Sophomore,1,they need to be more lenient about some things
College Freshman,1,How can a college expect my middle class family to pay full tuition?
College Student,1,I got it on my own and it's only worth 1 credit.
College Student,1,"Almost joined greek life, thank goodness i didn't. It is a way to meet people, but not the only way"
College Student,1,"lots of international students, but majority of rich WASPs"
College Student,1,"I love writing sems and english, but they are not the focus here. Humanities really take a back seat."
College Student,1,Seriously wish there was more school spirit. even these legendary lacrosse games have a lame turn out
College Student,1,"Dominated by greek life, often awkward"
College Student,1,"It is very inhibitory for students not involved in Greek Life and under legal drinking age, but once 21 there are off campus bars"
College Sophomore,1,"School spirit here is practically non-existant.  Our biggest sport is lacrosse, and I personally have yet to attend a game.  I think our hearts are in the right place, but when it comes down to it, academics are more important.  The athletic center is nice though; you can take classes, there is an indoor track and rock wall, wall tennis, a ballet studio, swimming pools, weight room and exercise room. There are a lot of intramural and club sports, but intramurals seem to be considerably more time consuming."
College Sophomore,1,"Not impressed at all, other schools are better"
College Sophomore,1,"The problem is Baltimore isn't safe, cars get stolen"
Recent Alumnus,1,We have no campus dining. There is a separate cafeteria in our building.
Recent Alumnus,1,Our location receives nothing that the students at the main location receive. We must travel an hour to participate.

Sophomore,5,"So far my experience at Lynn University has been a phenomenal one. The campus is so beautiful and the perfect size. I have not had a bad experience with any of the professors, they are all very nice and knowledgeable. One thing I would add to improve lynn university would be more on campus housing as there are limited options for students who want to live on campus. Besides that I think it is a great school!"
Sophomore,5,Online learning is great and just as good as in person! The professors are very helpful and easy to contact.
Graduate Student,5,Graduate of a Masters program at Lynn and all courses were rigorous. I enjoyed my learning experience. High quality professors.

Sophomore,5,"I only took online classes when we were sent home for the pandemic COVID-19, so they really weren’t online classes."
Sophomore,5,"Amazing school, beautiful campus, great academics. Students are very involved and great mannered, while the activities for students to take part in range from so many."
Senior,5,Lynn University has a welcoming ambiance as soon as stepping foot onto campus. Every individual is very friendly and caring. As I started my journey I immersed myself in all Lynn had to offer and found my new home. The professors were so encouraging and always willing to help. The diversity on campus is beautiful and it creates a place where  everyone feels accepted and belonged.  I absolutely loved my experience and would highly recommend this school to anyone who is looking for a university where they are recognized for who they are and understood.
Senior,5,The online learning experience with Lynn has been very good. Everything is accessible on the app we use called Canvas and the style of learning on the iPad (provided by the school) allows for an enhanced learning experience. Professors are still always available for help during extra hours or via phone.
Freshman,5,"Lynn University is a special place, and the staff and faculty are what makes it so special. Every person on campus is friendly and willing to help, and most go out of their way to assist in making it the best experience you could possibly hope for. It makes being away from home for the first time a lot easier."
Sophomore,5,I have had an excellent experience with the faculty on the admissions side and as well as the aeronautics side for far.  I am eager to return this fall in order to continue my education.
Junior,5,"I’m a current junior at Lynn and love this place so much. It has provided me support academically, athletically, and job wise. The professors I have at Lynn are constant there for me no matter what. I know at any moment I could call any of my professors and could ask for help. On top of that, the area if absolutely amazing. There are so many activities to do and being less than 10 minutes from the beach is always great!"
Junior,5,"Beautiful campus! The people are all very welcoming. The University Center is my favorite building, it's very sustainable. Even though it's a small campus, the diversity makes it feel large.  Need to update dorms!"
Graduate Student,5,"Lynn provides great opportunity for each individual. Those who take full advantage of the University's recourses will leave a better person. I have had a great experience in terms of gaining life knowledge, business skills, and mentorships. The school is small but is located in a very attractive area in south Florida where you never run out of things to do. For one who wants to grown beyond just the academics, Lynn is a great place."
Alum,5,"Great  university, that offers a family like atmosphere. If you are looking for a home away from home, Lynn is the place for you. Professors are amazing and try to make everyone succeed in and out of the classroom."
Freshman,5,"Lynn University is an incredible place to pursue your further education and grow as a professional. It is a tight knit community amazingly placed nearby various sources for outdoor entertainment, while also providing students with all the gorgeous benefits South Florida can offer. All features of Lynn (academics, athletics, and recreation) are all amazing ways non which students develop themselves personally and professionally. It is a home away from home that provides students with all their needs and allows for a great 4 year experience!"
Freshman,5,An amazing school! Professors and staff really care about the students! Students are friendly and care about one another! Feels like home!
Freshman,5,"I love being a student at Lynn for so many different reasons, but above all else, the individual attention you will get from professors and any faculty for that matter is unbeatable. So many incredible opportunities have come from my time at Lynn so far, and I know that had a gone to a bigger, less attentive school, I would never have gotten the recognition and chances that I have gotten so far... and I am only a freshman! I love this school and cannot recommend it highly enough"
Freshman,5,"A really good university! The campus is not too big but it has everything you need. It’s really nice and feels like home. The professor actually remember you and care about you as a person. There are a lot of activities and events even at the sport games. It is a big international school so you’ll get to know people from all around the world and get to know different cultures. The cafeteria is open 24/7 and you have a lot of choices for food. The majority of people are nice and helpful. There are a lot of different activities around Boca Raton as well, however you will probably need to have a car"
Junior,5,I love Lynn. Such a diverse school with the beautiful campus and an amazing professors. Cafeteria food is amazing! They are improving the student experience every day!
Freshman,5,"My experience in Lynn as a freshman was more than what I expected. I was pushed by staff in almost all areas to be present in the moment, to use all of  resources Lynn has to bring."
Sophomore,5,Lynn has felt like a home to me for the past two years. The IPad learning works really well and I always know I can count on my professors when I need help. Campus is beautiful and I feel so lucky to be apart of the community. 10/10 would recommend
Freshman,5,"Hi I’m Amanda I’m a freshman at lynn I am a criminal justice pre law major, I have loved my time at lynn I joined a sorority, I am involved in a variety of things on campus and I love the close knit community that is lynn, the professors are amazing and so helpful all the time, I love the courses I’m currently taking and I have really enjoyed my time thus far at Lynn"
Sophomore,5,The campus life is engaging with the supporting faculty & co-curricular activities taking place. The secure environment prevents any sorts of irrelevant activities. The canteen facilities are able to satisfy the lunch hunger.
Junior,5,"Lynn University really is a home away from home! They make you feel so welcome from the moment you apply, it's so amazing! They have the most beautiful campus in South Florida, it is the perfect size, cool weather, and amazing location. The professors are so well prepared and will really get to know you. At Lynn, you are NOT a number and the professors, staff and faculty really show that."
Freshman,5,Excellent university. Variety of internationals and excellent average of ratio between student and professor. Food is perfect. I just love it.
Freshman,5,"This place is spic&span. Grounds are great, so is architecture and infrastructure. People in admission are very smiley and friendly, I guess it's how they are trained. It all falls in line with the price per year and it’s NOT low or cheap, i think NOT even average - It's HIGH. I just hope that faculties and programs as sterling as the granite countertops in the bathrooms. I would consider them if i can find the money to pay for."
Sophomore,5,"wonderful experience with my all class,professor,and students .very excellent experience of relations with teachers, students, staff, optimal conditions of magnificent use of individual studies, health care, behavior of teachers and students with respect,"
Freshman,5,"I love how friendly the people are there, and the area its in is so beautiful. The food there is like gourmet food, and the students are also really nice."
Niche User,5,"Honestly, I have applied, and i was having issues with my application which took weeks to resolve and they stayed with me throughout the whole thing."
Junior,5,I love this university. It gives you an amazing exposure to different cultures. not only that but makes you feel welcome and at home. all faculty is friendly. the housing program is organized and good at making selections. there are many options for housing. the campus is extremely beautiful.
Junior,5,"I was actually grandfathered in from DMAC because Lynn wanted an arts program, and I couldn’t be happier here. The tutoring center is phenomenal, the social scene and clubs are great, and the courses and material are engaging. That said, the campus is wonderful too. I don’t think I could have managed a college like FAU And it’s sheer size, so I love Lynn and it’s quaintness."
Senior,5,I'm an online student and I’ve enjoyed my experience. Majority of the professors are very helpful and have a lot of experience in different fields
Senior,5,"Small and personalized with a refreshing touch of innovation that emanates throughout each class. There is nothing better than being able to apply the theories and information that is taught in the classes to real-life, current-day topics. 

I studied an extremely interesting neuromarketing class where we explored emerging technologies, applied it against historical facts and then I created a mobile app that related to the ""internet of things"". My app worked with the Apple Watch and stands out as a defining moment in my higher educational experience. 

Although the information was amazing, sharing my experience with such a diverse group of people was pivotal. Highly recommended for anyone that wants to break the mold through a contemporary educational experience!"
Freshman,5,"one of the best colleges in Florida, its a must to visit if you're looking for quality education with an opportunity to land a job straight after college."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Lynn University so far has been amazing, the teachers are helpful and they want to see their students succeed, the staff are helpful and they are very respectful, and the students are very diverse and the upperclassmen are very welcoming. The classes are easy to pass, but during the time challenge to your brain which is good. They also teach the students things that they thought they knew, and show them something new with that knowledge."
Sophomore,5,"As an incoming freshman, I was not too sure and confident of how the campus would be. Going into my sophomore year at Lynn University, I could’ve have been happier with my decision to attend Lynn. The campus is slowly growing, and has amazing and necessary features for students. The cafeteria and food selection never disappoints. The professors and faculty are always willing to help students in any way possible. Only downside is the small classrooms, and small location to have general education classes."
Freshman,5,"I love Lynn!  They are prompt, welcoming, and helpful.  I am so excited to continue my education there!"
Sophomore,5,"Although it is a small campus, the environment there is incredible. You get all the big school advantages along with all the small school ones as well. The classes are very hands on and useful, the teachers care about the students, and theres always something going on on campus. The boca raton area is so fun and sunny, theres a million things to do around town, not to mention the fantastic beaches. Lynn has the best food I’ve ever seen at a university and 24 hr dining on top of that ! I love this school and would not transfer for the world !!!"
Freshman,5,"One of my favorite things about Lynn university is that it is very diverse, you can find different nationalities from all over the world.  Along having a friendly staff and members there."
Sophomore,5,"This school is very on top of things! Very quick admission process. I heard back with in a week after they received all of my documents. Also what I like is that this school keeps parents in the loop so that I don't have to explain everything! They receive basically all the info I do. The professors are very friendly and the campus is very diverse. Also, love the location of the campus. Right in the heart of Boca."
Sophomore,4,"I really like  Lynn University! The campus and area are beautiful, the food is good the professors are amazing they help you a lot the courses are are pretty good , being her at Lynn its been a wonderful experience"
Sophomore,4,"My online learning experience within Lynn has also been pretty good and it has not given me any trouble . Connecting to my classes online through Zoom and Canvas has not shown any issues with me so far, the professor are really helpful  and I’m learning a lot from the online classes"
Sophomore,4,"Personally, I do not work very well online as I tend to get distracted but since this semesters schedule is a hybrid schedule I find it easier to stay focused on the materials. I took a lab course with the current online experience and that was a little challenging since labs are very hands on, so that was expected. Overall I think that the online learning experience with Lynn University is a smart idea in order to keep students as close to the college life as possible under current circumstances."
Sophomore,4,"I love Lynn University! The campus and area are beautiful, the food is delicious, the professors are amazing, the courses are impactful. This school has been a wonderful experience."
Freshman,4,"So far Lynn has definitely been a nice, welcoming school to be a part of. There is a good, welcoming vibe for freshman like me, and the elder students as well as staff are very helpful when it comes to any confusion new students may have upon arriving to the school, or throughout their time there."
Freshman,4,"So far my online learning experience within Lynn has also been nice, and it has not given me any form of trouble compared to any in person classes I have. Connecting to my classes online through Zoom and Canvas has not shown any issues with me so far, and I am glad that it has stayed so easy for me."
Freshman,4,The amazing admissions and financial aid counselors were able to help me find ways to pay for school. Plus they really show interest in their students and care about them deeply!!
Freshman,4,I haven’t taken any classes online but I have talked with other students and they said that the IPad power learning program gave them access to a way to be able to transition from on campus to online learning.
Senior,4,Good university look forward to graduating. Pilot program is not bad either just make sure you have transportation.
Senior,4,"Lynn is a great university, very diverse and with a beautiful campus. Professors and staff in general are always willing to help and enjoy doing their work. The environment is great and it is easy to make friends because the school is small."
Junior,4,"I’m a junior at Lynn and so far my experience has been amazing. The campus is extremely diverse and the class are very interactive especially because of the class size. Also, Lynn is very innovative as technology in every aspect on campus. The location is also amazing as the beach and mall is not far from campus."
Graduate Student,4,"I really liked the small school aspect. I really enjoyed the ability to have one on ones with my professors and they actually care about my progress in the classroom as well as outside of the class room. Professors are always quick to reach out if a job opportunity exists and you are a match. My have tons of resources around Lynn that aid in making sure you graduate on time and to the best of your ability. The food is really good, however some times it can be a little boring and not 100% accommodating to vegetarians/vegans. The school really allows you to focus on academics and get your work done. Many of the students, if they want a party scene will go to FAU or Miami, but always return to get the extra support and care that only Lynn will provide."
Senior,4,My three years at Lynn University has not only been life changing academically but socially as well. The environment allows you to create meaningful interactions and relationship as you get the opportunity to meet people from so many different works of life.
Junior,4,Lynn University is an outstanding school to attend. There is a community at the university and a family-like feel. The campus is absolutely beautiful and the professors do everything they can to help students succeed.
Freshman,4,"As I am in my 1st year of college, so far I am enjoying it a lot! All of my professors want me to succeed and I’ve gained a lot of knowledge in my major so far. Also, if i need any assistance on any assignment, I know I can always count on my professors or tutoring. In general, our university is so welcoming as well."
Niche User,4,"I just got accepted to the school and I’m am so happy that they want me and Im also grateful that’s they gave me a scholarship for 18,000 dollars!! I’m so ready to attend Lynn in August 2020"
Sophomore,4,"It’s a nice school. Location is beautiful, class sizes are small and inclusive. Psychology courses are amazing. However they don’t provide housing for all 4 years"
Sophomore,4,Best school in south Florida. They employees including professors are so nice and accommodating. Student Life is great and their food services are always delicious. The campus is always clean and people are always smiling!
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy Lynn University, not only is their campus diverse the people there are incredibly cooperative and inviting to guests and students to the college."
Sophomore,4,I love how connected the University is. The professors genuinely care for their students and want to help improve our time there. There are many sports and clubs that are aimed to include everyone. And there is an extremely diverse community on campus. I loved my first year and can't wait to go back in August.
Niche User,4,"When i meet their sponsor at a College Meet they were very informative and polite. My questions were answered with appropriate answers and my daughter and i learned a great deal about their aviation program. When we took a campus tour the campus was beautiful. Their campus is also an hour from Miami beach, which is a nice bonus for the students!"
Freshman,4,The professors are engaging and willing to help outside of the classroom. The classes are small and engaging with the course materials being easy to handle. Campus life could use a lift and you tend to see the same people everyday.
Freshman,4,"Lynn University is a exceptional college with amazing programs and classes. The campus is beautiful, open, clean and safe setting a great and welcoming environment for students to learn and live. The sports programs and clubs offered are also very nice with a wide variety of clubs for every interest and truly impressive teams that entice many students to go to games. The classes also have extraordinary curriculum and are well set up both on campus and online and are taught by incredibly competent and talented professors."
Junior,4,"I'm currently an undergrad at Lynn University and there's a lot of things to like about this school, a 24/7 campus with good food and good dorms is very appealing and Lynn puts its budget into trying to make the school a comfortable, up to date, and proper learning environment."
Niche User,4,I love movies and shows!! Always loved special features!! But the college I’ll be in has the same name but here in Louisiana!! And I loved all the technology and staff!!!
Junior,4,"This is a beautiful small college campus.  The student population is culturally diverse with students from all over the US and internationally.  The faculty is devoted to each student's success.  When I came for a visit, I was able to have lunch with the Division Chairperson for my major who gave me 100% of his attention.  I had never felt a college was truly interested in me until I came to Lynn.  The academics and internship opportunities allowed me to network within my industry and I feel I am being well-prepared for my career."
Freshman,4,Lynn University is a very nice school with a welcoming environment. The academic counsellors were very welcoming to us and assisting us in every possible way. I'll definitely recommend this school to people.
Sophomore,4,"Lynn is a great, very forward thinking college. Facilities are very nice, and the staff and professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. Received a mini iPad for textbooks, which is great because you don't have to carry around textbooks or really buy any. Some of the Dialogues courses seem like a waste of time, but great business school. It's just very expensive because it is private. "
Freshman,4,Very friendly environment created by the faculty and staff. There are many on campus resources and the administration is extremely proactive and involved.
College Freshman,4,They make sure you are eligible to get a job.
College Freshman,4,They make it a priority.
College Freshman,4,The overall atmosphere of the school is great.
College Freshman,4,Greek life doesn't play a huge role.
College Freshman,4,There is much support for the teams.
College Freshman,4,It is an amazing school from what I've seen so far
College Freshman,4,My experience is great classes are  overall small compared to other universities
College Freshman,4,I'm working toward my aa and am part off the 3.0 program
College Freshman,4,It's campus is beautiful and the professors and andvisors are so helpful.
College Senior,4,Life on campus is fun. It makes group work easier as students can stay up late nights working in projects and wake up 15 minutes before class on still arrive on time.
College Senior,4,"Greek life is very small on campus. Regardless of where a person is from and their tradition, it is accepted at Lynn University. There is a new Snyder sanctuary on campus where students from any religion or race are free the practice their customs."
College Freshman,4,The Health Center is very complete with a doctor at all times as well as nurses who can help you with anything.
College Freshman,4,"Though greek life is relatively small at Lynn, being in one has many advantages. I joined a sorority my second semester and I made tons of friends and the activities were so much fun. I strongly encourage girls to at least try joining greek life!"
College Freshman,4,"The whole university is very involved on athletic sports and basketball games as well as soccer and rugby are very entertaining to go to! On game day, everyone wears their Lynn shirts and the school spirit is at its highest."
College Freshman,4,"i have never had to transfer credits, but the school offers a lot of possibilities when it comes to working and going to school at the same time."
College Freshman,4,the class sizes are great and the teachers are better i think if you want to pursue a career with Dmac College you need to be willing to do the the work the school will do the rest for you.
College Freshman,4,you have a lot of possibilities when you come to this school its a great school to learn and become a great artist.
College Freshman,4,there is a lot of support from students and teachers in my school. The classes are not to big so you have a lot of one on one time with the student and teachers great school.
College Freshman,4,the school is credited and helps you apply for jobs when you have graduated from this college.
College Freshman,4,i will never forget what i have learn in this school. Never!
College Freshman,4,"Many students participate, the facilities are great and there is quite a bit of school spirit."
College Junior,4,"As an RA we meet the people working in our counseling center and we work with them personally, we have a very professional staff and they are genuine people. We have a joke within housing, whenever we joke about something we say ""We have a great counseling program!"" And it's actually true. We have a great counseling program, it's also 100% confidential and the counseling center is part of a bunch of offices so no one will even know that's where you're going."
College Junior,4,"I major in Computer Animation BFA. Coming from a more 2D illustration background there's a lot to take in for the first time in this program. We work with all relevant industry standard programs and tech. In the general program (not game art concentration) we learn everything a 3D artist can know for any type of field, such as modeling, texturing, lighting,rigging, vfx, compositing, ect. The pace at DMAC is accelerated, classes only last 7.5 weeks. Professors and fellow students are always more than willing to help out with anything though, makes the stress less intense for finals. There's always workshops from fellow alumni working in the field, events around town, and a career services message board to help with internships and networking. Its a lot of work to go into this field, as long as you're determined you'll be just fine!"
College Junior,4,"I've been here for about a year and a half in the animation BFA program, and I wouldn't even think about switching out. Art school is expensive, but DMAC really does try and help take down the cost. In this area its probably one of the cheaper schools. I love that so much because not only is it easier on your loans but class sizes are really small. With in a year you'll probably know most of your professors for the entire degree as well as other students. The atmosphere is so vibrant and helpful on campus and not a day goes by were I think to switch out. The only sort of downside is that classes are an accelerated pace, you will feel the pressure of it. As long as your dedicated and hard working this school will help you reach unexpected heights!"
College Sophomore,4,"All of the teachers at Lynn University are great. At LU they really care about you, not just your grades. The staff wants to help you and make sure that everything is going great, in your studies and to make sure you are not stretching yourself too thin or overworking yourself. They want you to be able to do your best and end up with a job right after graduating."
College Senior,4,"The athletics is really good, this year we won several major championships in more than 3 different sports."
College Senior,4,"the school is very close to the beach were their is a plethora of dinning options, and It is also located close to the mall where students also go and eat."
College Junior,4,"The benefits of being a member of a greek organization are great! There are always going to be people who love greek life and who hate greek life, but what it comes down to is weather or not greek life if right for the individual! Some people on campus make it pretty clear that they do not think Greek life makes sense or that they do not like the people. But, for our campus, the greek lettered organization do great things on and off of campus! Last year, as a whole greek life raised almost a thousand non perishable food items to the local food bank! Many of our campus' greek member also receive great awards at our annual award night called Knight of Honor!"
College Junior,4,"There are a bunch of different places to go out and eat near Lynn. Mizner Park is full of restaurants like Yard House and Racks. While Mizner Park is a bit more expensive, there are other options like Macaroni Grill and Chilis by the mall as well. The small places that you find just from being in the area are great too! I love the small Greek places or small places by the beach! Being in the Boca Raton area is not the cheapest place, but there are tons of options if you are or are not on a budget."
College Junior,4,"Being an Advertising & Public Relations major allows me to get a well balanced education in two subjects that are directly related to one another. I have learned how to use photoshop and other adobe programs though my classes as well as learning the importance of the Public Relations industry. Combining the two majors into one was a great move on Lynn's part and it allows students graduating from our major to take up jobs that some applicants would not necessarily get because of one or two aspects of our curriculum. The professors in the Communications school are extremely helpful in anything and everything you may need. They advise you in which classes to take and help you find the right internship for you! It is great to be a name instead of a number or a face, we have the great opportunity to form relationships with the faculty within our school."
College Junior,4,"It is paced at a good speed, and has nice transitions to connect the materials between classes."
Sophomore,2,"I really do not like online learning, especially when I did choose to return to campus and I am still forced to take classes online. Two and a half hours is just too long to sit in front of a computer."
College Senior,2,"the school is relatively quite at night, but most students travel 10 minutes to Florida Atlantic University to party. Or they go to some of the clubs in the surrounding area."
College Freshman,2,"nightlife is not bad if you have a car, but if you don't you are screwed "
College Senior,2,"Campus is only really strict on writing parking tickets. They are also very blind to the fact of having visitors in the dorms, which is clearly a concern. I feel they are only strict on things where they can make money. As for drug and alcohol it really depends on your RA and if you get friendly usually they let it slide."
College Freshman,2,"It is not that hard to get drugs, but people get caught all the time."
College Sophomore,2,You get tired of eatting the same food over and over again.
College Freshman,2,There Are Jobs but Long Hours. there are jobs but they are long and give you little time to work on school and no social time
College Freshman,2,"Lets Go LU – I did cheerleading my first year. It was fun but frustrating because we do not perform at a college level, not even high school to be honest my high school team is a lot better then Lynn's. The games are fun to watch but not many people go to them. There is not much moral and school pride since there is not football team."
College Freshman,2,"If you do not have a car do not attend Lynn University. There is not much to do on campus. I don't mind living on campus because it takes me five minutes to get me to all my classes. But the dorms are gross in Trinity. Pay the extra $1,000 to get into EML or Old Lynn it is worth the money. Good room mates are hard to find I got very lucky with my room mate but a lot of other people tried changing it is very hard and a long process."
College Freshman,2,"Diverse, I Guess – There are not many students but from what I see it is very diverse, Majority of students are rich and stuck up with nice cars. A lot of Jewish people attend Lynn. There are people from different places around the world. I have many Italian friends and some from France. The acceptance of people with disability is big on campus you will always see someone in a wheel chair because the campus is handicap accessible. Everyone is accepted at Lynn but it is very cliquey, once you find your group you stick to it because Lynn is very small."
College Freshman,2,"Not Many Working Ones Available in Lab – The computer lab is on the left when you first walk into the Library. The Library is really nice and throughout there are computers if you don't mind not having a printer close by, I only worked in the library three times my first year but spent a lot of time in the computer lab. If you want a quite place to work definitely do not go there especially during finals and midterms. People are super loud and there are many distractions. I mostly go to print something out because there is no limit on the printer and it is almost always working."
College Junior,2,No community feeling at all. No socialization. All the kids do is hang out in front of their dorms. Nothing to do. Bathrooms are a mess. Loud as ever.
College Freshman,2,Parking is always a hassle at Lynn University. It is so difficult to find a parking near your dorm. And there are so many disabled parking spots that are not in use.
Recent Alumnus,2,on campus at lynn their not really strict as long as you do what you're told then everything will be cool.
Recent Alumnus,2,Drug Scene – at lynn university there is no drug scene or any kind of peer pressure none of that really takes place on our campus.
Freshman,1,the online classes were a joke and complete waste of money. the education i received online was nowhere near as supplemental as I had paid for and they literally argued with us about reimbursing us for housing and dining and in class classes
Freshman,1,"if i could give this school less than 1 star I would. it is advertised as extremely diverse but is white washed and racist as hell, my advisor scheduled me for a lab that started in the middle of another class like that's not her literal one job, a lot of my friends didn't go to welcome weekend events but they came to MY door and pointed out my self harm scars that are over a year healed and it was triggering, security woke me and my roommates up at 2am to move her car for a firefighters event but other students' vehicles were still there, they moved another girl into my room w/o telling me or my RA & gave me attitude when I complained, the meat is consistently uncooked, and when we went home for the pandemic's lockdown they would only give us money back as transferred funds into next semester which effectively screwed over their MANY transfer students until they were literally sued. The classes are high school classes and a waste of time. Do not waste your money."
Alum,1,Lynn is a joke of a school. My dorm in trinity had mold and was disgusting. I ordered a burger once in the dining hall and there was plastic in it. The academics are a joke and everything is either too easy or super unclear and kids didn’t care about academics. There’s nothing to do in the local area and campus is heavily guarded by security. Do yourself a favor and avoid Lynn University.
Niche User,1,Lynn is the college that is just out to get your money. They offer little to no scholarships and they do not take the time to get to know their students at a personal level.
Freshman,1,"Lynn is not worth the cost! $60,000+ for an average school with average professors is a waste of money, the classes are super easy and the students are not even motivated to do a simple three to four page DOUBLE SPACED paper, the professors were very lenient with extending deadlines because only a handful of papers were turned in. The food is average and not ""gourmet"". The dorms are below average for what you expect, my dorm in Freiburger had mold in and around the A/C and each dorm has dehumidifiers because of multiple mold issues. The Financial aid department is horrible once you already signed the dotted line to attend, and a lot of the faculty don't really give you the time of day. The students (or should I say the students parents are) are very wealthy and you will find a lot of students are snobby and hard to connect to. The classes are ridiculously easy and not challenging which is not great when you become bored with the class because its so easy."
College Freshman,1,We do not really have a greek life.
College Freshman,1,IT'S A PAIN IN THE ASS FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WITH AMERICAN PASSPORTS...
College Freshman,1,"the academic workload is a joke , theres not enough challenge i feel like I'm in high school"
College Freshman,1,"i would definitely not chose to come to this school , i would rather go to a different school"
College Freshman,1,the local atmosphere is terrible there is nothing to do 
College Freshman,1,"dialogues of learning suck , they mess you up with your future"

College Freshman,1,there is a lot of diversity here but a lot of people are racist at this school
College Sophomore,1,Eating out became a habit for me since the cafe provided such awful food. Breakfast and lunch were the only good meals.
College Sophomore,1,"horrible teachers, horrible subjects. do not go to lynn. i have had some of the worst teachers ive EVER had, here"
College Freshman,1,"There is only one dining hall, and it is open at the worst times 7-9, 11-1, and 5-7. Its like its scheduled for old people, no college kids eat at those times. It doesn't matter though because the food is terrible."
College Freshman,1,Expensive/ No Parties – they are ok but you need to pay at least 20 dollars to get into a crap club. a good club is 50. no parties at all.
College Freshman,1,"Piolt/Sports Manigment Good Bad Every Thing Else – the piolt program and the sports maingement program are good but the other programs are going to get you a 25,000 dollar job."
College Freshman,1,Ripp Off – the food is crap and expencive you are better off at mccdolads then any of the resturants
College Freshman,1,your better off working at toco bell then going to lynn.
College Freshman,1,"the piolt program and the sports manigment programs are good but every other program will result in  50,000 dollar paying job or less. dont lisson to the school. they had 5 students in there 50 year exsistence go to law school."
College Freshman,1,"Not Bad – lynn has apd, zbt and sigima sigma sigma. they are not reall accepting of new greek organization comming on campus. the two frats will do any thing to keep you off and so will the school. they tried and are still trying for aepi but its not a good sign of it happening.plus 80 percent of the student wil not joing greek life."
College Freshman,1,"Food Taste Like Vomit and No Choices. you have choice salad bar, burgers or sandwiches. and they taste like total crap."
College Freshman,1,Sucks Without  Car. if you have a car you are set at lynn. but if you dont have a car good luck getting around.
College Freshman,1,the campus secerty trys to catch you on every thing even if it is picking up a rock from the ground they try to get you in trouble. the ra's suck they hate you and they want you to get kicked out of the dorms. they are selfish and couupt
College Freshman,1,you cant drink on campus there is alot of heroine cocaine and lsd on campus and the student spike your drugs.
College Freshman,1,Teams and School Spirit Suck – no one watches the game. they root for the other team. they are d2 and nobody cares.
College Freshman,1,Athletic Centers/ Class Rooms – athletic centers were worse then my gym in middile school. the class room are ok but the spekers are extreamlly load. the only activity you can do is basketball or watch tv.
College Freshman,1,Wifi Sucked – the wifi is so slow that i could'nt even get on facebook withoutwaiting 10min
College Freshman,1,"SUCKED/ RIP OFF/ MONEY MAKERS NOT EDJUCAION/ SCAM – i had a terrible time at lynn since there are no parties you ether spend 50 dollars to get into a club or you like i did stare at a tv or at you friends (if you had any). even though i had some friends the rest were dis respectfull spioled, made fun of you for everything, tried to sue you, had at least one car and took advatege of you. the edjucation sucked i got easy grades. the school is all about money no edjucation. they make you pay to hand in work ($100). when i got my transcrpirt back after them finding out i was tranfering. they put istend of an 80 they put a 79.75 aka c+ so i could not transfer. they tried to charge me 300 dollars for them to vacume my room. it was a rip off. the proffesser for my self as a lerner class treated me like a five year old. once your in the instute you cant get out its a trap. the school trys to trap you in so you cant leave.

they compare them seleves to harverd because they have diologs instead of regular science classes, math classes or there required courses. they do that so u have to take all of your required courses over agian. 

people try to make you do cokcaine and heronine. they try to make you drink with out wanting to and some times they spike your drink.

i regret going there.

NEVER CHOOSE LYNN UNIVERSTY"
College Freshman,1,"Spioled Rich ""Kids"" (Students)/ Sex Crazy / Not Accepting. the students are spioled and rich and take advantege of others. they think that they can do and buy what ever and when ever want. student drive around in mercedes benz. They treat the student with less money like slaves and treat them like they are maids. people are stuck in a fantasy world at lynn. they think they rule the world.

they have sex every night with who ever they can find.

the bully and taunt people that are diffrent then them. they think every one is rich and if u are nort they think you are lazy and ""retarted"" exact quotes from the students there.

i hated my expernce there."
College Freshman,1,if u want to spend $45 DOLLARS on a single dinner go to lynn. the area is very expensive and the sourondings are full of rich people. for example the movie ticket was 15 dollars and there were expensive cars in the parking lot.
College Freshman,1,"There are two and they do not have a house. ZBT is the boys I have been to a couple parties that are really bad. It filled with misfits that all stay in an apartment far off campus. ZZZ is the girls, you can join but they don't do anything but dress in matching clothing occasionally. They are not known as the popular girls just people having trouble making friends. They don't do many on campus activities. Personally I just stay away from it."
College Freshman,1,"I Have Heard of Them, I Did Not Get Any – I applied to many scholarships but received none. Lynn University is a VERY expensive school when you have no financial aid. I am forced to transfer because my parent do not have enough money to provide all four years. I know of two people that got a full scholarship, even then they are stressed because they have to keep perfect grades."
College Junior,1,"Good but bad – Went to the infirm here. Needed a script. They asked me if I had a ride to pick it up, because they don't get scripts here. I didn't have a ride. Luckily I got well on my own."
College Junior,1,"Smells .. Noisy – First thing I noticed when I moved in was the smell. Smelt like mold, or mildew. Also Roommate selection is poor .. wanted to put a jr with a freshman. There seems to be no socialization in the halls. The hang outs seem to be in front of a dorm's entrance .. reminds me of small towns, and hanging out in parking lots .. Need parties."
College Junior,1,"See review on transportation – So within 5 miles there seems a lot .. beaches .. shops .. food .. all great .. if you have the money to spend on the expensive shops .. the beach is just a strip of sand .. and nothing to walk to, and if you get hungry all there is is like 3 cafes. Although walking to the mall is fun."
College Junior,1,"Fatty, greasy, and over priced – Foods alright, but limited. Didn't make the dinning hall times? Try the grill that's open until 2a with the same greasy and over priced hot dog/hamburgers, etc. (20 items) or the cafe during the school day (10 food items, and 20 drinks) .. the dinning hall has the same hamburgers/hot dogs/fries, etc but also has some ""specials"" of one or two meals .. although they do have kool-aid :D .. Again, a walk to the mall and a little further you have 5 guys, hooters, cheesecake factory, and the mall's food."
College Junior,1,"Nothing to do on campus. So go off. Don't have a car? Wouldn't come here if I were you. The school offers a shuttle service that runs in a 5 mile radius of campus. It runs 10-7 M-F, and 1-5 on weekends. So make sure you're done with whatever you're doing and call the shuttle before 7 on weekdays, or 5 on weekends or else you'll have to get back on your own, or wait til 10 W-Sun for the ""safe ride"" that is full of drunks. Also when calling to be picked up at Lynn to be driven, call ahead. You will have to wait until the shuttle comes back to campus .. which takes about 30 min-hr depending on who was dropped off before. Also expect the same in the ride, it's not just a straight ride, they need to make drop offs as well. If you like walking, the mall is only 2 miles away and is better than waiting for the van to take you there. Public transit runs by campus, but when asked about it no one seems to know of it .. or seems to know anyone who uses it. "
College Junior,1,"Don't Need a Car – Joke. Unless you have a car. If not their is a shuttle offered by the campus that only takes one within a 5 mi radius of the school. Runs weekdays from 10-7, and weekends from 1-5. So if whatever you're doing goes past 7 on weekdays, or 5 on weekends, you're out of luck for a ride. Unless you wait until 10 on W-Sun for a ""safe ride"" which is full of drunks. (and that only goes in a ten mile radius)"

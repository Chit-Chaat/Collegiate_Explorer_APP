Junior,5,Dickinson has an amazing family atmosphere. When you go to the football games you get to talk with alumni and hear their stories of when they went to Dickinson State University and it just gives you chills. I get the same feeling from attending Dickinson. It is like my home. I am glad that I can pass down my stories after I became an alumni myself! I will forever remember Dickinson as my home. One day I hope I can pass this onto my kids and they will also attend Dickinson State University.
Sophomore,5,Dickinson state University is great and more diverse. The school has great buildings and the professors are ready to help any students that needs help with anything in school. The academics are good and outstanding. Dickinson State University needs improvement with the food service. The school security is excellent with their jobs and they are all making sure all the students are safe and sound.
Works Here,5,"DSU has excellent professors who care about student learning and success.  The campus is clean, friendly, and has a lot to offer both new and transfer students."
Sophomore,5,As a single mother of a two year old my experience with Dickinson State University has been very excellent. All of my professors have given me the best feedback to improve my studies. I feel that the staff are there to help anyone academically succeed. Tuition costs compared to other Universities is very affordable.
Junior,5,I love this University!! It has a great a great class size and great teachers.  Pretty cheap apartments to live off campus.
Freshman,5,Wonderful. Small classes mean more interaction between students and professors. Okay tuition prices.
College Junior,5,I have liked all my courses so far. The teachers help out a lot even if a person isn't doing so good in the class.
College Junior,5,They like to help out students with anything they need if its a job or helping them with future jobs.
College Junior,5,The campus always have their campus security on duty all the time. I think they take safety very seriously at the school.
College Junior,5,the chemistry is good and alot of the support is great and helpful
College Junior,5,you have freedom but rent may be expensive
College Sophomore,5,"I've never actually seen anyone on my campus talk of or use any drugs. I'm not completely sure it doesn't happen, but my peers are mostly outstanding citizens."
College Senior,5,"This is the third collage I have attended and the student advisors are so far the best, the work very hard to keep you in school and help you graduate."
College Sophomore,5,"my school is a multi-cultural school with people from all over the continents; Africa, Asia, Australia, North America...."
College Junior,5,Parking permits are only $30 and there is always adequate and convenient parking.
College Freshman,5,"it is a very great opportunity for me to study Chemistry in the school. the department is very organized with proper affiliations to other relevant departments. the lecturers are very supportive, helpful and considerate. there are also adequate facilities that enhance learning. technology wise, the department is very fine. the workload is also light and easy to handle, they are mostly in progressive form. Job wise, previous graduates of my department have been able to secure good jobs with oil firms especially now that oil has been discovered in North Dakota."
College Junior,5,Classmate Are Fun – I love campus life. There are so many international students to get to know. 40% of the student population is a diversity and 60% of the 40% is from China.
College Sophomore,5,I actually attend online classes and all of the staff and students are awesome. They will help you with anything you may have questions about. Dickinson State University is AWESOME!!
College Sophomore,5,Dickinson State University offers the best curriculum I have seen in all of the schools that I have looked at.
Sophomore,4,Dickinson state university is one of the most affordable colleges you are able to attend and still get a highly educated degree. The campus is cozy and the student life is amazing. They are trying to slowly update the campus to be more modern and I think if they could prioritize that they would get more people to attend.
Sophomore,4,All the teachers are required to record all lectures and do a blackboard collaboration (zoom call) for their classes. All classes are online accessible at DSU so it is very conveient.
Sophomore,4,I like the environment. Professors and students can have a stronger relationship due to the small classes.
Junior,4,"Overall, my experience was great. The professors seem to care about their students and want the best for their students."
Freshman,4,I love the small town atmosphere.  I appreciate that my teachers know me by name and all of the coaches from various sports know all of the students.  It feels like home.
Junior,4,Have loved attending DSU! Great people. Student to teacher ratio is 11:1 so it’s great learning in a classroom where the teacher knows you by name. You aren’t just s number here.
Freshman,4,I like that it is a small campus! Professors are amazing! I can’t really say much about campus life or athletics. Overall not to bad of a college to go to! I would recommend it to other students!
Niche User,4,I love it. It is very diverse and it has a great band  i play in as a sophomore in high school. Very inviting people and place
Freshman,4,"This is actually a very small university with about 4000 students including online. The people you meet and the faculty are what makes this school achieve any greatness. They have awesome programs that help the poor and disabled students. If you can get into the Theodore Roosevelt Honors Leadership Program -DO IT! They will give you 3000 a year for four years! The school is realitively affordable, and works tirelessly to provide a safe environment and community. You will fall in love with the heart of Dickinson, I know I did."
Freshman,4,i love the fact that everyone is so helpful being as i live in baltimore and the school is in north dakota from the online teachers to the staff they are very helpful
College Junior,4,The students at the school are excited to go to sports events and school dances. School spirit is one of the highest things the school promotes and they want every student to participates.
College Junior,4,"One thing that makes my school unique is the classes are a nice size, which makes the teachers a lot more available to help their students. I would choose this school again because the teachers really care about their students graduating."
College Freshman,4,The teachers are pretty accommodating. Although the teachers seem so all seem a little disorganized. The sizes of classes are average and a lot of students drop out half ways through a class.
College Freshman,4,The teachers sometimes are hard to work with and do not answer questions through email fast enough. All in all it is great!
College Senior,4,Everyone is treated equally at our school. If anyone had issues they would have to talk to our president for advice or just keep it to themselves. Not everyone believes in the same religion. People are respected greatly no matter what religion they are. People have their own minds to think what's right and what's wrong but overall there are no issues that's been occurred because of these options.
College Senior,4,"Professors want to see you succeed so they do whatever it takes to pass their class, help you graduate, or advice for certain situations. Registration process is best when your advisor helps you because they want to keep you on tract to graduating instead of taking classes that aren't necessarily going to help the student for their major. There are plenty areas to study around campus rather if it's outside on the grass or inside in the library."
College Senior,4,"We've had no complaints or issues of any type of crime for our school to be in great danger. Because of it all, I feel safe at school"
College Junior,4,The professors in the physical education and exercise science departments have been great.
College Junior,4,I feel safe on campus
College Junior,4,the courses are amazing and helpful and so are the professors
College Freshman,2,The athletics in school does not offer that much scholarships to international students.
College Sophomore,2,The prices of housing is very expensive so that makes things bad
College Sophomore,2,"Coming from a bigger city with a huge night life, I must say that the nightlife here is teribble"
College Junior,2,"The cost of living is bad. I pay $2,100/month for a 2 bedroom house and that is normal for a non-homeowner these days because of the oil boom in North Dakota."
College Sophomore,2,"DSU recruits athletes mostly from WestCoast. The basketball team core is almost from California. The track team consists of athletes from Phoenix, AZ. Games are not really exciting though. Plus they occur rarely, like 3 times per semester."
College Freshman,2,"There really is not much to do on campus other than class and taking naps. There are dances every 3 weeks or so, and a party only if someone decides to host one off campus. Most of the off-campus parties get busted by city police pretty early. There might be more parties if most of our students weren't Chinese..."
College Sophomore,2,"FOOD Is a None – In Restaurants around campus do not exist in this small town the closest is very far away. For students with cars these restaurants are not convenient but are acceptable for any exchange students these choices are simply impossible. We have Apple-bees, Sanford's, and a bunch of small town restaurants. The prices vary based on where you decide to go, but anywhere from $6.00 to $15.00 a plate is about the usual. By small town standards its pretty expensive to eat out here."
College Sophomore,2,The dining room food is not very good.  But they do have a side cafe to use flex bucks and that is good.  I eat in my dorm room alot.
Alum,1,woefully underfunded and unprepared for online learning. The professors do not know how to use the equipment
College Senior,1,they have more dorms.wont open them.  high prices for cost.
College Junior,1,No Greek life on campus.
College Senior,1,The main reason that off-campus housing is graded so low is due to the recent influx of people to the western part of ND associated with the oil boom. Rent has gone up and places to live have become unavailble.
College Sophomore,1,Drug Policy – Because of the alcohol and drug policy no student is seen with any form of drug or alcohol on school ground
College Sophomore,1,"Too Country – I'm an urban person, and DSU is a tiny country Wild West spirited town in the middle of North Dakota. I had no common interests with college community whatsoever. The home students either discuss the food, or get drunk on weekends and chew tobacco. There are no places to go entertainment wise. Education wise DSU is ok, although many professors who are not from North Dakota tend to have a ""sloppy"" attitude"" towards the classes they teach because they know they are not working at DSU permanently.  At the moment (April 2012) DSU going through the hard times. There is the shady story about the college President faking the numbers of its graduates and current students. One of the deans committed suicide because he was involved in the story too, look it up on Google. 
Overall, you might like DSU if you got used to a small town life. As for me, the college is really boring and depressing."
College Freshman,1,"Room and Board Need to Be Seriously Assessed. The cafeteria at DSU is not very good at all. It has gotten better since the inductment of our new president however. For the price we pay, the food does not meet the needs of the students. It is very repeated, such as chicken and pizza everyday, with little other variety. The same dessert bars are served every week, and the drink machines are never kept filled so that variety is also reduced. The dorms are even worse. There are zero rooms on campus built for more than 2 people, yet about 40% of the dorms have 3 students. The cleaning staff is short, yet they don't hire anyone and the cleaning in the dorms does not get well done, if it gets done at all. The director of housing is very lazy, and is never available in her office. The RD's of the three separate dorm buildings do not work together and create a somewhat hostile environment when it comes to dealing with the administration in the dorms. This school is great if you only go for the education and do not have to live in the dorms or eat at the cafeteria."
College Sophomore,1,"The college does not provide any type of transportation; campus, local, or long-distance for her students.  If one is made available, I strongly believe a number of students will be happy with the idea."

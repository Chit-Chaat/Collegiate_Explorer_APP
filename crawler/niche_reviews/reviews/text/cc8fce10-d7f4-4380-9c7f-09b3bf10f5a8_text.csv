Senior,5,"Brand new dorms have just been built so more students will be moving in soon. The school is expanding quickly and the student population is growing fast! One of their top priorities is diversity and they never slack on striving to diversify their students. The professors all genuinely care about their students, this experience is the reason I chose Nevada State over the community college near me. I love my school and the people I have met during my college career."
Senior,5,"I am currently taking classes online and in-person. The online classes have been smooth and I feel like I'm learning just as much online as I would have in-person. Sometimes there are hiccups during class, but that cannot be prevented by anyone. The workload is manageable and the professors have been forgiving, to a reasonable extent, and have been patient with students who are struggling to adjust to the online platform."
Senior,5,The college is smaller than a large university which means the class sizes are smaller and you get a more individualized learning experience. The professors are amazing. Every professor I have had is extremely knowledgable and prepared to help their students succeed. The campus is new and continuously growing.
Senior,5,Professors are attentive even through online classes. Help is always available through the many resources Nevada State provides.
Sophomore,5,"I have taken two semesters online, because of the pandemic when normally I would be in-person classes. So far it's great, I meet with some of my classes on Zoom ad the others are already online courses. There are lots of free tutoring opportunities available."
Sophomore,5,"So far I love Nevada State College, and I have only been a student for two semesters. Most of my classes have been online, but it has not changed the educational content of the classes. The professors are very good and fair."
Freshman,5,"My online college experience for the first week was very confusing at first but I got the handle of it. The instructors were very helpful and if I ever had a question they would answer as soon as possible. Online can be very confusing with the students and instructors, but we all helped one another, on what to do and where to go."
Junior,5,"I love that Nevada State is a small campus, everyone is very friendly and the professors are excellent."
Junior,5,"There are many benefits of online learning at Nevada State College. NSC offers many online courses that fit my daily schedule. Online classes make my life more convenient and flexible. I can plan around only have to keep in mind to get work done by the due dates. I can keep my two jobs and still get my degree.  NSC professors are more than welcome to help students. If I have problems with class materials,  I have various ways to contact my professors at any time and I can expect them to respond in less than 24 hours. I am lucky that NSC online learning classes are affordable and many grants are available for students who are willing to put effort into keeping their GPA high. Thanks NSC for opportunities that you have offered to the community."
Junior,5,"Although NSC is a new college, the staffs and professors are well trained and provide help for students who needed. I love the sense of a small college. Everyone treats others with kindness. The most important is that the professors respond to me immediately. One semester, my professor noticed that I was overloaded with my schoolwork. She kindly contacted me to ask about my situation. I was really impressed. As a student who pursues an education major, the professor's feedback teaches me how to improve myself for my future career. I have learned many strategies form NSC's educators that will benefit my future students as well."
Sophomore,5,NSC is an amazing environment to be in! All professors and staff seem to really care about each individual student and try to make sure each person gets an amazing college experience and education.
Sophomore,5,Online classes can be tough but professors make it as easy as possible to complete any online course. They are very flexible and understanding as long as there is communication from the students.
Freshman,5,What I love about Nevada State College is it is a small campus which was one of the things I wanted when choosing which college I was going to go to. Everyone on campus is there to learn and have the college experience. I enjoy the friends I have made and have had amazing Professors. Professors do there best to help there students out when we as students need the help. Being on campus I have learned to build my network because it is important to have connections with other students.
Freshman,5,"Towards the end of the semester we were moved remotely online I learned a lot from taking my classes online. Professors still have lectures like normal in person class and did their best to help us students out because it is not easy. Professors aren’t there to fail us, they are there to help us and they try their best for example, arranging a schedule for office hours."
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Nevada State College has been nothing short of amazing thus far. The staff are helpful and informational, and most importantly, they care about your success. I love it here!"
Junior,5,"this is a fantastic 4 year college. affordable, and accommodating. the teachers are really good and want you to succeed."
Sophomore,5,The school itself is very nice. The professors and other faculty really seem to care about the student's education.
Senior,5,"Transferring to NSC was an easy, inspirational and achievement filled experience. Customer service has been excellent in every aspect. Professors and classes are extremely informative, rewarding and available in person and online. I am proud to have earned a Bachelor's in Psychology at Nevada State."
Junior,5,"Nevada State College seems like a school that would not be as fulfilling as others, at first hand. However, this is the most supportive and accommodating college I have experienced. The staff is very fast at responding and the professors are helpful and extraordinary educators. Not only am I in a great learning environment, but I am also able to feel more confident and comfortable in my path because of this school."
Junior,5,"I like the staff, the campus, no parking fee and the professors. The staff is very friendly and always willing to help. The campus is environmental friendly and very clean. There is no parking fee and there are always parking spaces available. So far the professors I had haven’t disappointed."
Freshman,5,My first-year experience at Nevada State College was great. All of my professors cared about the students. They always offered to help if we were having trouble and gave us advice. I can tell that they enjoyed working at the school.
Senior,5,"I love going to Nevada State College because it is still a relatively small school. The class sizes are kept to a minimum. It is also really easy to connect with a teacher both professionally and personally. The professors seem to truly care about whether their students succeed or not. The one thing I cannot wait for is when the dorms are fully built. Oh, and the new Education building. i hope i am still at Nevada State when they are finished building, but if not I will definietely come back to see what they have done as an Alumni."
Sophomore,5,"What I like about Nevada State is that they keep the classroom sizes small. This helps the students communicate with the teachers and students easily, as well as, receive more personalized help."
Niche User,5,"The advisors, instructors, and the students made this experience a very positive one for me. I am older and I was very apprehensive about going back to school."
Junior,5,Nevada State College has been there for me through and through. It is very convenient to set up classes that fit your schedule and the community at NSC is very strong.
Junior,5,NSC is a great college with educators that really care.  The campus is smaller so you have a more 1 on 1 with your professors getting the best feedback from each of them.  The students are friendly and atmosphere welcoming and overall inviting to everyone who attends or visits the campus.
Sophomore,5,"I have attended Nevada State College for the past year and a half. I am a returning college student who is much older than the average student there. All the students I have been in contact with thus far, shows appreciation for what I am out to accomplish. They invite me to hangout and party with them. When we are in class we work as a team and get these projects completed and turned in. I must say that Nevada State College is young College with a bright future ahead of it. I have been to several city and state colleges in my day. This one is just right for me!"
Freshman,5,I am actually a new student here and have already had so much help. Not only with figuring my classes out but also the whole process of making sure my books were all explained to me and financial aid was secure.
Senior,5,I enjoy the work/school life balance that Nevada State College has to offer. It's great that NSC offers online classes which are extremely helpful to working parents looking to further their education while also having to provide for their family.
Freshman,5,I am about in the process of starting my first year here at Nevada State College. I could not be any more excited and joyful for being accepted here. The campus is eye stunning. Very modern and clean. The staff was very welcoming while I was attending their student orientation. All my questions were answered and I had a wonderful time at Nevada State College
Freshman,5,"My experience at Nevada State College it was a very good one because when I went there for my orientation, the people treated us nicely, gave us breakfast, bag of goodies, and it was just an overall fun and good experience. There is nothing that can be changed yet, since I still need more time there and get to know the place better."
Freshman,5,"There are so many resources to help you reach your goals including tutoring, study rooms, and counselors that really understand the ins and outs of their school. People really try to help you succeed and promote self-reliance at the same time helping you to fix the problems you have and learn from them."
Senior,5,This school is amazing! The faculty are very supportive and so are the staff. My time here has changed my life.
Freshman,5,it was good because they are all nice and everything is really ggnkfndskjcnvkljcbnoisdfhsdiofhdshvnsdkvsnvnsjshnvuivbnkc nkcnkshknjfjhsofhjshf
Niche User,5,"I went on a tour and I learned a lot. I am looking forward to going there next year as a freshman. I am currently a senior. Graduation is approaching, and I am more than ready to start learning and get my education to start my career."
Niche User,5,My experience wit nevada state college it was the best experience so far. It was good meeting all the people in the campus they were so energetic and happy . They were so wonderful and open minded. It made me feel loved and accepted into the society. And plus that the education was phenomenal and the class sizes were very good.
Alum,5,"The campus is small, but very nice! I enjoyed the classes I took there because they were smaller than UNLV, and the professors did a better job at making sure their students understood the material they were teaching. It is very far from me, but I cannot really change that. It is a good school, though!"
Niche User,5,i liked the classes the campus is really nice i bet there dorm is going to be nice the dorms will be done fall 2020 that means that there will be more people that will be coming there from other states and it getting more great every year
Niche User,5,The teachers are kind and since the classes are relatively small the professors are able to interact more with the class. The campus itself is nice and there are great resources provided to everyone. The only thing that can be complained about is the fact that some of the buildings are a bit far from the main campus for those who don’t drive.
Junior,5,Extremely caring faculty. I transferred here and have not regretted it at all. I only regret not transferring sooner.
Junior,5,"I love NSC! I was a previous student at UNLV. Be forewarned, my review is based off from my previous experience at UNLV. I love that NSC has a smaller campus and parking is free! It does not take me 15 minutes to walk from where I parked to where my class is located. If anything, 5-7 minutes at most. I feel safer at this campus because there aren't many hiding places nor parking garages to worry about. Also, let's not forget that tuition is less at NSC!"
Freshman,5,I love the school as a whole. It is great and the feeling I get from going here is the best. The faculty is amazing and they are very involved with you though if you have a problem you need to address it with them. I love how diverse the culture is here and how friendly everyone is and it is just an overall amazing school.
Freshman,5,"I am going to be starting in 2019, but most of my family currently attends and tells me how amazing the staff is, how organized the school is, and how caring everybody is there."
Niche User,5,I recently visited Nevada State getting there not knowing where i wanted to go to college. As soon as i got there and they explained everything and all the help  the provide i was hooked with the Scorpions. The was the gear up person Nick told us that campus cops would escort you to your car if you were scared or it was dark made me feel safe and happy.
Sophomore,5,"I recently transferred to Nevada State College from UNLV and I absolutely love it. The class sizes are smaller, which allows for a more personalized learning experience and the professors tend to know you by name. The campus is smaller which allows for more a sense of community and it helps with getting involved since the clubs and organizations are very welcoming. There is also tons of resources on campus to ensue you excel in your studies."
Senior,5,"Nevada State College has a nice campus, great instructors with small class sizes which to me are important factors while getting your education. I really enjoy being a student at Nevada State College and would highly recommend this school to anyone looking to further ones education."
Freshman,5,"I love how small my college is, all my classes are small and give me a one-on-one learning experience with my professors. This college is great for those who learn better in a smaller class environment. Also, there are great clubs offered here that help with meeting new people. One thing though, the campus is not that big and there is plenty of space surrounding the college so hopefully he college could keep growing,"
Sophomore,5,Best school in Las Vegas hands down. Teachers are so involved and want their students to succeed. Huge difference in academics compared to CSN and much more price sensitive than UNLV.
Freshman,5,"They have a good variety of classes to offer, and teachers and staff are really there to help you succeed."
Sophomore,5,"As a second year student at NSC, I enjoy my academic experience in campus with amazing professors who strive into students succeeding. These small classes are beneficial into keeping that one-on-one experience with the professors in which you may get to know. I truly believe you will not be disappointed with your academic experience here in NSC."
Senior,5,Nevada State College is hands down the best school I have gone to. The class sizes are small enough that you get personal attention and the staff are second to none. The knowledge I have gained has given me a leg up on the other competition in the career market.
Junior,5,"This is my first semester at NSC.  So far I love the teachers, I love the school, and I love the classes.  The campus is small so the teachers have plenty of time for you.  And they have a full digital library, with full time free tutoring for all classes."
Senior,5,"I transferred from CSN because I didn’t want to lose the sense of community by moving to a university with bigger class sizes. Also when you have a family, NSC is flexible and now offers child care (age min and max).  I’m too old for the party scene, they don’t housing, and I am unaware of an athletics. Hence the poor ratings."
Senior,5,"The professors and curriculum at Nevada State College are both amazing. Class sizes aren't overflowing so the largest class size would be 30 students and allows student and professor interaction. Professors spend time on teaching you and making sure you understand the material. The campus is away from the distracting city life which allows peace and quiet. Several different age groups of students attend the campus, providing great diversity. Many of the students are continuing their education and this in my opinion motivates me in my studies and provides me greater insight for the future. The environment is positive and uplifting and overall transferring here was a great choice."
Freshman,5,When I visited Nevada State College I was impressed. I loved the campus. I was amazed at on how everyone was so friendly. The campus was easy to get around and not to mention it has a beautiful view. The main reason why I fell in love with this college is because they have the major I am decided to focus on. They also make learning fun and they are willing to tutor everyone to see everyone succeed. There’s nothing that needs to change at Nevada State College it’s great the way it is. I am looking forward to attending there in the fall.
Freshman,5,"I like the willingness that the professors have for you to help you including the staff. However, I would like to see a change in the prices of food in the cafeteria and see Nevada State offer housing soon."
Sophomore,5,NSC is s small school on a quiet and welcoming campus. Professor was incredibly helpful and guided me towards success.
Niche User,5,"I recently went on a tour of the school and was amazed with all the resources they offer within a small campus. I am happy to say that I highly look forward attending NSC next year,"
Freshman,5,NSC is such a welcoming environment. You dont ever feel out of place. The staff is great. Everyone is almost always smilying. It's such a positive place to be.
Freshman,5,Nevada State College is the place I want to graduate from. I am studying for business. The teachers are friendly and helpful to any situation you are in. They help you step by step.
Freshman,4,"Nevada State College is overall an amazing 4 year college for such a small one. I was going in freshman year in Nevada State College in 2020. It was kind of stressful as Covid-19 is still going on at the moment. If there wasn't any situation like this in college, I would probably have an even better experience in Nevada State. I decided this year to take a gap year of college for now, since I wasn't able to get the education I wanted, but the instructors, staff, advisors and financial aid were so helpful throughout my little experience being in college for freshman year in a small amount of time. For next school year, I do plan on going back. The community was so great and everyone was so helpful. For future scorpions who are deciding on going to Nevada State, you will never regret it. It may be a small community but a strong one too."
Freshman,4,The atmosphere of the campus is very inviting. The academic advisors and student workers are always willing to help. Questions and concerns are welcomed and answered with responsibility.
Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful and there are more opportunities than local alternatives because of the small size of the student body. Once applied, the likelihood of receiving a scholarship/grant or being accepted into a program is high. The campus offers many study areas and options. The academics is focused on nursing/med degrees, so biology professors seem to teach for those students more than biology majors. There is only a tabletop tennis team, and I never see games advertised. The professors are comparable to CSN with the exception of the more research driven aspect of NSC. Reading from the textbook seems to be downplayed here as well. Some professors will tell you that they teach everything you need to know for the 5-6 exams they will give you during the semester. There is no on-campus housing, and therefore is no party scene. However, on-campus housing is coming soon. The campus food is comparable to other colleges as well as they are expensive for the quality in many of the dishes."
Junior,4,Nevada State College is still growing to this day. When I started years ago there were only a few building and as the years have pasted it has grown into a beautiful looking campus. Even when it was small the class sizes were decent and the professors still make time for each and everyone of their students. Online classes are offered and extremely convenient for those of us students working full time and trying to make time for classes. The school is just outside the busier areas of the city with a beautiful view which to this day still takes my breath away!
Freshman,4,I haven't yet started at Nevada State College but since I've enrolled I have been treated with lots of respect. The school is extremely efficient with acceptance. I submitted my official transcripts after my application was processed and within a day I received my acceptance letter. Since then I have encountered many small issues that they were able to help me fix with a simple 5-minute phone call.
Sophomore,4,"Financial aid is very difficult, but the campus is beautiful with tons of resources and free study areas!"
Junior,4,"Nevada State College is a commuter school where students travel by car or bus to get to class. This school has nearby buildings so that students who are late won't have to walk very long to get to their classes. People are friendly and quiet, they're interested in their studies is high. I would like to see additions to Nevada State, they have a lot of potential of a college that's dedicated to academics and seriousness. Perhaps more study rooms and a lot more space for people who want peace and quiet."
Niche User,4,I feel comfortable here. I appreciate the teachers helping me extra. I like the campus and how clean it is
Sophomore,4,Faculty and staff are always ready to help as long as the student wishes to. The institution has variety of sources in order for students to success in their classes and life overall.
Junior,4,I love that it is a small school and the upper staff really does care. I would like to see the professor turnover change that way nursing students can take their higher classes without having to worry about professors quitting halfway through the semester.
Sophomore,4,"I have been attending this school for a year and a half and many of the students and teachers are friendly and very helpful. I love that the school is small so that I am able to get a more one on one attention in my classes. One thing I dont like is that the school is so far away from everything and there is nothing that is within walking distance to eat beside the cafeteria,which isnt all that great."
Freshman,4,"Nevada State College is very small compared to most, if not all, colleges in Nevada. Because the school is so small, the classes are also small creating a more beneficial way of learning for individual students. The school does not have much in the way of sports or other activities but they do focus a lot on academics and there are clubs and small events that help students get involved or talk about issues people are facing in today's society. The cost for attending Nevada State is low in comparison to 4-year colleges such as UNLV and UNR as well."
Junior,4,"I love Nevada State College for the small class size and the professors who teach here. The professors here really want you to succeed. They are very approachable in class and outside of class. Professors are always available whenever you need them. Nevada State College is very diverse, however the student life is lacking. The school is commuter based. Many students use some sort of transportation to get to school as well as to find places to eat around the school which there isn't any. Nevada State College does not have dorms/housing. The campus food is reasonable for what it is."
Sophomore,4,"The professors and curriculum are excellent but dealing with the administration for enrollment and financial aid can be confusing. The campus is very clean and away from distractions. The students are very friendly as well.  The price of tuition is higher than other institutions but is worth it.  The books chosen by professors are very good and you will not be forced to learn anything that you do not need to know for your major.  Transferring credits to this institution is a breeze and the advisors are available to appointments and walk-ins as well.  The school communicates by email, which is very convenient."
Senior,4,I have enjoyed  Nevada State College since I transferred from College of Southern of Nevada in Spring 2016. The professor has been very helpful and sincerely care about every students' future. The only thing that I would like to see change is the TRIO Program there. I am a former student that was a part of the TRIO Program but I have withdraw my position because I do not believe in the Director's view.
Sophomore,4,"I am at NSC to work on a career change. As a mother of 2, I love the diversity of students in each class. 
My biology teachers have been incredible! The campus is very clean (& new;) and easy to get to. 
It's sometimes hard getting into certain classes you need. 
I also wish they had childcare on site."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy attending Nevada State College, because I like how the students are there for one particular reason. You're able to see that the students are focused and determined to finish on time. The professors are very attentive, and I like how the classes are only about 20-30 students. It helps me understand the material more fluently."
Junior,4,"It is a great school, the only gripe I have it is so far from the city.  The professors are knowledgeable and friendly. "
College Freshman,4,I often see security roaming around campus which makes me feel safe and secure.
College Freshman,4,"The environment, teacher, facilities, and the courses have been just great for me to expand and get as much knowledge as I can."
College Freshman,4,"The environment, teacher, facilities, and the courses have been just great for me to expand and get as much knowledge as I can."
College Freshman,4,I can assume is great through the comments I have heard from other students.
College Freshman,4,The support (moral and academic) has been outstanding.
College Freshman,4,I have met the friendliest people there!
College Freshman,4,Definitely something new but I'm willing to give it my best!
College Sophomore,4,"I loved college so much it was so great to experience such a new level of school with more dedicated students and teachers that want to succeed and want to help everyone around them. I get to focus on what I want to study and how I want to study or when I can study. College is perfect and I love it so much, I recommend that everyone gets a chance to go to college"
College Sophomore,4,There is Greek life but not forced to attend.
College Sophomore,4,There is no sports but great school for education and nursing.
College Junior,4,"Small, secluded campus. Seems safe."
College Junior,4,Very easy to get to know professors.
College Junior,4,"the courses on campus has been great so far. more than half of the professors have their PHD or currently work in the field that they teach. class sizes are vary anywhere from 5 students to 40 students. each class is taken differently. in counseling we give mock sessions, then in communications we learn how to communicate with others and what people tend to do while communicating. each professor has their own teaching style that fits within the curriculum of the school. i am almost done and i love the experience i have had with Nevada State College."
College Junior,4,"I just wish there was more food options. Everything they have is great, but I don't always want a sandwich or a salad. Fast food wouldn't be an option to always go to, but every once in a while it would be nice for study sessions."
College Junior,4,I feel safe on campus.
College Junior,4,Career services offer students a number of resources to help them find internships and careers during and after graduation.
College Sophomore,4,The workload is heavy but you learn alot.
College Sophomore,4,I have not heard of any problems and security is always driving around.
College Sophomore,4,"Class options need to be more available.  Sometimes there is only one class that you want to take and one time frame which is in the middle of the day,  which makes it impossible to take for someone that has to work."
College Junior,4,"It had been awhile since I had applied to a college, the process was very straightforward and easy to understand."
College Sophomore,4,There is not one day where I do not see a security or police officer driving around the parking lot and or walking around campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I have not really had a chance to talk to my adviser about this area, but it is one I am sure they would help me on and lead me in the right direction. They have always had anyway."
College Sophomore,4,"Most teenagers do not really think about college until their senior yer or high school when you finally realize you are just months away from entering the real world. For me, I was actually really excited for college since the beginning. One of the things I was more excited about was the freedom that comes with attending college. You are free to experiment, make mistakes and take risks. For some people it is actually a new beginning to becoming your true self. My overall experience at school so far has been one I will forever cherish. I love everything my college has to offer and its the best part is that I did not have to go out of state to find it because what I was searching for was right here."
College Sophomore,4,Just started attending although it meets all of my expectations.
College Junior,4,I've attended other colleges previous to this one and this college is much different in that the teachers seem to actually care about the students here. I've been to larger universities that there were 250 people in a lecture class and I never think the professor even would have known if I was there or not. That doesn't happen at NSC and I'm glad for that.
College Sophomore,4,"I am the most let down by the lack of help new students receive. If you are just coming out of high school then the entire college system can be intimidating and threaten the likelihood that student will continue education. Bookstore hours should NEVER be the shortest on campus and should remain open longer for students who work during ""regular business hours""."
College Freshman,4,great campus great teachers very organized
College Junior,4,Usually my brother and I are the one's throwing the party
College Freshman,4,Boulder/Henderson and nearby Las Vegas have amazing variety of good food options.
College Freshman,4,I have only had brief interactions but they were positive always.
College Student,4,"The Administration at the school is pretty alert and always around when you need them, I do not see how it affects the students' in a bad way. I can honestly say that administration is pretty great."
College Junior,4,"The nursing program at my school is very competitive. It makes you work harder as a student and engage in your studies more. You are required to have a high GPA and to score high on your TEAS test. Admission is easy, you just fill out a form after taking all the required pre-requisite classes and passing your TEAS with a score higher than a 60%."
College Sophomore,4,I received a grant just for going to nevada state college.
College Junior,4,Parking sucks but everyone is pretty nice and there are a few things to do depending on what campus you are at. I havent really experiences anything in the way of shopping or other such activities but my college /is/ in Henderson so there are lots of nice parks and a few museums.
College Junior,4,The building is pretty much brand-new and so is very clean and environmentally helpful. The study places and areas of hanging out are very open and in-fact are surrounded by glass walls (the fishbowl). This helps bring in light and works great for people watching.
College Junior,4,The police and administration aren't jerks about really anything and the things they are strict on are completely understandable and appreciated.
College Junior,4,"My financial aid was granted without much difficulties. I am, however, constantly on the search for more assistance, so that makes things more difficult sometimes."
College Junior,4,This school is very simple to register for (though that may be the program that is used by all Nevada Colleges) and there is a wide variety of Special Study options available to students.
College Junior,4,"I'm in a Special Education major at the moment and I'm pretty sure I'm going to stay there. The benefits of being in my program are the very straight forward road-map to the end of my degree that they offer and also the idea that at the end of the degree, you are assigned by the school to a teacher and class that is convenient to you."
College Junior,4,"The wide range of students in this school is not just limited to race/ethnicity, but also sexual orientation and economic background. There are a lot of financial aid that is offered to students and that makes the population very diverse."
College Junior,4,The class sizes are great and the teachers seem to care. The variety of classes kinda sucks though. For each subject there are about five or six classes offered and half or more of those classes will be online. Really not great. But the classes themselves are pretty good so far.
College Junior,4,"Everyone is down-to-earth and friendly. I really enjoy the atmosphere at this school, though it is pretty spread out. I hear that the wide spacing between buildings is to accommodate the growth of the school and may end up being buildings or fields for sports!"
College Student,2,"I do not understand why it is such a hassle to receive Financial Aid, I received the money but the school takes forever to give you the money that has already been given to you. The school needs a lot of information before they can give you the Financial Aid, I eventually got it but I am not satisfied with the the money I ended up getting,  thought I was going to receive a certain amount of money but for some reason I ended up getting $1,000 less which would be $500 less per semester for both semesters."
College Junior,2,The only sport I am aware of at NSC is flag football.
College Sophomore,2,There are a few athletic teams but I don't know much about them.
College Freshman,2,There is a Football team but not many involved.
College Freshman,2,"There are only 2 food options near our campus, everything else is a 15+ min drive away. Not convenient at all when you only have 30-45 min break."
College Sophomore,2,"There aren't may dining options around my school. And the ones that are around are mainly fast food, so it's not much variety. "
College Sophomore,2,"Yeah there really aren't any food places around. There's a small bar down the street, but it's not the best. If you don't have a car, you're stuck with walking and/or taking the bus, which is highly inconvenient, especially if you just want some decent food. "
College Sophomore,2,"We don't have any dorms whatsoever. Like before, it's a small campus. People are usually to themselves, so there isn't much social interaction. We also have no on-campus housing. "
College Sophomore,2,"Yeah, we don't really have any sports. Not sure why, but we don't. No one seems to be that interested in it. "
College Sophomore,2,Scholarships available are there for new freshman or transferring students only.
College Sophomore,2,Nothing super close by other then a convenience store.
College Sophomore,2,"The major academics that I know of that are offered at my college are Nursing and Criminal Justice. The professors that I have had in the past were full-time and were repeating professors, but lately, the college has been hiring part-time professors that come from the bigger university because they need to take on two jobs to support themselves. The curriculum is standard. The registration process to get into the classes can be difficult at times. I had a friend that ended up taking a Biology class at a different college because every time she tried to sign up at NSC, she couldn't get in. "
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much ride sharing, and buses are inconvenient."
College Freshman,2,I know NSC holds events at the campus but the only sport I have heard of is flag football.
College Sophomore,2,"The parking is very limited, most students park in the dirt lot between the two buildings or on the curb"
College Freshman,2,The parking lot is too small and very limited. Most students have to park across the street and this could be dangerous.
College Junior,2,I eat at home. The closest food is McDonald's or Jack in the Box.
College Freshman,2,Students Have to Park on the Streets – I see multiple cars parked on the street due to lack of parking space.
College Junior,2,"My experience has been okay, it hasn't been perfect but I have no complaints."
College Sophomore,2,"If you have late classes, parking is disgustingly packed. Some would have to park about 1/4 mile up the street. However, early students it does not seem too hectic."
Graduate Student,1,"It's so sad to say but the speech department is a hot mess right now. There are some good teacher but there are also really horrible teachers. I wanted to love this school but after having terrible teachers like Christy Fleck, I feel like dropping out. The material is not hard, but the instructor herself does not know how to teach. How can you succeed in a school where the instructors put information on tests that aren't covered in the textbook, class, or modules? How can you succeed in school and learn from your mistakes when professors don't give you feedback on assignments until LITERALLY the last day of school, and have assignments that build off of each other. I want to love this school, but the horrible teachers really mess it up for everyone else. This school has a lot of organization issues and have corruption issues; they all cover each others butts. They don't look for the student's best interests and that to me is enough to not want to come here anymore."
Niche User,1,"This is a beautiful college and I was looking so forward to attending. Went to take my math placements exam and I used the calculator icon that mind you was provided for the test! the lady who was supervising the testing room accused me of cheating and was rambling how I should be ashamed of myself. I tried to explain to her I wasn't cheating but she wouldn't listen to a word I was saying. I went to the student government so upset and they we trying to comfort me and set me up to speak with somebody, I can't remember who, high up. The person in charge spoke to me with no compassion telling me I was right while I was sitting there crying. He ""offered"" to reschedule a different time for the test (which I could've done anyways) when all I wanted was an apology from that lady who was so rude to me. Now I attended CSN."
College Junior,1,Small school. No athletics that I'm aware of.
College Sophomore,1,There are no athletic sports at NSC.
College Sophomore,1,Las Vegas is a terrible place to live in.
College Sophomore,1,"It's all junk food, and rip off of money if I want to buy something more.  Nothing worth eating there."
College Junior,1,"I have never physically see someone smoke any drugs or drink any alcohol on campus because it is not prohibited. However, I have smelt marijuana on students and a handful of students talk about drinking out in the open. Some professors will openly talk about it as well."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus has no daycare, there is no social scene and does not stand out"
College Sophomore,1,"There is never enough spots, students drive around forever trying to find a spot or end up parking in the desert and walking."
College Sophomore,1,There is no housing available and most of the students have to commute.
College Sophomore,1,"Due to the fact that the school is fairly new, there are not a wide variety of sports that are offered. I believe flag football, cheerleading, and baseball are the only sports that the school offers and even then, they aren't very popular. They are seen as more like clubs than anything else. "
College Sophomore,1,"The parking situation at Nevada State College is pretty terrible if you are come on time to class. The only great thing about it is that they don't charge for parking. The bigger, competing university wants their students to pay over $100 a year for a parking ticket, and even then, the parking is far. The parking at NSC may be far, but it will never be anything like the university. "
College Sophomore,1,"There are different options for all three campuses. The first one, the only food options you have are to go to the second campus or use the vending machines. The second campus has a cafe that they are recently trying to get students to use. It's extremely overpriced and the people that work there don't speak English. It makes it frustrating when you have to get to class and they mess of up your order more than once. There's a Remedy's at the end of the hill near the school, but you have to be 21 or older to go into it. Otherwise, the third campus, which is mainly where Nursing Majors go to, has the most options. Mainly fast food and casino restaurants."
College Sophomore,1,There is no real dining options on campus.
College Sophomore,1,There is no campus housing however there are apartments that are within walking distance.
College Sophomore,1,We're a small campus so there's nothing on campus. Only vending machines and a restuarant down the street but that's it. Ecerything else is like a mile from our school.
College Sophomore,1,"Nevada State College does not have an athletic center. I also have never heard of any campus events, traditions, or activities. The library and student center are okay, but they are small and crowded."
College Sophomore,1,I have not heard anything about the nightlife at school. Most of the students are not very social.
College Sophomore,1,"Nevada State College is school where most students only go to take classes they need and then leave. Most of the students are not social, and not looking to participate in any activities at the school. The main thing that makes this school stand out is that they offer a $1000 match to any $1000 or higher outside scholarship. This is great because it is more money to help you pay tuition, and it makes students want to apply for more scholarships."
College Freshman,1,"Horrible, most have to park in the dirt lots across from the school"

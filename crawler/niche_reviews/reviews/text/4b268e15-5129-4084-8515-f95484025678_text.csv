Sophomore,5,This school is very inclusive and has a spot for everyone to fit in and feel accepted no matter your background. the teachers are very nice and understanding and i have yet to have a class with teachers that weren't there with their joy of teaching.
Freshman,5,"I am taking all of my classes online, excluding my Beginners Painting class. My experience thus far has been very good, considering the fact that everything is being done virtually. Despite the challenges of online schooling, living on campus in the dorms has been extremely helpful. My friends and I do our zoom classes throughout the day, but whenever we have a chance to break away from the computer screen, we hang out together."
Freshman,5,"My experience with California Lutheran has been amazing so far. The staff and faculty have been extremely friendly, going above and beyond to ensure that we are receiving the best experience possible through these troubling times. Despite having online courses, the students on campus here at California Lutheran are making the most of their college experience."
Junior,5,"It is a very quite town, not too much activity so it is easy for one to be able to focus on their schooling and not worry about a lot of noise. The town tends the go to bed early so it is great for people who enjoy waking up early."
Junior,5,i took classes online and my professors were so willing to accommodate students that had trouble. Loved how my teachers made class as much fun online as it would have been in person.
Junior,5,"I like California Lutheran University because they are quick to help in times of need and they allow you to have a life. This university is flexible with you, as well."
Alum,5,"I was a CLU student for 5 years, studying for a bachelor's in psychology. I graduated in 2018 and honestly I miss it so much. The professors care about their students, and I made friends in nearly every class I took. Everyone is friendly, especially psych students. I will say, parking is horrible, the freshman dorms are gross, and it's hard to get into classes. But, the campus is beautiful, there are better dorms for juniors and seniors, and the quality of the education you will receive is great. Personally I am not a partier so I didn't mind that there wasn't much of a party scene. If that's what you're looking for, I'd say look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a really good education and a school where you can get along with everyone, go to CLU. It's worth it."
Alum,5,"A great school, small but with a good campus life.  Class sizes are small so they feel more connected."
Freshman,5,"As a commuter student I found this school a very good choice. The campus is nice and the student union is an excellent place to kill time or do work if you don't want to go to the library. The professors genuinely care for their students and want to help them succeed. As a first generation student I was a little nervous going to a university since no one I know can really help, but the transition was easier with all the programs offered to help you at this school. The dorms look nice too, at least when I visit my friend's rooms they do."
Alum,5,I loved attending CLU. It allowed me to reach my dreams and continue my education in graduate school.
Junior,5,It has a large network base once you graduate and everyone is committed to your success via administration and other students!
Freshman,5,"The community is small but everyone has a part to helping students be the most successful a student can be. Students are given the tools and access to the people to help them when they are in need. The campus it's self is very nice and spread out, there is a lot of nature for people to be able to sit outside and do their work."
Junior,5,Being a student at California Lutheran University has been such a rewarding experience so far. The professors really look out for you and do everything they can to help you succeed. The campus life is very diverse and we have many activities and events that happen on campus almost every week. I love the school so much I plan to attend as a graduate student as well.
Senior,5,"The professors are all professional, smart and collaborative. Our courses kept us engaged in class, keeping us motivated while learning solutions of the modern world."
Freshman,5,"I liked a lot of things about California Lutheran University but one of the things that stood out to me most was the inclusion among both students and staff. I never felt left out or excluded because everyone seemed to care about each other and felt like a family. The campus itself is gorgeous with lots of greenery and natural elements while still keeping it modern with its buildings and commodities. I enjoy that there are constantly student activities going on, such as movie nights and improv shows, and I feel at home whenever I am here."
Freshman,5,You are not a number. You are welcomed and appreciated even before you sign up.  The small campus is a close community.
Senior,5,"California Lutheran University is a small learning institution, but large in what it offers: a home away from home, a place to grow intellectually and emotionally, and a guide set on helping its students find the right path in life. 

Since my first visit all those years ago, I fell in the love with the campus and its small, intimate design. Now, entering my final year of college, I relive all those precious moments I had. CLU gave me the tools and knowledge to start a career, but more than that it offered me a chance to branch out and learn who I truly was. I can only hope that those looking for a college or university find what I found in CLU."
Freshman,5,This small community really cares about you and everyone acts as a friend to get you to be your best.
Niche User,5,"Even before college was on my brain I was comfortable with CLU! The community is so close together and everyone I have met is so friendly. After applying and being accepted to CLU, everyone I have gone to with questions were so helpful. The counselors and professors are very supportive when it comes to changing your major, which is something I was personally looking for. The average classroom size is around 17 people, so you really get to know your professor, as well as have to opportunity to ask questions!"
Niche User,5,"California Lutheran University has a beautiful campus. Since I applied, they gave me an admissions counselor I could text if I had any questions and she has been very helpful."
Junior,5,"I love everything about Cal Lutheran. The campus itself is so heart warming, so safe. With the campus being in Thousand Oaks, one of the safest cites in California, it makes the environment a place wanting to attend."
Niche User,5,"What i liked about California Lutheran is the most importantly the people, location and most importantly the people. I visited Cal Lutheran for football reasons and i absolutely love the the campus and the athletics. The location is magnificent being in southern california next to the beaches is the best thing you could ask for. Cal Lu has a great atomoshpere and really brings the best out of people."
Niche User,5,"I had an amazing time a Cal Lu! I am not a student but I have participated in multiple activities that have allowed me to stay there for a short while, one of which is drum major camp. I got to stay there for a week and the hospitality was great! Everyone is so friendly the food was super good. I also enjoyed how small the campus was making it so much easier for me to get to where I needed to go. I highly recommend at least paying a visit to their campus and exploring what the campus looks like."
Niche User,5,Friendly staff.  I felt like home when I was touring there. I enjoyed the  campus. Free parking! Excellent gym.
Junior,5,My experience at California state Lutheran University was outstanding. The tour guide was very nice and spoke loud enough so all the students could hear. She explained each building to us and told the students what subject was taught in each college. The students got to see how big the classes could be and how it may look like on a regular basis. She took us to the Gym which was very clean and big. We got to see some athletes  in action. One thing i would of liked to see was more trash cans around the campus
Sophomore,5,"California Lutheran University is filled with the kindest, giving, and intelligent individuals. Every professor deeply cares about their students' success. I personally grew to realize the intensity of this campus's kindness after the Borderline shooting down the street. Cal Lutheran truly brought everyone together and made it a place where people can still feel safe and connected with the community. California Lutheran University is truly special in more ways than one. If you are looking for a college with an accepting community and a personalized eduction experience, Cal Lutheran is the place for you."
Graduate Student,5,"In my profession, I have heard employers and districts will only hired those from this university because they know when the students graduate, they are prepared for the workforce. 

Great school and amazing professors. Excellent opportunities!"
Alum,5,"CLU has opened me up to so many different life opportunities. I have met some of my absolute best friends through the university and have gained a large amount of knowledge. The professors are so dedicated to their students and having such a small class size is very beneficial. Overall, CLU is decently small but since it is a private school, there are a lot more opportunities for individualized activities and activities that would not be normally allowed at a public university."
Graduate Student,5,"CLU is a great school and I am so glad I picked it for my graduate studies. The counseling program I am in, teachers, students and facilities are all fantastic. You truly get to interact with your professors and classmates and work on assignments together to get the best result. Class sizes are small and it feels like I am truly getting the most out of my graduate experience."
Sophomore,5,"Being a small private university, California Lutheran University is well known for their professors that care a lot about their students that they want to see succeed. The perks about Cal. Lutheran include the small and comfortable campus that brings a relaxing while also vibrant atmosphere. From the beautiful scenery of the campus to the students who strive for success: California Lutheran University is the school where people and teachers will push you to achieve your dreams."
Sophomore,5,"This school is accepting and diverse . The campus is beautiful and safe and people look out for each other like family . With this atmosphere , you can learn and grow . The professors are great and the smaller classss allow for lots of personal attention.  They are also easy to meet with and always want to help. I feel like CLU is a hidden gem . People don’t realize how wonderful it is!"
Junior,5,Being a small private school makes relationships between student and professor much more personal. Communication is very easy among the school and they provide many activities and opportunities for the students to set them up on the right career path.
Junior,5,"California Lutheran University has provided me with all the necessary tools to be successful in my academics as well after graduation. They have also given me the opportunity to conduct undergraduate research which could potentially benefit greatly once I apply to graduate programs. Over all, Cal Lutheran is a friendly, caring, and welcoming campus."
Niche User,5,"California Lutheran is a wonderful, safe college with caring professors , thought provoking courses, and just all sorts of great things. It is a smaller campus, but the facilities are top notch. Dorm rooms are huge and have beautiful courtyards. The food is healthy and delicious. I feel that it is underrated as a B+.   Consider this university !"
Junior,5,"The professors here are amazing. Small class sizes (and department sizes) allow you really to get to know your professors, and it's clear that they genuinely care about you. The campus is absolutely beautiful and has great vibes. The new cafeteria has incredible food, and most of the dorms are spacious and comfortable. My only complaint is that I wish it were bigger; sometimes clubs die out because not enough people come to them, and I wish I could get to know more people with similar interests. Overall, though, great experience so far."
Niche User,5,"I really enjoy the campus and the students, if you want to be involved you can be as involved as you want. There are many internship opportunities, and people to help."
Junior,5,I love cal lutheran because it is so diverse and everyone on campus is super friendly. I would personally like to see growth in the film and art departments!
Alum,5,"I had a great experience at FLU. It is true that it is a small, friendly campus, and you can certainly make the most of your time there with a variety of activities, study abroad opportunities, clubs and internships. If you lean into it you can fill your 4 years with a wide mix of academic and social experiences ."
Niche User,5,"I recently took a summer college course at this institution and all I can say is that it is a breathtaking experience. Not only is the campus architect beautifully crafted, the professors are so passionate in their lessons that intrigue me deeper than any other school. The professors question your thinking and guide you to think of another perspective that you would have never imagined thinking about. They are helpful and willing to go up and over for any question you have. Similarly, the students encourage everyone to come together and form a family. Within this family you learn to love others and embrace each others differences regardless of their background. All in all, the institution aims for a higher education for every student that would not dare leave anyone out of this amazing experience and will help you financially."
Alum,5,"I loved California Lutheran University! Small class sizes, the professors truly care and want you to succeed! Great location!"
Sophomore,5,"Cal Lu is THE BEST private and liberal arts school in the country! The professors and the small class sizes are amazing, as is the overall atmosphere at the university. The aid and scholarships are extremely helpful."
Alum,5,As an alum of California Lutheran University I was able to see how much respect employers have for graduates from here as I prepared to enter the workforce. I was able to get a job thanks in large part to the Career Services department on campus -- they even helped me with my resume and prepping for the interview.
Niche User,5,Cal Lutheran is located in a beautiful and safe area.  The staff is incredibly helpful and provide so many opportunities for the students.  I am so excited to have the opportunity and I recommend it to all college-seeking students.
Junior,5,California Lutheran provides a small family feel. The college and all the resources that are provided are very nice.
Alum,5,"I absolutely love the small atmosphere Cal Lu provided. They give you all the steps to succeed. It is wonderful to be able to make a real connection with your professors, seeing as the biggest class you'll be in is about 45 people. Walking through campus, you will see familiar faces anywhere you go. You make great connections with your classmates, especially the ones who share the same major, as you are likely to spend most classes with them. Cal Lu sets you up for success and offers many services while you are a student, as well as great opportunities to network as an Alumni as well. No matter where I go, I know I can always call Cal Lu my second home."
Graduate Student,5,Small classes.  Personal attention.  Well-qualified and experienced professors.  Lovely campus.  What else could you want?
Freshman,5,"Cal Lutheran is an outstanding university.  It has been rated one of the safest colleges in the entire country.  The Professors knowledgeable, professional and genuinely concerned about your success."
College Junior,5,Safety measures include text/phone/email alerts.
College Junior,5,School has their own community mental health clinics that train therapists from their program.  Reputation of this school's MFT graduates is highly regarded in the community and draws employers from throughout the area.
College Junior,5,I have not visited campus housing
College Sophomore,5,"I enjoyed my classes, and it was very apparent how much my professors cared."
College Sophomore,5,"When needing transportation across campus late at night, campus safety was always available to drive me. They made me feel very safe and comfortable."
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely loved living in the dorms. My hall had an amazing sense of community and my RAs were fantastic.
College Sophomore,5,The overall experience is great in Cal Lutheran because there are a lot of inviting people that are there for each other.
College Junior,5,"From what I've noticed, there doesn't seem to be many problems on campus. I haven't heard of any scandals or sexual assaults. I feel very safe walking around campus by myself whether it's during the day or at night."
College Sophomore,5,"My first year at Cal Lutheran was great. It is small, but most people are friendly and it's easy to get to know people in your hall and classes."
College Freshman,5,"The teachers show care for the students and their progress, not only in class but also in their future career. The class sizes are what compelled me to attend Cal Lu because it promotes one-on-one with professors, and they actually know your name. The professors are very dedicated in their work and helping students succeed in and outside the classroom."
College Sophomore,5,"I feel very safe on campus. Always have security driving around, so its really comforting."
College Sophomore,5,"Professor really care about each student and their success. Class sizes are small, which is a perfect learning environment. Class style is different with each teacher, but they are all very involved styles."
College Sophomore,5,"I got a really good internship, with connections from the school."
Junior,4,"I am about to take classes online and the professors have communicated very well with everyone, which gives me a lot of confidence to do well in my classes."
Alum,4,"I did not have many classes online at CLU, but the ones that were were very clear.  I'm sure now that most classes are online things are better."
Alum,4,"Small classes were very helpful in the learning environment. Some classes purposely try to weed students out, but I suspect that is something that occurs at all colleges/universities"
Alum,4,"They typically do not offer many online classes (at least in my fields of study). With that being said, I did take one online summer school class and enjoyed it tremendously."
Freshman,4,"For the most part, people are kind here— staff, employees, professors, and students (Usually, but what can you do)."
Sophomore,4,"I'm from the other side of the country and I found California Lutheran to be unexpectedly welcoming. Everyone I meet was friendly and there was always more than one person willing to show me around the campus. The teachers I had were fine, none of them really made me interested or excited about what they were teaching but they weren't terrible either. I didn't have a meal plan, but I heard from more than a few people there that it is common knowledge around campus that the food they serve is terrible. Though they do have a Starbucks and Jamb on campus so that might make up for it. The dorm hall that I lived in was very nice and I luckily got put with roommates that were very nice. One of them I am still in contact with. Overall, it's pretty chill."
Freshman,4,My time at Cal Lu has been so beneficial and fun. The location is great (30 minutes from the beach) and everyone has been so friendly.
Alum,4,"My experience at California Lutheran University in the Adult Education Program was nothing other than remarkable. I can't give this college a higher rating enough in the quality of education aspect of rating. The professors not only bring the educational portion to their instruction, but you as a student also receive feedback from working professionals who have been successful in their own perspective careers. The only downside to go to California Lutheran University is the cost of Tuition and Additional fees. However, overall I would definately recommend attending here for an Undergrad Education."
Senior,4,I have enjoyed myself in the California Lutheran University. Everyone has been very nice and professionals are very helpful
Alum,4,"CLU is a great school filled with fantastic and dedicated professors, really in depth classes and opportunities on campus to meet other people, get involved and study abroad. The school is on the way of becoming more diverse and progressive and expanding, but isn't expanding in all the ways necessary to keep up. The classes are great, but more sections are needed with the growing population of admitted students. Same goes for dorms and appointments. The criteria is there, it just needs to be increased. The school helps with some programs in setting up opportunities for internships and post-grad life, but for me in particular I had very little assistance from the school itself, minus some fantastic advisors."
Graduate Student,4,"I am in the Executive MBA program, which started in the Spring. I take classes both at the campus and online. The Administration and Faculty are first class. They want the students to succeed. Cal Lutheran has one of the highest ranked MBA and EMBA programs in California. So far my classes have been small (WW students) and I don’t expect that to change. The only thing that I can think of that I might change about this University is to have more consistency in the skill of teaching in the professors. I feel very lucky to be enrolled in this excellent program."
Sophomore,4,"Small liberal university, very easy to meet new people. I would say the only thing that I would change is it make it bigger with more options to get around more (food, classrooms, gym)."
Sophomore,4,"California Lutheran University is a wonderful school. The campus is beyond beautiful and so is the wild life and the local area. Everything is close to the campus so there is not a real need to drive very far to get what you need. Certain professors don't teach by having the students basically figure everything out on their own which I don't really like, but other than that the school is pretty great."
Junior,4,"CLU a is very accommodating and welcoming community filled with people who want you to succeed. If you are ever in need of help, there is a resource or point person ready to assist you in any way possible."
Freshman,4,Overall my first year at this university was great. I got lots of support for my studies and made many new friends. Professors here genuinely care about you and your education and will always make the time for you to get extra help. The only thing I wish was better was that I wasn’t always notified about the events going on and only found out the day of.
Freshman,4,"The Admissions is fairly competitive as the Cal Poly Pomona acceptance rate is 55%. Popular majors include Business, Hospitality and Tourism Management, and Computer Science. Graduating 66% of students, Cal Poly Pomona alumni go on to earn a starting salary of $37,000. Overall it was good school."
Freshman,4,"I like it. Feels like a community.
Not my first choice but very good, very friendly.
Small - not many places to eat."
Alum,4,I thought the school was very good. All minority groups were well-represented in both the faculty and the student body. My one complaint is that the school supplied a lot of money to sports which meant that the arts sometimes were put on the backburner. The theatre arts department has been housed in an old gym for several years without an actual theater to work in.
Sophomore,4,"The atmosphere of acceptance that CLU provides is something to not take for granted. Professors are fully dedicated to providing a collaborative environment where conversations are encouraged, in turn, enhancing the academic experience. Your voice is heard, no matter your background. My only complaints would be the lack of food choices and activities around campus. Other than that, the campus feels like a community where it is impossible to not see a familiar, friendly face on a daily basis."
Niche User,4,"I recieved an email from them early in the year saying that they wanted me to visit their school so I did. I almost instantly feel in love with their school and the people. Everyone there was so sweet and very welcoming. The only reason I gave it four stars was because I could tell that it wasn't very diverse, which isn't there fault but other than that I loved my experience there."
Sophomore,4,"I play basketball here and it is an awesome experience, even with it being a division 3 school. The class sizes are very small which means you have the opportunity to get close with you professors, and that can be very helpful if you take advantage of it. The food here isn't awful, it's just that you get sick of it quickly but it is better then a lot of other schools. The campus is small and nice so you never have to walk more than 7 minutes to get to a class which is convenient."
Junior,4,"My experience with CLU has been a good one generally. I have attended it for three semesters so far and am satisfied with most features. However, the food on campus is pretty bad. You do have a choice of buffet-style cafeteria, Starbucks, Jamba Juice and a cafe, yet for an athlete, the only place with a good price/food ratio is the cafeteria. The food in cafeteria is the worst. It may seem to have a good variety at first, but after a few month it feels like a refrigerator full of food where there is nothing to eat."
Junior,4,"California Lutheran University has been such a wonderful experience for me.  The administrators and staff work to make the college challenging and fun at the same time.  
I have the opportunity to work with the Study Abroad Department to gain to go abroad and gain a global perspective while earning credits towards my degree."
Freshman,4,"So far, the experience here, since my enrollment has been smooth and truly helped me develop my path in life. The classes and its teachers goal is to allow us students, to grow and become a part in a very diverse world, in our own ways."
Junior,4,California Lutheran University is a great school with an incredible campus. Since it is a small school you get to meet a lot of nice people. You also get to know your professors who are there to help you.
Sophomore,4,"CLU is the perfect school if you're looking for small class sizes with teachers that are more than willing to help you succeed. The campus is small enough that you recognize faces where ever you may go, but will always seem to make new friends"
Niche User,4,"I have a cousin who attends California Lutheran. When visiting the school, I really enjoyed the sense of community, and diversity. My cousin really enjoys the school. He says it is filled with intellectual professors, fun activities such as intramural sports, and many different activities."
Niche User,4,"My Dad went to California Lutheran University and he took me to visit the campus over Summer, and I do have to say I was very impressed on how bautifl it is. They had plenty of activities and the building were amazing."
Sophomore,4,"California Lutheran University has a tremendous staff who care deeply for your success during and after your stay at the school. The small-sized campus makes for a feel-good, community-like dynamic in which everybody is accepted and celebrated for who they are. The academics are above average as each professor provides in-depth academia in which they are very passionate about. The smaller class sizes allow for a more intimate setting for students to develop relationships with not just fellow students, but also with their professors. The atmosphere of the entire campus is fresh and welcoming. Personally, it has been very easy getting to know new people whom I have built great relationships with already. Overall, California Lutheran University is a place for people who want to feel at home and  feel like they can make an impact on their school."
Freshman,4,"Although it is a very small school, it is nice how closely relative everything is. I like how close everyone is at this school and how friendly everyone is. The dorms are pretty nice. It is a lot having five people in one room for freshman, but there is a nice living room. The study rooms are nice to escape to. There are many places to study and do homework."
Freshman,4,"I am in love with the campus and surrounding area. You can walk around anywhere at one in the morning and feel one hundred percent safe. I am never worried about my safety on campus, and you definitely get what you pay for. I would like to see some more passion from some faculty and professors, as well as more student diversity. Overall, this university is amazing and definitely worth every penny I spend."
Senior,4,"Cal Lu gave me an exceptional education with the help of many great professors. My professors have all been understanding and caring when it came to my education, you are not just a number in a lecture hall. The one downfall is the lack of Greek life making you miss out on the “typical college experience.”"
Junior,4,"Its  small school, extremely expensive and diverse.  The town of thousand oaks is very nice and so is the campus. However, it seems that it lacks in educational value. I feel that I had to put more effort into my studies at a community college."
Freshman,4,"I love my university because of the small class sizes to begin with. These classes allow teacher- student interactions to be much more refined. Also, the campus is beautiful and the staff is very attentive."
Alum,4,"Great school, small class sizes, real opportunities for deep relationships with professors. But, a little limited in student support services and diversity of students."
Junior,4,California Lutheran is a fantastic university! The only complaint I have to make about it is that it doesn't always do a good job recognizing its student's financial struggles. The Financial Aid office needs to be made aware of other ways to help.
Sophomore,4,"Coming from A small close knit high school, I was looking for a university that could offer me a similar experience. At Cal Lutheran I feel that the professors and faculty make an honest effort to get to know the students. I feel that they challenge the students and foster growth among them. I am very proud to be on a campus that accepts and promotes diversity. It has been an honor to attend Cal Lutheran and I hope to make my mark on the university in my time there."
College Junior,4,I honestly don't know much about the regular athletic activities as I attended a satellite campus and was an older undergraduate
College Junior,4,"Very liberal for a religiously affiliated school, but that's Lutherans for ya"
College Sophomore,4,"There's really no peer pressure, and the school does a lot of crack downs on students and drugs."
College Sophomore,4,"Although I have not fully taken advantage of the career assistance, I find the counselors and advisors very helpful and passionate about our futures."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors at my school genuinely care about each student, working to get to know them personally as well as helping them to succeed."
College Junior,4,I'm a beginning student at the Woodland Hills satellite location but I enjoy the small class sizes. It really helps bring the students together.
College Sophomore,4,"Even from the small space that Cal Lutheran has to offer, there are a lot of career options on campus."
College Sophomore,4,The students are well behaved and the people around there care about the students and there is a lot of securities that are in patrol.
College Sophomore,4,The housing is expensive but the rooms are a quality and everything is in close range of the rooms. The only thing that I would want to change is the late night options and variety of food.
College Sophomore,4,"Since the school, there are a lot of the student that are playing some kind of sport."
College Sophomore,4,Cal Lutheran is small and the teachers are always there to help the students in any way possible.
College Junior,4,The courses are well thought out and they challenge students.
College Junior,4,There are people here to help students find internships and jobs that relate to their major.
College Junior,4,I do not live on campus; I'm a commuter.
College Junior,4,"I'm not sure if I would pick this school again. It's a bit pricey, and I'm not very religious."
College Sophomore,4,Really nice compared to most freshman housing
College Sophomore,4,The football stadium isn't huge but is usually full during most home games. It's D3 but the athletes are really good .
College Freshman,4,"Campus secutiry is available with just one quick call, which brigns me a lot of comfort. The campus itself is very quiet and calm and there are hardly ever any crimes, or times were I feel unsafe. The parking lot however, should be a bit more lighted at night, because anyone could easily be hiding behind a car."
College Freshman,4,The athletics program motivates not only athletes but also non-athletes to participate.
College Freshman,4,"My school really cares about the students as an individuals, not just as academic students. There are countless amount of resources that help students feel comfortable around campus. I would definitely choose this school again because it really brings forth the sense of community."
College Freshman,4,The sports facility's here are very nice. Every game I have gone to has mostly full bleachers with a lot of school spirit. The student body doesn't revolve around sports or the start team members though.
College Freshman,4,The school is pretty small. Almost all the staff and students are very friendly. A lot of students are very involved on campus.
College Freshman,4,Professors are always prompt in their responses. They truly know your abilities as a student and professional and understand how to best challenge you and facilitate growth and learning.
Alum,2,"I wish there were more online classes available. Almost all of CLU's classes are in person. Hopefully this is something they will change to allow for more flexibility for students, especially since in person classes are always full."
Alum,2,"Cal Lutheran needs more resources outside of the classroom for students who need extra help with course material, especially for their STEM majors. Their dorms are also not worth the amount of money you have to pay to live in them; most of the dorms need renovating. Additionally there's limited on-campus options for food and the meal plan types aren't varied and are very expensive. It's also a very small campus so if you like a larger student population, then look at a different school because it's difficult to meet new people after your first year there. This university is a good experience for some people and for others it's not, make sure you visit it before you make a decision."
Freshman,2,"Love the four year graduation guarantee.  However student life living on campus not great. Seems more like a commuter school.  The food is gross and been a waste of a lot of money because you have to buy the meal package and when salads are wilted and fruits are slimy,not much left.  I pay double for food because I can't stand the food. Eating at Starbucks is my main meal and that's not mucho option.  I have lost weight and I didn't need to.  It's encouraging poor diets and can cause anexeria.   Student life there isn't one.  Academics is good however my English class they picked was for a foreign student so they transferred me to intramedial English and I was a high school AP student."
College Sophomore,2,"A large majority are liberal, however the conservatives are trying to stay afloat. In regards to finances, I would say that the majority of students would be categorized as affluent while it seems like a select few (including myself) inhabit the fairly low income classification."
College Freshman,2,"School has a lot of strange/overbearing graduation requirements and it is sometimes hard to get into classes needed for my major. However, most professors are passionate and happy to help."
College Freshman,2,"The dorm itself is somewhat far from most, if not all, classrooms and dining facilities. The amount that they charge for housing absolutely does not reflect the standard of housing received. This year, we had five people crammed into a traditionally three-four person suite and once the fifth person had moved out, campus services neither came to remove the extra bed/desk/dressers that were taking up valuable space nor did they allow us to move it. There is no place to do laundry on this floor. It was also very difficult to move in/out of the dorms."
College Freshman,2,School is not only over-priced but is poorly budgeted and does not use student fees/payments in an appropriate or diligent manner. Fees often go towards areas that are not in need of update/re-budgeting instead of going towards things that would make the school actually worth what it is charging. Housing fees most definitely not equal to the standard of living received and the same goes for meal fees.
College Freshman,2,California Lutheran University does not have any Greek life.
College Sophomore,2,"Health and Wellness programs were terminated, but they are very important - students need access to that information and guidance."
College Sophomore,2,We don't have Greek Life. I know of two fraternities on campus for science and business majors to help each other get hooked up into programs and internships.
College Sophomore,2,This is not a party school. If you play sports and are well known you will most likely get in. Get to know some of the more well known athletes and try to get in. Everyone knows each other at the few parties that occur so they are really fun. Things get shut down pretty easy if the party gets out of control and and to wild but it just depends on what house you go to. Some parties have music going all night and nothing happens so just be aware. Everyone is actually pretty chill at the parties but just be prepared to be kicked out by upperclassmen if they don't know you or if there are to many guys.
College Sophomore,2,"Starbucks tastes not very good, the Centrum is pretty disgusting, and the Commons isn't too bad, though you get sick of the food very easily. It is very hard to find YUMMY food on campus, everything just tastes the same day after day.  Although, they do have healthy options, they do not have very many of them."
College Junior,2,There are not many parties and you are invite only if you are an athlete basically.
College Freshman,2,there really isn't a party scene. Always shut down and just not fun
College Freshman,2,the minimal options / healthy choices
College Senior,2,I never see the Greeks and they do not have any facilities available on campus.
College Senior,2,If you like to shop you're good. But you would be a student and how would you get all your money... Oh yea you're rich
College Senior,2,it's pretty easy to get in. There is an awful amount of requirements so I recommend students choose Comm instead of Multimedia. It's the same damn thing.
College Senior,2,you basically need to fend for yourself and pay top dollar
College Senior,2,"The teams are not real good, but the stadium is great"
College Senior,2,"Ihave to keep going back to financial aid over and over to get clarification. Now they're saying I owe the school over $2000, and I may have to drop out for the semester! This happened last fall, too, and  I did have to drop out until spring.

I don't know why this keeps happening, and I apply and apply for these scholarships and I never get them. It's very,very depressing. I'm 63. I don't have my whole lifetime to finish school. I've taken care of EVERYBODY all my life. It's my turn, but I can't seem to get Cal Lu to cough up any more grant and scholarship money, even though I have a 3.7 GPA (merit) and I live far below the poverty line (need). I may very well have to transfer to a state school. (where it will take me seventeen years to get the classes I need.)  Wow. Opened the flood gates there, didn't I?"
College Freshman,2,Cal Lutheran lacks in the party scene.  You have to venture out to L.A. or the West San Fernando Valley for some fun.
College Senior,2,They dont cater to college students
College Senior,2,"Teacher's are poor in the teaching methods, when we give reviews there is rarely a change from the professors, most of them are full of themselves, teachers rarely teach. I know of three professors in the business program who actually teach and even though they are difficult, it is worth the work. Econ classes are the worst, very little direction (especially Coman) . The business building is old and small. Could use a renovation..."
College Freshman,2,there is minimal public transportation to get around to other areas. everything is a pretty far walk if you do not have a car.
College Freshman,2,"There isn't a form of transportation on campus, that I know of. The campus is small so it's not needed. "
College Freshman,2,It's expensive  for commuters and the meal plans too for bad boring food.
College Freshman,2,There is never anything going on at school because it is such a small school.
College Junior,2,"There are very few good parties, and even when they do happen, the host can be an asshole and not let you in. Your best best is small kickbacks at friend's houses"
College Junior,2,"The food here is okay. You find what you like, but definitely get sick of it REALLY quick."
College Sophomore,2,"The racial diversity is mostly white in our school but it is fair really. There is latino, afro decent and asians just not in large quantities."
College Sophomore,2,"There are three places to dine on campus. The dining hall (cafeteria), the centrum (on campus restaurant), and the Mogen Mart (a miniature grocery store). For the price of the meal plan, the cafeteria food is extremely lacking. The options are repetitive and the quality isnt the best. Also if you are hungry after 7pm you are out of luck. The Centrum is open a bit later, til 11pm, but the food is the same you will find in the cafeteria and is also closed in the weekends which is very inconvenient. The Mart is open late and on weekends but mainly just contains snack-like food."
College Sophomore,2,"There are mostly chain restaurants and fast food places around CLU. Thousand Oaks is mostly known for being a ""retirement city"" so almost everything off campus, close by, shuts down by 10 pm. You have to travel a good distance to get into the night life. I would strongly recommend having a car on campus if you don't want to be stuck with nothing to do most nights."
College Junior,2,"I don't live on campus, but I can tell you that  local police are very strict with DUI's."
College Junior,2,"There is nothing close to campus, and no public transportation.  I did not attend CLU for undergraduate so I don't know about campus drinking.  For 21+ there are many great bars in town and nice cab drivers."
College Junior,2,"I can only speak for the graduate education program, but the classes are just not what they should be.  We are learning how to teach, and none of my classes make effective use of the strategies we are supposed to be learning.  The concepts are easy, but there was one class that required extensive repetitive assignments.  There is another teacher who is supposed to be teaching us about diversity in the classroom, but she uses the class as a platform for personal reverse racist and political advocating.  Hopefully, the program with improve as I go further."
College Freshman,2,"ACTCM does not have ""Campus-Police"" as it were, but the local neighborhood is generally safe.
Although, there are plenty of car break-ins, so keep a keen eye, and carry valuables with you!"
College Freshman,2,CLU is surrounded by an abundance of fast food and chain restaurants. Everything is about a 5 minute drive or less but there isn't a lot of variety. There is a good authentic chinese restaurant called Imperial Garden that is about a five minute walk from campus. Other than that the students can find whatever type of food there looking for in a cheap chain restaurant.
College Freshman,2,"For me it was, and still is, a big hassle to receive a lot of financial aid. I had to take out tons of loans to afford it but they really did help me out with as much as they could. I think it was also given that it's a private so they have to help other students as well."
College Sophomore,2,"Cal Lutheran is very strict, especially when it comes to on campus drinking. It is a dry campus, so the policy is that every time you get caught with anything alcohol related, you are required to pay about one hundred dollars and take an online alcohol course that takes about 4 hours. I find this policy to be quite extensive, especially if the student is not even physically seen drinking."
Alum,1,"I never was an online student, so I can't really make a statement about it.  I have never spoken to students about their online experience either."
Senior,1,"I may be in the minority, but CLU is a terrible school. My social experience has been great and I have made many friends. But it all comes down to administration at CLU. I always have to double check to make sure my registration or housing forms have been filed correctly., things that students shouldn't have to do. Housing is a mess. There are more students than the university can handle, so freshman are stacked 5 to a room. Overall CLU just has terrible regard for their students."
Niche User,1,Home of Eurocentric supremacist thinking in the Bay Area. They're still hoping the great German culture will return to power. No wonder the ELCA Lutheran church is the whitest denomination in the country - they're fighting to keep it that way. Zero tolerance for ANY OTHER cultural presence or expression. Home of the twisted cross....
College Freshman,1,School is not very popular.
College Freshman,1,School is practically empty when it comes to the weekend and does not have a present party scene.
College Sophomore,1,We don't have greek life.
College Junior,1,"We don't have Greek Life yet, but I think some smaller fraternities are making a push to come to our school. It would have made my college experience better, I believe, if Greek life was an integral part of the school, but that wasn't something I looked for when applying to CLU."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Thousand Oaks is a very safe place which is great but it is also super boring, nothing much to do if you want a life."
College Sophomore,1,"We don't have greek life, yet."
College Senior,1,They lose my paperwork and the application process is confusing and I had no assistance until it was too late.
College Senior,1,There are rarely any parties in the area and if you want to go out there are many clubs in LA which are an hour away.
College Senior,1,if you are a white female you are in heaven
College Senior,1,It doesn't really take much to get into the program there are just a ton of requirements after you are enrolled
College Senior,1,No one cares about varsity sports except the students that play them and their parents.
College Senior,1,it's a bunch of rich kids that are either socially awkward or try and replay their high school days mixed with kids that are not rich and came here to play sports because they couldn't play anywhere else.
College Senior,1,I paid less out of pocket at more expensive schools. Being a transfer student sucks on all angles.
College Senior,1,My grandma goes to better parties that don't ever get shut down
College Senior,1,this is the place where parents send kids to get into the least amount of trouble
College Sophomore,1,"Ruins everything, and you have to pay ridiculous fees for everything"
College Freshman,1,"i feel as though this is a small dictatorship and we have limited freedom. a good thing though, we do not have a curfew. thank god!"

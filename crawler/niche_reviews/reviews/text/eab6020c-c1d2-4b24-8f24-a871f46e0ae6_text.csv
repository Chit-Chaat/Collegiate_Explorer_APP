Sophomore,5,"I love it, it’s such a welcoming environment! We still have events with COVID precautions. It’s a small college where students respect each others space and needs. The staff is also wonderful."
Sophomore,5,"Many on my classes are online, but it’s very organized. There’s good communication between the professors and students."
Graduate Student,5,Alverno is full of students who are strong minded. The school itself is very supportive of its' students. All of the faculty and staff are very nice and willing to lend a hand. The students are diverse in their backgrounds and their capabilities. I love Alverno!
Junior,5,Alverno College incredibly unique. The sense of community is unmatched and I always feel like I belong.
Sophomore,5,"I love Alverno college. All of the teachers are very helpful, and the other students are very supportive. I like that they grade you based off of eight abilities/ skills instead of letter grades. It really helps show what you're good at and how you can improve in certain areas."
Niche User,5,"As I visited to Alverno's college campus, I immediately fell in love with the campus. The administrators and the students who introduced the campus tour and giving us a warm welcome into the campus made me feel so comfortable to be around and how included I felt when I went there. I would 100% recommend this school!"
Senior,5,I love how small classes are and how every teacher in there cares deeply for student success. Their passion reflects on their students.
Sophomore,5,Something that I liked about Alverno College is the Environment as well as how much the professors want you to succeed as a student.
Junior,5,"My 2 years at Alverno so far have been overall great. I love the school and the people who come with it. I would definitely recommend the school to someone  who is looking to live away from home for school but doesn't want to live too far away. Alverno has a very high diverse rate where nobody is left out and everyone is welcome, nobody is turned away because of race and is a strong believer in DACA. If looking for a school with one on one learning, diverse atmosphere, athletics, and of course a great education, Alverno is the place to be!"
Senior,5,Supportive environment. Instructors accommodate and assist. Unique 8 abilities curriculum. External assessments. Constructive feedback. Annual Community Day. Deicated to lifelong learning.
Alum,5,"The educational enviornment is unmatched. Most programs are small enough that you have unlimited access to faculty. The college is very inclusive and they are always offering something to do. Paying the extra money for this private school education is absolutley worth it in the long run. The lessons I learned at Alverno, I will carry for the rest of my life!"
Sophomore,5,"I came to Alverno as a transfer student. My first overall impression was that it was only for crazy outgoing people. However, now going into my third semester, I love it! The community around Alverno, along with the staff and women who attend this school are amazing and supportive. Alverno does not have grades, we have a pass or fail system. At first it was scary with that grading system,however, I really like it because the professors provide lengthy feedback on every assignment. The feedback tells us what we did well on and how we can improve our skills. With the professors giving indivial feedback, it provides us with a chance to form a better relationship with them rather then being defined by a grade."
Junior,5,The staff and faculty members are friendly. The faculty members care about the student's success. You will be pushed to do even better than you had expected yourself to do. The job opportunities after college are amazing. The school prepares you for the world after graduation very well.
Junior,5,"This school is amazing. The teachers interact with every person and it isn't just any college, the professors know your name. If a student is struggling in a class, they will reach out and make sure they get help. We don't get grades in this school, it is a pass or fail but this challenge the students to think more and study to make sure they get it right the first time. Everyone is so kind to one another, the students and the staff. I feel comfortable going to this school and the friends I made are amazing. Going to be getting my masters at Alverno College as well next year!"
Sophomore,5,"I find Alverno College to be an excellent place to extend my knowledge and expertise. I love Alverno because it's such a inclusive college, so the staff and students are always so nice and postive."
Sophomore,5,"Alverno College has been really great so far! Sometimes scheduling is hard to figure out and some professors are hard to deal with but for the most part, I love being a part of the Alverno family. The small class sizes are awesome and there are always opportunities to get involved in the community and connect with others. It's been a really great experience so far and I can't wait to see what the rest of my education will bring!"
Freshman,5,"I love everything about this school, it's so different from other schools, which is really good for me. Everyone here is so nice and care about how our schooling is going. They really want to make sure you reach every goal you have. I wouldn't change anything, I love my school the way it is."
Alum,5,Best women's college out there! It made me be an independent woman who now has a successful career and confidence that shines!!
Freshman,5,"It's an amazing school with a real passion for its students. The curriculum is meaningful and the teachers are committed to helping you excel. The only thing I'd personally change is the food services, they need a little bit of help. 
This is not a party school, but you can find people to go out with if you are looking for it."
Freshman,5,I absolutley love it at Alverno! Ever since the first day I stepped into that school I instantlly felt like home. Everyone at school is really friendly! You will right away fit in and make lots of friends! Professors are amazing too!  They all have positive attitudes and are always available when you need anything. I recommend alterno very much and believe you will be very successful here!
Niche User,5,"I haven't attended the college yet, but it seems very fitting to my needs as a student and looks to be a lot of help along my road to success!"
Junior,5,"Alverno is an amazing school! The diversity is incredible.  I come from a small town so when I started at Alverno, it certainly opened my eyes to how different the world really is.  The course selection is tremendous.  There is something for everyone and everyone's voice is heard.  Even though the school is expensive I couldn't have chosen a better college to invest in."
Freshman,5,"Love attending Alverno College. Not only is this University supportive in its academic programs, but we also support each other as a community of women. Unlike many other larger Universities, Alverno has a close net community that makes you feel at home. Another great part of this College is the fact that you never feel like just a number, because you will have the opportunity to get to know your classmates and professors on a personal level."
Freshman,5,"Unlike your typical University, Alverno is community based. What I mean by that is although we have a huge variety of majors all us students are supportive of one another. Our campus community has an annual Community Day, which we get involved with volunteer services in our local community of Milwaukee. Alverno College really focuses on supporting their students and faculty, as well as helping us prepare for our futures."
Freshman,5,"There are many activities throughout the year. Also, the professors are here to help students and make sure we succeed. The grading is different from other schools: it's either pass or fail at the end of a semester. Some students aren't used to this type of grading, however I believe this will help my education because I'm not worried about a letter grade and the professors give feedback and help to make sure you pass."
Junior,5,My experience at Alverno College has been like no other. I feel welcomed all the time and love the environment and classes it has to offer. Alverno believes not only in success from their students but for them to reach their full potential and change the world. The professors are helpful and really want you to do well in any assignment that is given to you.  I also love how it is not only a college but a community. A community where women at this college support one another instead of competing with each other. I love Alverno College because of the support I receive from my classmates and professors and would not want to change anything for any reason.
Sophomore,5,I'm a sophomore in college and i just love the school everyone is so friendly and helpful. Honesty the best college in Milwaukee. I've become more social while attending this school.
Sophomore,5,"Alverno has changed my life in the most positive way possible. I have never felt so supported in my life until now. I never thought university like this existed, I'm excited to be here, and would recommend this school to anybody. The one thing that I would like to have more of is, more options for classes in the summer."
Sophomore,5,I've loved it so far I'm a sophomore here and I've had the best experience. Everyone is so welcoming and so helpful. Everyone cares about your wellbeing and educations
Freshman,5,"Alverno has a very family like feel. Everyone is so willing to help you when you need it. You don't feel like a small fish in a big pond, because every where go on campus you have someone saying 'hi' and asking how you are."
College Sophomore,5,I haven't had any negative experiences thus far.
College Freshman,5,I love alverno College I am very happy I decided to go back to school and that I picked this one.
College Freshman,5,"I love Alverno college's grading curriculum, it is unique and ability based. Teachers work with you to improve your mistakes and are engaged."
College Junior,5,One of the safest campuses I have seen I ran into a security guard throughout the day and my classes are scattered all over the campus.
College Junior,5,The admissions process was very involved but I had an awesome admissions counselor who worked hard with me and treated me like a friend which helped me to relax during the application process.
College Junior,5,"This was a great choice, I am honored to be a student here!"
College Junior,5,I love the college I have chosen the welcoming atmosphere is what drew me in!! I am continuing my art education and Alverno College is making it happen for me!!
College Sophomore,5,The professors are willing to help.
College Freshman,5,It's just perfect! And beautiful community!
College Sophomore,5,there is very little to no crime on Alverno's campus. It is in a quiet neighborhood and it feels safe.
College Sophomore,5,Alverno's name carries a lot of weight with employers. Those who are hiring realize that graduates from Alverno have received one of the best educations possible.
College Sophomore,5,I love my school! The teachers do anything and everything they can to help you. They are very approachable and empower their students.
College Sophomore,5,I love my college. I love the curriculum and teaching style. It is easy to understand and very effective learning wise.
College Sophomore,5,My school very passionate about the success of each and every student. They strive to see that each student is confident about their major of choice before going out into the job force.
College Sophomore,5,I feel very safe and the fact that it is an all girl school is even better! Alverno security on campus is one of the best around!
College Sophomore,5,"Although Alverno is expensive, you honestly get what you pay for. The school has amazing academics and when you are finished you definitely are ready for your chosen career. I personally work with nurses who have graduated from Alverno and they are amazing nurses! very confident and don't regret going to Alverno."
College Sophomore,5,"Although I live off campus, I know students who live on campus and love it. Best experience ever and the school truly cares about each and every individual."
College Sophomore,5,They have a sport for everyone who loves sports. And those who are not athletic the college makes it easy to support them. Alverno College is amazing and has something for everyone!
College Sophomore,5,"I seriously love Alverno! Best college, hands down. Love love love!"
College Sophomore,5,Alverno is a very diverse school and that is something that I love.
College Freshman,5,it is the best around
College Freshman,5,I am so glad I chose Alverno
College Freshman,5,kinda of hard to have sexual assualts on an all girl campus
College Freshman,5,lottery system sucks but everything else is good
College Freshman,5,It is the best school out there
College Junior,5,"I really like how the 8 core abilities are the main framework for the curriculum. 

The courses are very interesting, and have provided crucial and relevant information for respective fields of study. There are always a variety of courses offered, but seating is limited depending on the popularity of the major the courses fall under. Also, class sizes are great! Class sizes are usually small.

The instructors are very knowledgeable in the courses they teach. All the instructors that I have encountered so far in the communication field are very helpful. However, I did not have that same experience with the nursing program. The program, and instructors are very cold and rigid. It is a nurturing environment, but the nursing department does not seem the same way. It seems that if you fall behind as student then you must fend for yourself and the instructors offer very little as far as advice in how to move forward- I sought out my general advisor because I felt that I did not receive much help with my nursing instructors."
College Junior,5,"The student career and services department is excellent in helping students identify their career interests, and seeking out internship opportunities that will best suite their career goals. The employers recruiting on campus are generally from distinguished and reputable professional organizations.

The alumni network is strong; and my experience in networking with alumni has always been positive. Many of the alum have showed a great amount of willingness in networking and providing guidance for current students."
College Junior,5,"Campus crime does happen, but it is minimal. Nothing has been deemed severe. Campus security is consistently surveying the campus 24 hours a day. There are also emergency posts in every parking lot that are identifiable with a large blue light; and these emergency posts are in well lit areas and allow the student to push a button to alert security if that student is in danger. Also, upon orientation the students are encouraged to call campus security if they felt uncomfortable walking across campus during the evening, in which a person from the security team will escort the student to their vehicle. 

I do not feel in danger on campus, and I feel safe to know that I do not have to walk across campus by myself if I feel unsafe."
College Junior,5,"I enjoy everything about Alverno College. From the moment I enrolled I was designated an advisor, who was extremely helpful and someone who I felt provided a personal attention to me. As I entered my advanced level courses in my field of study, I was designated a new advisor who was just as helpful. The career and student services department has provided me with so much helpful and relevant information as I approach crucial moments in my junior and senior year: interest inventory tests, scouting for internships, finding jobs in my related field of interest, and more. I also particularly love that Alverno instills 8 core values that should be demonstrated and fulfilled before graduation for each student. This element is what, I believe, sets Alverno graduates apart from others, and makes Alverno graduates more marketable in the career world."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is so friendly. All you have to do is ask!
Sophomore,4,I enjoyed Alverno as soon as I stepped on campus. I enjoy the idea of sisterhood and having staff and professors help as needed. I have had trouble financially and would have liked more support. Overall I love the campus and coursework and support I received discarding my financial state.
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love the staff and the environment. Only issue is this year I’ve had so many problems with the financial aid department not following through or miss placing information. Besides that, this is by far of the best colleges I’ve looked into."
Sophomore,4,"the college has an amazing student to teacher ratio that makes learning much easier for students. this college also features an amazing way of grading because it is based on a pass-fail program which is very easy for students to follow. the school also features abilities that are major life skills needed for after college. and finally, this college offers an amazing nursing program with a full-blown simulation lab and a clinical lab which is very helpful to help students to learn"
Junior,4,Alverno Is very expensive but the Education is worth every penny. The Nursing Department is the best in the Midwest. The curriculum is very demanding. Don't expect to have a life.
Alum,4,"Alverno is a great school for those who want a small private experience. The staff are all very friendly and you truly do feel a sense of community at Alverno. However, while I enjoyed most professors, there is an increasing amount of not great professors coming in. I still believe that I got a good education from Alverno. I also took a lot from the additional activities I participated in, my student job and my time in athletics were vital to my success at Alverno and some of my best memories come from those."
Alum,4,"If you are looking for a small campus with an innovative approach to education, value small classroom sizes and low teacher-student ratio,  Alverno College may be a very good fit for you.  While I thrived in this small, intimate setting and lived on campus, for me, the only downside was the lack of social connection on campus with the opposite sex. The nursing and education program are highly rated and regarded in Wisconsin & the Midwest, and the business management program is solid. A great value for the money, perfect commuter school, excellent for the non-traditional student with one of the first weekend-college programs founded.  Also a good pick for an athlete wanting to continue her high school sports career in a Division III setting. Easy accessibility to downtown Milwaukee via public bus transportation. Safe neighborhood, nestled in a quaint, south side residential area."
Sophomore,4,"I am currently in my second year at Alverno, and I love it. I like the teachers and the students. Especially the grading system, because it is more of a pass or fail system and we do not receive grades. Which I believe helps in the long run because in life there are no grades or second chances per say, and by teaching us that early on the better off we will be when we are in the work force."
Sophomore,4,"I like the classes, other students, always things to do on and off campus. I don't like some of the professors"
Senior,4,"I am going into my senior year at Alverno College as a nursing student. A couple reasons why I chose these school was being it was an all girls college and has small class size. I wanted my teacher to know me by name, which they do. As well as focus on my school work, which I felt being around a lot of strong woman would help me do. The campus is gorgeous from the outside lawn to the inside of the school."
Sophomore,4,"I love my school. I love the other students, I love the professors, and I sometimes even like doing the homework! The only thing I'd like to see changed is maybe allowing a more open discussion with higher faculty members and students."
Graduate Student,4,Alverno College has a very inclusive and innovative approach to assessing student learning.  There are no letter grades.  You have to prove that you have mastered the course outcomes by demonstrating that knowledge.
Niche User,4,"Alverno is a beautiful and large campus for women. The people are genuinely really nice, polite, and patient people. I've had multiple encounters with the people and they are all really vibrant."
Junior,4,"I love Alverno! The one thing I really have enjoyed is how involved the staff is in the students lives and academics. The nice thing about going to a smaller college is the fact that you get to know everyone on a personal level. Alverno is not an easy school, but with the support of the staff and peers, succeeding at Alverno is a wonderful feeling."
Junior,4,"Alverno College provides a very structured and diverse academic program. The professors are very helpful and friendly, they offer office hours for students to talk with them for extra review or for any questions that they have. They also challenge the students to do everything academically to the best of their abilities. If a student starts to fall off track, the professor will reach out to that student and offer them extra help outside of class, or if a student reaches out to a professor for extra help, they will receive the help they ask for. Alverno College also provides students with a diverse and friendly community. They offer many clubs/activities to fit each student's interest to hep them feel welcome and a part of the school. Alverno College is a place where its open doors welcome students of all different backgrounds to receive a well rounded education and provides them with a diverse community to create positive experiences."
Sophomore,4,"My experience in Alverno College was first a bit challenging, but when you connect with instructors to help you...it went out like as piece of cake. Instructors, counselors, colleagues, you name it...they support you no matter what."
Freshman,4,They make sure every students needs are met and are very personal. You are not just a number there. There is so much to do on campus and so many great people.
Sophomore,4,My expirence at Alverno College has been nothing but amazing. The professors are there to help you every step of the way and support you to become a successful women!
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman and so far I am enjoying my experiences at Alverno college. I like how the class sizes are small and the grading system is not as overwhelming as the A, B, C system was for me in high school. A change that I would like to see is that there is more authority towards residents in the dorms especially towards the end of the year when girls start to get loud."
Freshman,4,What I like about Alverno is that they don't have a grading system and the students and faculty are very welcoming. What I would like to see change here is more food options especially for vegetarians.
Junior,4,Alverno has the tools and resources to make my college experience successful. The great professors and staff help me gather all that I need to be prepared for classes. The environment is well rounded.
Freshman,4,I love the atmosphere it gives off and everyone is super friendly. I love the one on one I get with teachers and they're always willing to go out of their way to help a student when needed. The friends I have made are making it a great college experience so far. I am learning and thriving in this environment and becoming the strong woman I know I am. I have grown so much so far this first year and I can't wait to see where the next 3 take me!
Junior,4,Alverno college is a college that is outside the box of any other college. Alverno challenges you and enforce working with other women which enhances your work skills in the future.
Sophomore,4,"There will be a lot of self assessing, but helps you reflect on your choices in life. Student events are always incorporated throughout the semester. The environment feels very open, diverse, and comfortable. Some may even bring their kids to classes and this is not something that is frowned upon. Staff is always supportive and it is important to make connections with them."
Junior,4,"I like that Alverno has very small class sizes. The smallest class I've ever been in had 6 people, the largest had 30. In my opinion smaller classes allow students to get to know one and other as well as get more attention from the teacher. I love that Alverno doesn't have standard grades or a GPA. Instead you are graded on skills which is applicable to any job field."
Sophomore,4,"I like all Of my professors. For the most part, my classes are great. However, this school makes you take a lot of prerequisites before you can even think about taking classes that have to do with your major. Most classes are in a 2hour time frame, and the whole school is on a “break” from 12-1 pm. Which is nice because it gives everyone the chance to take a break during the day. The campus overall is really nice and clean, and everyone is really friendly. They make you feel welcome, but a lot of the advisors can be really pushy about what classes you choose to take and when."
Sophomore,4,"Alverno is a wonderful college, the teachers are pretty good they are always there to help in anyway they can. I love how their grading system, and all the effort Alverno makes to make every student better. The college life is average, Alverno has mostly a calm and serious atmosphere so if you are looking for the big parties Alverno is not the place. Otherwise Alverno is a very good school overall, but something that I wish they would change would be how high their tuition is and make it more affordable for many more women to gain their education at Alverno."
Alum,4,"Going to Alverno College has been an amazing journey. I came into this college as a shy person. However, as I progress my courses through the years, I met wonderful instructors and peers that provided me feedback as well as guidance towards improving myself and my skills within my major. The only thing that I believe the college should improve on is the communication about grade equivalency. Alverno College does not evaluate students according to a letter grade system. The college evaluate students based on performances in each course to which the student meet or exceeds standards and criteria. Grade equivalency is converted based on the instructors feedback and can be provided if you want to pursue further in your education. The communication for grade equivalency is really difficult if you are a Science major who is planning to go to Graduate School afterwards. Fortunately, it is possible to do so. However, the process sometimes is long and tedious."
Freshman,4,"Alverno has been great so far! Although it took sometime getting used to not being around boys, I feel like I've made great friends and I'm doing better academically (comparing myself to how I was in high school). Although, I don't have the chance to go to many of the events they put up during campus, many events sound super fun."
Freshman,4,I love alverno's nursing program. I think is one of the best out there. They put you in similar situations that would most likely happen in a hospital so when it comes to real life interactions you will be ready for them.
Freshman,4,I am still new to Alverno and am just starting my 2nd semester but I love it.  The teachers really seem to care and they have a number of resources available to help students succeed.
Sophomore,4,"My experience with Alverno College is simply amazing and exciting. There are lots of opportunities and organizations to join within the alverno community. The teachers are very understanding, they help you with everything and work with you to catch up on assignments.  I like alverno college because it's bigger, has smaller classes, reasonable staff members, and they helping me feel better about myself."
College Sophomore,4,I do not have an issue with safety on campus.
College Sophomore,4,Many professors are very approachable and have the student's best interests in mind.
College Sophomore,4,Alverno really pushes you in your field to make sure that you have a better chance than people from other schools to get a job or internship.
College Sophomore,4,There haven't been many safety issues on campus accept for a few cars getting broken into so overall the campus is very safe to me.
College Sophomore,4,I think the athletics are great. There are many sports teams to chose from and from what I've heard they do very well.
College Sophomore,4,"Alverno is a fantastic college and if i had a choice to chose a college over again, i would pick Alverno every time."
College Freshman,4,"I don't participate in athletics, but the teams at Alverno are dedicated and practice often."
College Junior,4,I dont participate in any school sports but the athletic program at Alverno College is top notch.
College Freshman,4,I really can't give an opinion but I sure will once I get to start college and join a sport myself.
College Freshman,4,It is a college full of independent women who are working hard towards their career.
College Sophomore,4,The sports at my school are fantastic! The ladies here love their school and make a good name for it.
College Sophomore,4,I feel extremly safe on campus!
College Sophomore,4,My college has a great athlectic department.
College Sophomore,4,"I am aware of  fraternities at the college, but I'm not really into them personally. I do know there are plenty of opportunities to sign up and get involved."
College Senior,4,"Alverno focuses on the abilities graduates will need in the real world and has created a curriculum surrounding those abilities (problem solving, analysis, global perspective, social interaction, valuing, communication, aesthetic engagement, and effective citizenship). You can tell an Alverno woman from well-rounded skill set and her ability to constantly self-assess efficiently and thoroughly. Because of the ability-based curriculum, there are no grades. It may seem crazy, but it is highly beneficial. There is no focus on aiming for the highest grade, but instead there is focus on reaching your highest potential. Not only is the curriculum unique, but Alverno's atmosphere draws its students in. The moment I stepped on campus for a tour, I felt wanted and like I was already part of the family. At Alverno, you are not a number."
College Sophomore,4,"Everything about this school is mostly great, except tuition, I think that the school should just have a set tuition and not always raise it every year. That is really the only thing that frustrates me as a student here."
College Sophomore,4,The campus is very safe. There is a number in which you can call if you need anything in regards to safety.
College Student,4,"There are always games going on for something, softball.. Basketball.. It's pretty cool!"
College Student,4,"The overall experience, so far has been great. The professors and advisors are very open and helpful, not to mention, friendly! I love it."
College Sophomore,4,Wisconsin has students from all over the world. Campus life is supportive of students growing academically and socially to become members of a global society.
College Sophomore,4,Wisconsin has a strong support for Badger athletics.
College Sophomore,4,From what I have witnessed and talking with people who have graduated from the college say that getting a great job that they love and finding many opportunities that give those students chances to go farther in their career and beyond to where it has given some students to go for their master's degree and or working on their doctorate degree. Finding an internships from this campus is good it depends though if the student is looking for a specific type of job to be patient since it does take time to find the job that is right for each individual student. The process itself isn't that hard just the time when accepted to the job in question.
College Sophomore,4,For the two out of four years that I have been on campus it has be for the most part a good experience. The teachers that I have picked where really good in teaching the class and helpful when a student didn't know how to do an assignment or project. Teachers work with the students and talk about other resources around campus for additional help if needed and reasonable times to meet the instructor outside of the classroom. The courses that I have taken were on a range from average being the lowest to highly interacting with the class that I look forward every time I go to the class. It depends on a student's major but for my major/minor it has been a great experience and would come back to this school again if given the chance.
College Sophomore,4,"The college that I go to is very helpful in resources and with questions that a student has about anything from financial aid to internships/career opportunities. Most classes are enjoyable and fun with learning new information will and could be applied outside of college for my possible career choice. If I had to do it over i would, because the atmosphere and people at my college are helpful, stress-less most of time and teachers are there for the students."
College Freshman,4,"For example a lot at my school mainly play basketball. There is not too much people that attends the games because they probably are to busy studying. Overall when I stayed after to study, the team had good performance and they all worked together."
College Senior,4,They have an office to help you find internship and jobs that are related to your field of study.
College Senior,4,Very cleanly and pleasant indoor and outdoor environment.
College Senior,4,They tell you what's going on with their community. They are very nice and pleasant people who are willing to teach you everything they know about the community and their culture.
College Senior,4,"I really love Alverno. Sometimes I do wish there were more elective classes but because the school is so small it's difficult to get students to sign up and have a full class so it's understandable... But, the classes are small so you really feel like you are a part of your own experience-not like Professor is talking at you. We even call our professors by their first names. It's a very personable school where almost all of the professors are really passionate about what they teach and they really know their stuff."
Junior,2,"My first year attending Alverno College was a great experience. I did not encounter any problems with my professors or any other faculty. I found everyone I interacted with to be very helpful and encouraging. However, my second year attending Alverno College was the exact opposite, this is also the reason why I am transferring schools. What I experienced my second year at Alverno College was awful and I would not recommend this school to anyone because of this. The professors I had were completely rude and discouraging. This simply through you in with the wolves and did not offer much help. Also, if you asked for help, they would make you feel completely stupid in front of the whole class. I even had one of my professors tell my adviser I was not smart enough to pursue the major that I was and that I should change it. Definitely a very discouraging school that really does not care about your future at all."
College Freshman,2,"If you want to spend A LOT for a tiny little apartment that is not worth the price at all, then the Alverno apartments are great for you."
College Freshman,2,"The food is incredibly expensive and there are far too many options. If you have dietary needs or like to eat healthy, be ready to spend $15 plus on food."
College Student,2,"The sports are good if you are a sport person. However, the fitness center is AWFUL. SOOO OUTDATED. SO SMALL."
College Sophomore,2,"There is really anything. It is about a 30 min walk, most students do not have cars. Or you can have delivery but not many places do that."
College Junior,2,There is nothing to do here unless you drive into Milwaukee.
College Junior,2,There is not much to do on campus and the officers are friendly but rules can be strict.
College Student,2,"The walk to the school from parking is king of far. We have a lot of snow most of the winter, so you need to wear boots all the time."
College Student,2,It does not seem that many students take part in athletics offered at the school.
College Student,2,The work load is very heavy. It is hard to be in school full time and also work. There are so many classes you have to take that are not relevant to your major.
College Student,2,"It is an all girls school, so there is not meeting guys at the school. Most girls already have boyfriends and they can come visit. Most girls wear sweat pants and comfy close to class. Some girls do dress up though. I feel like a lot of people at the school are going for nursing, but I have been learning about other majors girls are taking."
College Student,2,"They are currently re- doing the dining area, but before it was very plain and crowded."
College Student,2,I think you need a car for the campus. Otherwise you go to the store you would have to walk to the bus stop and use public transportation.
College Freshman,2,I haven't even started my program yet because of all the prerequisites that this school wants you to take. It's a little annoying.
College Sophomore,2,"There is no greek life but there is group you can sign up for, but they aren't advertised good."
College Freshman,2,The school isn't very unique the only unique things about it is the fact that it is an all girls school and the grading system is different then most schools
College Freshman,2,Its so bad that i'm  not even in my program yet i'm not even on the list because i had to go back to some general education credits that they did not inform me that i had to do .
College Freshman,2,"A lot of students come high to class and smell like drugs and alcohol. Many students also throw up of feel sick because of drugs and alcohol. Also if you don't do it many people may look at you weird, but they wont press you on the issue anymore which is nice because i hate being peer pressured ."
College Sophomore,2,school may shut down in winter at late notice
College Sophomore,2,"no shuttle, small school, personal transportation"
College Sophomore,2,"its not really a great atmosphere. its a long walk to get to any type of store but a short drive. not everyone has cars and no bus takes us out there where we need to go to like walmart, movie stores, etc. its far from downtown but the good thing about that is we could take one bus out there."
College Sophomore,2,The housing at Alverno college isn't great but its livable. A lot of things are broken and/or don't get fixed properly. I would suggest better repair company or something so that we are living comfortably at the dorms. The good about the dorms is that everyone interacts with each other and if we need anythings CA's are around (2 on every floor and on duty) to help us in anyway.
College Junior,2,"Alverno doesn't have a big selection of scholarships for students. It would be nice if they could provide students with more from the school, but the workers in the financial aid office will help you find scholarships on other admirable websites."
College Junior,2,"The dorms at Alverno College are very boring, you have to really decorate it to have any personality in the room. Although they are very close to the school and the girls are quiet very friendly."
College Sophomore,2,I love the variety and choice's for healthy eating but the prices for those meals are outrageous in my opinion. I would eat off campus because I could receive the same meals with more additions for the same price. It was always disappointing because Alverno carries such a comfortable environment that I wouldn't want to leave and would much rather spend my money on campus but the prices are too high for students.
College Junior,2,"Nothing Really Happens – Alverno is located in a very quiet community, night life is quiet."
College Junior,2,Alverno is located in Milwaukee and it doesn't have the best weather when it comes to winter time.
College Sophomore,2,Since Alverno is a Women;s College there are only Sororities on campus. There are about 8 of them. There are newly created sororities as well as sororities that have been around for 100 years active on campus.
College Freshman,2,"Im not into the Greek life here. We don't have much of a variety with the greek life. If we had sorirty's that I was interested in here, I would pledge"
College Student,2,"I'm starting this fall semester, so there is not much I can say.  I have heard that security is always around and partying is not something the girls at the campus are known for doing.  I guess I will have to find out as soon as I start!"
Recent Alumnus,2,Not Sure – I'm really not sure because I don't stay on campus so I don't know what the campus life is like here.
College Sophomore,2,Alverno needs to update computers there is not enough to for all students a lot of nursing student are using them and others are not able to get one. They built a nursing campus so they should have them in the building along with computers for the nursing students.
College Sophomore,2,There are very few parties on campus. For a fun nightlife you have to go to bars and find your own parties.
College Senior,2,"Were division 2 or 3. Ive never gone to any sporting event, nor will I ever."
Niche User,2,It sucks! It's too cold. It sucks! It's too cold. Although we are pretty lucky that we don't get tornados or hurricanes! I almost went to college in Florida so I would prefer to be warmer..
Niche User,2,"The weather here is unpredictable and it's never too hot or too cold for very long! Although, I don't like living in Milwaukee because I can't snow mobile and do all the outdoors stuff I normally do in the winter."
Niche User,2,"Milwaukee buses are slow and not reliable – I don't use it. I have a car and pretty much drive myself where I need to go. Milwaukee buses are not reliable. Not to mention, it takes forever to get anywhere."
Niche User,2,The rules can be frustrating – Living on campus is pretty strict because students can't leave their guests in their rooms. Which is kind of ridiculous. I think that the rules are frustrating because they don't allow for a lot of leeway.
Niche User,2,Sororities mean lots of drama – There is kind of this rivalry between some of the sororities. Lots of drama. People who are looking for the real experience should not look at Alverno for sororities.
Niche User,2,"Sports are not very big on campus – Sports are not very big on campus because there are so many non-traditional, commuter students. Alverno students are more focused on their academics and that's what the school is known for."
College Freshman,1,nothing around. quiet neighborhood we are located in
College Freshman,1,no greek life on campus
College Student,1,"I don't believe our campus has greek life. Our school acts as a whole and everyone gets along with each other. No one is different and our school isn't very split up or divided, which is what I like about Alverno. No one is better than anyone we are all the same and equal."
College Freshman,1,"Yes, Alverno is located in Milwaukee but we are in the part that there is nothing cool or good to unless you want to eat and Panda Express and BW3s."
College Freshman,1,The party scene is non-existent. I don't know why this is a deciding factor seeing as how much you are paying for your education.
College Student,1,"It's great if you're einstein, rich, or completely broke, ward of the state, but otherwise you're not going to get much help if any. You'll be about $120,000 in debt by your 4th year. enjoy."
College Sophomore,1,"My school is by no means a party school in the normal terms. A party at my school is board games, music, junk food, and movies where we all gather in a common space and just have fun. We dont have any drinking parties that I know of, its a pretty mellow quiet school where fun is defined by number of activities there are not by the number of drinks per person."
College Freshman,1,They don't provide off campus housing.
College Freshman,1,There is no greek life.
College Junior,1,I don't live on campus so I don't know nor do I hear about it.
College Junior,1,It is an all girls school so guys are nonexistent.
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek housing of Greek life on campus.
College Junior,1,I believe that there is only one sorority on campus and it is for honors students.
College Junior,1,It's a woman's college so there are many if you like that...as far as guys...none except the one's that work there. 
College Freshman,1,It is horrible! parking is horrible since it is in a busy city and when its cold or rainy or really hot you have to walk about six blocks just to get to one side of the campus . The campus is not close to anything and the weather sucks most of the time in Wisconsin.
College Freshman,1,No one really cares about the sports at my school. I personally haven't been to or even heard about a sporting even . 
College Freshman,1,It is horrible and it is in crime infested areas. I would never want to live there and often the house and apartments re rundown and have rodent problems.
College Freshman,1,We have some greek orgnazations but they meet off-campus and don't work with our campus directly.
College Junior,1,"Almost N/A – My school doesn't provide it's own shuttle, nor are their buses that have stops nearby. I personally drive and it's a 35 minute drive both ways. Room/Board too expensive."
College Junior,1,The weather on campus changes with the season. In the winter the snow is very bad and very very cold. I commute to classes so I have wake up in the early cold mornings with my daughter. There are times I have to clean the snow off my car and be on the free during heavy snow falls. The campus is often clean and available for the students and staffs. During there winter seasons their is not much out doors activites like the spring and the summer seasons.

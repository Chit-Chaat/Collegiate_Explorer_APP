Freshman,5,"I'm just beginning school but so far it's been really easy. They use Canvas like most online/campus schools. They teach you the navigation of the site and checkup on you to see how your work is going. They even provide easy ways to get daily points towards your work for being counted ""present"" in your online class."
Freshman,5,"So far everyone is super helpful. And really nice. They are all hete to help is all achive our goals. And make our future better. I havent started classes yet but im super exited.

Freshman,5,"The online courses are not what I expected. I didn’t realize how connected one could be while so far away, the instructors and student advisors have made such a comfortable and confident environment for me. I moved away from my family to be where I am, but independence university have really made my new living situation feel a lot more like home!"
Freshman,5,"Other than the great people and support independence university offers, their easy class structure and flexibility make choosing this school hard not to do! The large range of people and their different backgrounds makes me believe that really anyone can make whatever situation they are in much better through this school. Personally I never expected to be where I am now, and I can’t wait to see where it takes me!"
Freshman,5,"They were very nice, reliable, consistent, & driven to help me get enrolled. They were very encouraging & answered any questions I had & made me feel like they actually cared about my future!"
Freshman,5,I'm a new student so I'm honestly not sure yet because I haven't experienced it. I wish I could go into more detail but I can't. Based on what I have experienced I have no worries & know that they will be a great educational vessel for me & my brain this semester.
Freshman,5,My experience this fair has been amazing they really want to see you succeed!Everyone is friendly and very helpful. You also get supplied with the materials and the electronics you need to succeed with only worrying about getting internet my process was smooth and very pleasant.
Freshman,5,Taking classes is very flexible and and rewarding as do with taking campus courses. You really have to be up to the challenge to make yourself do the work to succeed. A strong support system and the attitude to get it done is what make the experience great. I love online schooling I can get it done on my own time in my own space.
Graduate Student,5,I like that all the instructors are available when you need them they also have a chat line for help too. I really like the whole barrowing a laptop until you graduate then it's yours to keep
Graduate Student,5,They made sure that navigating the web sit and the app you will use to do your schooling easy to understand. They are also very prompt on getting back to ur emails ASAP.
Freshman,5,Easy 4 week classes. You recieve a tablet and laptop that are yours to keep after you graduate. The staff is so far very nice and helpful.
Freshman,5,I am currently enrolled in 100% online learning. It is really the only way that I can go back to school right now.
Freshman,5,I was very hesitant to go back to school at the age of 33. But the advisor really helped me and made me feel comfortable with the decision financially and with scheduling. I'm a single mother in time with my children is very important so I really appreciate all the help. Also they provide a tablet for the first 4 weeks which is the duration of one class and once you complete it they send you a laptop you get to keep both upon graduation and they're helping me in the financial department very much so.
Freshman,5,"the people,there is a great staff, they explained and answered all of my questions and helped me through the process. i haven't seen the campus because i am doing the online classes. but the pictures online look really awesome!"
Freshman,5,"the learning curve here is awesome, they have a great support team to help you through your courses."

I look forward to the classes because i know there's a big support team when it comes the the staff. I wouldn't change anything because everything has been going great do far.
Freshman,5,So far my online experience with IU has been amazing. If I have any questions or concerns there always answered in a timely manner. The student portal is very easy to navigate around. There is always someone there to help.
Freshman,5,This is my freshman year. I don’t have anything I would change as if right now. I get the help when I need it. They are always making sure everything is going smooth. That’s what I like. Overall so far I have no complaints.
Freshman,5,"The professors and instructors are very interested in helping their students succeed in highering their education, and I am very appreciative of their teachings and astonished of the way they do their work. I wouldn't have chosen a better school to attend because of the effort and time they put into these courses to help each student obtain a degree of some kind. I had had a wonderful time learning the educational information from Independence University, for I wouldn't have chosen a better school to attend online. They help you understand any academic education questions that you might have, yet they can be very helpful making sure you have complete documents that need to be signed or turned in with warnings or reminders. I'm very glad that Independence University college is where I'm highering my education, as well as earning my Masters and bachelor's degree, furthermore I am inspired by my children to succeed, so that I am able to leave them something that we love to do."

The classes are great, very easy to understand and if you don't there is always someone there to help you. The instructors teach you the most essential things needed for the class and to help you in your future career. The advisors are always trying to find ways to help you and make your time at Independence University the best you can have at an online college. Everything is well organized and they even give you a laptop to do your work. which was a big thing for me because I did not have any other device besides my smartphone. When my table went down I sent it back in and they fixed it so I could do my work on the go. I would have never had the opportunity or even gotten that far in the classes. Everyone that I have come encounter with has made my journey well worth it and easy to do. Thank each one of you."
Sophomore,5,My learning experience with Independence University was better than expected. I was given access to thriving in almost any condition. From giving me a tablet to take on the go to giving me a laptop to do my work at home. I get updates for everything I need to remember in the classes. It is a very good learning system and everyone at Independence University is there to help you.
Freshman,5,So far I've learned a lot very enjoyable school. They also have very helpful teacher's that make sure you understand what you are learning.
Freshman,5,It is a great school initially I was a little confused about how to navigate through the canvas site but once you get used to it. It gets easier they pack a lot of info into a short class. I really enjoy the school
Freshman,5,Enjoying the courses. The online courses are very convenient for me as I do not have to travel back and forth. I find the courses easy to understand and the lectures are good. Doing this online course has really been helpful during this COVID-19 pandemic.
Freshman,5,This school have good lecturers who are dedicated to the student's progress and welfare. They are committed to the teaching profession and are available at all times to listen and answer to student's questions. They readily offer counseling when appropriate and when needed by the student.
Sophomore,5,I enrolled into Independence University a year ago. I love the fact that I got a  tablet and laptop to use. Everyone is very helpful and always checking in with you to make sure you are doing ok and keeping up with your classes. The instructors are always prepared and ready to help with any problems you may have.
Sophomore,5,This is the first time I've done online schooling. Independence University has made it very easy to get started and walk me through setting up my laptop with the programs I need to complete each class.

Freshman,5,It is good . I really enjoyed the online classes.i have learn so much and I plan to learn so much more
Freshman,5,I am starting my 5th class next week and it is amazing how much I have learned. I get to enjoy prioritizing my time with the flexible schedule that IU allows. I only wish that I started sooner.
Freshman,5,IU has a solid supporting foundation. This support is part of the reason why I have made it this far with all high A's in my courses. I haven't recieved this kind of support virtually in any kind of online education before attending IU.
Freshman,5,"Great school, your able to do your work on your schedule. Great support from staff. The classes are easy to understand, logical and put together very well."
Freshman,5,My online experience has been great. My teachers have been very informational and supportive. The classes are very well put together.
Freshman,5,"The very best part about Independence University is their success team. Every time I needed anything, I could reach out to my instructor or Student Services Advisor and they would connect me with someone that could answer all my questions and give me all the help I needed."
Freshman,5,"I did all my learning online. I have loved every instructor and Advisor. They treat me like I am their friend. They have every resource you need to succeed. I thought it was too expensive at first but after taking a few classes and experiencing the success team they placed around me, I decided it was worth every penny."
Freshman,5,"They did everything needed to make sure I could start on Monday.  They stayed in constant contact. Every department was right on the ball to help get things done. They were very easy to work with and very supportive.  I would be more than happy to recommend them to anyone and everyone.  They are also a very affordable school.  I am looking forward to starting on my degree even though I'm 41 years old.  I also love that they have a tutoring center that even my grade school son can use.  They also have a center that can review my written papers if I need them to.  This is so they can help me make them better.  Everyone has been not only professional but also very nice.  This will be a school I'll look forward to graduating from in three years, and will always remember.  They help you every step of the way cause they want to see you succeed, not many schools do that.  And I love that I get to do it all from home where I'm free to take care of my family.  This is the school I have chosen"
Freshman,5,"I just signed up to start a couple weeks ago.  They were wonderful about staying in contact, make sure things were done, and getting me my tablet sent in time for class start Monday."
Freshman,5,On time and very well trained . They were very patient with me and gave me not only a introduction but an experience.
Freshman,5,"I'm about to become a student at Independence University and I'm enjoying it so far/ I hear about the school on a youtube aid and I did some research on the school to see what is it about. My main goal for my career was to be a actor because with independence university this a back up to focus on my new career and that's  graphic design. I always knew I was good with computers and understanding how it works, with me going to Independence University this gives me a chance to understand more graphic design and how it is used everyday."
Junior,5,"I received my associate degree from this school about 6 months ago and now I am studying for my bachelor's degree. The instructors, advisors and other staffs are very helpful.Their goal is to help the students achieve, but the student have to ask for help. I like the writing center, which have been very helpful to me when I have to write a paper. Yes, it takes 2 days to get your paper back from the writing center, but it is worth it. And if you still do not understand the student is able to schedule a one on one with a lab instructor. Yes, the courses seem easy, but really they are not. But I like that because I want to get everything I am going to need for when I hit the workfield."
Graduate Student,5,I love the way each and every course is set up. I didn't think it would be this easy! I'm going back for my masters'! I recommend this school to ANYONE!!
Freshman,5,"Independence University is a great school for college students that want to get a great education, help with all assessments, assignments, and discussion posts. They help you with everything. They will send you a tablet to start your courses and you will receive a Mac book laptop later in your courses so you will not have a problem with anything. I love this school so far and I just started about a month ago. It's wonderful."
Sophomore,4,Tutoring is available for students and their children also. All questions answered quickly. Support available for technical issues as well as advisors for extra help.
Sophomore,4,All of my courses are online. Time management and dedication are the most important qualities. Easily retainable knowledge.
Freshman,4,I have not started my classes yet.  I start Sept. 14th. All of my classes will be online and honestly I am overly happy about it. I cant wait. Everything that I have done so far to get enrolled and with talking with everyone has been online I have even been the guinea pig for a zoom video. The zoom video actually worked like we were hoping and went really well.
Freshman,4,This is my freshman year so I cant say a lot just yet. What I can say though is that everyone that I have talked to so that I could get enrolled and get all my financial aid figured out has been wonderful. They have been very polite and quick about getting back to me with and questions or concerns that I may have or have had.
Freshman,4,Staff are very welcoming and explain everything in depth. They pay for your trip to Utah for some training and i can not wait to visit the campus and meet the students there.
Alum,4,The professors of the MBA program are knowledgeable and provide the knowledge necessary to succeed in your career.
Freshman,4,They provided me with all the tools that I needed for success and also a laptop and a tablet Super awesomeness i love it
Freshman,4,I’m having a great time does stuff for a very educated and I’ll give you a lot of one on one timeSuper awesome
Freshman,4,I'm really just starting out and don't know much about the school but I do know that my SSA is awesome lol
Freshman,4,I'm really just starting out and don't know much about the school but I do know that my SSA is awesome lol
Freshman,4,I hadn't took any classes yet because they don't start until July. I have did my orientation and a few courses online already and I hadn't had a problem yet.
Sophomore,4,Yes took class online. Great school and learning experience. Tutors are available to help students whom need help. School is accredited and worth the tuition expense. Great college to graduate with a degree and start a new career.
Freshman,4,I am proud to go to IU because they have helped me start my life goal. I would recommend this school to anyone who is looking to do school online.
Freshman,4,"I enjoy the way classes are seperated, and all are meant to work well together. The tuition includes a laptop and a tablet the send you, and help you set up for free. The college also provides free tutoring for anyone that needs it. The college also provides the adobe programs for students to use, and when we graduate from independence university we are allowed to keep the tablet, and the laptop."
Freshman,4,"so far i have really enjoyed the school, the teachers, and the classes. They have been very informative and helpful."
Freshman,4,"I haven't started classes at Independence University yet, I start March 30, 2020. I can however say that throughout the whole enrollment process everyone that I have spoken to has been extremely helpful and has gone out of their way to make sure I had everything I needed and so that the process went smoothly for me as well as them."
Senior,4,The live lectures that the school has makes us online students apart of the college because we get to talk to the professor and other classmates this is for the online students.
Niche User,4,Great experience for those looking for an online degree. It is very flexible to do this as you can make arrangements on when to complete assignments. Easy and fast paced. Great professors and helpful staff. Online staff runs through the canvas network and is surprisingly simple.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman with IU, so far getting to know everything, and everyone is so easy, because they stay on top of everything!! You get text messages from the counselors, your SSA. Theirs so many resources"
Freshman,4,The Instructors are very involved with your schooling and keeping in touch with you to make sure you are doing well and are very responsive if you have any questions or need anything at all.
Freshman,4,it has been a good experience the teachers are helpful and their classes are small so you can get instruction as needed if you need help with anything there are there to help you. they also get you set up with everything you need to get started in school they send you a tablet to start and you get to keep it as a graduation present when you graduate
Freshman,4,Taking classes online is so convenient and my instructors all have 10+ years experience in the field they teach so I feel like they know what they're doing. Plus I can go to live lectures from any of them so I can get the teaching style that works for me and I have access to tutors as well!
Freshman,4,"I love their commitment to student success and the introduction to all facets. They are willing to go the distance for successful transition, as well as in making sure that the needs and what's best for the student is accomplished."
Sophomore,4,"I am in my 2nd year of the graphic design bachelors program at IU, I have enjoyed all my classes, the fast pace, the helpful staff & instructors. I really like the way everything is set up, how the courses work, how each module flows week to week. If i could change anything it woould be having a break or 2 more per school year. Having 4 week mods 1 after another and only getting 2 weeks off the entire year can be overwhelming. Also it would be nice tosee them implement some type of medical leave that wouldn't affect your enrollment or grades. As it is right now, without withdrawing for the time you need and re-enrolling hen you are ready to return, there is no way to get time off for any reason. Your best option is an understanding instructor who lets you turn in your course work from the time you need off late with no penalties."
Sophomore,4,"Independence University is a great college for anyone! I like that they allow me to take all my classes online because it is flexible with my work schedule. They work one on one with you to help find you the best financial advisers and administration advisers. They sign you up for courses relevant to your field of study and the professors will check up on you to make sure you are doing alright and that you are understanding the material. There have been a couple of hiccups along the way which is why I have rated it a four and not a five. I think communication could improve between faculty and students. They call and send emails, but if your like me, then you don't check your email everyday and do not answer random phone numbers. However, I check my texts every five minutes and whether I know the phone number or not I read the message to see who it might be. Thank you for your time."
Sophomore,4,"It's decent. High tuition, but classes are enjoyable and the professors all seem to have genuine interest in your education."
Freshman,4,The freedom you have in becoming your own you! You have the opportunity to grow in and from this university if you just let it take you where you are bound to go!
Freshman,4,They Work Will You and Are Available to help you  24/7. The give you all the tools to get your work done. including a tablet and laptop that way you can use Microsoft word to type papers. you can use your tablet on the go to study at work or the park.
Junior,4,"I love the instructors that I've had, as well as my advisors (SSA, FPA, Financial Aid, etc). The only real issue I have had is dealing with the IT Department, but that was worked out and I'm happy with my experience at IU."
Freshman,4,I am a new student at Independence University and I have found that I have really liked the program so far. The schedule and course load has been very satisfactory in my opinion. I like how the have everything set up. The staff and faculty have been very great. And it is nice how you have so many advisers to help you and guide you through education. The flexibility of taking courses online is super helpful because I can fit in my classes on my time before and after work. The resources Independence University has are amazing the have a great library and even a writing lab that gives you feedback on your written assignments.
Junior,4,"I'm an online college student. This is ny 1st time trying online classes. In the very beginning, the school has prep classes to get you comfortable and familiar with taking online classes & their school portal where you log in daily and do class assignments. All professors have previous work experience in the field of the class they're teaching."
Graduate Student,4,"Daily Quizzes and a program that reads to you while you're doing something else. Making it easier to multitask, while learning and studying. An active career coach that assist with moving forward with job searches and resume reviews.
Activities that are engaging outside your personal academia."
Freshman,4,My experience with Independence University has been great. They help you with everything along the way. You even have personal advisors so that you’re able to connect with them easier. The instructors are amazing and make everything so very clear for you. I haven’t been disappointed at IU yet.
Sophomore,4,Well I haven't started yet but my experience so far has been amazing. Everyone that I have been in contact with has been super helpful. Any question I have had; has been answered fast and has helped me any way possible. Such as helping me find scholarships and  even sending Fed Ex to my house.
Freshman,4,"Very convient excellent support team for academics, work and career developement. Each student has a success team they walk you through everything. Curriculm is self paced. Professors are very easy to contact and the student body help you a lot
Resources are excellent and they tutor a lot to help you whe. you need it. Application process is pretty easy and they walk you through it step by step"
Freshman,4,I am an online student that believes the tuition is too high and it is hard to get anyone to help you with attaining the resources to help you find scholarships. I feel that since they have been under an audit they should at least offer a reduction in titution.
Freshman,4,"They worked really hard to get me enrolled, all my paperwork, everything up and rolling. I have been enrolled since June and I love it. The only thing I'm not really a fan of is that we started taking just 1 class at a time and now its two classes at a time. Im having a hard time keeping up and not falling behind. i wish they had a way you can take just 1 class at a time."
Freshman,4,"The staff has been very helpful through the whole enrolling process. Hoping for a successful two years! Haven't started classes yet so, little to go on!"
Freshman,4,"New student, but the process to begin has been outstanding, online learning layout is unique and more focused on keeping students focused. Staff has been amazing. Excellent choices in courses."
Senior,4,"I was afraid to take the math classes, but the school held classes to help you learn the math before you took the class.  I am happy to say I passed wit a B."
Freshman,4,I am a freshmen at Independence University online courses. So far my investment has been absolutely wonderful. They have great help when you need it.
Freshman,4,I did not receive my tablet or laptop in time and had to use my personal tablet for schoolwork but other than that I've had a great experience .
Freshman,4,Just started so don't have a lot of experience with them yet but they worked with me really well to get me started and be on my way getting my degree they have always been helpful in every way I'm thankful for how good they have treated me makes it a lot easier to deal with any stress about starting school
Freshman,4,"excellent online resources ,staff is very willing to help with everything you need to know or if you have any learning curves,the resources are above  and beyond."
Freshman,4,"Awesome,so many research criteria to help with school.Online courses have so much information.Microsoft is tough to learn,but step by step ,they take you through step by step.Attendance is extremely important."
Freshman,4,"The teachers ( not all ) lack in communication, and the school leaves out information UNLESS you specifically ask them. The work has nothing to do with the actual class. However on the good note the classes are semi easy and its easy to navigate and works great around all types of schedules. Like anything else there is good and bad to everything."
Freshman,4,School is great. One problem the information I received about receiving free laptop and computer never happened. Emailed advisers they never returned emails or phone calls.
Sophomore,4,"The faculty and staff are very friendly and knowledgeable of all things related to this establishment. The enrollment process was easy and the classes are just what I expected, not to mention, I always have help available."
Freshman,4,All the instructors and employees make you feel warm and welcomed about getting your education here. It feels as if they actually care
Freshman,4,I have recently started my enrollment process and so far everyone has been really helpful. The student advisor and financial aid guide will be very clear in explaining everything you need before classes start. The program that the offer works a 100% for me because it offers the flexibility that I need while still giving me the chance to earn my degree in as few as 22 months.
Freshman,4,I like independence university because it works around my scheldule but still allows me to work toward my degree. all the people that I have talked to there has helped me get where I wanted and answered all of my questions. they are all super kind and help walk you through everything every step of the way.
Sophomore,4,"This is a really good school for people that work and go to school, because there is not a lot of work. The teachers help you and you can get help at the help center."
Junior,4,"For an online University, I enjoy the school. The teachers are understanding. The classes have their challenges which I like. They have a great library, writing center, and tutors. The teachers give their phone number and email if you need extra help with something."
Sophomore,4,I like how the professors and the administrators want to help as much as possible to make sure that you succeed in what you are doing. They are also there if there is a problem that just docent seem to want to go away. I really don't see the need for change in any of the programs or structure because to me they are the best hen it come to open about everything that is happening as far as grading or even how classes are ran during the mods.
Freshman,4,I like this online schooling opportunity through Independence University. The staff has been informative and involved with my education. This is also a great place for academic opportunity to grow and learn!
Freshman,4,I love the enrollment part of this school. From admission to financial aid and First day of class they are with you. the give you the tools and information needed to an successful  student
Sophomore,4,"I will be graduating in April. So far, I have learned a lot of information regarding my major, along with a lot of new information . The staff in this university has always been extremely kind and helpful, regardless of the matter at hand. The classes are well built and the programs are accredited. I am looking into the possibility of also receiving my master's degree from here as well- that is how much I enjoy the college. Because I am so far away, everything I do is online and I have never visited the campus. This transition has been flawless and easy to manage."
Sophomore,4,I like the fact that the school takes all the efforts necessary to find a clinical location for the student. I wish they could change the admission process for returning students so we do not have to go through too much just to get back in the program.
Freshman,4,They are a great face paced education but for what you get it is not financially smart to go to this school.
Freshman,4,"The processes of starting is little difficult but there was a lot variables in with my process of starting school. i spoke with a man named Chad. He was a great guy, very interested in what i was wanting to do, and all the goals i had in my future. He made me feel like i was making the right call in my choice of school and goals in life. Classes are laid out very well. Easy to understand. If you do not understand you have access to professor Via Email, Text and call. So far, i enjoy where i am going to college at."
Alum,2,"While their professors care about your future and give you the knowledge necessary to succeed, that is where it ends. Due to their lack of research and judgement, I received a bent and crumpled piece of paper that  vaguely resembles a Masters Degree diploma. Poor intercity high schools with zero dollars for books would not hand out diplomas in this fashion, let alone a multi million dollar a year profiting university. They should be ashamed of themselves. All they offer is to resend it again in the hopes it arrives in tact. Do not waste your time or money here. They don't care about you once they get their money. There are many better ranked and affordable universities you can go to."
Freshman,2,i am having trouble with the financial aid department they wont return any messages or calls. that is the only thing so far that is stopping me from giving it all good amrks its harrd when they dont respond
Freshman,2,it would be better if the financial aid department would respond to you at all. cant get a response from them at all im about to withdraw from this place all together if not for that all seems real good so far that being the only problem with them everyone else is great
Freshman,2,It’s difficult to get in touch with people other then your instructors.  It’s like they got ya so no need to keep helping you.  I still get calls asking me to become a student and I’ve already been a student for 6 months.  Some of the classes offer little to no readings and a lot of the videos or out dated or don’t work.
Freshman,2,i would like there to be better opportunities to go local and to make sure that the retention rate is up and that there will be job opportunities once degree is received
Freshman,2,"Well, when I was attending this school it was great. But afterwards when i withdrew, come to find out they had token all of my financial aid money and didn't want to refund it back to me and I was only attending the school for 4 months. SO what I did was re-enrolled so I could be attending some college online. Now I haven't heard back from anyone and supposedly I'm suppose to start class by February 5th. The bad part is that they wont contact me at all to let me know what is going on. I tried contacting someone myself but no one will return my emails or phone calls."
Sophomore,2,Independence University is an alright college. Since I have been enrolled I have had the most problems. Their financial aid sucks and it seems like a scam. They give you information on your  finances but make sure you don't get any funds back . Before you attend this college please do good research. I'm basically hanging in here until I graduate next year. Never ever recommend  this school to know one.
College Junior,2,I am really not for sure.
College Sophomore,2,I wish it wasn't so high
College Senior,2,Some of the administration don't need to be working with the students to get them in school if they are going to mislead them about how much the school will be receiving for the classes being taken and the money the student is going to receive if they are getting the HOPE and PELL grants and they took out both loans.
College Freshman,2,After 5 months I have taken only core classes. No classes have been scheduled in my major to this point and it is very disappointing as i feel I am paying to learn English grammar and not Graphic Design.
College Freshman,2,Too many core classes to start with...have to pay back loans and have not had a single class in Graphic Design to even consider going back to work. Career Services has made no contact. Only contact I have had with the school is the loan department wanting money from me. Recruiter fed me a line of bull about not having to pay anything back until I go to work in my field after I have had some instruction. There has been no scheduled classes in my major at this point.
College Freshman,2,Administrator's are not interested in me at all. They don't put forth any effort in contacting me or ensuring I am not having any problems.
College Freshman,2,Instructors are less than interested in students. I have not ataken a single course in the subject I am seeking a degree in after 5 months in class.
College Sophomore,2,We do not have job prospects.
Junior,1,Onlive schooling is awesome if the school you're at is helping. Don't go to Independence University if you don't want to get scammed.
Junior,1,"This school's education rate is horrible. I've been having problems withdrawing for months. 
Future Students: if U want an education that's worth it, this school isn't it. Go to a university that's willing to help."
Alum,1,"Actually 0 stars. They are a scam and stealing money. The degree will not get you a job, it is a diploma mill."
Freshman,1,"This school is the absolute WORST! They are on probation. Students are not hireable once graduating from their programs. The program was so bad that I tried to transfer, come to find out no other institutes accept their accreditation so you're stuck with no degree and a hefty bill! Do not attend this school. For the money they charge, you can go to one of the larger institutes. They do not deliver on anything they promised! Don't waste your time!"
College Senior,1,Coming to this school was the worst mistake I made because now I am struggling paying for school when all I was trying to do was get an education.
College Senior,1,I think the cost of education online through your school is unconstitutional.  Why is the cost of receiving an education cost so much through your school online.
College Freshman,1,I am bored with the classes I am taking at this time. Frustrated that I am not learning about my major and irritated they keep calling me for money I was not supposed to repay until I went to work in my field. I cannot go to work in my field with out the knowledge to change careers.
College Freshman,1,I was lied to about when and how my loans had to be repaid. Repayment was not supposed to begin until I was able to go to work in my field. I have not even started classes in my major after 5 months.
College Freshman,1,No one is friendly or even tries to make contact to study or just to talk about the class. Students are very standoffish in most every way. It is even difficult to get another student to respond even in the discussion posts.

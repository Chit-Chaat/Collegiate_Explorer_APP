Niche User,5,Online experience was great! It was super easy to do and everything for the most part worked perfectly well. UPenn is a great college to attend.
Niche User,5,UPenn is an amazing school built for just about anyone. It offers a wide variety of classes to choose from. The students here are so nice and caring for one another as well as the teachers. I would totally recommend attending this university.
Senior,5,"Great campus life, academics, and area for young people.  Could do better for diversity... ""cultural centers"" are a little embarrassing."
Senior,5,Only took online classes once things switched suddenly in March.  Professors were very proactive about learning the online teaching platforms and doing their best for remote students.
Senior,5,"Penn is renown for its top business school, medical school,  engineering school, and nursing school. The combination of its many and large top ranked undergraduate and graduate programs gives its students access to resources that are not accessible to students of any other university to the same extent."
Senior,5,The university worked hard to make sure that resources that were previously available on campus are now available remotely. They made the best of this less than ideal situation to help their students.
Sophomore,5,"I love the diversity at my school. I have met and gotten to know people from various ethnic, cultural, economic, and political backgrounds. This has allowed me to become more knowledgable about the diversity in people's experiences and perspectives. I also love the academics at Penn and there is a broad range of courses available to students of all interests. Here, they will have the opportunity to thoroughly explore and discover their passions while building lasting connections with other students and professor."
Sophomore,5,I took all my spring courses online for the remainder of the academic year. I felt that all my professors did a wonderful job transitioning to this new format and made students feel as comfortable and supported as they could while still maintaining the same level of academic rigor. They had ingenious ways of engaging students on the online format and were successfully able to complete the course and meet (even exceed) the students' expectations for online learning.
Alum,5,"It was a great institution on a beautiful and historic campus with fantastic and supportive professors, courses and students. The environment really encouraged students to grow and push themselves while enjoying their time and having fun."
Alum,5,"N/A. When I was a student,  I did not have any online courses while attending school so I cannot accurately rate this."
Alum,5,excellent overall and lots of choices.  teaching was above par and flexible schedules.  I would recommend alums to take the courses as well.
Alum,5,"As a Proud Penn Alum, I can honestly say that my 4 years here were the most rewarding by far.  Rigorous studies and intense competition, but I  Met tons of students and friends who went on to successful professional careers and the extracurricular and social life cannot be beat."
Graduate Student,5,"Great faculty, facilities, and classmates. Incredible institution with a diverse student body that exposes you to multiple viewpoints and provides a one of a kind experience."
Alum,5,Online learning at the University of Pennsylvania is seamless. A ton of tools and software to get everyone up and running quickly.
Alum,5,I had the best time at Penn. It was a wonderful place to learn and meet friends for life. You will not be disappointed if you attend.
Senior,5,"Great time. Met loads of quality people and overall really enjoyed myself. Certainly not divorced from the problems that all prestigious universities have (lack of socioeconomic diversity, competitive atmosphere, corporate pipeline), but if you can find other spaces to exist in, you will be able to have a good time. Philly really adds to the Penn experience too."
Alum,5,"Penn was a thrilling and meaningful experience. The academics are strong, the faculty brilliant, and the campus is stunning. I especially enjoyed the English department and the Benjamin Franklin Scholars program. Resources are incredible too - always a good idea to familiarize yourself with them early on. Here I'd like to highlight the vibrant LGBTQ community/center and the gym Pottruck. The location is also great - it feels like a college environment yet is so close to all the amenities of the City of Philadelphia."
Senior,5,"My experience at UPenn was rewarding, educational, a struggle, but well worth it.  I feel that my experiences prepared me for life. The professors prep you for reality and a higher criteria than normal universities or college life. Financial hardship makes life difficult for any person that comes from a low-income family, Yet, UPenn helped me through my financial struggles to complete my BS.  I did not get to do all that I wanted, but I am blessed for all that I accomplished. I would encourage anyone that wanted a good education to attend UPenn."
Freshman,5,"The University of Pennsylvania is a school full of driven, curious, and passionate students that want to change the world in whatever field they are in. The campus has students with all interests never afraid to show the world what they love."
Alum,5,"I had an incredible four years at UPenn.  It goes without saying that the faculty and campus resources are unmatched, but truly it's the student body that made my experience so fulfilling.  They come from all different backgrounds but are all similarly driven and curious, and it's a rare and wonderful opportunity to have four years to make friends in that setting."
Niche User,5,"The campus is beautiful, but the dorms had cockroach problems and we could not have food on the table/ bed. I feel that for the money you pay, you should get newer and cleaner dorms! Academics are great!! The local area is pretty and has a lot of things to do, but after months it can be a little bit boring! The food was not the best, but you can always get something on wawa. Upenn is a prestigious school and you will always received ""credit"" for going there."
Niche User,5,"After a two-year year intense search for the ideal school, we discovered that UPenn had the perfect balance between location, campus life, diversity, size, tradition, and academic opportunities. The energy on the campus is palpable from the very first moment you step onto Locust Walk. My son did a summer program at Penn and absolutely loved the experience. He will be starting in Fall 2020 and we are so excited for him."
Alum,5,"Amazing university with top-notch professors, instructors, and staff, which include many of the most brilliant and leading researchers in their respective fields. Very social student body that's really passionate about what they study and often times extremely engaged through multiple activities, clubs, or societies. People you can make friends with for life, who changed your life with new perspectives on how to innovate and make the world a better place to live."
Niche User,5,"Without a doubt one of the best colleges in the country. The professors are some of the most successful in their fields, the academics are challenging and engaging, and Philly is a great city to live in, with a ton of events to partake in."
Alum,5,"Excellence in academics, campus life, location, and diverse student body and faculty.  Best decision of my life was to attend Penn."
Senior,5,"UPenn is a fantastic school overall. For engineers however, would like to see more funding and rooms/space to support the growth of engineering clubs. I would also like to see the growth of majors such as mechanical engineering and the addition of classes with focus on other concentrations such as aerospace design, and more. Despite these things, UPenn has fantastic people. It is easy to get involved in extracurriculars, house duties/planning events, and more. UPenn definitely feels like a home to me."
Freshman,5,"Penn is blessed with great diversity.  Students are serious about their studies.  There is a wide range of activities available.  The campus is beautiful, and surprisingly walkable.  Students can take courses in any of the four undergraduate schools, no matter their major.  Professors teach classes, not TA’s, and are committed to teaching and available in their offices.  Scholarship money, based on need, is readily available.  In summary, a world class institution without snobbery."
Sophomore,5,"A true research institution, the University of Pennsylvania encourages all of its students to be curious about the world. Fund their research, it provides once in a lifetime opportunities with access to remarkable faculty, an international reach, and trail blazing peers. As a member of the Ivy League, it connects its study body to similar-minded students in a culture of alma matter pride, playful rivalry, and inter-school dependent  programming. Whether it be an Ivy League conference on LatinX heritage, political science, or veganism, the University of Pennsylvania encourages curiosity at every seam of the institution’s fabric."
Freshman,5,"Penn is a great place. It's a school that has lots of opportunity and a great community. In my first semester alone I have made so many friends that love and support me. My experience has truly exceeded my expectations both academically and socially. This is largely because I am not afraid to ask for help when I need it. One challenge that students at Penn face is that its so big that you will not be helped unless you yourself go out and ask for it. There are plenty of resources available to students who want help (ie. there are academic resources and mental health resources), but if you don't ask for them or seek them out, you won't be helped. Overall, I'm so grateful that I attend Penn and I wouldn't transfer anywhere else for the world."
Niche User,5,"University of Pennsylvania is one of the best universites in the United States. It's challenging, but hard work pays off. The professors are understanding and are willing to help anyone."
Niche User,5,"I like that University of Pennsylvania encourages girls to be in STEM. I was a part of the Penn LENS Program and I attended the GAINS conference. I got a chance to meet women who worked in STEM field and gained experience in real laboratory while learning about neuroscience, robotics, computer programming and more. University of Pennsylvania gives opportunities to get involved in science. Everybody was welcoming and supportive."
Alum,5,"I was a recruited athlete at Penn. I knew this school was the one for me immediately when I visited, and it stills holds true to this day."
Niche User,5,"I felt as if, I can redo college experience all over again, I would. Everything was amazing, from learning with your Professor to the food and housing."
Niche User,5,"There are numerous reasons that I love this university over other universities. One of them being is't diversity and willingness to accept talented students. As a person who is pursuing a career in business, University of Pennsylvania is the best choice for me."
Graduate Student,5,"Wonderful students, faculty, and administrators. Things can be expensive and sometimes they charge you for petty things, but overall positive expereince."
Freshman,5,"Penn is an excellent school with brilliant students and great faculty. The campus is fairly compact, and it is breathtakingly beautiful. I would recommend Penn to any student who likes an urban vibe and wants to earn a degree with great connections in a pre-professional atmosphere."
Niche User,5,"The University of Pennsylvania has it all.  From Academics to social life, there is never a boring moment.  I recently spent my summer there and had the time of my life."
Sophomore,5,I love the history of the university and the diversity of the education. One of my favorite things is being able to easily take classes from all four undergraduate schools and be able to interact with students from all different interests and backgrounds. I would like to see Penn become more affordable for all students and provide less advantages for those with overwhelming wealth.
Junior,5,"My experience at Penn has been excellent. The professors are passionate about the content of their courses and make time to support their students if they need extra help. I have learned so much, from increasing my vocabulary to more nuanced perspectives on things I have studied in the past."
Freshman,5,"entering my freshman year, so far everyone is super helpful and friendly.  Very excited to start my freshman year there and play softball."
Sophomore,5,"I had a great first-year experience at the University of Pennsylvania, as the academics were challenging yet rewarding and the people were incredible. As expected, the dining hall food was average at best but I found the dorms to be better than I expected."
Freshman,5,"U Penn definitely has a pre-professional culture, even if you're not in Wharton (the business school). That can affect people in different ways. The competition can motivate you or it can over-stress and burn you out."
Freshman,5,"I love the sense of community and school environment! I run for Penn's cross country and track & field teams, and I was easily able to manage my time between athletics and school. Also, being a nursing major, I can see why Penn's Nursing School is #1 in the nation. It feels amazing to go to class everyday and be taught by the best of the best!"
Freshman,5,"Penn continues to go beyond in its endeavors as a university. I am constantly in awe at how thought out and how well run everything is. So many support programs are available, new buildings and programs are always being announced. Socially there's something for everyone and not just something but for every type of person, there is a strong and rich group of people to be around. Obviously, Penn is one of the most elite academic and intellectual institutions in the world, and there are so so so many opportunities for involvement be it on campus (clubs, groups, etc.) or professionally with recruiting or study abroad, what have you. Ivy League athletics are also really great, something that hasn't been really spoken to. Plus, the school is in Philadelphia. The perfect school exists, and it's Penn."
Junior,5,"In the heart of Philadelphia, Penn offers a first-class, immersive Ivy League education that moves away from the image of high scholar of other prestigious institutions, and instead values working with students in order to foster success. As a student in liberal arts, I have learned to bring an open mind to all the different kinds of courses I take, and have been able to bring an interdisciplinary view to my major through my classes, my relationships with my professors, and the overall atmosphere of campus."
Alum,5,"Was a student at GSE from 05'-07'. Had some very stressful courses, but the professors were all very passionate and helpful. Classmates were very diverse and came from various backgrounds. Stays in Samson East and the rooms were terrible. Beautiful campus and tons of resources. Made some lifelong friendships and unforgettable memories."
Alum,5,I had a great experience academically and socially. I met great friends and learned under (mostly) engaging and passionate professors. I enjoyed the location of the school as well.
Sophomore,5,"Wonderful scholarly atmosphere, world class professors, access to many clubs and resources such as career services, tutors, mental health, and much more."
Graduate Student,5,The amount of opportunities offered by UPenn is tremendous. The campus looks good. Philly is also a good place to visit.
Freshman,5,"Enjoyable experience so far. Good professors/academics and vibrant social scene. Be wary of the pre-professional culture, but all around great experience."
Freshman,5,it's amazing and i really really really love it here. its been my dream school since i was a young child and to be able to go here is so amazing and such a blessing. studying psychology at upenn is really awesome.
Senior,5,"I truly love the University of Pennsylvania. I had an amazing time here and look forward to getting my graduate degree here next year. The highly professional environment and competitive atmosphere pushes students to reach their highest potential and grow beyond it. Penn also encourages students to have balanced social lives, and provides the students with the necessary resources to have their interests be represented within campus and in student groups. However, I must admit that Penn's hyper-competitive environment  does have drawbacks, especially on students' mental health. I think Penn could tackle this by changing their grading scheme, especially for underclassmen."
Niche User,5,I hope to attend the University of Pennsylvania. I love it. It has a great Finance program at the Wharton School.
Graduate Student,5,"I love it here. When I first visited I felt immediately at peace. I love the safe, beautiful campus in the middle of an awesome city. Every day I'm here I feel I'm developing more as a person. Awesome art, great libraries, kind students."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Pennsylvania has been my top choice school, and I am very satisfied with my experience so far. I am most impressed by the stylistically varied yet unified campus architecture, the quality of professors and extracurricular activities, and the times I spent at Locust Walk.
Few reviews of Penn can be written without mentioning Locust Walk. It serves as the central walkway for several dorms, dining options, and significant locations. At the same time, it is a hub for students of all majors and interests and a vibrant representation of Penn's life and culture. The Walk continues to be a wonderful addition to my college experience.
At the same time, I appreciate Penn's dedication to development. Every year, new constructions, programs, and extracurricular opportunities arise, and I enjoy being part of such a community. I would recommend Penn to anyone who loves challenges, immersive experiences, and diverse social connections."
Sophomore,5,"The University of Pennsylvania has given me an excellent learning experience. Academics are challenging, and you will be required to invest a good amount of time to them. Personally, I spent most of my time focused on this but did not find myself feeling overwhelmed for the most part. The university provides excellent study environments where you can study with your friends or by yourself. People at the university are very social and making friends is not a very hard thing to do. I was satisfied with my dining plan except for the fact that it is a little bit overpriced. Despite having a large student population, moving around on campus is not difficult at all. Regarding financial aid, the process of applying can get complicated and some of the staff can be impatient at times. Finally, there is always something to do whether you want to party on campus or do some culinary exploring in the city. Overall, I have had a fantastic experience!"
Sophomore,5,"great school with tons of  course options. great students. lots of choices for majors. great professors. wish there were more smaller classes. love the computer science, cognitive science and south asian studies dept."
Freshman,5,"My favorite thing about my experience at the University of Pennsylvania has to be the people. I have met such talented, intelligent, down to earth people who are ambitious and dedicated to their academics as well as their other interests. The environment at UPenn is very much work hard but also play hard. However it is not competitive, but more supportive in nature."
Graduate Student,5,"A great interdisciplinary academic community with a rich tradition of community based opportunities. Founded by Ben Franklin, Penn is grounded in a humanistic viewpoint that accepts students from diverse backgrounds."
Graduate Student,5,I liked the environment along with the academic curriculum. The Professors were great and the overall performance of staff was magnificent. I was able to stay focused and if I fell short I was supported by a cast that did not allow me to fail behind. The support was overwhelming and the school itself lived up to the number rankings it received. I would recommend Penn to anyone who is ready for the challenge.
Freshman,4,"I love the University of Pennsylvania. I got into a program that I was really interested and it is super helpful for me in getting into the professional degree that I want to go into after I graduate. To be honest, I was really scared to go to the city because I'm a beach girl, but online schooling, so I don't really know how to rate that yet."
Sophomore,4,"I love this school, but Penn still has a lot of work to do regarding its relationship with the West Philadelphia and the greater Philly community. The education I receive at Penn is great and have been able to take classes with the top educators in their fields. The social life is great and I would say better than most top schools, but can definitely feel exclusionary at times. Those are my main thoughts on the school."
Sophomore,4,The professors were fairly accomodating with everything which made my experience very simple and easy. Professors were flexible about deadlines but could have been more flexible about grade distributions after cancelling exams or assignments.
Sophomore,4,"Very competitive environment. Always have events going on, it's very easy to meet new people. People are friendly but they can be very cold, especially when  you are their competition."
Sophomore,4,"Coming into college, I had high hopes for achievement, opportunity, and personal growth. I expected my transition to be smoother than a freshly paved road. However, It was not that easy. I spent a majority of my freshman year learning how to adapt to a unisex school environment on my own, a shift that took more of a toll on me more than I expected. I soon learned that I had a severe case of social anxiety and found networking and making friends to be extremely difficult. However, I found so many safe spaces on campus. Spaces where my social anxiety dissipated into thin air. Spaces where I could express my true identity without the fear of judgment. At times It was harder than others to find this comfort., especially in spaces that lacked cultural and academic diversity. I would often come across individuals who were explicitly   unaccepting of my culture and race, but I did not let these experiences deter or hider the personal introspection and growth that I want to achieve."
Alum,4,"Challenging and fast-paced learning environment. High quality education. Competitive environment. Expect to grow personally, professionally, academically, and socially. Okay diversity. Poor mental health. University needs to work on mental health issue."
Junior,4,"I think Penn has a lot of great qualities — namely the fact that I've had the opportunity to learn from professors at the top of their fields. That experience has been unparalleled, and I'm very lucky. But I do think that Penn has an obligation to be more committed to their first-generation, low-income students. The wealth gaps at Penn are striking, and as a FGLI student myself, it can be overwhelming. It's been hard to see my peers who really struggle economically to have to return to unsafe or uncomfortable home situations when our spring semester went online because of the pandemic. Penn also has a responsibility to give back to the Philadelphia community, and I don't think they've always made the most ethical decisions as an institution. Penn is a great school, but it could benefit from being the benevolent force it wants its students to be."
Graduate Student,4,University did  a good job transitioning to online learning. Many of the classes had similar feels when synchronous and asynchronous classes provided flexibility.
Senior,4,"As good as online learning can be; obviously left things to be desired, but professors were very flexible and eager to do anything they could to make the experience as seamless as possible for students."
Sophomore,4,"The UPenn experience varies extremely within the community. Some students feel as though they are drowning in work and assignments, while some seem to barely be troubled by anything outside of their class times. That being said, most professors are very understanding of this and will help you if you ever reach out to them. The campus is amazing, an excellent blend of city living, and standard college-campus feel in my opinion."
Sophomore,4,"Following spring break, all courses in the spring 2020 term were held online. Course instructors were generally kind regarding due dates of assignments. While actually latching onto new material was indeed difficult through an online format personally, it was possible."
Niche User,4,"It is a really great school with exceptional opportunities. The campus has an amazing feel because it is in the city, yet there is still a quad area with green grass and tress, creating a sense of community within the university. There are also lots of restaurant options because of access to the city, which creates a fun environment."
Niche User,4,"High tuition. Top notch staff, resources, networking and campus. Number 1 nursing school in the world for 5 years in a row."
Senior,4,"Penn is good college to go to. I think its size provides everyone with opportunity to find their people. But it is very difficult no matter what your major is.  A lot of classes are just harder than they really have to be. People tend to prioritize their grades of their mental and physical health, and it becomes a difficult habit to break."
Freshman,4,"It's a really good school with a great social scene and engaging professors. Most students are really friendly and interesting. However, there's a lot of stress and pressure that comes with being a Penn student, so be prepared to struggle a bit."
Freshman,4,"In terms of academics, Penn is an excellent school. Philly is also a great place to live! However, this is a bit of a toxic aura surrounding Penn which can definitely be damaging to your mental health."
Senior,4,"Penn is overall a great university - you get a worthy return on your financial investment, if only simply in the prestige that comes with the name. But in addition, the offerings of the university in terms of courses, research opportunities, student involvement, and various opportunities are more than abundant. Student life can be tough and competitive - it is highly pre-professional - and even at a top-ranked university, the poor professors outnumber the fantastic ones."
Graduate Student,4,"Excellent University, you will learn a lot here. Be prepared for a hefty price tag. You can get anything you want or need in the University City area, as long as you can afford to pay or it. Philadelphia is a great city to live and learn in. UPenn is an ivy-league school offering world-class education."
Niche User,4,"I am really fond of this university. It's very big, and I love how the college basically owns everything."
Alum,4,"I attended the University of Pennsylvania as an exchange student during the 2017-2018 academic year. It is one of the most meaningful years of my time as a college undergraduate. I want to cite three reasons why I consider UPenn a very good university; its location and campus, its resources and extracurricular, and its prestigious academic atmosphere.

UPenn is located in Philadelphia, a city with a lot to do, whether the goal is leisure and entertainment or career advancement and research for a project. But the campus itself is beautiful and busy enough to trap you. There is always something going on, especially if you commit to activities and clubs that interest you. And lastly, everything from your classmates to the professor bring alive that feeling that gives UPenn its cannon as an Ivy League; beyond academic excellence, its people are friendly, intellectually curious, driven, and serviceable, willing to share their passions and desire to grow with others."
Sophomore,4,"Penn is a very smart institution. A lot of people feel Imposter Syndrome, and it's especially hard if you're coming from a ""hard"" school and fought for going to an Ivy League only to think that you're not smart enough. It takes a while to adjust, but I think most people keep their head above water (thanks to good friends, occasional therapists visits, and a lot of motivation).

The hardest part about Penn is its pre-professionalism, which can become tiring. There are engineers boasting about the 100k they're going to get post-graduating, Whartonites focused on how they're going to end up on Wall Street, pre-meds planning for three majors and getting lost in their coursework; it's easy to feel inadequate. Sometimes this acts as a motivator to apply for jobs or internships, but sometimes it does a blow to your self-esteem.

Going to a hard college means it's going to be hard. For me, it was worth it. Throwing yourself off the deep end is a huge change, and maybe, a good one."
Sophomore,4,"I really like the balance of academia and social life at the University of Pennsylvania. The campus is very active and alive, even during finals week. Very pre-professional and research oriented. I wish the financial aid offers were better, for I am struggling to finance my education."
Graduate Student,4,Definitely a campus-feel with the benefits of living in a city.  Lots of opportunity to take interdisciplinary classes and explore new subjects.
Alum,4,"Penn is a truly inspiring place, and it was a joy to study there. Students tend to find the academics rigorous, but if you're willing to work then you will do well. Professors are fantastic, and they are all open to working with students one-on-one when concepts aren't clicking or if something in class piqued your interest. I loved my experience so much I'm going back for law school."
Senior,4,Penn connects you to opportunities that you would never even imagine because of the incredible faculty and access to resources in Philadelphia and beyond. I have had some amazing faculty advisors who have worked with me individually to reach my goals. The students are also so kind and welcoming and incredibly smart and motivated.
Freshman,4,"Penn is a good school if you like urban-ness. It is also good for independent people as it really is a place where you have to learn to thrive. Make sure to take some good mental health practices as people tend to over-work themselves. If you work hard, you play hard, but both can be exhausting so also take time for yourself."
Sophomore,4,"The education at Penn is world class and provides you with the tools you need for success in the future. However, Penn is also a very challenging place both socially and academically, so make sure you are prepared. Greek life also is a bigger part of social life than is advertised and definitely surprised me."
Freshman,4,"During my time at Penn I have grown both as an academic and an individual. I have been challenged like never before in my time management, studying skills, and abilities to adapt to new ways of thinking. The professors present their individual subjects with a desire to create change and better that field. Socially, the environment is competitive but I have encountered many peers who are eager to collaborate and help one another succeed. The surrounding area and the city of Philadelphia encourage adventure, and even on campus there is no shortage of activities on any given day of the week because of the boundless events and clubs. Students at Penn have limitless opportunities to discover and cultivate their interests through the engaging academia and diverse, friendly community of students."
Graduate Student,4,"University of Pennsylvania has a well informed instructors who go above and beyond to tutor students. Assigned Readings, individual assignments and group assignments are all structured to fit in and help students understand better. Class participation is encouraged with games and interesting activities to help impact knowledge. What I don't like is that the school is extremely expensive and at this point, am not sure if I can pay for my fall courses."
Sophomore,4,"So far, UPenn has been very intense, academically, but I have yet to join any clubs. I am doing well but the people are so focused on achieving that it's hard to have much of a social life. I include myself in this category. It's great for science, medicine and engineering students but as an English major, I sometimes wonder where I am and why I am here. Overall, the education has been very high quality."
Sophomore,4,"The opportunities at Penn are incredible and open to mostly everyone. Being near Center City Philadelphia and being within University City, Penn is surrounded by so many activities and cool experiences. There is a lot of freedom to do what you want and try new things, be it with courses, fields of study, clubs/organizations, or jobs/careers. This university definitely treats its students as adults and does not ""baby"" them at all. However, the level of competition and social pressure is extremely high on campus. It is easy to fall victim to the competitive atmosphere even if you don't realize it - clubs themselves have an intense application process that is akin to applying for a job. Socially, there are pressures to have a lot of friends (the whole culture of ""networking"") and to always be doing something during your free time. This may all be useful for the future, but it gets a little tiring at times."
Alum,4,"I loved the diversity of opportunities, schools, and backgrounds that came together on the campus. I also appreciate that the beautifully renovated buildings. 
One thing that I did not appreciate was the super pre-professional culture and the PennFace."
Sophomore,4,"Appropriately challenging with so many different clubs, organizations, and groups that allow you to find your people and to experience new things."
Senior,4,Some of the best faculty around. Plenty of opportunities for students to take graduate level courses and participate in research. Tends to be pre-professional.
Alum,4,"Lots of opportunities for research, jobs, internships, etc... Students are super competitive and make classes feel stressful. Wonderful resources and facilities. But student life can be poor if you want to do well in classes."
Junior,4,"Competitive yet passionate and inspiring. The school offers a lot of diversity and pushes you to explore a variety of activities, thoughts and experiences."
Junior,4,"There are so many opportunities being at a large research institution with a large medical network, great business school, and ties to the community. However, the pre-professional atmosphere and competitiveness can be a lot sometimes."
Alum,4,"Really enjoyed my undergrad experience.  West Philly sometimes gets a bad rep, but I never felt unsafe.  Easily my favorite urban campus I've been to.  Most upperclassmen live in off-campus housing, which is mostly a rip-off for the quality you get in the areas closest to school.  Campus food is ok at best, but the food trucks and Philadelphia culinary scene are unbeatable."
Sophomore,4,"It id a very good experience so far, but it is competitive academically. Not much diversity but the social scene is very active."
Freshman,4,"I love UPenn! Go quakers! It is an amazing school with a lot of resources, but sometimes it's easy to get bogged down with everything that you should be doing."
Alum,4,Incredible environment with exciting energy. Big things happening there in all fields. Can be very competitive and sometimes exhausting. Seems like most people are very affluent.
Freshman,4,I have had a very positive experience at Penn where I quickly made friends. I truly enjoy my classes.
Junior,4,"This school is a really challenging academic program, however, it has its faults and puts a lot of pressure on its students. A lot of students here have trouble with mental health and having high expectations for students."
Alum,4,"The university is extremely helpful with financial assistance, and has very good support for career assistance. There is also a great variety of student organizations, often themselves being well-funded. One point of consideration for improvement is the competitive atmosphere. Additional support for stress, both in counseling and in actions to bring about the decrease of stress would be well advised. (Some measures have already been taken)."
Senior,4,"Freshman tend to live in the quad which is a fun place because all the people are there. But the actual rooms are terrible. Then you can move into the high rises which are not bad, but do not live up to the expectation after graduating from the quad. Then from there many people live off campus which is not only cheaper, but also better rooms. Try to make the most of the education by loading up on classes."
Senior,4,"I loved the academics. The academics were challenging, and I had to grow comfortable with not getting A's like I did in high school. The professors were very engaged and wanted to see their students do well. I was also a varsity athlete and found the facilities to be amazing! I joined greek life and found it to be very rewarding. The greek life at Penn is much more laid back than some other schools. I had work study jobs throughout my time at Penn, which I found enabled me to get a handle on the work world while also pursuing my studies and academics."
Niche User,4,I loved all of my professors and the access to great opportunities. My local campus had a ton of events going on at least once a week and it was really worth it to go and check everything out.
Junior,4,"Excellent for pre-professional paths, especially for Wharton/business track, but little variety in what careers students pursue (dominant banking/consulting culture), which can become restricting and stressful. Great education, but culture can be taxing."
Graduate Student,4,"I loved my undergraduate experience at UPenn. The campus is beautiful and it is obviously a great school. West Philadelphia has also come a long way in the past decade or so, and I always felt safe on campus. The dining halls leave some to be desired, but they are pretty average college dining halls.  The dorms are pretty nice - especially the Quad and New College House. Social life is vibrant, but the general support for athletics is lacking. My biggest criticism of the school is its poor mental health and the lack of initiative on the administration's side to improve it."
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at the University of Pennsylvania studying Nursing. For me, the school's academia has been above all, and I have continually felt as though I am going to be fully prepared for my future career. Most of my professors have gotten to know all of us individually, even though we have class sizes of over 100. I am constantly engaged by my academics, and find myself excited to learn. Also, there are such a wide variety of students who come from different backgrounds and have embarked on a diversity of life adventures. I find it so interesting to listen to all of the amazing things that my peers have done in their past, including gap years, business investments, and travels. However, I wish that the students weren't so overly focused on their academics, and were able to enjoy themselves every once in a while."
Graduate Student,4,"Like any colleges, Penn has both pros and cons. As a graduate student in the School of Social Policy and Practice at Penn (Master's of Social Work), I find that the biggest strength of Penn is its wide reach of professional network, research, etc.

The amount of resources/networking opportunities available for developing insight, experience, and others is unimaginable here at Penn. Having deep connections with all three sectors of the non-profit, for-profit, and governmental world brings its students enormous opportunities and information/knowledge to learn and grow from.

The cons, however, is that Penn as a whole seems a bit lacking in terms of student activism and engagement. There are clubs to join. But, I rarely see them out in the quad or the walkway outreaching or being vocal about a variety of issues students are concerned with in this age and time."
Alum,4,"When applying to schools, I did not know whether I wanted to live in a city. Penn has a beautiful campus while being located in a great city! It was the best 4 years."
Sophomore,4,"pros: great location, amazing opportunities, strong academics in most departments, vibrant food scene, diverse student body. cons: subpar dining and housing (if not in New College House), drab campus, hypercompetitive and stressed students (esp. premed, Wharton), high levels of social segregation"
Sophomore,4,Penn is a lot of work and full of stress just be prepared. It's not going to be an easy walk in the park.
Graduate Student,4,"The university had exceptional teachers and curricular content. The pace of studies is critical but the workload is enormous, much more than the stated time. Happy to attend but it would have been a better realization to understand how much work it was going to take."
Graduate Student,4,"Penn is a great school for graduate school. The campus and surrounding area is really nice - there are restaurants, bars, fast food, shopping, and convenience stores all within a five minute walk. Professors are helpful, but they are also very busy as they are so involved. Being in Philly provides a great living experience, although the cost of living is pretty expensive."
College Sophomore,4,"for west philly, penn is extremely safe, security almost everywhere"
College Sophomore,4,"variety of social, professional, and service greek organizations and combinations of the three"
College Sophomore,4,won the ivy league for football during last season
College Student,4,The teachers are helpful and are there when students need help. The students are driven to do there work and help the others around them when they don't get it.
Junior,2,"My only experience with online classes was finishing my courses remotely after all instruction moved online because of Covid-19. It was difficult, but that wasn't necessarily Penn's fault. Not being in a physical classroom is a huge loss — it's harder to have easily flowing discussions with my professors and classmates. I also found it hard to sit and stare at my computer screen for up to three hours at a time. It could be really disorienting. The lack of access to campus resources — really, just the campus in general — was another big loss. Much of the college experience is social, and being rid of that was hard."
Graduate Student,2,"My experience is with the Graduate School of Education.  The GSE has faculty doing cutting-edge work, but they give little attention to their teaching in my program.  The Penn library is superb."
College Sophomore,2,No one really cares about sports here at Penn to be honest
College Sophomore,2,"Being a non-greek, I only appreciate it for the parties they throw.. but even then, I didn't really go much after second semester of freshman year. Especially for women, the greek life promotes cliques and female-female competition. The way most, but not all, sororities are picked is through where you're from, who your family is, money, and physical attractiveness. People seem to be obsessed with what greek group you're in. I've been visibly looked down on when I get asked and say I'm unaffiliated, even by guys trying to hit on me. Despite this, there are some business, service, and cultural frats that seem great. The Panhellenic system is to blame here."
College Sophomore,2,"Even at the homecoming game, most of the people there are freshmen and parents. Even then people only stay for 30 minutes or so"
College Sophomore,2,"In general, the athletics are not what the students come here for."
College Freshman,2,housing at Penn basically sucks - most of the upperclassmen dorms are decent but ones for freshmen are pretty bad. A lot of upperclassmen live off campus though which a lot of people find as a cheaper and higher value option.
College Freshman,2,The only redeeming factor about Hill College House is the people I meet there.
Recent Alumnus,2,I had a very hard time finding an internship and had no help from my professors in this regard
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Apartments has a monopoly on off-campus housing, allowing them to charge whatever they want and continuously raise rents. In addition, they are very slow and unhelpful, and sometimes do not help at all, with necessary maintenance and repairs."
College Sophomore,2,"RAs and GAs in the freshmen dorms are far to quick to break things up/get kids in trouble for things playing music in the dorm, even before quiet hours begin."
College Sophomore,2,Dining hall food is consistently awful.
College Junior,2,"Horrible landlords that don't fix anything, and the owner of campus apartments has his two lamborghini's parked at 41st and locust--the man is running a racket in screwing penn students with incredibly jacked up rates."
College Freshman,2,"This year, Penn athletics have been pretty terrible as a whole."
College Freshman,2,"There is no merit-based aid, which is completely understandable, but SFS cut my aid in half after giving me my first estimate."
College Freshman,2,"You live in a city, so you don't really need to have a car on campus.  Anyways, if you do have one, spots are pretty hard to find unless you pay to have a spot in a parking lot rather than looking for street parking."
College Sophomore,2,I just don't like the city.
College Student,2,"The athletics aren't bad, it's more a lack of school spirit concerning athletics."
College Student,2,"While alcohol and drugs are abundant, the open dialogue on campus & medical amnesty in the state of Pennsylvania is incredibly beneficial for students' health."
College Sophomore,2,"Being in the city, there's not much parking on campus. "
College Sophomore,2,"Asian, jewish, and wealthy - the three words I'd pick if I had to describe the student population. The school tries hard to talk up their diversity, but don't be fooled. Like many schools, Asians are abundant, but there are also an incredibly large number of wealthy jews, most of whom have come to this school holding their legacy status. Most of the international students are very wealthy, and the ""minorities"" the school admits to fulfill their quotas also tend to come from very wealthy families."
College Sophomore,2,"There's nothing in West Philly - if you want to go for a walk outside of campus, take public transportation to Center City instead, as it's much safer and more interesting."
College Freshman,2,Campus is in the city so spots are scarce.  Parking give students a discount of around $18 a night but that is not cheap!!  Do not expect to use a car while on campus if you don't need to.  Everything is within walking distance!!  Everything!
College Freshman,2,"In urban Philadelphia, there is obviously a dearth of parking spaces. On-street parking can be hard to find during popular hours, but the cost is reasonable. Parking garages (There are four on or near campus) is pricier. A student should not need a car on campus, for everything is so close. Even Center City or other parts of Philly is easily accessible on foot or through public transportation. A car would be a hassle!"
College Senior,2,The strictness is pretty average for schools.  Safety issues are pretty strict.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Transportation was very inconvenient. If traveling by own car parking was a nightmare or if  by city bus it was far from campus. The school did have yellow buses that went into the city, but they were very uncomfortable and they didn't run at night. It was very expensive traveling from north Philadelphia to Abington PA."
College Senior,2,"The weather is unpredictable at best. It has a mind of its own. It can snow, hail, rain, and shine in the same day."
College Freshman,2,"Not many people do drugs at Penn, but it does depend on who you hang out with. Usually theres at least one person smoking week and then people take adi, but other than that nothing is too serious. Most people just drink."
College Sophomore,2,"Philadelphia is a disgusting city to be in. There is always construction, and it is pretty dirty. There are some places to go, but they are not in the same part of town as campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I Would Advise Against Driving to Class – There are relatively few parking spots near campus and many cost money and are limited-time parking. There are places you can park near to campus (that then require a walk) if you live far-away, but in general, it's better to plan to walk to class. The campus is pretty accessible on foot."
College Sophomore,2,I have not had much experience myself with parking so my review is based on my parents' experience with it when they drop me off and pick me up. Parking is difficult as is to be expected in a big city like Philadelphia.
College Senior,2,"I live off campus and public transportation is the way to go around Philadelphia. However, I like the fact that if I'm running late, I'm able to jump into my car and grab a metered space. The caveat to this is that it's $2 for every hour with usually a max of three hours. Don't even think about just 'winging' it because the parking authority loves their job."
College Senior,2,"Gender Inequity – I don't like how all of the sororities are off campus while the frats are in the center of campus. I understand that women have not always been allowed to attend here, but some things need to change. Its all about location."
College Junior,2,"Obviously there are many different social scenes, but if you intend on being involved in the fraternity scene, be prepared to witness a heavy use of alcohol, marijuana, and cocaine. Cocaine use is very prevalent at Penn and to say it's not would be a total lie. At any frat party, if you manage to get upstairs and open a closed door, chances are there will be cocaine. Molly and ecstasy were also big highlights of this years spring fling, and there is widespread criticism of the school's open stance towards drug use. "
College Freshman,2,"If You Really Want It, but No Need – Very few people have cars on campus.  There's just no need for them.  But if you really want to get a car for school, then Penn will let you park in the garage at 40th and Walnut, and there's pretty much always spaces from what I understand, but it's pretty far away from the center of campus."
College Sophomore,2,"Dining Halls – Overall, repetitive and bland. But it definitely makes freshman year easier, not having to worry about finding your own food."
College Sophomore,2,"At Penn, there is a lot of diversity in race and hometown, but very little diversity in economic status. Obviously they are outliers, but for the most part, most people fit the Penn stereotype."
College Freshman,2,"It can be incredibly hard to find a parking space on campus, however, there's almost no need for a car as a student. Because the campus is in a city with good public transportation, I rarely wish I had a car. The only times I would want a car are to go downtown on weekends, but it's probably better that I don't have one..."
College Freshman,2,Long Lines – It is over priced and has long lines. Few options.
College Freshman,2,"My honest opinion of UPenn is that it felt like a Vocational school for suits.  The pre-professional feel is very dominant and seems to detract from the normal feel of undergraduate life.  While socially the school is nice because it is big enough to find different niches, the population is large and it is easy to get lost in the crowd.  It is hard to find guidance and I would recommend UPenn more for graduate students than for a true undergraduate college experience."
Niche User,1,University of Pennsylvania offers a very distant campus with low maintenance upkeep and overall low student agenda. My experience with this university has been poor for the most part the staff for university are very carefree when it comes to my well-being as a student. Do not recommend this university for any subject other than medical.
Niche User,1,"If you're not in Wharton, you don't have access to 3/4 of the computers on campus. I hate Penn. I was very I pleased."
College Sophomore,1,It's system is designed for the underprivileged to fail out.
Recent Alumnus,1,It is bad because if you're not in greek life you do not exist.
Recent Alumnus,1,They did not help me with getting scholarships. That is why I am looking to outside sources now because this school is very expensive!
College Senior,1,"Honestly, dealing with financial aid here is a huge hassle"
College Student,1,"It's incredibly difficult to get in touch with people, and countless mistakes were made with my file. Eventually things worked out, but it took considerable (to the point of unnecessary) brain power and effort on both ends."
College Sophomore,1,Absolutely horrible! Get off of the dining plan as soon as possible and run away!
College Sophomore,1,"Do not-- I repeat, do not-- own a car on campus.   "
College Sophomore,1,"There's no where to park on campus; if you do drive, you'll need to park off campus or spend a lot of money in a garage or to get a permit. It's really useless to have a car and more of an inconvenience. It's best to bike around campus and use public transportation like SEPTA."
College Freshman,1,"There is no food for freshmen on weekends because of hours, and poor choice in dining. All grocers and convenience stores are overpriced and have poor selection. Food choice repeats over and over every day and is usually tasteless. The pizza is often still doughy. Sometimes they serve breakfast at dinner. Dining halls close way too early. 1st year students are forced onto the dining plan. Staff varies from detached to openly hostile to students. Sometimes the dining hall serve completely random food for dinner. For example, sometimes you go into a dining hall for dinner and they are serving breakfast instead."
College Sophomore,1,"The food quality is poor. It improves only slightly when parents are around (surprise, surprise). The staff at the dining halls are generally impatient, mean, and not pleasant to deal with."
College Sophomore,1,There is WAY too much of it. It is actually ridiculous and not the right fit for me at all.
College Sophomore,1,It sucks!!! The quad looks nice only from the outside. The high rises are the only good options if you want to stay on campus. Insulation is pathetic and it is freezing. They take 9 days to turn on the heat.
College Freshman,1,"I am not from this area, but honestlty, I hate the weather here. Summers are hot and humid, winters cold and dry. There are like 6 nice fall weeks, and 6 nice spring weeks. We have airconditioners, dehumidifiers and humifiers in our apartments to keep it bearable inside during the seasons (and I live in a very nice building!)"
College Senior,1,"Sage Advice – Urban. UPenn pushes their liberal agenda really hard. Professors are unattached to the undergrads. A lot of engineers and nurses in the College classes. Classes are HUGE despite what the ""faculty to student ratio"" might tell you."
College Sophomore,1,Do Not Park Here – Expensive parking coupled with inconvenience on campus makes parking a terrible choice.
College Sophomore,1,Ditch the Meal Plan ASAP – The dining halls are a horrible value. You're charged $16/meal unless you get unlimited and half the time you end up eating a sandwich because everything else they have is too gross to eat. Houston Market and the cafes that take dining dollars are good though. You're better off just using dining dollars than getting a full meal plan.
College Sophomore,1,There are parking meters everywhere around campus.  It costs too much to park.  It's just horrible.
College Freshman,1,"Terrible System – The application process for Housing has changed this year. A lot of people were forced to live off campus or with substandard housing. By the time the University notifies you that you don't have housing, most off campus vacancies have already been filled. Rooms are small, and mice can be found in all residential housing. Residential services is VERY unhelpful and rude. The Quad can be very dirty. Also, housing is extremely expensive, although many units do not have any air conditioning. Most college houses need to be renovated. My experience with housing has been terrible. There is simply not enough housing for undergraduates. "

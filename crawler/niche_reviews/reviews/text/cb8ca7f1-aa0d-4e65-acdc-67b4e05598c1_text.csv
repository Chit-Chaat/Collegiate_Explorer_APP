Sophomore,5,I am taking all my classes online! It’s been a great experience! Amazing classes! Amazing system to learn with!
Sophomore,5,"Southeastern is an amazing university. Even though i am doing remote for the fall semester, i still feel like i am apart of seu! The environment is very welcoming and friendly. They have a lot clubs and activites for every student. Lastly, they have a very passionate worship group, chapels are amazing and encouraging!"
Senior,5,"I took all of my classes online, and the experience is excellent. I have enjoyed interacting with other students and my professors in these classes. I have gained a lot of information over the last three years. I would recommend Southeastern University to anyone looking to attend online courses."
Senior,5,"Southeastern University fits my lifestyle. I am able to take all of my classes online, and this has benefited me. My professors are great and they respond and answer any questions I may have in my classes. 
I have enjoyed the journey I am on at Southeastern."
Alum,5,"My experience at Southeastern University was tremendous. There were many upsides to the program: it's online courses, brilliant professors, and an incredible college community. During my time at Southeastern, I was highly involved in extracurricular activities in the community and at my church. Because of this, I thought it could have been difficult to identify classes that fit my schedule. However, I was always able to find a course online that I could do on my own schedule. Professors were intelligent, hands-on, and clear at communicating due dates for projects and assignments. All of these components, plus the fact that the community is welcoming, engaging, and joyful made my time in college unforgettable. I highly recommend Southeastern University!"
Sophomore,5,"I love this christ centered university. They don't push Christianity in your face, but rather guide you in a relationship with God. Also SEU Worship is great"
Sophomore,5,"They did a good job transferring to the remote format. For science majors, they did a good job because we had labs that had to be in the remote format. They did a good job with this"
Alum,5,On my way to third Master's degree completely online! Their online setup is easy and consistent. I wholeheartedly recommend them.
Alum,5,"Southeastern University accepted my unacredited undergraduate degree. I am on my way to earning my third Master's from SEU completely online! They are fabulous to work with, and have financially reasonable tuition prices."
Senior,5,All of my classes were online this past semester and I absolutely love the program! They are no less engaging and personal. The only downside is the lack of downtime between courses.
Graduate Student,5,Southeastern was the most amazing place to go to college. The sense of community helps you feel like you belong to something greater. The professors are all amazing and more than willing to take extra time with you if you need it.
Graduate Student,5,The online learning platform at Southeastern is great. It’s user friendly and there is tech support available 24/7 in case you have any issues. The professors all utilize discussion forums so you still get the discussions you would in a classroom setting. I loved the classes I took online.
Alum,5,I took Hebrew and Sociology online.  The course materials were well organized and helped me to learn the material.  I had already started working full-time so this was an easy way to finish up my degree.
Alum,5,"I am an Alum of SEU and my 3.5 yrs on the campus were the best.  I met life long genuine friends who were grounded in their faith and in real life. I was an RA and very involved in many aspects of student life.  I lived in Lakeland after I graduated for 5 years, nice small town feel with many things to do.  Party Scene - SEU is a no alcohol/drugs community.  I don't need those things to have a good time.  We had tons of fun in the evenings and on the weekends.  I would rate the ""Fun Scene"" as excellent.  I love going back to visit during Homecoming and my professors still remember my name.  I am a high school college counselor now and I always introduce my students to Southeastern as a great Christian College option.  Go FIRE!"
Junior,5,"I have loved my experience at Southeastern University. The people are what really did it for me, it was  a place I felt welcomed and loved by everyone."
Junior,5,The online learning transition in my opinion was done really well! The faculty was understanding in how the transition might affect their students.
Senior,5,"Beautiful campus, great staff. I have learned so much and feel confident in the education I have received."
Senior,5,Very easy to use and navigate. Online learning was very well taught and organized. The professors were very involved with your progress. I would recommend online to anyone.
Freshman,5,Southeastern University is incredible!! The online platform is so easy to use and makes learning efficient. They are so kind to the students are really allow us to utilize them if we have questions. I would recommend this school to anyone.
Sophomore,5,"Every class has been so beneficial to my growth as a student, while also deepening my faith! All classes as well as instructors have led with such integrity. So thankful for my time at Southeastern University and would definitely recommend to anyone looking to have a mixture between academics and faith."
Senior,5,Southeastern University is a Christian - based University. The campus is beautiful. The faculty and people are above amazing. I wouldn't want to go to school anywhere else!
Freshman,5,"I am part of an extension sight of SEU, called Dream City College. It is an interactive ministry school that allows us to do hands-on ministry, while also getting a formal education. The leadership is excellent. They teach us how to be good leaders, how to serve well, and love others. They also help us achieve our academic goals and never settle for mediocrity. I am extremely thankful to be part of this college."
Freshman,5,"This school was amazing from the get go. I originally heard about it From my schools college fair, where I learned about its amazing values and academic programs. I was then able to take a tour, where I fell in love with the school even more. I have since committed to the school and am excited to start as a freshman in the fall of 2020."
Junior,5,The school is a Christian environment. It’s a place where you can walk around and talk about Jesus freely. The school has great athletics with a great academic core. There is no other Christian school better than Southeastern University.
Junior,5,I believe that Southeastern University has done a wonderful job of educating their students! I love the community and my peers!
Junior,5,"Southeastern University is my dream college. Honestly, the best college thats surrounded with positivity, love and goals to help students."
Freshman,5,Southeastern is a welcoming community and a community who is always willing to give a hand. They are a community who represents God. They make you feel at home.
Niche User,5,The counselors are great and they really keep their focus on Christ. They help me as much as they can with the application process.
Niche User,5,I went to visit for preview day at SEU. They make you feel like your apart of the school. I loved how they surround there to focus on God in everything they do and stand for. I also really like the connection and relationships professors have with students.
Niche User,5,Southeastern University is a Christian college filled with super sweet and accepting people located in Lakeland Florida. The weather there is so beautiful and warm. The professors are very courteous and willing to take their time to teach the lessons thoroughly. Southeastern's campus is easy to get around and is so beautiful. The music performed during chapel is beautifully performed with talented singers.
Freshman,5,"The friends I have meet, the chapel, I feel I have a calling and God is doing wonderful things in me, the mission group, going on my first mission trip with SEU and feel very excited and waiting to see how we can spread the word of God in Brazil."
Freshman,5,"I vistes Southeastern college and loved the campus. It’s so beautiful. The tour was so informative and organized. Everyone is friendly and exceptional. I will be attending radiant College , a satellite campus at Radiant Church. The availability to have it here is a wonderful way for me to get a degree in ministry and be a graduate of South eastern University."
Junior,5,I love that SEU gives you a chance to grow spiritually and mentally while allowing you to explore different cultures.
Senior,5,I was a very overselling experience to have the tour. I felt motivated. I was interested in studying in a small private university. I would not also fulfill me career interest but also would give me the christian opportunity.
Freshman,5,I believe this school is worth the 5 stars because they invest their main focus on students and everyone wants to help you succeed instead of failing.
Junior,5,The faith element in Southeastern University has made every class beyond just an education but a life-changing experience. The diversity in my classes has helped me to understand so many walks of life. The viewpoints I encounter will help me in my future career. The support from not just the professors but the administrative staff has been crucial in my success at Southeastern University. I have found the availability and quality of classes to be refreshing in my busy life as a full-time worker and mother of four. I have had nothing but great experiences with every professor I have had the pleasure of having in the last two years. I would highly recommend Southeastern University to everyone and especially their online and extension site classes.
Freshman,5,Southestern University has an awesome facilities!  Have been a blessing for me be part of the team of students this year.  I always gave thanks to my God for the oportunity to study on campus. God bless you!
Junior,5,"This university helped me not only in my education but in my spiritual life as well. The teachers, student, and the facility are all amazing people, they truly care about your well-being."
Freshman,5,I loved the environment. As soon as I stepped onto the college I felt at home. Many of the people there were so friendly and welcoming. They gave me vital information for applying to get the school and maximizing my financial aid and scholarships.
Niche User,5,"They are super nice and welcoming, I enjoy the vibe they gave off at open house and their true dedication to want to help."
Freshman,5,"It's a beautiful campus full of beautiful people.  I am challenged in all areas of life every single day.  The classes are filled with material that is actually applicable to me, even though they're just general education courses right now.  The professors love their students and strive to ensure that the students are successfully thriving in their academics.  They want us to succeed as much as we do, and it is such an encouragement."
Freshman,5,Southeastern University has a great environment. It is a very welcoming school with a great variety of programs and Christian based education.
Sophomore,5,"Being so far away from home, the students, faculty, and staff have become my second family. I am seeing myself grow in so many ways. I am definitely glad I chose this outstanding University and I am looking forward to my future like never before."
Freshman,5,"Southeastern University is an amazing school, it is so personal the teachers make sure you understand the curriculum, I had also met my best friends here!"
Niche User,5,"Southeastern University is a wonderful college in a more rural area of Florida.  The campus is a nice size compared to some of the other universities in Florida.  I love the location - beaches, theme parks, and cultural options are within an hours drive."
Sophomore,5,"I'm very thankful for the school and the people at the school, because of the people and the environment I'm able to call SEU my home"
Niche User,5,"As the branch I attended opened when I was an entering freshman, I can say it was a unique experience. The grading system below is not due to the quality I experienced, as the usual university scene was not applicable. However, the professors I learned under were super encouraging, helpful, kind, and gracious. Many of my classes were eight weeks, and even in those short times I found my education to be exciting and fun. Also, the online professors from the main campus in Florida were extremely easy to talk to, patient, and respectful. The grading system was very fair and my GPA proved it to be true. SEU is a school I will always be grateful for, even if I only attended my freshman year. I wouldn't trade that year of learning for anything!"
Niche User,5,The tour was very thorough and answered all my questions. I was able to get the experience with the coaches as well. I was very thankful for them walking me round the campus and introducing me to the area. The coaches were every helpful in answering my questions about the team and allowed m to even meet the team and view all the locations I would be using on campus. The orientation also allowed me a great insight on the university. Not only were there many welcoming faces but they also walked us around in groups to view the campus. The guides answered any questions anybody had.
Sophomore,5,"Southeastern became my home away from home! Not only were the resort style housing options comforting, but the people became my family. I became surrounded by a campus of genuine human beings with a strong hunger for God. Professors also shared this kind of love, as they seemed to really care for a student's well-being and not just a grade. There are always events on campus and ways to make friends an get involved. I could not see myself having a college experience anywhere else."
Freshman,5,Every professor cares about their students and the students can go to them for anything. The athletic programs are top of the line. Th
Freshman,5,Such an amazing college full of dreamers! People who love God and serve Him wholeheartly. A place I could only dream to attend.
Niche User,5,I visited Southeastern University on a tour and found it a Beautiful campus with lots of opportunities to thrive in Christ and in studies. I just wish they had a more direct Veterinary oriented pathway to prepare for Veterinary Medicine school.
Sophomore,5,"Wednesday, August 29, 2018 - My first day of classes at SEU! My professors have been such kind hearted and genuine people, they love their students and the environment throughout this campus is full of love and joy. Everyone cares for one another and supportive and encouraging towards your goals and dreams. You don't get this on every campus and I'm so glad I did not give up on my perfect college search! We must trust the process in whatever it is that we want or need! This process was full of many prayers! God definitely blessed me with this university, I am so content and excited for what’s to come and what journey I'll be on for the years to come. I never thought that SEU would be the perfect school that God set out for me to go to since the very beginning of my upsetting journey with my two previous UCF rejection letters. But, as the general population says, ""Everything happens for a reason!"" :)"
Niche User,5,"Southeastern is just an all around the amazing school. Their sports facilities, the teachers, and the students are so nice and kind. The campus is so beautiful, it looks like a modern little town. Everyone enjoys life at SEU. But the most important thing that I love the most about this school is the way they express Jesus. Their chapel services are just so amazing and the way everyone their shows you love and is actually there to take care of you is just amazing."
Freshman,5,"Overall, Southeastern University is a place where one can group not only academically but spiritually. It prepares you for more than you can ever imagine. The professors are very well prepared and are willing to assist on a personal level. The campus is very beautiful and Lakeland is by far a great place to reside in."
Sophomore,5,I love this school! It is an amazing environment to grow in God and learn so much about your major. This school is full of opportunties if you are looking to get invloved and learn from the best professors.
Senior,5,I love my college! I’m currently an online student but my experience has been great. My professors have always made themselves available to answer questions and offer help. I love the school is faith based and that I am reminded of Gods word and encouraged with it.
Freshman,5,"Although it is  expensive the environment is rich and God's presence is so eminent. It is truly and ""Christ-Centered"" university. The food could use some work, but for cafeteria food it is not the worst. There are tons of things to get involved with and I would recommend getting involved.  There is much to do in the city around campus, but I wish there was more offered on the weekends at the campus. They really should not fine students for not fulfilling chapel credits, I have a job and I petitioned but don't have enough for the rest of the semester. We already pay $35,000 to go to Southeastern the extra fees make it  not affordable for most students."
Junior,4,"Since COVID-19 hit, most classes have gone online over zoom! So far the experience has been incredible, the WIFI does cut out every so often but kicks right back on!"
Sophomore,4,"My online experience is going good so far.  All of my professors are very flexible and understanding when it comes to being on zoom. They are very passionate and determined to teach and help you learn. Even though i am on my computer and not in the class, i still feel apart of the class/classroom because the professors and teaching assistants are one on one with each student."
Alum,4,"My online experience with Southeastern University was quite enjoyable. What I respect about Southeastern is how they constantly work toward being a prestigious university. For example, between my first and second semesters, the school changed its online platform so that it became more functional and far simpler. For the most part, online professors would respond to questions on the same day with extremely few exceptions. The aspect of online learning that I did not enjoy was its amount of non-essential work. In other words, I felt that I spent more time doing assignments rather than studying and learning. In my opinion, I believe that if their courses put more energy into fewer but more challenging assignments rather than a multitude of simple ones, the program would improve. In conclusion, the program was beneficial, and I believe I have come out of it with far more knowledge than before."
Senior,4,"Southeastern is unlike the other schools I have attended. I wanted something more personal and intentional, rather than general learning, and I get that here. The professors are engaging, caring, and willing to encourage you. They have enriching activities on campus and an excellent career starter program."
Niche User,4,"The friendship I made during my time at the university, are for a lifetime. The professors and staff were always kind, approachable, and professional."
Niche User,4,I enjoyed how easily it was to be successful with all the tools made available for me to appropriately complete classes.
Alum,4,I had a wonderful experience with staff and faculty at SEU. My professors genuinely cared about me and working with me to provide the best possible education.
Junior,4,What I like about Southeastern is the community of students and the student to professor ratio of my classes. It challenges you to learn and the professors make an effort to get students involved. It would better benefit the community of students if we had space for a bigger library and more buildings for classrooms.
Junior,4,"I had three other choices with scholarships and God called me to this campus. While there were some problems with my roommates, I grew ten times stronger through it with the help of my peers and professors."
Sophomore,4,I’m currently a sophomore and hoping to get accepted into the nursing program. The science professors that I’ve learned from know their stuff and can help answer and questions you might have pertaining to the field.
Senior,4,Attended for three years and overall is very good. Love the spiritual aspects and growth. Never interested in campus job and now I have two through recommendations! Professors are down to earth and loving.
Freshman,4,I love Southeastern University because the facility there are always willing to help you in any situation that you may need assistance in. The teachers are excellent they are always there to help you in and outside the classroom. There are a lot of ways you can participate in the school because they have a lot of clubs for students to join.
Niche User,4,"My sister attended southeastern University so I got to experience the process along with her. The open house was very informational. They broke down cost, meal plan, dorms, and student life very well. Being at that college felt like home because of how nice everyone you encountered was. Also when I went to visit the football team was just starting out but regardless you can see the energy and the excitement they brought to the school when they entered the cafeteria. My overall experience was great made me feel like I was going to the college and not my sister even though I was only a sophmore in highschool at the time."
Sophomore,4,I believe southeastern wants the best for its students and God is our main focus. The Professors really care about you if you show that you really are interested in what the are teaching. The fast pace of the course is hard to keep up with.
Niche User,4,"I was an online student for approximately two years and I appreciated all the helped I received and the emails that kept me up to date on what I need to submit or turn in. I appreciated the professors and how clear they were in terms of what must be turned in, etc."
Sophomore,4,"I do plan on attending this university in the Fall of 2019. The campus looks very nice, the people there are very welcoming and kind and just overall gives off a homey place which I can't really say for other uni's that I've visited. The application process went by quite smoothly towards the end but in the beginning it was a rough patch. I am so thankful that they were always there to help and respond quickly and efficiently but one thing I wish had gone a bit better was the placement of files since mine were lost somehow and the communication on their end between the workers so everyone was on the same page."
Sophomore,4,"This University is very Christian based and if you are not into that then it is not for you but, if it is the go for it because you would generally enjoy your time here at this institution. The people are so full of life and it is impossible not to make friends here. You will definitely walk out with memories. The classrooms aren't too big so you will get to engage better in the classes and and their are plenty of places near by for you to hang with friends and have fun. Also there are many campus wide events where you can go to make memories."
Freshman,4,"As a private Chrisitan university, it offered me so many opportunities to pay for college in full, and have a great time. I go to their accredited campus at Bayside Community Church and the school has been nothing short of a blessing to get me set up and ""Fire""-ready for the fall."
Niche User,4,I am an online student and the classes have been great. I have toured the campus and it is a really great atmosphere. The people and the staff is very welcoming. If everything works out I hope attend classes at the university.
Junior,4,"Southeastern is an amazing school with generally caring staff and faculty. However, this school is very image- driven and only teaches hype messages in chapels. The Biblical teachings are often skewed to make the messages more appealing to our generation. I love the community, but I must be careful with who I am around and what I am being taught specifically in the theology courses."
Sophomore,4,It has been a very great experience getting to know Southeastern University throughout the year that I have attended so far. The people that go are so kind and friendly to each other and I've never seen that at any other college campus that I had toured. I hope I get to learn more about the school and it's history when I go back in the fall.
Niche User,4,"I like the community, the teachers are really devoted to you doing well. Even if you need extra help, they have tutors for you."
Niche User,4,Southeastern University is an excellent school that teaches the diversity of academics and spiritual life. I am currently a dual enrollment student through Southeastern. I have been able to take basic classes while exploring my walk in faith. This school has given me an experience to explore my knowledge that I know I wouldn't have been able with another school.
Sophomore,4,"I absolutely love this school. However, the problem I have is with the administration/financial team. I had to struggle to not get kicked out due to a past due balance that I ran out of resources to help me pay for it. I hate that each semester I have to fight with them about my financial plan instead of it covering the whole year."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Southeastern University has been great so far! I would like to see more opportunities here on campus that would help me grow in the field of my study. Which is biology premed. Otherwise, the professors here are great and very knowledgeable. I also love the fact that it is a faith integrated institution, therefore we get a bible perspective in most classes no matter the subject being taught!"
Niche User,4,"I loved the campus, it is very beautiful. The people there are so friendly, and the education program is outstanding. The one thing I would change is the denomination to Presbyterian. I want to go into Biblical studies and don't desire being taught from an Assembly of God perspective..but other than that, it is a really great place!!"
Junior,4,Southeastern is a great school for Christian students that want to be focus on academics. It has a really good location between Tampa and Orlando by 45 min.
Freshman,4,Southeastern is a vibrant and gorgeous University that does everything in its power to make you feel welcomed. It truly gives me a sense of belonging.
Alum,4,Southeastern University provides a quality education for a great price! The staff is very helpful and the students are academically inclined and clearly invested in their future.
Sophomore,4,"Southeastern University is wonderful because everyone is so inviting and kind. When I went in as a freshman, I was nervous and anxious but I met people and my RA and RD were super nice and amazing and really wanted to get to know me. The university has such a welcoming feeling and an open community."
Sophomore,4,"Southeastern University is a school for those who are passionate about serving God and the purpose they are called to. SEU students are a prime example of what hard work and dedication looks like. The atmosphere of the school is very welcoming; it's home away from home. I am encouraged daily by my peers and professors to be excellent in all that I do, giving glory to God. I came to this school with low expectations and this school has went above what I expected it to be. SEU is the college our generation needs; a school to push us to our full potential."
Graduate Student,4,"Southeastern University is a Christ-centered institution with a great educational program which lends the opportunity of online classes for graduate students like myself who are in the working field to attend. I know that in order to achieve greatness between its student body and school you must demonstrate trust, honesty, and educational diversity to create an environment for these standards. That is what Southeastern University is about. When looking for a school to further my education, this university, has more of the qualities I am looking for the other colleges"
Freshman,4,I like the small setting in college. This school looks like it would be a great school. It is pretty hard to rate accurately until fully established there.
Freshman,4,Southeastern is a great place for students who like smaller universities and intimate settings.  The staff is kind and helpful.  The academics and athletics are competitive.
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, the school does everything it can to help you make friends by throwing parties, events, and get togethers. It's a small campus so it does give a family atmosphere. The only thing is that leadership and the worship team is a big thing around campus and be sometimes be cliquey."
Sophomore,4,"I've been an online student at Southeastern University for the past year. It has been a good experience! I wasn't always satisfied with the limited time to complete assignments, nor was I always satisfied with the content of the courses offered. However, I've enjoyed the interaction, though limited, with professors and students. I've learned a lot and grown a lot!"
Freshman,4,"the southeastern campus is beyond beautiful, with gorgeous oak trees everywhere you look. On this campus everyone knows everyone even just a little bit. Sports is like a mandatory thing, if your not going than your all alone because everyone is at the game."
Junior,4,My overall experience has been great. I have excelled more under this program than ever before in college or high school.
Junior,4,"I really love the atmosphere at Southeastern University! They do a great job at creating an environment for students to put themselves out there and be who they want, while still maintaining an excellent range of academic with teachers who know your name and care."
Senior,4,"The professors and staff are definitely my favorite part of the university, other than the fact that it’s gorgeous. I would say the chapel services need work, you’re required to go but it’s always so packed."
Junior,4,The people there are so friendly! I think the only thing that I would like to change is maybe hire more people in the financial aid and advising office so that they can get back to you in a reasonable amount of time without getting flustered.
Sophomore,4,"The university is Christ-centered, which is important. The teaching aligns with Christianity. The professors are willing to help in any way. The campus is beautiful. I am only giving a four star rating due to the cost of tuition."
Freshman,4,"Great experience, friendly people and environment. Get a chance to experience several mission trips and study abroad in different countries. The professors are genuine and actually try to get know you and invest in your life. There are weekly group meetings you get assigned in and you have to open up and get to know other people your age and have people pray for you and pour into your life. Very beautiful scenery, with a nice tropical feel."
Freshman,4,"I like that this school is a great community brought together by Jesus Christ. With such an inviting and friendly atmosphere, you can be comfortable in your own skin and grow in wisdom and your relationship with Christ."
Freshman,4,Southeastern was welcoming and fun. The teachers are really nice. They really care about you. The campus is beautiful! Everyone loves helping out.
Freshman,4,"There is so much opportunity at Southeastern! The campus is extremely diverse and successfully making an effort to connect with the generations coming into the college. The bathrooms in the Bethany Hall are extremely clean and upkept, especially for a dorm bathroom."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Southeastern for the past two years has been filled with challenges, but also a lot of growth. The challenges have come from simply being a freshman and trying to see where you fit in and going through the ups and downs of those experiences. But without those challenges I couldn't have grown, and Southeastern is such a great place for that. You can find people and staff that genuinely care about you and will help you. The professors here are also great. They are relate able, and overall care for you."
Sophomore,4,"There is a lot of positives but SEU has a lot of flaws. First would be the chap credit system. 30 may not seem like a lot, 
But just you try balancing out that, plus work, plus school, plus whatever else a d the fee is 25$ per missed chapel. That's not a good Christian message."
Freshman,4,"Southeastern University is a world where God is endlessly moving. He is present in all of your moments. The professors are out of this world knowledgable and not just about what they teach, but about God Himself. The campus is gorgeous and not far from the beach (living in warm weather is a blessing all in itself)!!! God is Good and Good is God and you wholeheartedly grow in Him here."
Sophomore,4,"Southeastern has been an incredible way for me to grow in my faith and in my academics. The campus is beautiful and the professors are intelligent and invested in their students. I have made so many friends here and the surrounding area is full of unique places that you could only find here in Lakeland! The school is not far from beautiful beaches and Disney World. Tampa is one way, and Orlando is the other, so I enjoy being able to be in the middle of it all. The RA's and RD's will make you feel like family and invite you to many things. You will not have a problem finding things to get involve in either. Overall, this university is amazing and I love it here!"
Sophomore,4,"SEU is amazing! The Christian atmosphere and student body community is one of the best things about the school. The Christian atmosphere is contagious and growth stimulating. They are very welcoming to first time or transfer students. They have a plethora of degree options, but still having that small campus feel. You walk around campus daily seeing familiar faces. At the same time, there are plenty of things to get involved in on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I am an extension site student for Southeastern University (main campus located in Lakeland, FL) and it has been great! I have been able to learn what it means to be involved in ministry at a high-capacity church. In addition, I have consistently been taught on leadership as well as spiritual principles. The professors as well as the site staff are focused on the students' spiritual growth and their fulfilling their specific life callings. If not for this school program, I may not have had as much experience in ministry as I have had up to this point."
Senior,4,"Southeastern University is a great place to be challenged in theological studies. The professors are fantastic and it is obvious that they care about the success of their students. People are always friendly and the campus is beautiful. Sporting events are generally exciting, and the food is better than many other places. Southeastern is not a party school by any means. The environment feels extremely safe, but Southeastern also kind of exists in its own bubble, separate from the real world. I would like to see more engagement in the different cultures both on and off campus as a major improvement."
Freshman,4,"I like it, it's great. The academics are great. I definitely  feel like I'm learning valuable things."
Junior,4,"Southeastern University is a great private school that has a goal of helping students in their education and their faith. The school focuses on students education and greatly encourages hard work and motivation in the classrooms. SEU has come a long way from when it opened, and is continually growing. There are small parts of the school that are frustrating, but overall it is a great college and experience. "
College Senior,4,We have a lot of fun in classes. The professors make clear effort to help us.
College Senior,4,We don't have a lot of problems on campus. Other than your random burglary.
College Senior,4,"The professors care about us as students, as individuals and groups. They ask us how we are and make it known with their behavior how we are valued."
College Senior,4,Everything they do to help and make sure we succeed st everything we do is top notch. They respect us and what we want in our future and where we feel lead to pursue in the future. They work very hard to make sure we are set up for success after we graduate the school.
College Freshman,4,theres always a way t find a job or internship
Junior,2,My main review talks of my online experience. I am an online student. I do not recommend this school.
Junior,2,"One of the worst online programs I have ever seen. In-class is different, but if you are someone who works full-time like I do and doesn't have the ability to be in class, you should consider a different school. I have had many problems with online professors, many of which do not correctly follow the curriculum on SEU and the class. Sometimes that is a good thing because SEU draws up the online curriculums very poorly. Often times the directions differ from the grading rubric. So to get proper directions, always check the rubric. The professors have no accountability because they do not work in Lakeland with SEU. They are all around the country, and sometimes international. I am transferring to Liberty University online in January and am looking forward to it."
Sophomore,2,"THIS IS ONE SCHOOL TO AVOID!!! Once you are admitted you are basically left to fend for yourself. The school entices people to join by citing all the activities and extra curriculum activities but fail to mention how expensive the cost of education and how much you will to have to paid or taken from FAFSA for elective classes that have nothing to do most degrees. I am Christian and love God with all my heart but mandating elective courses that are irrelevant with a college education and that is obtained from church is absurd. In addition if one tries to request a transcript it is denied and a big issue to obtain one. The school actually has a retention department to keep students that want to leave, RIDICULOUS! Staff for the most part are not helpful and calls are seldom answered. Think hard before signing up for this school!!!"
Freshman,2,"Southeastern wasn't really that bad. But, personally I think I felt kind of sterotyped because of the way I looked or how I dressed. Some of the people there are nice but some of them also came off as unapproachable or don’t want to be bothered. So I didn’t have much friends, but I focused on my academics and I did just fine."
Sophomore,2,"It is advertised very well, but once you get here, you realize a lot of what they don't tell you. They especially false advertise the spiritual development on campus. You see these big events, well that is all they are, hype. The sermon will be 20 minutes the pastor talking about himself, and 5 minutes actually about the bible. You will hear ""Can I get an Amen?!"" more than you will God's name. If you want fun, come to SEU! But if you actually want to grow deeper in your faith, go anywhere else."
Niche User,2,Lovely people but the campus was quite small. I visited and had a lovely tour guide but did not like the old Floridian style of the campus as I am from Massachusetts. Some of the dorms were quite old.
College Sophomore,2,We do not have a Greek life.
College Sophomore,2,They take in far too many students during fall semester. This creates an overpopulated Campus
College Sophomore,2,Living on campus for one year I have experienced two lockdowns. The first one was during the summer when only a handful of students were living on campus and we had no idea what to do. There was a guy with a gun on campus and we just stayed in our dorms thats it.
College Sophomore,2,I lived on campus for two semesters and ended appealing to live off campus because of issues I was facing with my RA and RD. I was being bullied and actually lived in a hotel for two weeks and the school didn't see the situation as harmful. But the housing itself are beautiful and nice.
College Sophomore,2,You are basically on your own.
College Sophomore,2,"Honestly, the girls and guys here all think they are better than those who have jobs on campus and need to work in life to actually go to school. Most are privileged and take pride in the Lord and themselves, many are fake too. In a year of being there I found maybe one genuine person there. Mostly the guys and girls there are concerned with God, Looks, and Money. It is actually pretty sad and I feel bad for both genders when they graduate college and have to enter the real world instead of living in their fantasy bubble where mommy and daddy take care of them, but then again unfortunately since they are so privileged they probably will be taken care of their whole lives. ***BOTTOM LINE- IF YOU DO NOT HAVE LOTS OF MONEY, DRESS UP EVERYDAY OR ENJOY COFFEE OR BEING A HIPSTER. GOOD LUCK FINDING A RELATIONSHIP OR EVEN A FRIEND."
College Sophomore,2,Need more fun school parties and get together.I am a football player and from what I hear are the parties on game day for the students are awesome.....Maybe a luau or Toga party something that can bring the students together like the football games
College Freshman,2,"Not a whole lot of parties here, it's part of the rules"
College Freshman,2,I haven't heard of any internship opportunities at all. Have fun hunting for a job after graduation
College Freshman,2,Driving to Wendy's or McDonald's is the closest and most popular options. Brain food. Yum
College Freshman,2,Not sure if they're understaffed or just don't like to work much but they take forever to get anything done
College Freshman,2,"Rooms are smaller than any other college I have seen. Destino and the girl's dorm across from it isn't bad but the other dorms are basically walk-in closets with air conditioning units in them. On the bright side, the campus is so small that you only have to wake up 5 minutes before your 8am class to get there on time"
College Sophomore,2,"This college is ""dedicated to making great adults"" but does not treat it's students with the responsibility and privilege of letting people under 22 years old live off campus."
College Junior,2,I do not think this schools provides enough financial aid.
College Junior,2,The neighborhoods around the school are subpar
College Freshman,2,So much of a hassle.
College Sophomore,2,"The food is only good when they are special visitors on campus, otherwise its pretty nasty"
College Sophomore,2,"We only have one nurse. We used to have two psychologists, but now we have none."
College Freshman,2,Financial aid won't submit for this school and I got no money at all when I applied to other schools.
College Junior,2,It's very strict and some rules are a little overboard.  I don't drink  so partying is not an issue for me.
College Freshman,2,"I'm not in the minority, so I can't speak from experience, but it is a Christian school. I have never come in contact with an openly gay individual (but many questionable ones haha), and I'm pretty sure we don't even have a democrat club. I would assume that being a LGBT student here would be extremely difficult. As far as ethnic minorities, I think that would be much easier. Our campus looks like a meeting of the United Nations."
College Freshman,2,"The area around the campus isn't exactly nice. I would say that the houses and apartments near campus range from below average to all around sketchy. They had a rule that you aren't allowed to live off campus unless you live with your parents, or until you were 21 or married, but I think that they've relaxed on it a bit since the dorms are overflowing with students. I don't know anyone who lives off campus that doesn't still live at home. Almost everyone stays on campus."
College Student,2,"If you like sports, do not come to this school. The athletics here are terrible. The players on the teams were most likely stars of very small high schools that were bad at sports. Real athletes do not sign with this school. This is the school for scrub athletes. Beyond the sports played here, no one here really even cares about sports in general. The guys here are more into skinny jeans and boots. When important games are on television, no one is watching them or even knows about it. If you're a girl who's into athletic guys, do not come here. The sports here minus well not exist considering no one goes to the games or even knows about them. The teams normally play schools just as bad and the games are painful to watch. The facilities are a joke. My private school in high school that is thirteen years old has much better facilities. There are only two tennis courts, my country club has more than that. The baseball field doesn't even have a club house. There is no track. If you are a serious sports fan, you will feel like an outcast here. I love sports and athletic guys, and I was extremely disappointed."
College Freshman,2,I usually don't enjoy that food.
College Freshman,2,They don't do much of anything. But the safety people are always there.
College Senior,2,"If there was somewhere else that had such a great Education program, I would go there. "
College Senior,2,The wifi login for the school almost never works for a lot of people.
College Senior,2,The bus is confusing and there is almost never any parking. 
College Sophomore,2,"I had a terrible experience my first year on campus.  My financial aid was set, then the financial aid office changed directors and I was left to provide documents that I had already provided multiple times.  It was a lengthy process that was extremely distressing!  It took forever!! N"
College Sophomore,2,They have certain campus traditions like battle of the dorms and the underground. Otherwise to that there aren't much to do unless you gather a group of friends and go off campus.
College Sophomore,2,Southeastern is strict on alcohol use and drug use. But they aren't strict on visitation. Southeastern has rules for visitation and have certain days that boys can go to the girls dorm and vice versa. But they do not I force the rules as much.
College Sophomore,2,I never had an internship as yet  but I would love to have one. I think having an internship will allow me to have a good experience.
College Sophomore,2,The best dorm is Ave the worst dorm is Valencia . Ave is the so much cleaner and newer then Valencia. Ave is about $550 more but it is worth it
College Senior,2,We are not allowed to live off campus unless you are over 22. This eliminates the opportunity for most students.
College Freshman,2,"There is NEVER anywhere to park and you must walk in the dark a mile back to your dorm, not safe at all and scary."
College Senior,2,"SEU is very focused on 'transforming minds, and changing our culture;"" therefore they try to enforce rules to the student body."
College Senior,2,"Financial Aid and scholarships are distributed among our student body equally, but it can be a bit hard to receive such aid, especially in a private school."
College Senior,2,It really doesn't matter if you are involved in any kind of club/sport at Southeastern. They encourage you're participation in all activities and even if you are a commuter or living at the campus the welcome the student to be active in all aspects of the college life.
College Sophomore,2,"Unfortunately I am not eligible for most of the scholarships at Southeastern and with a school that is as expensive as it is I feel that there should be scholarships that reach father than the missions and religion majors. Personally I was only able to apply for an academic scholarship and a grant, so I am fortunate enough to get something!"
College Sophomore,2,Transportation is ok. Transportation for college sudents is free but the buses stop running early and the buses come every hour.
College Sophomore,2,"The campus as a whole is very pretty, but there is not a whole lot to do besides sit in your dorm, sit in mi casa, or sit on a bench unless you have a vehicle and drive somewhere."
College Sophomore,2,"Eh.. not really any night life here at all. Unless you count people going longboarding downtown for hours. 

No parties (at least ""open"" parties that you'll know about). If you're caught drinking alcohol you can get kicked out of school."
College Junior,2,"Internships are pretty much dispensable to those who are willing to go outside of the school and find an internship on their own. It is required your senior year, but so far I haven't encountered much support or resources as far as internships go."
College Sophomore,2,"There's not really any ""well known"" or ""crazy good"" places to eat, just the normal."
College Junior,2,"It's a ""ring by Spring"" deal here at SEU. Girls and guys end up getting engaged or getting married after dating for less than one year."
College Senior,2,"Difficult to Interact – Unless you are living with family, it is difficult to find a safe place to live that is reasonably priced for a college student.  The cheap apartments are in bad neighborhoods.  The school itself communicates very poorly with the students since they want everyone on campus."
College Sophomore,2,transportation is virtually non existent  there is only available for events that that the school is holding because there is everything so called needed on campus but unless we have a car then there is no way to get anything
College Freshman,2,Not a Very Safe Town! Lakeland is a very high crime city. I would not want to live off campus near Southeastern University.
College Freshman,2,"A Little Lacking. . . The campus dining hall is not very good. Sometimes, there is something good, but usually things are very average. The food messes up my digestive system most of the time. I like the cafe food. My only complaint there would be prices, everything is very expensive."
College Freshman,2,It cost me around 200$ every time I want to visit my family. Airports are far away and expensive.
College Junior,2,Southeastern has parking available to students that are distant from classes. Students are constantly complaining about parking tickets and fines. The need for a car on campus is minimal because the campus is so small.Students have to walk from one side of the campus to another in order to find a parking place.
College Junior,2,"Scholarship Opportunities – My freshman year, the scholarships at Southeastern greatly aided my efforts to pay for my tuition and books; my first semester was completely paid for. For my sophomore year, however, the outlook for SEU scholarships is not great. None of the endowed scholarships or grants apply to me, as I am no longer an incoming freshmen. I was disappointed there were no available scholarships for lower classmen that were NOT freshmen."
College Sophomore,2,"Lakeland's options of off-campus dining is like any other city. There are a bunch of chain restaurants along with plenty of fast food places. There are a few places that offer student discounts, but they are sledom and few. The main chain restaurants do not offer student discounts. Southeastern's campus is located at the heart of Lakeland so restaurants are pretty convenient to get to, within down the block to twenty minutes away."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The security on campus is not very effective, however I see improvements being made. Many of the security officers are older men and it does not make me feel very safe. Because it is a Christian school, there are a lot less student initiated problems, which makes me feel safe, however there have been a few incidents of people from the area coming onto campus. I feel that if the administration gave security more training and equipment, I would feel safer."
Niche User,1,"Judy Austin is the reason for this review.  She is, from my experience, a very unethical person and does not mind making false accusations against local businesses in and around the Lakeland, Florida area.  I do understand how a person can accuse a company of a wrong doing without any data to support her accusation.  She needs to re-evaluate her life and what she deems fare and reasonable and retract statements made and shared with others that are and were false.  For a person to have a higher education, she lacks the ethics and morals that should be associated with such intelligence.  She must have a lot of book sense but no common sense nor respect for her neighbors.  Her actions are a reflection of Southeastern hence this review on Southeastern."
Niche User,1,"Racism is apparent; many stereotypes. a lot of hypocrisy and gossiping.  Lakeland is a xenophobic hick town; if you live near the school just go home for the weekend. God is the furthest thing from these people's minds; the only thing they worship is fame and the love of money, and the desire to push others down.  If you are a real Christian, do not come to this school. It's a waste of time and money."
Freshman,1,I enrolled in an extension site for southeastern and I ended up deciding not to attend a few days before class started. I had already made my first payment and contacted them about receiving it back they told me two weeks and it would be refunded. It had now been almost 2 months and they took out a SECOND payment for classes I am not even going to. They are not returning my calls and the keep promising new dates it will be in and I never receive it. I have never had such terrible customer service or greedy for money people to deal with. I will continue to keep contacting them until I receive my money back for classes ivhave never taken. This is absolutely ridiculous and this school needs to work it out. I would not recommend.
Junior,1,"Awful School, lacks diversity, forces you to go to chapels but never has enough room for you to actually sit unless you get there way in advance and then if you don't have enough credits for chapel they charge you for not going. Also maybe if they don't just let students basically work for financial aid and admission and all other departments, things wouldn't get messed up and I wouldn't have had to rush to find loans for 2 different semesters because they messed up my financial aid."
Freshman,1,"I came here because it was the cheapest option for me, after a semester here, the only friends I have made are the ones I already had because I'm from Lakeland. Parking is horrendous. They have taken out half of a dirt lot this week and if you don't want to park a mile from class you need to be here at 8. But they won't address it, they've just began building a welcome building, if there was any building that was never needed, it's that. My only challenging class is philosophy, and that's because I don't pay attention or read the required books. The only reason I'm still here is because I feel stuck."
Niche User,1,Religion isn't really  taught in chapel. It's just about abiding by the seu rules. It's not very religious.
Freshman,1,"What a joke. I went here for a semester and was stunned that a university can lie so well. It’s all about connections, and knowing people. Also they want your money so they can say that their the fastest growing private school. The only good thing is the weather."
College Senior,1,I feel like just another number
College Student,1,We don't have Greek life
College Sophomore,1,"I don't think Greek life is a good thing for colleges, personally why I decided to attend a school without one."
College Freshman,1,I don't believe there is any on the campus.
College Sophomore,1,the athletics at SEU are very rude and think the world is owed to them.
College Sophomore,1,very hard to get any money for struggling students
College Sophomore,1,there are never any parties.
College Freshman,1,"I'm Catholic and apparently I'm going to hell for this. Apparently because I'm not Assemblies of God I am doomed for hell. That's a complete cult mentality. The anti partying/anti fun policies are ridiculous. College is meant to be a time of experimentation and self actualization. Going to this school achieves the exact opposite. A sheltered environment will not prepare you for the real world in the slightest. The prestige of a degree from here is laughable compared to that of FSU or UF. My harsh words are the absolute truth, think hard before enrolling here. I'm getting out ASAP."
College Freshman,1,You have to be 22 to live off campus. The reason is so they can keep you under their radar but it's still ridiculous
College Freshman,1,They're a bunch of hipsters who never had a real college experience of their own or were shunned from their college community so they decided to make their own little society to make themselves fit in. Their outlandish religious views also take away from the potential college student experience. It's like having the strict parents that my parents never were :)
College Freshman,1,"Southeastern University is the worst party school in the state of Florida. Don't believe me? Google ""tamest party schools by state"". There's a difference between control and communism. This school definitely goes overboard with their anti-partying policies"
College Senior,1,We don't have Greek Frats or Sororities. I'm glad we don't.
College Freshman,1,You seriously cannot call them and get a direct answer. I feel like they can never help you. If you ask for help or questions you leave with the same amount of knowledge that you went in with. Theres not one person you can talk to. You have to start with one person and then write a letter to a higher person (that name is still unknown). It sucks.
College Senior,1,I don't party so I'm not sure.  The school is a religious school so alcohol and drugs are not tolerated.
College Sophomore,1,"SEU does not have parties with alcohol and very few parties actually happen. One Big Night is a big event that is ""party-like"" that happens once a year. I like the limited parties because it keeps people focused on their education."
College Sophomore,1,School does not have a Greek Life.
College Sophomore,1,"There is no Greek life here. At all. No sororities or anything. The closest thing would just be the cliques that naturally form. Athletes, student leaders, etc."
College Freshman,1,You need your own car or friends who have cars if you want to get around.
College Freshman,1,Absoluely hate it/its a headache. Support is weak.
College Student,1,"The people here are so weird. I will never date someone from SEU. The people here scare me so bad. I haven't made one friend of the opposite sex at the place. I am legit worried for these people. They are friendly but so fake. There is only one attractive guy on the whole campus and he is of course, taken. The girls here have no style sense and the boys dress like hipsters which I find highly unattractive. The couples here are so gross. I was popular in high school and here I just hide in my dorm."
College Student,1,"NOTHING TO DO. THERE IS NO PARTIES. THE CAMPUS IS A GHOST TOWN AT NIGHT AND THE WEEKENDS. Being here  I have made a total of two new friends and gone home at least seven weekends and the weekends I don't go home, I go to orlando. I haven't experienced a college lifestyle at all. However, I have caught up on at least four TV shows and watched at least 30 movies."
College Student,1,"Lakeland is the meth capital of the world. I come from Fort Lauderdale so maybe I am biased or spoiled. However, there is legit nothing to do here. There is no beach, there is no good restaurants, there is no attractions, and the city is scary. Everything closes at nine. I legit feel so deprived. The only thing I have done here is walked around lakes. I am so depressed here. I feel bad for the people who think this is what Florida is really like. If you want to come to college to experience the Florida you see on TV, with nice beaches, lots to do, and a exciting night life, you will be extremely disappointed in Lakeland."
College Student,1,There is no where in Lakeland any one would want to go anyway to I mean....
College Freshman,1,"No matter how many times student leaders hashtag LKLD on their Instagram pictures, it's not going to make this place cool. It's a very quiet town with almost nothing to do."
College Freshman,1,"There is NOTHING TO DO HERE. I'm from the Miami area, so maybe I'm just spoiled. Publix closes at 9 PM. Make your own judgements. If my friends and I want to do something on a Friday night, we usually just drive 45 minutes away to Downtown Disney. So far, I haven't found much to do in Lakeland other than walk around lakes."
College Freshman,1,"Often times I sit in my dorm room and wonder how in the world all of my stuff fits in here. Literally, my room is so small that you can't even un-bunk the bunk beds. There isn't enough room for two beds to be next to each other- just let that sink in. I share a tiny shoebox of a closet with my roommate. It's basically a battle to pull my clothes out every morning.  Don't even get me started on the community bathrooms. I know that dorms aren't supposed to be penthouses, so I'm trying to not have a complaining spirit, but it's kind of the worst. Living with over 200 girls isn't exactly the ideal situation. Almost every time you open your door you hear someone singing. Yes, singing. I guess this is some sort of college-high-school-musical situation?  The good thing is that we have cleaning ladies that come every weekday morning to clean the bathroom and once a week mop your floors. Also, we don't have to pay for laundry which is a gift from Heaven. It is recommended to live in Bethany or Bauer in your freshman year, and I have seen a lot of girls make friends on the hall. Basically my whole hall is best friends, which is kind of sorority-esque. Personally, it kind of weirds me out. Aventura has way bigger rooms and is an all-around quieter situation, which is what I would do if I was coming back next year. Esperanza is very similar to Ave, but is more expensive and is in higher demand because it is so close to the volleyball courts. Personally, I say save the money and stay in Ave. It's closer to Chartwells (the cafeteria) and classes anyways. If you're really looking for a sorority kind of thing and you love being around people all of the time and don't care about getting any sleep, then Bethany is for you."
College Freshman,1,There is literally no where to park
College Senior,1,They have come a long way but they are still really strict and it affects people like me who only have guy friends who can't come into my suit.
College Sophomore,1,The cost to park at school is $65. Yes the price may seem reasonable but there are never enough parking spaces  at school. The police officers do not give you tickets right away if your doubled park waiting on parking they will just ask you to move.
College Sophomore,1,"There is not much of a night scene here. Sadly, many people do not know how to have a good fun time without alcohol or fornication involvement so everything is just turned down and taboo. There are a couple of activities that the school puts on after dark and they can be fun."
College Freshman,1,There simply isn't much off campus housing in Lakeland.
College Junior,1,Greek life is basically nonexistent at Southeastern.
College Senior,1,"The nightlife at southeastern University is a D.  I say this because it is a Christian school, therefore we are not permitted to go to clubs and house parties.  Nevertheless, Southeastern is also located in lakeland, Florida, a city that doesn't have much nightlife.  If one were to go to my school looking for a party or club they would have to go to near by cities like Tampa and Orlando.  There are public buses and taxi cabs that drive routes all around lakeland, making it easy to get around."

Alum,5,"During my time in school, we used blackboard for assignments and projects. The use of the program was effective."
Alum,5,The experience was incredible. I believe that the rigor of the education prepared me for the real-world.
Niche User,5,"As a recruiter, I can testify to the unbelievable university this is! The firm loves to target Georgetown students and scoops up as many as possible every year. I find that the intellectual and pre-professional culture are two key factors that make Georgetown students superb professionals and leaders. And needless to say, the D.C. location makes it that much better. Can't beat it!"

Freshman,5,Georgetown has been such a fantastic place to learn! I have experienced so much growth. It manages to motivate students whilst being an environment that cares for the whole person.
Niche User,5,"Every Georgetown grad at my firm has impressed me. This school breeds intellectuals, hard workers, and sharp professionals! Excited that my son is choosing Georgetown over the Ivies into which he was also accepted."
Niche User,5,"Excellent academics, faculty, and location. Lead to an incredible undergraduate experience with numerous opportunities off and on campus."
Junior,5,"The atmosphere at Georgetown is lovely, the faculty is wonderful, and the financial aid office has assisted me a great deal. I truly feel like I am constantly learning new things while being in a great area."
Sophomore,5,"Great location, fascinating courses, engaged student body, so many opportunities on the Georgetown campus and the entire DC area. Extremely expensive, but for the opportunities that are afforded to the students here it is well worth it."
Sophomore,5,"Georgetown University embodies the very best a Jesuit education offers, an education that brings people together rather than driving them to compete among one another while still being among the very best offered in the world. If you seek to make the world a better place, no other school better serves that mission than Georgetown University."
Niche User,5,I toured and I loved the environment. Everyone was incredibly welcoming of me and I felt like I was in a place where I could find my passions accompanied by an up and coming city.
Sophomore,5,"Amazing professors and staff. I feel so challenged here and I am so excited to continue attending this institution. If you want to expand your horizons and attend a school that forces you to think deeply and apply your knowledge to the world, go here. The students love to support each other and collaborate to really make it a home."
Senior,5,One of the best experiences one can have. A great university that cares about your success. Professors and Deans will help anyway they can. D.C. can be a bit dangerous though. A+
Niche User,5,Georgetown's location and the campus is a dream for anyone looking to pursue a degree in international affairs. Its connections with the federal government give students opportunities no other university could compare to.
Freshman,5,"This is a fantastic school that truly focuses on educating its students in all ways, both inside and outside of the classroom. The professors are experts in their fields and easy to talk to, the campus is beautiful and the people are smart, caring and focused on changing the world."
Junior,5,"Georgetown is renown for it's educational excellence. Unfortunately, the parking is the biggest problem."
Freshman,5,"Great experience at Georgetown so far. Definitely one of the best options for IR, finance and pre-law"
Graduate Student,5,"I have enjoyed my brief time at Georgetown greatly. It has provided me with great classes and professors, excellent work opportunities, and fun memories."
Niche User,5,I liked the standard of academic excellence offered by Georgetown University.  I only visited the campus as I have not been accepted. I am still in high school  I can not provide what grade.
Alum,5,"I can't say enough good things about Georgetown. Its a great mix of strong academics, great classmates and a fun atmosphere outside of class."
Freshman,5,I love the people overall and the academics. It's definitely tense academically here but it's healthy stress and definitely prepares you well for professional life!
Niche User,5,great experience great teachers and great curriculum. i would go back if i like to further my education in another field.
Freshman,5,"Georgetown University is simply unmatched in its global connections/programs, its extensive list of independent, professional student-run clubs, and its location in DC. I find an education at GU massively rewarding, as classmates are genuinely interested & actively participate while professors truly care about you. Overall, Georgetown students also seem to have a much more work-life balance and know how to take care of themselves. The campus also tolerates a wide range of thoughts."
Niche User,5,I really enjoyed the student environment and community at Georgetown. There really is a place for everyone at Georgetown.
Freshman,5,"I met this really chill dude named George. This is his town. In all seriousness, I am currently a freshman here and am in love with this school. It is one of the best campuses in the country; there aren't many places where you can run into presidential candidates at the gym or while getting lunch. The campus is super close to national tourist attractions. My professors are all geniuses, ranging from nobel laureates to former presidential advisors and war heroes."
Freshman,5,"Wonderful institution, with a beautiful campus, but could have better facilities. In a beautiful area as well, with lots of opportunities around."
Alum,5,"Georgetown was such a great experience for me personally -- I found the professors to truly care about their students and most of the student body was driven, intelligent, and genuine. The only downside is that their on-campus housing is pretty horrendous for what you're supposed to pay, but that is marginal to the education I received."
Junior,5,"Georgetown is an excellent school, and I love attending. It definitely focuses on rigorous research, although sometimes I wish my professors included more hands-on activities. I wish there were more opportunities for project-based grades because most of my grades are based on 1-3 tests a semester, which I do not believe is the best judge of whether someone learned the material."
Niche User,5,I really liked the campus and the energy. The professors are amazing and they are very educated. Many students are driven and know what they are doing. the school is great for liberal arts
Niche User,5,"I went to Georgetown University as a sophomore high school student attending the Young Women's Political Leadership program. I stayed in the campus dorms and shopped and ate in the campus food courts. The food was wonderful and at a fair price, and the dorms were clean, safe, and comfortable."
Junior,5,"Georgetown University is an incredible university with top-notch professors and academic programs. Professors DO seem preoccupied with their research, but most genuinely care about students. Perhaps the most difficult aspect of the university is connected to how pre-professional it is. This can translated to club culture. People are more focused on getting jobs after graduation than most other schools. This is connected to Georgetown's return on investment, however. Well worth coming!"
Alum,5,I graduated my MA in Policy Management from GU in 2014. I can say that Georgetown University is a very good school for all. Come and see.
Junior,5,Georgetown has a School of Continuing Studies that is specifically designed for working non-traditional students. The program has excellent professors and the variety of curriculum that prepares students like me for different high level careers.
Alum,5,"The most compelling undergraduate experience in the country, combining top academics, premier location, unlimited social, academic, research and professional opportunities, an active and diverse student body, top-notch and experienced faculty, and strong community."
Niche User,5,"The campus atmosphere is amazing. There could not be a better location for the college. There are so many place to get food, groceries, clothes, or anything you need. Right next to the nation's capital, it is a very history rich city."
Freshman,5,"Georgetown has its fair share of ups and downs. The religious aspects of the college are surprising really low-key and very relaxed- the most its 'super apparent' is that you have to take two theology courses as apart of your core, but they're really diverse and stimulating. The club culture may seem overwhelming to new students, but you'll find your niche in no time. 
The food on campus... Is hit or miss(I guess they never miss huh?). While there's sadly only one dining hall on campus, its not too bad.
Dorm life is great. And no, Darnall Hall is not THAT bad.
You'll work hard here, for sure. But you're not alone and most of the professors are understanding so long as you communicate with them."
Alum,5,"I really loved the area and the opportunities. I also enjoyed getting to study abroad. The student housing is the one thing that wasn't as nice, given the high tuition cost. Overall, it was a really positive experience."
Freshman,5,Great academics and definitely very knowledgable faculty. Professors in your department will support you through almost everything and are very helpful if you ask for any support. Facilities sub-par because it's a rather old school
Senior,5,"I have had a very formative Georgetown undergraduate experience. People here are driven but also unafraid to have fun, and my peers and professors are always challenging me. Campus life is vibrant and it's difficult to be bored."
Niche User,5,"I went on a campus tour over the summer to Georgetown University. I was not sure whether or not I would like it, but once I stepped foot onto its beautiful campus I fell in love. Its location in Washington D.C. is very appealing because of the vast amount of internships students who go to this school are offered. Being in a big city, the school still manages to maintain a smaller campus atmosphere. It has great resources, a great campus, and a great vibe."
Freshman,5,Georgetown University has an excellent campus and culture. It has many opportunities for every student that attends.
Graduate Student,5,"The School of Foreign Service has provided me with unparalleled academic and professional opportunities I would not have been provided at any other university given its location and prestige. From interning at the White House, Capitol Hill, and a top consulting firm — all while being a full time student — to its rigorous core curriculum, my program time here has been hands down the zenith of my academic career.

While I was accepted into other top universities, Georgetown SFS was a no brainer, and I’m excited to call myself an SFS alum."
Niche User,5,"In my time spent at Georgetown, I have observed the mindset of the students; each one is dedicated to growing as a person, is always intellectually insatiable and is willing to invest in others. They represent the ultimate coalition of people-oriented people, servant-leaders, and diversified-unity."
Sophomore,5,"Georgetown University was my number one choice because unlike other prestigious universities, Georgetown offers and inclusive and cooperative environment. The school not only emphasizes academics, but also there is a focus on student involvement and pursuing one's interests. Coming from a competitive high school, Georgetown helped reduce my anxiety because the community is very supportive and offers adequate resources and networking opportunities to succeed."
Niche User,5,"It’s my dream university, It has excellent medical program, good education.
, And it’s  always clean,  they always help students who aren’t not able to pay money to attend this university, it’ A safe place to go especially if you put your mind for to study and you know that you’re going over for to study."
Junior,5,My experience as an undergraduate at Georgetown University has been amazing! I love the university's commitment to investing in each individual student and enriching their academic experience. Georgetown is also intentional about increasing the diversity of the student body and faculty. There is a club or organization for everyone on campus.
Freshman,5,"As an incoming freshman, my experience with Georgetown so far has been wonderful! The pre-academic year advising and support from all departments in the administration is comprehensive, and the current students who have connected with us to provide advice have made Georgetown feel like home already."
Graduate Student,5,Georgetown University is a great school in a fantastic location with respected and inspiring faculty in many subject areas.
Sophomore,5,"After my first year here, I'm absolutely certain that Georgetown is the place for me. Because social -- and often intellectual -- life centers around student organizations, I've had the chance to meet people who share my passions. In lieu of Greek life, student organizations host parties that foster a sense of community that centers around something deeper than hazing or a few Greek letters. The professors are caring and encourage you to think for yourself. Another thing I want to emphasize is the effect of Jesuit values. I was hesitant about them coming in because I'm not religious, but Georgetown doesn't shove religion down your throat. Rather, the school makes a concerted and largely successful effort to instill Jesuit values into all aspects of the community, such as the values of empathy, care, and intellectual risk-taking."
Senior,5,"Georgetown wasn't my first choice college, but I'm very glad that I ended up here and would so it all over again if I could. Although it's far from perfect, it has everything that's really important at the end of the day. Great academics, beautiful city, and stellar people."
Alum,5,"Georgetown opened the world for me. Great location, great professors, and amazing classmates. Awesome university!"
Junior,5,"Georgetown is amazing. It gives you the best of both worlds: a vibrant  campus community, and access to one of the world's most influential cities. While Georgetown's amenities are relatively poor, their education is world-class. Join clubs, your social life will largely revolve around them. Get to know your professors, they are leading scholars in their fields, and simply brilliant."
Freshman,5,Georgetown University is a beautiful campus surrounded by many opportunities as it is in the heart of Washington D.C. It's Walsh School of Foreign Service is second to none and is a great place to pursue international affairs and many more areas as well.
Alum,5,I truly loved Georgetown as an undergraduate student and I am returning to get my masters in the fall! I studied physics and had very small classes. I was able to develop close relationships with my professors and peers in the department. I also loved Georgetown's core curriculum that forced me into classes I didn't think I would enjoy but ended up loving!
Sophomore,5,The culture in the business school isn't great but overall the school has been a phenomenal experience
Alum,5,"The Catholic Ivy League School.  Student are taught by Secretaries of State, former Cabinet members and ambassadors.   Washington DC’s most selective and favorite university."
Senior,5,Love my major and the uniqueness/specificity of study options at georgetown. The 4 school culture is singular in its effectiveness and developing certain interests
Freshman,5,"Beautiful campus, teachers who are passionate about their subjects, and incredible city / surrounding area to explore. The social scene is centered about on campus clubs and student groups rather than Greek Life."
Sophomore,5,"Georgetown is an amazing school!! Yes, the atmosphere can be very stressful and competitive, but you will meet some of the best people. If you focus on pursing what you love, you will be met with so many opportunities."
Sophomore,5,Academic resources are great the internal portal should be more student friendly and consolidated. The classes are very interactive  and engaging and you do learn quite a bit . It is my hope that cost to attend be brought to an affordable measure as it stands right now there is constant stress as to how to pay tuition let alone books and overall coat of living. A good education should come unreasonably priced especially for those adult learners wanted to improve their lives through education.
Junior,4,"Georgetown is definitely a place you go to for the name and for the quality of the professorial staff, NOT for the amenities or the diversity. Its a great place to learn and the connections you can make are invaluable. The food and a majority of the housing is abysmal: mice, cockroaches, mold everywhere. Economic diversity is almost nonexistent, but racial diversity is a little better. Definitely am enjoying my time at Georgetown, but I do wish that I had applied to a few Ivies or potted Ivies on the same level as Georgetown just to see what I might be missing at other Universities."
Freshman,4,"The school is perfect for anyone with the slightest bit of interest in politics. Sure, the bureaucracy gets in the way sometimes, but Georgetown is also full of passionate students and professors who dedicate their lives to living out the values of the school."
Freshman,4,professors tried their best to be accessible as possible. online learning is more of an adjustment for the student than for the professor.
Senior,4,"Very amazing experience! The school could be offering more resources to support students, however my peers and professors are incredible"
Junior,4,"Georgetown is my favorite place to be. I would've given it 5 stars, however recent events of the cancellation of in person class for sophomores and juniors has changed by mind. As a student at GU, there is much to say about the community and togetherness that Georgetowns atmosphere offers The location of Georgetown in a quaint beautiful area, as well as, in the heart of the country is beyond compare."
Freshman,4,Obviously learning online is different than learning on campus. It  has some immediate drawbacks but the professors were quick to adjust and I felt confident that they were going to make sure I was learning as efficiently as possible.
Freshman,4,"I love all of the great people I have gotten to meet while at Georgetown, people from North Dakota, Spain, Vietnam, and so many other places. The food...well it is there. The classes, for the most part, have been great and I feel that I have and am learning a lot."
Niche User,4,I spent the summer at georgetown doing one of the immersion programs. Over my time here I quickly realized that all the other students are driven and hard working but also play hard. My whole experience was good and I learned a lot. We stayed in the upperclassmen dorms which were really nice.
Niche User,4,"When I visited Georgetown University, it was a beautiful place. The campus was very big and wide, and the classrooms seemed like a great place in which learning could be facilitated. The hallways were wide, and I liked how nothing was densely packed."
Alum,4,"Great school. High quality professors, class sizes are small, and there are always great speakers on campus (presidents, vice presidents, congressmen, senators, presidential candidates, attorney generals, etc). The only negative about Georgetown University is their premedical advising, especially when it comes to first-generation and minority students."
Junior,4,Georgetown University is a premier academic institution with amazing faculty and exceptionally bright students. Many students are interested in domestic politics and international affairs however there are also pockets of students who engage in the arts.
Niche User,4,Georgetown is like a salad of all desirable traits a college may have. The academic rigor is there and abundantly so. The athletics are competitive and spirited throughout the entire student body. The diversity infiltrates campus and the community surrounding it.
Junior,4,"As a current junior at Georgetown, I can safely say that I am still in love with the campus as much as I was during my freshman year. The teachers have such profound, impressive backgrounds; the academics are rigorous; there are diverse communities and numerous communities with which students can identify. The Jesuit values are also very well incorporated into everyday campus life. The only thing that does need to be addressed are this: prioritization of mental health and facility maintenance. The administration does not truly invest into these two areas as much as they claim, and as a result, it has a negative impact on the physical, emotional, and psychological wellbeing of the student body. Moreover, the security of the campus is subpar - especially considering the geographic location of the campus."
Niche User,4,"When I went on a college visit this year, Georgetown University looked like an amazing campus. All of the students looked so energetic and I can tell that there is such a great community-type environment on campus. It seems like such a great school and it would be a dream come true to go there."
Sophomore,4,"So far my experience at Georgetown has been amazing because I was finally able to find people with similar passions for social justice and educational work. While in high school, I often had to shelter my interests, and so I settled on playing sports and building relationships solely off of playing pick up basketball. However, once I got to campus I was able to make meaningful and deeper connections with people who I had never encountered in high school. Together we push ourselves to achieve our dreams and become the best versions of ourselves in order to attempt to make a difference in this country."
Sophomore,4,"Thus far during my experience at Georgetown, I have thoroughly enjoyed being surrounded by such intelligent, thoughtful, and curious individuals. Whether they are students or professors, each and every person at Georgetown is incredibly bright and pushes you to strive for better. Additionally, the campus setting in the charming DC Georgetown neighborhood is simply unparalleled among other universities. Here, you have a distinctly unique combination of being in a city that offers a wide array of interesting and distinctive opportunities while enjoying all the social and academic aspects of collegiate life."
Junior,4,"I am a rising Junior at Georgetown University and have had a great time. Georgetown boast a diverse and interesting list of classes that range from the basics of religion to hands on biology research experience. Georgetown also has many student led clubs for students with a variety of interests and hobbies. There are performing arts groups, service organizations, eating/cooking societies, social justice clubs, and much more so that anyone can find a home in the hilltop. Those who wish to find something to do on the weekends can find many activities in Georgetown and the surrounding DMV area. In Georgetown alone there are movie theaters, bowling alleys, escape rooms, bike paths, boat houses, bars, and restaurants to entertain students and residents. All in all, Georgetown offers a knowledgeable and enjoyable college experience."
Graduate Student,4,I really like the professors and environment at this school. I think they can invest a bit more into their facilities but overall it's a very nice school and DC is a great area.
Graduate Student,4,"I will be attending Georgetown in Fall 2019, and I couldn't be more excited. I believe my experience will propel my professional career, but also allow me to grow personally. The brand name of Georgetown, along with the mission and vision of the school are two things that I value about the institution."
Junior,4,I wish that there was more diversity on campus. I also wish that there was more advice on careers that were not restricted to Finance and Consulting.
Alum,4,Georgetown offered many opportunities to learn from fantastic professors and engage in interesting research.
Niche User,4,The university is in the middle of one of the biggest cities in the United States so that means you have access to a lot of different cultural experiences which are a great way to round off a college experience.
Niche User,4,"I have had a wonderful experience attending Georgetown University through a summer program for high school students and through the application process as an incoming undergraduate student. Georgetown is located in a fantastic and charming neighborhood of Washington, DC with plenty to do, see, and eat."
Graduate Student,4,"When I'm on the main campus, the undergraduate students a bit of a preppy, entitled vibe that I dislike. Granted, I may just be being judgmental as I have had pretty little actual interaction with them. But,  in my experience, the graduate students, for the most part, are diverse, supportive of each other and down to earth,"
Senior,4,"Georgetown's greatest strength is the student body. They are the ones that have knowledge on campus about the best way to access resources. While many resources exist at Georgetown to help students, they do not advertise them in any way so it is left to students to help connect each other to them. The various centers on campus connect students with jobs and internships in sectors as varied as community organizing to internships at government agencies."
Junior,4,"I think Georgetown is an amazing school for creating connections, recruiting incredible professors, and exposing students to a diverse set of ideas and values.  However, I would like Georgetown to focus more accommodating student's needs and to lower the tuition."
Junior,4,"As an undergraduate and a young adult, Georgetown is situated in the perfect place to experience life on your own for the first time. It is a welcoming environment and the students are so nice and inviting. Something I would like to see changed about Georgetown is the career development and outreach program. The career center is, unfortunately, not extremely helpful when students are looking for internships or job opportunities in the workforce."
Graduate Student,4,"Georgetown is a great place to attend for graduate degrees in International Affairs, the network of alumni and professors are valuable as are the courses offered."
Junior,4,"I really love the campus and the city atmosphere! You get a lot of breaks because it is a catholic university but that's good! The work load is heavy so make sure its something you can handle. Worth it in the end, you will most likely get a job right out off school."
Senior,4,"Social life and student culture completely centers on extra-curricular clubs and organizations. Students are required to live on campus for 3 years and most of the on-campus housing is older and not well maintained. Educational opportunities are incredible - incredible professors, visiting speakers, and the opportunity to use DC as a resource for coursework. There are very few bars near campus, so social life is generally on campus or in another neighborhood."
Freshman,4,"Georgetown is a great school. Despite drawbacks which are found on other campuses, such as mediocre food, aging infrastructure, and competitive club life, it is possible for every student to find their niche and have a fantastic time as a Hoya."
Graduate Student,4,"My overall experience at Georgetown has been positive given the rigorous curriculum and high standards of academic performance have provided a stimulating learning environment. This said, I believe Georgetown could really stand to encourage more critical thinking and adopt strategies to make its student and faculty bodies more diverse, because many classrooms have tended to resemble echo chambers at times. Less significantly but still important: I think the amenities and prepared food options available on and around campus are really lacking. What is available is not affordable and the majority of these options are not catered to those who are health conscious."
Freshman,4,Georgetown George sounds a lot of fun but it’s also a lot of work the athletic division part of it was not the most when it could’ve been in fact the football team at one and two but overall I would say door so I was a great place to be is long as you’re not trying to play football
Freshman,4,"Studying at GU is a very pleasant experience. The university provides fascinating courses taught by leading professors. But the school and Georgetown community is EXTREMELY expensive, so it is hard to budget. The city of Washington DC is expensive generally, as well."
Junior,4,Georgetown is a bit pricey but it offers world class professors and opportunities. The campus is beautiful but the dorm situation is poor. Some dorms are new and some are as old and rundown.
Sophomore,4,"I love the diversity of course offerings and the high caliber of professors. However, the food isn't the most tasty and varied little. Certain dorms are older and more broken down than others, creating inequality among dorm residents."
Freshman,4,"Georgetown University has a beautiful campus and stellar academics that make it a wonderful place to study. The town itself is quiet yet lively enough to make for a good place to go out on weekends. The only issue I have found with the school is that the websites and technological aspects of the program can be difficult to navigate, but these should be improving in future years."
Sophomore,4,"I like the opportunities that are available at Georgetown University. In fact, employers often times recruit directly on campus. The professors are intelligent, engaging, and passionate, they really want to see you succeed. Georgetown's dining halls and dorms could be improved and they are actually starting work on those two items over the summer. Another thing that I wish was different about Georgetown is that there are very few traditions,  most of student life is focusing on academics, sometimes a little to much."
Freshman,4,"While Georgetown is a great school academically, there are several aspects of life on campus that are not as amazing."
Freshman,4,"It's been fun so far, I've really been able to be challenged academically while also expanding and learning about myself socially. Great academics and social life make for a memorable college experience. "
College Freshman,4,It is gorgeous. They could offer more to graduate students.
College Freshman,4,Interest in men's basketball is intense
College Sophomore,4,"Thankfully the medical housing process was not difficult and I was able to score appropriate housing for next year. Overall, the dorms are taken care of very well and located close to classes."
College Sophomore,4,The gym on campus is superb and school spirit is an integral part of being a Hoya.
College Sophomore,4,"Despite having a difficult time with the initial adjustment period, Georgetown has provided me with a number of invaluable experiences and opportunities that I am more than certain will adequately prepare me for the future."
College Junior,4,The course offereings are great. One thing I'm not a fan of is our pre-registration. It seems pointless and Georgetown is the only school that still does this.
College Junior,4,Georgetown's sexual assualt prevention programs and self-defenses class provided by campus are great. Our police department is ok.
College Junior,4,"Like all universities, the dorms have their pros and cons. Overall, I would recommend staying on campus."
College Freshman,4,"The alumni network is very helpful and are willing to aid students who are qualified, passionate applicants."
College Freshman,4,"I have always felt very safe on campus, no matter what time it is."
College Freshman,4,"Students are passionate and driven, and professors encourage them to reach their full potential."
College Sophomore,4,"It's very easy to get a Job, and alumni are always willing to help."
College Sophomore,4,"The professors have amazing Backgrounds, great opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,"not only do we learn, but we experience the real world."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm somewhat worried that I won't be as desirable without a Master's degree. Also, employers in this city have a bad habit of expecting interns to work for nothing."
College Sophomore,4,"I have my issues, mostly with the quality of my terribly dorm, but I love being here."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel like the risk of sexual assault is somewhat overstated compared to the number of actual instances of assault, but the safer environment is worth it."
College Sophomore,4,"Like every college, there are good and bad professors."
College Senior,4,"Georgetown is an amazing school that provides a breadth of opportunities and a strong system of support for any type of needs whether it be academic, financial, or psychological."
College Freshman,4,Greek life has very little influence on the campus
Senior,2,"Real tough -- abrupt switch, however professors were lenient. Grading schemes were inequitable and felt based more on how well equipped one is at home with resources than academic skill."
Freshman,2,"If you are someone who is fascinated by the humanities or liberal arts—be that literature, anthropology, or astrophysics—Georgetown may be a difficult place to feel at home. Understand that if you value the intellectual pursuit writ large, love discussing ideas and questions with friends outside the classroom, Georgetown may not be the best place for you. If you are an explorer at heart, and someone who seeks the path less traveled, understand that Georgetown students are largely conformists—they have frankly, chosen to view college as a time to fortify their path to that coveted position at Morgan Stanley.

If you identify with a public school background, or express yourself as a creative individual through clothing, hobbies, music, etc., understand that Georgetown will resemble an alien world of Exeter (or Deerfield, or Riverdale, or Andover...) sweatshirts and vineyard vines, amalgamating into one frustrating, relentlessly vanilla, pre-professional mass. Proceed with caution."
Graduate Student,2,"I am currently enrolled in their master's program in program and portfolio management. I am not impressed with the quality of the instructors, especially for such high tuition rates. Our last two courses were basically mirror images of each other, with one instructor hardly present and never responding to questions. The other instructor never realized who his students were.....accomplished professionals with many years of experience. If I had to do over again, I would have  never enrolled at Georgetown University."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not an official scene, but there is an unofficial one."
College Sophomore,2,My down was absolutely terrible.
College Junior,2,Students tend to have a lot of expendable income which they use to gain access to drugs and alcohol. It is hard to have a social life if you are turned off by being around drugs and alcohol.
College Junior,2,"Georgetown doesn't have any official frats or sororities, but there are a few of them."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is not officially recognized by the campus, but a fair part of the student population attends parties and activities thrown by fraternities or sororities."
College Freshman,2,"Pretty poor. No football, Basketball is mediocre."
College Freshman,2,"I have found a lot of success here, but this is not a place where I am happy. I will get a decent education for a hefty price and find a fairly comfortable job and upper middle class lifestyle. Don't look for earth-shattering experiences here."
College Freshman,2,Georgetown is remarkably exclusive and socially dead. There is very little diversity in academic programs here. The campus and facilities are simply not good. This school has a long way to go.
College Freshman,2,There is not much Greek life due to it being a Jesuit school.
College Sophomore,2,"Party scene is pretty quiet, unless you're a member of the few exclusive clubs that frequently throw parties but are very competitive to join."
College Sophomore,2,The buildings are old and outdated. Maintenance is also very slow and unresponsive to issues that arise frequently. Mice are a frequent problem in the apartment style housing.
College Senior,2,"There's only one dining hall, and it's terrible. The food is not consistent at all, one day you'll eat a decent meal and the next you'll feel like throwing up. Since there is only one dining hall, it would be wise to allow students to use meal swipes in the food court and on-campus restaurant, but for some reason this is not allowed."
College Senior,2,"There aren't many options for food off-campus unless you go way off campus into another part of DC. In the vicinity of the school, options include Chipotle (a student favorite), Subway, Thai food places, salad places, a dingy Chinese food place, pizza places, and a sandwich shop or two. Despite the average quality of the food, prices are rather expensive simply because Georgetown is an expensive neighborhood."
College Sophomore,2,"Facilities are pretty crappy. I would say that's the one downside to this school. Our gym sucks- it's small, stuffy, and pretty outdated. I've seen high school gyms much more impressive. Our library is constantly being ranked as one of the ugliest buildings in the country, built in the brutalist style, and it's incredibly depressing looking. There's barely any green space, as we are a city campus and therefore very compact. There aren't many places to just hang out other than in a friend's room. 

They are working to improve all of this though. A new gym is being built, a new student center was just opened, and renovations are being done to the library. Let's hope campus is a lot more beautiful come next fall."
College Freshman,2,The university doesn't officially recognize any fraternities or sororities. Those that exist aren't especially relevant.
College Freshman,2,"New university policy is that only seniors can live off-campus, which is in itself a pain. Most that I know live in townhouses or apartments within a half mile or so of campus."
College Junior,2,"This is not a greek-life school, which I personally enjoy."
College Sophomore,2,"Not too well-versed on this, but I'm being required to answer, so I'll say what I do know: It's pretty expensive and you usually have to know who you want to live with one year in advance."
College Freshman,2,"For international students, scholarships aren't good. In fact, I did not get any financial aid at all. I called and sent letters, but unfortunately that didn't boost my chances."
College Senior,2,It's very difficult to find just a little bit of high-quality food.  The focus is on lots of poor-quality food.
College Senior,2,"As a grad student, the grad campus is terrible for on-site dining. There are plenty of options nearby though. The main campus has reasonable on-campus options, but nothing that is especially great"
College Sophomore,2,To park at Georgetown costs $20 for the day and finding a metered spot in DC generally is difficult and expensive.
College Sophomore,2,"No official greek life here (because of Jesuit identity), but there are a few unrecognized fraternities. The consensus tends to be that greek parties are unimpressive, and that the frat members themselves don't exactly compensate, if you will."
College Sophomore,2,"No bones about it; DC parking is some of the worst you'll encounter. That being said, almost nobody has a car at school and you'll find that just about everything you need is within reasonable walking distance. If you do need to park, however, make sure you've got the correct permits and/or have paid the parking fee -- the D.C. parking patrol is ruthless."
College Junior,2,Parking is terrible. An even larger problem is that we do not have nearly enough resources for getting around DC.
College Freshman,2,"The specific dorm I am in is not a good dorm. It has not been renovated in many years, it is too small, and has only one perk."
College Freshman,2,Diversity in terms of race/ethnicity is not good here. It sometimes seems as if only Caucasian or European students attend.
College Senior,2,"All international and transfer students seem to get placed in the worst dorm (village c east). The campus is predominantly white students with a ton of money. The number of CEO children or royalty children here is excessive. People throw down money on clothes and designer items like you can't imagine. It's hard to keep up with sometimes and quite shallow. It makes those without money feel self conscious. Also there are lots and lots of LGBTQ community members at this school, so if that's your thing you'll definitely find a place here."
College Freshman,2,"There's maybe 6 or 8 different fraternities. No dedicated houses but brothers will use their own housing to host social events. Some serve a higher purpose but most are social. Big ones are SigEp, SAE, AKPsi (business frat), and Zeta Psi is up and coming. Fraternity brothers kind of do their own thing aside from parties ..."
College Student,2,"If you are not financially-dependent, there is no financial need for this school."
College Junior,2,Garages are expensive. Off campus spots fill up quickly and are short term meter spots. Walk or take the bus. Driving isnt the most feasible or economic option.
College Junior,2,"While fairly reasonably priced, the food is usually not very good but at least it's all you can eat! "
College Freshman,2,"While the school has great security officers and a helpful safe ride system, there are literally like two blue lights here and most student guards will let anyone into the dorms.  Also the buses run on reduced times on the weekeneds so you end up walking across the key bridge at night, often alone."
College Junior,2,"Finding affordable, quality housing in D.C. is a well-known quagmire. It can be difficult to find housing that is reasonably close to campus as well as in a good neighborhood."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't much of a variety off-campus and most of them are costly. A few stay open late on the weekends, but other than that you'll have to fend for yourself."
College Sophomore,2,"Drugs are known to be on campus. However, it's not visible because of low tolerance policy enforced by the DPS. Drinking is more noticeable."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty Hard to Get Into School but Easy to Choose a Major – To get into Georgetown, I had to submit a separate application form that required three essays. Also, the process was very competitive. However, the process of getting into my Neurobiology major was relatively easy. Once I was accepted to school, I just enrolled in Biology classes and eventually declared my major during my second year. To declare, you had to write an essay detailing your plans over the next four years and turn it in to your adviser."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Waitlists Are No Fun – I was initially put on the waitlist for my program. This was 4-5 months before school started. I was notified of my acceptance into the program only 1 month before classes. I do understand the nature of the waitlist is that you are only granted admission if a spot becomes available, so I do know that this was slightly unavoidable, but it did leave me rushing to get paperwork and things ready to go. Also, my class options were VERY limited because of the late registration."
College Junior,2,"Housing is very expensive in DC. Most of the apartments I looked at were for young professionals, which wasn't exactly the atmosphere I was looking for as a college student."
College Freshman,2,"Variety of Color...But That's About It – So Georgetown has made this big deal about being an economically and ethnically diverse school, and it's apparent in the different types of people you see...but diversity basically stops there. People tend to have the same personality and fashion sense, so it makes an otherwise scenic and enjoyable stroll about campus boring."
College Freshman,2,"General Campus and Library – The general campus is seriously lacking in adequate learning spaces. Besides the newest additions to the university such as the MSB, I feel that several of the classroom's have desks that are too small or climates that lack proper temperature management. The library is also not up-to-date and not large enough. One of my biggest burdens is often finding a place to study in the library. The study cartels are relatively small too."
Recent Alumnus,2,Many students do not leave the Georgetown neighborhood because of the cushy setting it provides. This creates a bubble that prevents the diversity of DC from having a presence on campus.
College Freshman,2,"More Self-Segregated Than It Should Be – On paper, Georgetown's diversity isn't that bad. In practice... people tend to hang out with their own race. Everyone's amicable, but I've never seen anything like it. It's definitely worse than it should be for a school of this reputation. There's also a huge gap between rich kids and those on financial aid... not a lot of middle ground."
College Freshman,2,"In the SFS, a lot of people are *not very nice* to put it lightly and slightly snobbish. The core curriculum is really strict and lacks variety. But of course, Georgetown SFS can be great if you are fully committed to IR and have no interest in pursuing anything else."
College Sophomore,2,Georgetown is an expensive place and parking is limited in any city. Don't count on parking to be easy here.
College Freshman,2,"One Drinks, They All Drink – To my surprise I was shocked when I saw how many people drink at georgetown. I didn't think people would flaunt it so openly, especially on the weekends. But it happens, and it's prevalent."
College Senior,2,"Forget Merit – Everyone who gets accepted is smart enough to qualify for merit scholarships. For this reason, Gtown doesn't offer any. If you're an athlete, you stand a chance. Otherwise, forget it. We don't have the endowment."
College Sophomore,2,"Pretty Bad but Not Always Necessary – If you're willing to pay the $10 for the parking garage under the Southwest Quad, it's really not so bad. Just don't go searching for parking anywhere else. It takes a maximum of 15minutes to get from one extreme on campus to the other so take this option. If you try to park on the streets outside the front gates, good luck! If you can avoid using your car, it's a better idea to use public transportation to get to the school."
College Sophomore,2,"Drug Scene – A lot of cocaine on campus, some marijuana and others such as ecstasy."
College Sophomore,2,"As I said before, it is very difficult to find parking, and it is expensive as well."
College Sophomore,2,"Usually Small, and Often You Will Find Rats – Some of the dorms have been recently renovated, such as New South, Village A, and Darnall... but they are all pretty small - even the upper classmen apartments. And there are lots of rats..."
College Sophomore,2,"Drugs Are Not Huge – You can get prettymuch anything if you look hard enough, but for the most part campus is drug-free. Alcohol is popular as always."
College Junior,2,"Georgetown is the only university in DC that doesn't have a stop on the metro but there are shuttles that take you to the 2 closest stops in DC; however, these shuttles stop running pretty early and they are unreliable on the weekends. Also, there is a public bus that runs from Georgetown to Howard and that is pretty reliable but its not free. There are other busses you can catch if you are willing to walk a little"
College Junior,2,"The area around Georgetown University is called Georgetown and that are is very expensive to live. In fact, it is the most expensive part in DC, but it is not that much more expensive than living on campus (but there's no financial aid of course lol). If you have a car then you can get a decently priced apartment in another part of the city , but only if you have a car because public transportation is defintely a problem when it comes to gtown"
College Sophomore,2,"O Wow...The Snowpacalypse of 2010! The weather in DC is pretty extreme for me!  I have never dealt with such unpredictable and predictable weather before.  DC weather can be dreadful - it may rain and be cloudy for an entire week, leaving you quite down.  We have had more cloudy days than sunny days.  However, it's not too cold.  It can get really sticky and gross in the spring/summer.  The only profound weather which incredibly affected my campus experience was the blizzard that hit the East coast.  We had 3 blizzards - each leaving the campus with a foot to 2.5 feet of snow.  School was shut down for 10 days (including weekends).  However, the likeliness of that happening again is rare I would think considering in past years DC gets a couple inches of snow and ice (most likely)."
College Sophomore,2,"I have not yet had to deal with off-campus housing, but it is extremely inconvenient that GU does not guarantee on-campus housing your junior and senior year and that obviously because it is DC, living off-campus is pricey.  Some areas are 15 minutes away from campus but it still is unfortunate if you are like 99% of the campus and are involved in 100 activities."
College Sophomore,2,"Lord Help Washington D.C. in General – I'm probably not telling you anything you don't already know. Having a POV...military acronym...sorry. Anyway...parking is rather challenging in several areas, not to mention expensive...easy to get fined. If you are not a nontraditional person like myself who is way to accustomed to driving myself around, it will be easier for you."
Junior,1,"The online learning is terrible. It is not necessarily the professors faults, but online learning for students who are trying to move into extremely important jobs in the country and world today is not good enough. The tuition for Georgetown is so high you cannot replicate anything like it when you are not in persons. This was utterly ridiculous."
Sophomore,1,"It feels as if I'm living in a pressure cooker. The environment is very stressful, not only academically but also socially. Classes are extremely hard, while professors are only mediocre. The social life is centered around extremely competitive clubs, both pre-professional and more socially oriented. While the school uses these clubs as a selling point, saying that they contribute to a student's well-roundedness and professional skills, this doesn't always apply because the clubs are selective according to a social hierarchy. If you're not a genius and super attractive, then good luck."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life isn't recognized by the university, so there are a just a few unofficial frats and sororities that don't take up a lot of time commitment or are not important parts of the school."
College Freshman,1,The housing here is no selling point.
College Freshman,1,"It's barely a thing, and it's pretty silly."
College Freshman,1,Practically no opportunity to get out of double style dorm
College Freshman,1,"There is no Greek Life. There are some underground ""fraternities"" which would be the laughing stock of any true Greek school"
College Freshman,1,Should have never even applied
College Sophomore,1,"My financial aid was drastically cut after my freshman year because my sister graduated from college, even though my parents' income dropped from my freshman to sophomore year. Georgetown's claim that they meet all students' needs is completely false: they expect all of your parents' income to go straight to tuition, and don't keep in mind that families have other student loans, mortgages, bills, and food to put on the table. Financial aid is absolutely insubstantial."
College Sophomore,1,The parties are boring because nobody dances
College Sophomore,1,I avoid Leo's because the nutrients are empty.
College Junior,1,I got out of the meal plan after freshman year. The food is terrible and there are options but they are all poor options.
College Junior,1,Little to no scholarship opportunites.
College Senior,1,"As an international students, the scholarships and grants available are extremely limited. Federal financial aid is not available to international students. Funding is a true problem and an everyday concern for me, especially since the tuition is so expensive...sometimes you can really push hard to get a small waiver on tuition but the application process includes only a handful of very competitive scholarships."
College Senior,1,"We don't have it, but I'm glad we don't. People must find other ways to engage in community."
College Freshman,1,Georgetown students are banned from parking. 
College Junior,1,On campus parking is almost non- existent and off campus is even more difficult !
College Senior,1,Parking on campus is expensive and it is difficult to find a spot. Carpooling with other classmates is a must if traveling from off-campus.
College Junior,1,"Campus housing is barely inhabitable. Both dorms I have lived in have had black mold, rats, and cockroach infestations. The university will ignore your requests for fixing this, and instead of cleaning mold, will paint over it. It's a huge health hazard and embarrassing to the name of the university."
College Student,1,"Georgetown is not good with financial aid, plain and simple. There are some kids who get small amounts of money, but unless your family is in dire need you won't receive anything. For a big name they must not have a big endowment. Financial aid is not a huge priority for the school."

College Junior,5,"Post Grad Services – To begin, some of these services I haven't used yet.
Now I believe the list of companies for internships post grad, they hold many seminars in which students and alumni are welcomed to attend. Fremont also provides continued job search,they have alumni social networking that all post grad and grad students can attend. Fremont has a extensive list of many companies thar have welcomed their graduates. The career center is in us as students yet the e.Career center is the school itself and the Fremont family of educators"

The best thing is that my instructors are available at any time that I need them!"
Junior,4,"Fremont College has dedicated instructors who take a real interest in our education.  They work with us to help us achieve our goal of a degree...whether it be an Associate or a Bachelor's degree.
Classes can be online, in person, or a mixture of both...depending on the needs of the student."
Junior,4,"Fremont is a university that offers classes online and in person.  This arrangement works out great because my day isn't really structured to where I can carve out regular hours to devote to classwork.
Sometimes, the best hours for me to study are after 8 pm!  Online classes allow me to use these hours with no problem.  My instructors are available to me by email and I can call them if needed.  Sometimes, I may need to go on campus to use the schools equipment or speak to the instructor in person and this is always a choice that is available to me and any other student."

College Senior,2,"Not Happy With My Choice – I am not to happy with the school. everything that they promised to help me with and that was included in my accademics was not. fremont has been nothing but a streessful gerny for me since day won but I continuted to stick it out and finish but will never refer this school to anyone else. they charge you an arm and a leg for a lap top when it cost pennies from what they paid for it. they have no tuturing like they stated there was. the parking fees are to expencive, they don't offer discounts for bus tanspertation."
College Junior,1,I prefer being the classroom
College Senior,1,still getting used to being back at school since 1990 when I went to a 2 year college.  I knew I would have trouble with online courses compared to traditional class. And I was right.  The work load is alot with being single mother of 2 and working.  I fell behind on some assignments and my instructor understood my situation and is allowing me to make them up. I'm still having a hard time but refuse to quit.  I'll die first.  I'm trying to show my kids not to give up when the going gets tough.

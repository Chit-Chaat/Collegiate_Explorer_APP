Junior,5,I have just started classes at CU Denver as I am a transfer student. Unfortunately my classes are remote due to COVID 19 but the school has been very easy to work with and is trying to help students succeed through this tough year.
Niche User,5,Fantastic online experience.  I would Highly recommend learning online through this institution.  The U of CO professors are high quality and VERY good at teaching
Niche User,5,Excellent course content.  Great instructors.  Thoughtful and thorough instruction.  I learned so much about the field of EMT.  Great testing after each module. Videos helpful to teaching.
Junior,5,"great, I have gotten used to doing school online, the university of Colorado seems to have it down pretty well."
Niche User,5,"I really liked getting to learn about the environment at CU Denver, it really makes me want to attend the school.  Everything was up to I expected and I can't wait to start my own story there."
Niche User,5,I didn't take online classes.  But I think it would be cool to do because it seems very organized.  Online learning isn't the easiest for me because I learn better in person.
Junior,5,I love that every staff member holds my hand through this crazy transition. I feel very supported and heard. I am an inline student so the learning curve is very hard for me as I am a visual learner but I found that my experience here is very easy and natural because the staff does not allow for me to not understand. I would highly recommend this university (and have!) to my friends and family interested in higher education.
Junior,5,I am a completely online student so their easy use of canvas and web teaching is very practiced and efficient. I've learned more her than I ever have in my life. I may even get a graduates degree from here just so I do not have to leave yet.
Niche User,5,"The professors were very good about switching from in-person teaching to online education. Although it did make it a lot harder to ask questions or contact the professors. I enjoyed that the online learning was slightly different based on the classes. For example, my psychology course utilized recorded lectured to pass information, whereas my physics course utilized zoom meetings at the times that our classes would have been held. Overall, it was a great experience where I didn't have to worry about my safety going out of the house, but I was still able to keep up with the work load."
Junior,5,CU Denver is a great option for students who want the CU experience without the snobbery of Boulder or the extreme competition at CU Boulder.
Junior,5,Great professors who help their online students. You can tell that the students care and that the professors really want to help their students learn.
Junior,5,"When COVID struck, it was in the middle of our semester. All teachers were asked to go online and some did incredibly well, others had a harder time with it and handling the students. I usually take online courses and I really enjoy them! Most teachers have everything up on time and before the course even starts so you always know whats getting put in. The teachers really try to make online courses as interesting and as user friendly as possible."
Junior,5,Online classes are easily accessible and professors respond in decent amount of time. Great way to learn remotely.
Sophomore,5,"Thanks to canvas, staying in contact with the professors is easy and possible. With so much uncertainty, it's nice to know that we have tools to encourage our learning."
Sophomore,5,"I have been coming to the Auraria campus since I was in middle school and in the Pre-Collegiate program. The experience of inclusivity and active engagement is really great, but I also love the flexibility for nontraditional students like myself! It's a commuter school within the hustle and bustle of Downtown Denver and I honestly wouldn't have it any other way."
Senior,5,"All of my classes got switched to online. A few professors stumbled a little with the sudden transition mid-semester. But for the most part, the professors were very tech savvy. Additionally, they really worked hard to adapt the content to work better in an online class, providing recorded lectures in advance and changing grading systems since our tests were now at home and thus open book. Some of our proessors took advantage of the situation to collaborate and provide content that connected different courses together in scenarios."
Senior,5,"This review is specific to the accelerated one year nursing program. If you've had some life experience and decided nursing is what you want to do, this program is amazing. It is very fast paced and competitive. But if you're up for that, the quality of education and the clinical placements are much higher quality than a lot (if not all) of the other schools in Denver.

The professors are experts in the material and they're very experienced in how to deliver the material in this intensive way while setting you up for success. They are all funny, warm, and supportive of students."
Junior,5,"It is presented very neatly and easy to follow. All the resources you need are easily accessible. It is a different setting than being on campus, but everyone has the same goal which is to teach and to learn."
Junior,5,They have a strong form of communication. Everyone is willing to help at any time. The students are also quick to help newcomers. The setting is very welcoming.
Junior,5,"I attend the University of Colorado- Anschutz Medical Campus which is still classified under the Denver campus. I have greatly enjoyed my experience so far, and the professors genuinely want to see you succeed."
Junior,5,"I love this university. The connections to a variety of people from all over the world is priceless. The faculty that I have engaged with have been, for the most part, guiding, inspiring, and caring."
Freshman,5,"Amazing, excited to begin my journey here. I have grown a love for cinematography and believe that it is my path to bring comfort and empathy to others. Given my upbringing, I have insight and awareness that can be translated into a worthwhile and rewarding career in the film industry. Being able to expand upon my creative mind with others just like me gets me very eager to finally start film school in the fall of 2020. I have been dreaming of this since I was a child and the fact that I will be finally doing it gives me such a great sense of fulfillment and joy. The current people who I know who attend University of Colorado at Denver are in love, I cannot wait until I get a chance to feel that spark for myself."
Senior,5,"I attended school here at UCD second semester of my sophomore year and now graduating here. This school does offer a lot of opportunities to get to know people and to make a difference in our community and the capital of our beautiful city and state of Denver, Colorado.  You will succeed at UCD with the amazing help from each professor and even tutors. We are in the heart of downtown where there is a lot to do no matter the weather or time of day."
Senior,5,The University of Colorado Denver is a great school to earn your degree. Every instructor I've had have been amazing and very understanding. This school has a lot to offer for every person!
Freshman,5,"I haven't gone there yet, but I have been accepted. Hopefully I will have an amazing time. Also, I heard it is very cold so bring a lot of warm clothes to stay warm."
Junior,5,The school has great resources for students. The faculty are helpful and involved in students academic success. The campus is beautiful and diverse.
Graduate Student,5,"Denver is wonderful, I enjoyed learning and living here. The students are kind and overall it is a great environment. I am very happy to have chosen CU."
Sophomore,5,"Campus is laid out well and close to downtown by bus . It's a diverse campus and overall, the teachers are pretty good. There are tons of clubs and any help as far as tutors and staff. My counselor keeps me on track with my course scheduling and there is a big food court in the main building. There are a lot of students here, in all age groups and the classrooms are fairly close together. 

I'm not sure about the party scene but new dorms were just built."
Junior,5,"Great campus, not very interesting though. No parties and everyone here is focused on staying in school and studying."
Niche User,5,My overall experience with CU Denver was great I have done some college corses there through pre-coligent. The teachers and instructors have really given me a lot of support and determination.
Niche User,5,excellent. a warm welcoming open door when we first came there. Went there for a trip and enjoyed it.
Junior,5,I love the campus and how diverse it is. The area in which it is in is great and allows us to see the city.
Senior,5,Professors really care about your future and make sure to help you learn important skills necessary for the real world.
Freshman,5,"I have enjoyed being a student at CU Denver so far! My professors make it an enjoyable experience. I am enjoying my experience with the school so far, for it makes me more excited and determined to earn my degree!"
Graduate Student,5,"I really enjoy going to Skaggs School of Pharmacy at CU anschutz. The medical campus is strictly graduate students, which in part creates a wonderful less crowded environment.  There are many resources available for us as students. I feel upon graduation I will be able to  find the jobs of my dreams because my institution has prepared me!"
Freshman,5,I like how after attending this school so many stay in the state of colorado. It would be nice to see more career success stories in music displayed for aspiring artists to see.
Sophomore,5,"So far, I really enjoy being on the campus. There’s a lot of diversity and the programs like to be involved with the students and make sure they’re aware of what is available to them."
Sophomore,5,"The advisors are so friendly and helpful. My emails are answered within 2 days, and getting an appointment is super easy. They've really helped set me on the right path."
Sophomore,5,I really like the environment in and around the University of Colorado Denver. The campus is downtown with connections to multiple businesses and thus attending school here can lead to a broader range of networking and help you attain internships or jobs during or after your studies.
Niche User,5,"I attended UCD for a Music Industry Music camp this summer with both professors and guest artists. The instruction was rigorous and engaging and I learned so much to better not only my voice and my playing of guitar, ukulele, and violin, but also my songwriting and understanding of music business. The campus is beautiful and easy to navigate and the classrooms are perfect for individual class needs."
Freshman,5,"The administration is very flexible and understanding and provided a painless process when I requested for a gap year. 

The counselors were always ready and willing to work with you and intensively review your schedule and progression.
The faculty is always prompt in answering questions and provide immediate feedback to classwork and homework. The classes themselves are relevant and up to date."
Freshman,5,One of the things that I really like about CU is the student diversity population. This is my first semester in nursing school and I had have the opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds.
Freshman,5,"University of Colorado Denver have such a nice campus, and a lot of services for students. The only issue was that  was not notified that the scholarship deadline is in March."
Sophomore,5,"Professors were very easy to talk to and actually cared about their student's understanding. They always had office hours and showed up to them or emailed students when they could not make it, also telling students that they would hold additional office hours for the inconvenience."
Junior,5,"The University of Colorado Denver provides a great education through the abundant access of textbooks, library books, computers, professors and so much more! The campus is diverse in a multitude of ways and because we're a liberal campus there's a room for everyone. The campus is also in the heart of downtown Denver, so a variety of attractions such as Elitch Gardens and the Convention Center are only a bus stop away!"
Niche User,5,"Overall, everyone has been friendly and helpful the times I have been there. I know people who go here and really enjoy attending this school, so I think I will really enjoy my time when I begin attending. This school is close to home and there are many places in the surrounding area that you could go to on your free time to explore."
Junior,5,"I fell in love with my school I am even considering becoming a professor here later in my future. Throughout my college career, I have been inspired by many of my professors. They love and enjoy what they do. Everyone is friendly and I truly recommend my school to everyone who loves meeting all kinds of people from different cultures."
Junior,5,"I really do like the college and what it has to offer. I have had many experiences that have inspired me to show my best work. The teachers are very knowledgeable and have shown me how to better my work and improve my skills. The campus is large and full of many students all pursuing their future. I do wish that access to more financial aid for my position was easier to find. If I could change anything, it would be that. Otherwise, I have enjoyed my time at the university and recommend it to others who wish to continue their education."
Junior,5,"I am going in as a Junior to the nursing program, so I don't have experience yet, but have encountered has been amazing. The staff, interview, application process thorough and excellent."
Sophomore,5,"I really love the small class sizes, it makes it easier to learn and get to know your professor and fellow students. I also really like that all of my classes are in buildings that are fairly close together. I do wish that some of the classes were offered at more times."
Freshman,5,The University of Colorado Denver is an amazing school. They give amazing opportunities to all student and has an amazing academic environment.
Senior,5,This is a great college to come to get your degree of any kind. I am in the ECE program and all professors are really engaged and care about your learning.
Freshman,5,I love how the staff really cares about every individual. Everyone on campus is very helpful and straight forward. I’ve had nothing but good experiences with the advisors and professors.
Freshman,5,"I loved the diversity of students , i loved the opportunities they offered, I would not change a thing!"
Niche User,5,I have seen there campus when visiting Metro state and have been in there Lynx camp of performed arts and media for about two weeks.
Niche User,5,It's a very peaceful and calm place. It's a medium size school and everything around is pleasing to the eye. There are art sculptures around the school. Many different open areas. And the students are kind and so are the professors.
Junior,5,"I like that the school has a lot of diversity, which is uncommon in my home town. The diversity has opened my eyes to the many cultures that reside in the US, and how culture broadens the horizons of learning. I also like that the campus is very inclusive of its students in events and organizations."
Sophomore,5,"If you're looking for a great college experience, from academics to peers, you can definitely find it here."
Senior,5,"I love CU Denver. I transferred here from CU Boulder and am grateful that I made that decision. The school is so diverse and it is an enjoyable place to learn. The students are so diverse and it is a pleasure to be around so many unique individuals. The advising could use some work. Everyone in the advising office is kind, but at times my adviser has not answered my emails and our meetings were not helpful. Overall, CU Denver is an amazing place."
Graduate Student,5,Great and helpful professors and staff. This campus is also in a wonderful location offering everything from the city activities to everything outdoor.
Junior,4,"The online learning experience has been pretty good. It is all over zoom so we can interact with our classmates and instructors. While I do not mind zoom, it makes it hard for me to schedule my work since attendance is mandatory and not every professor is willing to work with you. I work healthcare so my hours can be sporadic, especially during the pandemic."
Freshman,4,All my classes so far have been remote but I enjoy all my classes. Plus the teachers are really nice and willing to put forth the effort to teach you and help you if you're struggling.
Freshman,4,"Despite having to attend college during the COVID pandemic, I am finding a lot of things I am enjoying about my school and campus. I like that its close to the city so if me and some friends or classmates want to get out for a bit, that's easy to do. The campus and housing have plenty of room and the food is pretty decent for a school. The campus is big and has plenty of materials and resources for students to use.
Overall, it is an awesome, safe place to live and learn and I would give it five stars if it weren't for the pandemic."
Alum,4,"It was a commuter's college, so it was in the city.  I feel like we missed out on all the college life like football, etc due to not having a team."
Alum,4,"It was a good school that allowed to learn in a diverse environment. The atmosphere was super urban and along with that came the diverse cultures, fellow students and learning."
Freshman,4,Univeristy of Colorado Denver is a great school for its academics as well as its student life. The faculty is very wise and helpful. Other students are friendly and good role models.
Freshman,4,The online experience at University of Colorado Denver is easy to follow as well highly personable. The faculty is willing to help you in a one on one format just like in the classroom.
Sophomore,4,"University of Colorado Denver has one of the most diverse student population, which is wonderful because students from different cultures and backgrounds are able to receive equal opportunities for academic support and other college essentials."
Sophomore,4,"With online courses, the professors were efficient in responding to students' emails and concerns. Since it is online, this requires the students to manage their time more effectively; however, the amount of workload is good with high quality of educational materials."
Sophomore,4,The online experience is well designed and I learn a lot even though it is not in person. The teachers have been very accommodating to learning online and I feel comfortable asking questions in an online format.
Sophomore,4,Its fun to live in the city and all the classes I took there in person and online have been informative and I got the sense the teachers really cared about me.
Sophomore,4,The campus is really nice and it is really close to Downtown. There are two other colleges on the Auraria Campus which means there's a lot of people on campus. The Tivoli is really nice too with lots of options of food to buy from.
Sophomore,4,"After having to switch to completely online for the remainder of the semester is was not very hard. A lot of the teachers were understanding and made switching a lot easier. Sometimes it was hard to find the motivation to finish certain projects, but with everything going on teachers were very helpful."
Niche User,4,"I love University of Colorado Denver. I am still in high school but I am a full-time student at UCD. It is in a great location and it is very easy to take a walk outdoors around the campus. Occasionally professors could be difficult to deal with, but its nothing a respectful conversation can't handle. The food on campus is great, but if students aren't in the mood for campus food, they can walk a few blocks into Denver and try the food there. There isn't designated student living, but the campus is surrounded by lightrail stations so it is very easy to hop onto the train to get to class."
Junior,4,"CUDenver is very inclusive and welcoming. With a large open campus and beautiful views from each classroom. Overall, its a wonderful college with great professors! But there is not a lot a of hang-out places or places to meet new people."
Alum,4,Close knit community in the heart of Downtown Denver offers and inclusive environment.  The education was rigorous but school provided support if needed.
Sophomore,4,"It's been an overall great experience there. The year was cut short due to Covid-19, but it's a great school with a great Recording Arts program."
Junior,4,"Very nice campus with plenty of things to do. They are very accommodating, but also extremely expensive."
Alum,4,"The college mainly uses canvas. The effectiveness of the course depends on the professors. Fortunately, I have great experience with online learning and the professors made the learning effective."
Alum,4,Supports diversity. The school has many resources to ensure student's success during school and after! Met many professors and fellow students that became life long friends.
Freshman,4,"University of Colorado Denver is a small, primarily commuter campus, without Greek life or large sports teams, which makes it a non-traditional college experience. There are selling points, however, the location is right in the heart of Denver, and the class sizes are quite small, which means professors often know you by name and are invested in your learning. What this campus lacks in traditional university culture is made up by the close proximity to restaurants, nightlife, and businesses (which means an abundance of jobs and internship opportunities)."
Alum,4,The University of Colorado Denver is located in downtown Denver. It offers a variety of courses/majors for its students. Professors are flexible and willing to accommodate students when needed. The university provides individuals with a proper college education.
Sophomore,4,"The University of Colorado Denver is a fun school. The campus is walking distance from downtown Denver, which is always fun to get a cup of coffee. Also, student resources are helpful when finding necessary help on essays, job applications, resumes, and even counseling. The student life is very active in terms of learning and friendship, but very diverse."
Senior,4,"Diverse place, mostly great instructors, and connection to the School of Medicine is nice. Not great if you're looking for typical college experience though, as it is a commuter campus."
Niche User,4,"The University of Colorado Denver (UCD) is a beautiful gem in the heart of Denver. UCD has beautiful scenery of Denver. The school itself also seems to be more diverse in ethnicity than it's other branch the University of Colorado Boulder. There are people from all kinds of backgrounds here. Not only are the people diverse, but there is diversity in the food in the Tivoli cafeteria as well. The academics opportunities are endless at UCD. Along with that the professors are challenging their students daily. There are many people who would rather go to the University of Boulder, but I believe UCD is a beautiful school that definitely shows growth not only in the successful careers of their students but, in their character as well."
Senior,4,"Great campus that is shared with two other colleges. The professors, for the most part, are amazing! You will have to look hard to find a ""difficult"" teacher but they are rare. the only downfall is that it does not really have a college life feel, after class there is not much reason to stay on campus."
Freshman,4,"It’s my first year at this school and what has really stuck out to me was flexible my teachers were able to be when my mom had to go to the hospital, so I had to be at home taking care of my 2 younger sisters. I was able to get all my work done from home. Instead of making me feel bad or critiquing me for things that weren’t in my control, they were sympathetic to my situation and how it was affecting my family."
Freshman,4,"UCD is on a shared campus in the heart of downtown Denver. If you can't find something to do on campus, there's plenty of opportunities just a block away! The classes are a good size, and it's easy to get help from professors or through the Learning Resource Center. It's exciting to start adult life in such an exciting city and university as University of Colorado Denver!"
Niche User,4,Cooperation with Anschutz creates a very convenient situation for an effort to progress from a premedical program to a full medical program immediately afterwards. I also have friends who enjoy the college.
Junior,4,"One positive aspect that really stands out to me is the urban campus life. Right outside of campus is Elitch Gardens, the Pepsi Center, Mile High stadium, 16th street mall, and other cool districts all within walking distance or a short train ride away.
One thing I wish would change is the lack of tolerance of other points of view. Even the faculty and staff have very obvious political biases which I experienced working with a political organization on the opposite end of the spectrum."
Junior,4,"What I love about the University of Colorado Denver, is diversity. UCD is known for its immense diversity. Being a Hispanic male student, its hard at times to fit in and feel welcomed. But, at the University of Colorado Denver, I feel really welcomed wherever I go. One thing that I would change about UCD is space. There is minimal space to sit down and do homework. I usually have to go to a whole different building to do homework because of theres hardly any tables in the business building."
Freshman,4,"I love the diversity on campus! There are so many people from different backgrounds, mindsets, countries, religions, races, and more! I also love the dedication each professor puts into their work. It shows that they truly care about their students."
Junior,4,One of the main things I love about CU Denver is that it is right in the heart of downtown Denver! This is a huuuuge advantage to many of us because of all the connections that are nearby right in the city. Another thing that I love about CU Denver is their diversity. CU Denver is part of the Auraria Campus which is really diverse.
Junior,4,"I am a transfer student for Red Rocks Community College, and transferring to a university was a big step for me. I believe UCD made this transition the best one. Everyone from admissions to registration to financial aid, to even students passing by and smiling were very welcoming. I am happy with the university choice I made and I am proud to be a CU Denver Lynx"
Niche User,4,"During my visit to the University of  Colorado Denver I saw a lot of thing that I liked. For one I really liked how close to home this College is to my family. They also have a lot of majors and things that I would like to study. The campus is very diverse and I feel like I would fit in. Something that I have heard though from people that have lived on the campus, is that it is very expensive for what you are getting. The campus overall though was very pretty and seems to have a lot of people going through there everyday."
Sophomore,4,"Very good research university and diverse campus, welcoming and academic feeling for all traditional and non-traditional students."
Freshman,4,"This university is very helpful in getting first year students adapted and comfortable to college life. This includes but is not limited to; pre-orietation modules, freshman orientation, and informational emails. These all act as helpful resources to get students ready for their academic careers."
Freshman,4,"I love the environment on campus, everyone seems to be inclusive and open. The actual campus is beautiful, with so much to do by just walking around."
Niche User,4,"I haven't gone to the school to study, but I have gone on a tour and it seems like a school where students are able to reach resources easily. I also liked it because it seemed like students were able to reach their teachers in a mannerful way."
Senior,4,Consistently renovating the campus and friendly staff who are always happy to help. The only criticism I can truly level would be an inconsistency in some members of the teaching staff in terms of their approachability.
Freshman,4,"I love all of the diversity, it isn't hard to feel comfortable when first attending, there are so many different clubs also and millions of opportunities to grow as an individual and find who you are. The area surrounding is very nice, especially at night and the city will never get boring. Every single one of the professors and the staff has been very friendly and that gets me excited to start my first year in college. I know this because I was in a pre collegiate program at UCD and have found it easy to adapt and there is never a problem when it comes to asking questions."
Sophomore,4,"Attending the University of Colorado Denver has helped me interact and meet with new people, experiences, and opportunities. The campus prides itself on facilitating connections to the people, places, and opportunities ahead, individualized to each student. Supporting their students is one of the primary goals at this university. Campus involvement is also emphasized through numerous clubs and events. The University of Colorado Denver gives students the chance to grow, learn, and thrive in a comforting and welcoming environment."
Junior,4,As a student that commutes to the University I can't tell much about the housing but I do spend alot of time in campus. The fact that campus is close to 16th street mall opens the abilitiy to more options for lunch. But also it opens the possibility to have a walk around downtown.
Freshman,4,"A thing I like about University of Colorado Denver is how diverse it is. UCD shares the Auraria campus with two other schools which makes sure that every group of students and faculty are belonging to the community. One thing I'll like to see change about  the University of Colorado Denver is their International studies program, be able to offer places in and third world countries and not just the countries that are developed or are developing."
Freshman,4,"I am going to be a freshman at CU Denver this upcoming fall and from all the events that I have gone to I can really tell I will be accepted and feel at home because everyone there is so nice and friendly. I wouldn't want to see anything about it change because the professors are really helpful, so is everyone else on campus and I just love the area of being in the heart of downtown Denver."
Junior,4,"University of Colorado Denver is a great school, that I highly recommend to my peers. The campus is beautiful. There is a great view of the mountains and it is well kept. The school has a lot to offer for students, from clubs to job opportunities."
Junior,4,In the two years that I have been attending classes at this institution I have become fairly verse in the bureaucracy and can say that it is easy to use.  The things that I would like to change about the school is that many of the clubs do not have the support of the institution.
Junior,4,"I love the integration of city vigor with academic vigor throughout the campus. I attended several classes in the business building which is a state-of-the-art building in the heart of downtown Denver. This experience was unique and brought forth many opportunities in not only the business community, but every other major provided."
Senior,4,Some of the professors are amazing and have significant nursing experience they bring into classes and discussions.
Freshman,4,The school environment is good to be around. The teachers are respectful and understand your goals and ambitions. There are many opportunities to meet others and build relationships with the school.
Freshman,4,The school is really diverse but I do think that there could be more activities to help the students be more involved in the school.
Niche User,4,"I love how connected it's with the two other colleges, an internetwork with resources shared with all three colleges."
Freshman,4,I find it incredible how helpful their staff was during my application process. They check in with me and get back to me very quickly to my emails about any questions I have.
Freshman,4,"University of Colorado Denver is a school that is around the city side of the states. During time off I would walk around downtown and explore the city. With the vast amount of shops and areas to hang out, I tend to find places with food. Campus however could be quite confusing considering how large and confusing the buildings may be. Most of my professors are quite nice but the amount of lectures are tiring. If I were to change something about the school it would be to move some activities to the morning/afternoons since my classes all end early."
Junior,4,"Professors are very passionate about teaching and advisors are very knowledgeable! Academics are great, but very work intensive. Tuition costs for out-of-state is way too high though."
Freshman,4,"The University of Colorado Denver is very education based.  There are not very many parties and social events are not heavily used.  Its a commuter schools so not very many people stay on campus for any longer than required for their classes so if you are looking for the ""college experience"" with parties, frats and sororities then this is not the college for you. However, if you want a good education and you want to be pressured to excel this is a great place to receive a higher education and remain serious about your degree."
Freshman,4,"CU Denver has a small campus but it is always teeming with activities and events, even in the cold winter months. Fellow students are active with their education and take charge in making the most of the myriad of resources the school provides and actively makes known to its students."
Senior,4,"Attending CU Denver was one of the best decisions I ever made. The campus was located close to my home, and the school allowed me to commute rather than live on campus which helped my expenses. The classes, overall, have been taught by great professors who have always been willing to help me achieve my goals and, more distinctly, pass their class. The course has, of course, been challenging but every moment has been engaging and insightful. Also, with a campus located downtown, the university is ideal for those who want to be plugged into the community."
Freshman,4,"The University of Colorado Denver is a beautiful campus located in the lower downtown of Denver Colorado. Overall, the university has great professors who are dedicated to see the students succeed."
Niche User,4,"I know CU Denver through my high school. I got the opportunity to attend CU Denver through a scholars program. The classes I have taken haver been very helpful. The professors there are great; students have easy access to them and so far everyone gets along very well. The campus is beautiful, not just the scenery outside but also inside. They have been remodeling the buildings from inside making is much more comfortable and safe inside. It is a great school and I can not wait to attend after I graduate from my high school."
Alum,2,Zoom classes are always a problem not just here. I don't think any school can do this well especially for an MBA that is meant to be collaborative.
Senior,2,The online platform is rather clunky. The EdX platform is quite superior -- they could take a few pointers from them.
Sophomore,2,I wish to see more diversity in this college. Most professors are great and love working with their students. The campus food is mostly not well cooked. But I still love the location of the school.
College Sophomore,2,Almost every day an email is sent out about how someone was assaulted in some way.
College Senior,2,I wish I went to a different school. This school does not give you a leg up for Anschutz schools. It's expensive and they take all your money through parking because they know 909% of students commute. what a waste
College Senior,2,I feel like I won't get a job because of where I went. There are no connections to be made at this school
College Senior,2,It's creepy at night because it's downtown and since there aren't many people and the parking lots are so far it's unsafe to walk at night
College Sophomore,2,I'm pretty sure we dont have greek life.
College Junior,2,There's no promotion of greek life.
College Sophomore,2,The dorms are really nice but the food is horrible and most people like to stick to themselves and not socialize
College Sophomore,2,"If you want a typical college experience, this is not the school to go to. No sports teams, no greek life, it is hard to meet people since it is a commuter school, no interesting clubs, the dorm-life sucks, so overall, it is very difficult to have a social life. The academics are okay, but people here are primarily focused on academics only and it can get overwhelming at times."
College Junior,2,It doesn't seem to be a huge deal here
College Junior,2,I rarely hear about sports on campus
College Sophomore,2,I wouldn't hire a student here.
College Sophomore,2,Our school doesn't have any official competitive teams
College Junior,2,I have never seen any engagement related to sports at this school in particular.
College Senior,2,Not enough opportunities for internships
College Freshman,2,Athletics aren't really a big deal here.
College Junior,2,"Like everywhere sexual assault is a big problem and that makes me especually as a girl uncomfortable. As a girl you always will have to fear that your statement will be taken apart, you will be blamed and your rapist walks away without prosecution. You literally put your life on the line every day, having to fear to be assaulted and no one will take you serious or you rapist is a star on the sportsteam on campus and therefore doesn't get prosecuted so the school still can win a teophy."
College Junior,2,I haven't seen any fraternities or sororities on campus yet even though I would love to join one just for the benefits of getting scholarships to pay for school
College Junior,2,"Since this school is a commuter school, the party scene is not very good. Many people travel to Boulder or elsewhere on the weekends to party."
College Junior,2,It's bad because this is a commuter campus.
College Junior,2,"Unless you fit a certain role, you will not receive hardly any aid.  It's very disappointing."
College Junior,2,Our school is more of a commuter school so I've never even heard of a party on campus and I probably wouldn't be around to go to one after 5pm anyway.
College Sophomore,2,"Expensive and low availability, hard to find"
College Sophomore,2,"No parties on campus, fun activities downtown"
College Sophomore,2,"Took forever to process, not enough info provided"
College Junior,2,To strict on parking rules.
College Sophomore,2,"Area around the Aurora campus is not very built up, so there are very few ""hole in the wall"" sort of places around the campus and a few chain options."
College Sophomore,2,for my major I haven't seen that much internship and computer science club doesn't seem to influence a lot of companies to come and present but they are doing the best they can.
College Sophomore,2,"their are a lot of places to eat for the first 6 month of you college life, then after that it gets boring because it is the same food place over and over again."
College Senior,2,This is a college campus of mostly traveling students. There is no campus housing or dorms.
College Junior,2,"Auraria is not the place to go to parties. Most of the partying is done at the bars that are walking distance from campus or at the homes of students, which tend to be off campus."
College Junior,2,"Campus Village is HORRIBLE. The lofts are better, but sometimes unsafe and VERY expensive."
College Junior,2,"There aren't a lot of parties, in my opinion, that's a good thing. If you are over 21, the downtown bars and clubs are awesome."
College Freshman,2,There are a small amount of sports available and I am not allowed to participate in another school on campus for athletics. How am I supposed to be involved then?
College Freshman,2,I never know what is going on and no one cares about what is going on. It makes me feel unsafe and scared on campus
Recent Alumnus,2,"It is very frustrating to work with financial aid.  They will send you an email stating that the student needs to take some sort of action (fill out a specific form), then when you take it back to the campus, they don't need that form or they need something different, they also do not keep some records well....best piece of advice is to keep copies of everything.  I submitted a SAP appeal (which was requested by them a year ago), then this semester they had to record of it at all."
Recent Alumnus,2,"I'm in the History program.  If it wasn't for the credit hours I have, I would definitely transfer to another school.  In regards to required classes, they do not have very many options in which to take classes, and when one meets with an adviser, they may or may not tell you truth about course availability.  It definitely has not been a welcoming environment at times.  Many of the professors however, are really good and knowledgeable but I will still be very glad to graduate."
College Freshman,2,Most scholarships have similar due dates and also not many are offered.
College Sophomore,2,Hard to get in contact with admissions or anyone helpful at least.
College Freshman,2,"The financial aid process was easy to apply for. However, the school barely pitched in to help with finances. For such an expensive school they should give more aid to out of state students in need. Personally, the main income for my household is my Mother's Disability income. Therefor the college doesn't expect us to be able to give any money, yet still barely granted any financial aid."
College Junior,2,There's little to no student life and a lot of the student life which is there is ignored by the majority of students.
College Junior,2,Not much of a focus on athletics at all.
College Sophomore,2,Needs improvement. No school spirit and no sports teams!
College Sophomore,2,We are not driven by sports. It is mostly consisting of club sport and intramurals.
College Sophomore,2,There are too many snow days in Denver as far as I am concerned. The campus buildings are often spread apart to the point that walking through the cold ruins the experience.
College Junior,2,There is not a lot of bars near campus. 
College Junior,2,I spent the first semester of my freshman year on the campus. The dorms are outrageous prices and I never had an option to who my room mate was. I never would stay there again. 
College Junior,2,During the busy times of the day it is very difficult to find parking and spending $4- $5 dollars on parking everyday can rack up. The school does not offer permits. 
College Freshman,2,"The University of Colorado, Denver is not a place someone should go to school if they want a real ""college experience"". There is barely anything going on at this school and I find myself spending all my money in the city so I don't have to sit in my room all the time. "
College Senior,2,Upgrades needed to PE/Event Center
College Sophomore,2,"Guys are geeky, nerdy, and weird. Which is great if they are cute, too. But they're not."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking is ridiculously expensive, and being in Denver, there aren't any better options. Taking the bus is SOOO much better."
College Sophomore,2,"Printing is super expensive, library computer labs always filled. Best bet is to go to the CU labs in the north building. Wireless internet super unreliable, almost always use Auraria Campus wireless, and even that doesn't always work."
College Freshman,2,"We don't have an athletics program, really. We only have growing club sports teams. That being said, there is huge initiative to start our football team and add evermore club sports! "
College Sophomore,2,I did not receive any sort of financial aid. 
College Junior,2,Downtown parking is expensive and they have eliminated a couple of parking lots..
College Senior,2,"My school has a lot to offer, but I am not aware of any programs that my school would have that would catch my eye compared to other campuses. Programs at my school are strict, some programs require high GPAs, which is hard to achieve, but then again having a good GPA would show that you are up for the program. What I like about my school is that we have programs where we can travel to different countries like China, Australia... etc. Another reason why I like my school is that we are very diverse, there are many different cultures at our school and it is nice to see that and learn about different cultures when meeting a new friend."
College Senior,2,"I'm majoring in Biology and I am currently looking also at nursing school as well. As of right now, my classes are getting harder and it is a little hard to get the grades that I want. My professors this semester are awesome! I feel like they know so much, for example my professor in my Human anatomy class. As of right now I am trying to pull up my grades for this semester and hoping to achieve all B's, and it would be great if I were able to get A's. This semester is going to be hard, but it will be worth it in the end and become useful in my future career."
Alum,1,"Constant issues!!! I spend more time proving I don't owe money, ore trying to get transcripts than anything else. Nothing works and you will be nickel and dimed. I had an incorrect bill after it was finally fixed they tried charging me fees on the money I didn't owe. The school is a joke, the staff are just terrible and they charge an insane amount, my MBA os worth MAYBE $12,000 I was charged $85,000. I feel like I wasted time and money."
College Senior,1,There is no greek life. there is no college experience at this school
College Senior,1,There are no clubs or actives that seek new people. It's like they keep to themselves and don't want to recruit others
College Sophomore,1,We do not have Greek life so there is no way to rate it.
College Junior,1,Athletics are not offered at the University of Colorado Denver.
College Freshman,1,We don't have any greeklife. I think MSU has a few sororities though.
College Junior,1,We don't have greek life on campus.
College Junior,1,"CU Denver does not offer any varsity sports. It does offer club sports, but I am unsure of how popular those are."
College Senior,1,There should be more light on campus for the night classes. Possibly more security. I don't feel safe walking to my car after class.
College Sophomore,1,"No real Greek life, that's a plus thought!"
College Junior,1,The Denver housing market is really hard to get into right now. Students are having a very difficult time finding afforadable housing within reasonable proximity to the school.
College Freshman,1,This school is more disappointing than my tiny high school was when it comes to parties. I heard that there was nothing on campus or around campus before I began attending but damn. There's seriously nothing going on unless you already know people at the Lofts and feel like making the trek. Or you feel like blowing money at a club or a bar. Saying that downtown makes up for the school's lack of social excitement isn't relevant to students under the age of 18 or those who don't want to spend much.
College Freshman,1,"It took all spring and summer of my Senior year in High School as well as a portion of my Freshman semester to receive my financial aid. And no, before anyone thinks it, I did not wait until the last minute to submit my FAFSA."
College Freshman,1,"The mandatory Campus Village housing for transfer students under 21 and freshman under 21 is ridiculously overpriced. In some cases (not too rare) I had friends who were paying over a thousand each per month for a two bedroom apartment with 3 people per room. The other housing in the area is a much better value. Also, the food plan and cafeteria of Campus Village had quite a few people losing weight (YUCK!!!). I ended up leaving school for a semester and waited out the residency time so that I could return to CU in the fall and not empty my parent's wallet on such poor housing."
College Junior,1,"Barely receive any help, just loans."
College Freshman,1,"I say ""it's the worst"" because there is no Greek life on campus currently."
College Junior,1,I don't think we even have Greek life in our school
College Junior,1,We have nothing. We all wish there were sports here.
College Junior,1,"We don't have this at all. Sometimes we wish there was more of it, but it keeps the campus focused on academics."
College Freshman,1,"I lost all opportunities to receive financial aid because UCD did not receive my records even though I did it three times consecutively. I was and I am still not satisfied, instead I am disappointed greatly for the lack of responsibility on the other side of the street"
College Freshman,1,There's 3 sororities and only 1 is available to UCD and it is latino based. I wanted to join one but I do not like any and I usually love hearing about them and getting more info
College Junior,1,There is no athletics in the CU Anschutz Medical Campus
College Senior,1,"Very, very poor scholarship and state funding"
College Senior,1,"Freezing in winter, blazing sun in summer"
College Sophomore,1,"Parking passes are upwards of $500 dollars a semester. Parking is heavily enforced and monitored, tickets are common...TERRIBLE! "
College Junior,1,This last semester the financial aid office messed up a lot of different individuals financial aide. I hardly got any of my financial aide and had to pay a lot of money out of my own pocket for their mistakes. 
College Freshman,1,I can not wait to go back to the East Coast to a school that is more involved with their students. 
College Freshman,1,"I live off-campus, only housing avaliable, and having my own bathroom and kitchen is AMAZING. Otherwise, I cant stand where I live. "
College Freshman,1,"Our dining hall has very strict timing of meals, and are terrible options. I stick to the same three food options, which are sometimes terrible as well. A grilled cheese should always be satisfying. "
College Freshman,1,"I live in the only housing provided for my school, which is off-campus. It is called Campus Village Apartments. They made moving across the country a lot harder for me to get accustomed too. They over booked rooms, leaving no space for the last person who arrived. Also, when asked to move out of existing room into a new one, they treated us as if we were children and were very rude. The RA's are the best people you will ever meet and are extremely supportive. The staff at Campus Village is terrible. "
College Sophomore,1,"Well you can live on campus, at home, or if you try to live in apartments near by, good luck! It's Denver, everything is a million dollars."
College Sophomore,1,"Only a few options, over-priced salad, subway, mcdonalds, chinese, or taco bell. A few small cafe's here and there. Best choices and on 16th street mall, off-campus and pricey, but delicious."
College Freshman,1,Don't know much about them
College Junior,1,What night life? There is no night life on campus. You have to go to downtown Denver to get to the nightlife.
College Junior,1,"Because CU Denver is the sister campus to the flagship campus in Boulder, we don't have a team aside from the Buffs in Boulder. Because of this, I give athletics a D. However, students did pass legislation to create a school mascot (Milo the Lynx- ""Mi-"" to play off ""Mile High"", and ""-Lo"" to play off the popular nickname for lower downtown, ""Lodo""). There has also been the addition of club sports. They are new so haven't gained much steam, but I'll assume they'll be awesome once they do. It is nice to see the school making an effort to not only create an athletic atmosphere, but to facilitate school spirit, hence the D rather than F."
College Sophomore,1,"I applied for scholarships back in March through the online campus portal. My mom and I even made the trip down to the scholarship resource office where we sat with a lady who went over my app on the computer and told me I had completed everything I needed to and would be considered for all scholarships. Come August I still hadn't heard anything so I call and turns out the portal had ""lost"" my scholarship application and there was nothing they could do for me this year."
College Senior,1,CU Denver parking is extremely expensive for students on a limited budget.
College Senior,1,Transportation and parking is one the negative attributes of attending CU Denver due to lack of parking spaces and the expense of paying to park.
College Sophomore,1,Our school is in the process of getting club sports teams up and running. But there aren't any NCAA sports at our school which takes away from the college experience.
College Junior,1,"There aren't much athletic events going on on this campus, that's one thing I wish there was more of. One of the schools on campus has a lot more athletic events that some students go to but for the most part UCD lacks on the athletics."
College Freshman,1,"I live at the dorms, which are on campus, so I park my car in the same lot every day. It's convenient, but it comes with a hefty price, $100 a month. Also, my friends who don't live on campus have to deal with the obnoxious lady that hands out tickets left and right. We're allowed to have guests at the dorms and campus parking is the only place they can park. The two hour spots are monitored by the Gestapo, and if you don't move your car to another lot in exactly two hours, you get fined."
College Sophomore,1,"While the campus has security- my bike was stolen right on campus. Bikes get stolen all the time on this campus. Be careful. Otherwise, I didn't seem to have any issues."
College Freshman,1,Horrible. They do not have student parking nor parking passes like other colleges. It's a huge hassle paying for parking everyday. Can be from 2.50-5.50.....bad thing bout this college
College Freshman,1,"Students are not involved in any sports. Doesn't feel like a college, rather go to CSU or CU boulder"
College Freshman,1,"There is only one dining hall for students living on-campus. The food is not very good, the hours are short, and you end up paying way too much for it all. I would recommend buying and making all of your own food rather than paying for the on-campus dining plans."
College Freshman,1,"It's a city campus, there are limited opportunities for sports and games. While there are some, its not like CU Boulder."
College Senior,1,"The athletics at the University of Colorado - Denver are pretty much non-existent. If anyone talks about college sports, the subject is DU or Metro. However, the Pepsi Center is across the street, Coors Field is a few blocks away, and Invesco Field is a couple blocks the other way."
College Freshman,1,The campus is not very green and comes off a little antiseptic
College Freshman,1,"The facilities are very average and the school is not particularily beautiful. Granted, it has a minority graduation rate and is in an urban setting."
College Freshman,1,"Athletics? There are no athletics here. We have few intramural teams, but honestly, why do we even have a mascot if we have no varsity sports?!"
College Sophomore,1,UCD does not have major athletics (only a hockey team). Metro State does (which shares the campus) and there are a few sports related clubs.
College Freshman,1,Almost completely non-existent. Parties and drinking practically do not exist.
College Junior,1,"Campus Is Bad – The campus for UCD is shared by 2 other colleges, Metro State and the Community College of Denver.  It is crowded, it is dirty, the buildings and classrooms are old and outdated.  If you walk around campus outside, it is full of trash, especially cigarette butts littering every available piece of ground.  Because the campus is in downtown Denver, there are also a lot of homeless people wandering around and no one does anything about it.  They go hang out in the library when it's cold and take up space that students need for studying and no one does anything about that either.  If it wasn't one of only 2 schools in CO that offer the program I'm taking and wasn't $1000 cheaper a semester to go to, I wouldn't be going here."
College Sophomore,1,The University of Colorado medical campus is in a poor neighborhood. I wouldn't live near by if they paid me to do so. In general housing in the Denver metro area is fairly priced.
College Freshman,1,"If you want good parking you are going to pay $6-$8, uncovered and covered, respectively. If you want a cheap spot, say $3-$5, you're going to have to walk a mile to get to class. They don't offer parking passes. Almost all the lots are full by noon which doesn't help me because I have a 1pm class."
College Sophomore,1,"Booze  and Mary Jane – Therre is a HUGE drinking problem and marijuana use in the dorms, campus village, I have seen it first hand as I used to live there. I know for a fact that certain people ""patrolling"" there have let people get away with severely illegal activities. Not cool at all. People smok weed in the parking garages all the time too."
College Freshman,1,You can search for hours to park. They keep eliminating parking to build new buildings. You have to stalk people for their parking space.
College Junior,1,"There is not enough now that they have built new buildings, so now there is less"
College Freshman,1,"Too Much Smoking – There is way too much smoking on campus, and it gets annoying at times. I wish there would be a stricter policy on how far away from a building one must be to be able to smoke. The drinking is not nearly as bad."
College Sophomore,1,"Snow & Cold – It snows a lot sometimes in the winter, but classes rarely get cancelled, or campus never closes or has delays. It can be dangerous going to school in temperatures below zero or freezing, icy road conditions, when the city is on accident alert, and when it is still snowing hard and the wind is blowing hard."

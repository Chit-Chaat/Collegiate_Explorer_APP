Sophomore,5,I am taking over half of my courses online. The professors are very helpful in replying to emails when I have a question. They set up their online classes in a manner in which is easily navigated. The courses have the same quality material being online as they would being in-person in my opinion.
Sophomore,5,"West Virginia University Institute of Technology is wonderful! The professors are kind and caring. They take time to get to know their students by name. They are always willing to help. Not only are the professors great, but the campus is too! It is small and everyone greets you in passing. I feel as if I am enriched in more diverse culture now more than ever."
Freshman,5,The professors are great to work with. The food at the bears den could be better and the cook's work well with people that have severe food allergies. Dorm life is decent as long as you like your suite mates and/or roommate. There is not much around the campus to do without driving five to ten minutes into town.
Freshman,5,"West Virginia University Institute of Technology is a close knit type of campus. The campus is small, but that makes making friends a lot easier. The classes are no more than 50 people max but they decrease when you take classes that focuses on your major. The staff that works on campus are very nice and want to see you succeed."
Niche User,5,"I am taking online classes through the Tech and they work very well with you, always there when you need to talk to them about any problems or technical difficulties. They are super nice whenever you call in about a problem that you have. The teachers really show a care to the students. Overall my experience has been great and I look forward to much more, well spent time with this school."
Sophomore,5,This is a small town school so everyone pretty much knows everyone else. Teachers are helpful and nice but will make sure you know the information. This school is currently working on growing their programs.
Freshman,5,"The professors are prepared and they want you to succeed. The students are friendly and you can always find someone to talk with. The school facilities are modest but they’re just right. I’m an international and I’ve been welcomed here like I’m part of the American culture. The athletes and students also want to succeed and there are people that inspire you to always work hard. I’m looking forward to the remaining of the school year. Beckley is sketchy in some places but nowhere near the school, so you’ll be alright. The dorm rooms are actually in good condition and the food is pretty good, they offer a lot of options."
Senior,5,"The faculty and staff at WVU Tech treat every student like they are important, heard, and cared for. Great environment for an education."
Freshman,5,"If you're looking for a small school with great STEM programs, this is the place. The teachers are very helpful towards their students, especially if the student shows a good work ethic. Although it is a small school, there are still some great sports teams to watch on and off campus. The school is also on the cheaper end for a quality STEM degree at the end of the tunnel. The student body is very active and there are many clubs on campus for a variety of subjects. It is also very easy to create a club if a student desires."
Niche User,5,"I am an ""early enrollment"" High School student. I have toured the school on several occasions and I absolutely LOVE it. The staff there are amazing and the over-all atmosphere is very warming and friendly. I have no other college in mind for my undergrad degree!"
Freshman,5,"While WVU-Tech is a relatively small campus with small student to faculty ratios, the overall feel of the university rivals that of larger institutions."
College Junior,5,Our administration really cares about the students success and our overall education. They want to know and want to help when we have struggles and they want to be there for our achievements too.
College Junior,5,"The college may seem small and uninteresting to someone from a big town or with high expectations, but this college is far from. There is always something to do and someone to do it with. This campus is full of friendly, amazing people, and tons of activities. I'd always chose this school if given the chance to chose again."
College Junior,5,The Greek life on this campus is where you will find your leaders and your most dedicated and full of spirit students. I happen to be apart of Greek life as well and it has had a huge positive impact on me.
College Junior,5,Our athletics are amazing. Our whole school is very supportive over all of our teams.
College Junior,5,"This school has become my home. I have become an amazing student, a dedicated leader, and a great asset to those around me. I wouldn't be who I am without Tech."
College Sophomore,5,Diversity on campus is very prominent. Students don't regularly discriminate against others because they're different from them.
College Sophomore,5,The students at Tech are pretty great. They're all pretty accepting. There aren't many things a person can do that will make them accepting. A regular student wouldn't feel that they're any less than maybe a well-known athlete and the athletes all mingle together. It gives students a nice homely feeling where they can truly be themselves.
College Junior,5,I would refer my school for mechanical engineering to any person who aspires to be one.
College Junior,5,There are people from all around the world
Freshman,4,This college is great for my needs. I live close by and have two jobs in the same area so it is a great location. The staff has so far all been very kind and helpful and I like all of my professors.
Freshman,4,"I like the diversity of WVU Tech, there are people from all over the world here and I find that very interesting. The one thing that I would say that needs improving would be the campus itself, but with the location of the college it is difficult to give it a ""college campus"" type aesthetic."
Freshman,4,So far I have had a great experience at WVU Tech! My classes have been a little harder than the institution I transferred from. The food is awesome and my dorm at University Hall is really nice. I just wish there were more things to do. Also.. there should be fraternity/sorority houses on campus in my opinion.
Junior,4,"A good school with a good reputation, a good culture, and good classmates who are more interested in succeeding than getting wasted (unlike some other WVU campuses). A few fatal flaws include a few poor teachers and terrible food."
Freshman,4,I like Tech because it offers my program and it’s close to home. It’s small but not too small. The campus offers great security so everyone feels safe.
Junior,4,very good school for academics. Engineering professors are really good and professional. the only problem is the lack of activities in a small city such as beckley and the college life is not very active. Also it is not very good if you want to party. Athletics is pretty good. Men soccer team won championship in the last two years as well as the men basketball team. Almost every team went to the final tournament. Gym facilities are not really good.
Senior,4,"I really enjoy the small classes size that allow students to develop a relationship with the professors. I would like for the school to have more research opportunities and more options for time of classes, since many classes only have one schedule option and it is often conflicting with many other classes."
Freshman,4,"My experience here has beem awesome. All professors I have had were very friendly, and taught the required material very well. The walks to each class are not very far, even if walking from one end of campus to the other. 10 minutes are given to go to the next class if a student has one immediately after, and this is sufficient time to get there. All buildings have WiFi, and this is very nice. The only thing I would like to see change is the drainage system in the parking lot next to Life Science Building, as when it rains, it's basically a river that covers your feet as you walk through it."
Freshman,4,They make you feel at home and are always trying to help. Offering many varieties of helping option to not only get you started and settled in but to also help you keep the grades you are striving for. I would like to see the flag pole become safe so we can fly the American flag outside of our building. We need a flag!
Sophomore,4,The small class sizes make for a very personal experience as you get more one on one time with the professors. The school has a widely respected Engineering program.
College Freshman,4,The school is very supportive of all the sports teams no matter what they may be and the athletes get very good recognition for their hard work and dedication.
College Freshman,4,"This college is very helpful and they make it so easy on students by answering questions, picking up the phone, and getting to know the students at the university."
College Freshman,4,the rooms are perfectly spacious.
College Freshman,4,Every student is friendly and tutors are great
College Junior,4,I don't really hear much about anything negative.
College Junior,4,It's okay for the size and price of the campus.
College Freshman,4,"West Virginia University Institute of Technology is a great school because of the small classes, professors actually get to know you and help with work which I believe makes it an overall great college experience."
College Junior,4,I love the professors. They are very helpful. The class size is also a plus because you get more one-on-one time with the professors.
College Junior,4,Tech has a career fair at least twice a year. Very beneficial.
College Sophomore,4,"There are rules in place, however administration still realizes that we are college students and grown or growing adults so they allow us that space to be who we're going to be and do what we're going to do. They are very serious about drinking and drugs though. Which some students don't like but at the end of the day those things can become very hazardous if there is no limit put on them."
College Sophomore,4,I think it's great that there is no application fee. A lot of schools don't realize that application fees can make students not want to apply to their school. The actual application itself didn't make me want to pull out my hair because it was simple yet thorough.
College Sophomore,4,There are many international students who bring in their own culture
College Sophomore,4,The only thing is that the campus is in the middle of nowhere
College Sophomore,4,"Train right across the street. Runs Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Sunday"
College Sophomore,4,The campus itself has a relatively low crime rate. Outside of the campus is a little higher/
College Junior,4,It Is  More Challenging As You Go Higher In Your Major
College Junior,4,"I Love The Athletics. I Just Wish We Had Another Court, LikeA Practice Court So The Different Sports Won't Interfere With Each Others Practice Times"
College Junior,4,The Computers In The Library And Student SUccess Center Are Great. The Computers In Old Main Are Pretty Slow.
College Junior,4,$17/hour....40 hours a week.... You will learn a lot and understand the use of college courses in work industry.
College Junior,4,It is a dry campus and tobacco free.
College Senior,4,"The professors are great, most of them really want to see you succeed and will help as much as they can if you ask.  Not an amenity at a larger school ."
College Freshman,4,I did receive some aid and loans.  Still applying for more.
College Freshman,4,WVU Tech provides adequate computers for students.
College Freshman,4,"I participate with the cross country team.  By participating, I have made new friends and adapted to college life.  I was also given shoes, warmups, and other equipment to help perform.  "
College Freshman,4,"I don't really need a vehicle on campus because the dorms and classes are in a two (2) block radius.  The college also provides a police station which monitors the parking area for students and staff.  As of this year, West Virginia Institute of Technology's enrollment is approximately 1200 students, therefore the number of vehicles on campus is minimal compared to larger colleges.  I am very pleased with cost of a student parking permit.  The high school I attended last year was nearly doubled.  "
College Freshman,4,"At WVU Tech, unless you hang with the right people you would never know if there's an illegal substance being used or if there are student drinking alcohol.  The campus police officers and the faculty work really hard the keep illegal drugs and alcohol away from the campus."
College Sophomore,4,"The food, that I have ate, is delicious. However, it's still not like home."
College Sophomore,4,"Parking is fine, except that the only lot that usually has an empty space if forever away."
College Sophomore,4,"I am currently an intern for the state and the workload for an Accountant major is not terrible. It does get harder, but never more than an average student can handle as long as they work and study."
College Sophomore,4,"There are plenty of areas of study, but there is a limit considering it is a Technical College. They are now increasing their areas of study though and have even picked up Creative Writing as a minor."
College Sophomore,2,They only serve food that actually looks edible maybe once a week. And twice on a good week. They don't follow all the health precautions like they should and they know it but they don't seem to care.
College Junior,2,No Places To Go And Have Fun At Night On Campus
College Senior,2,We have a few good places. There are no late night options & it gets dull after a few times at the same places.
College Senior,2,"The only night life is the occasional frat party, or once in a blue moon house party."
College Senior,2,"There's a few local restaurants, one sketchy bar with a pool table, & no night life. No where is open past 11 which makes for boring nights & weekends."
College Freshman,2,"Only a few fast food, one Mexican, one Japanese.  That is all."
College Freshman,2,"As many people may know, Montgomery, WV is really small. The off-campus dining option are not very close, they are atleast 10-20 minutes away but the options are fair. There are a variety of restaurants which range from fast-food to fine dining. The key issue would be getting to the restaurants which explains why it would recieve a ""C""."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a bus and a train that run by WV Tech, but other than that, walking or driving are your only options."
College Sophomore,2,"IT has its good days, and bad days. I just wish it could be a little better."
College Freshman,2,"Like at most schools, certain sports receive more attention then others. Soccer, basketball and softball are the sports that receive the most attention where volleyball receives little to no attention. The gymnasium is good for the size of the school, which means its enough to accommodate the majority of the student body, if necessary. The fields are decent and kept up fairly well, but facilities like the weight room are lacking when compared to other schools. Its rundown and majority of the equipment is broken, but they are in the process of renovating it. Another facility that is good is the swimming pool. It's heated, and completely open to the public. Its extremely well kept."
College Freshman,2,"The computers are pretty outdated in certain parts of the school. Apple Mac and high end computers in the engineering buildings, but old Dell computers, that are still usable in the library. Most students have nice computers so using the schools computers is hardly ever considered."
College Sophomore,2,"Time for a Upgrade. The school is in need of some major upgrades to be able to attract new students, they recently upgraded the pool and are having a swim team this year for the first time in a long time, other facilities are not even located on campus, as a soccer player we have to travel to approx. 40 minutes to our home field, locker rooms are old and need upgraded."
College Senior,2,"Maintenance and Student Input Issues – The housing staff is abnormally slow when it comes to repairs and maintenance, and the staff is not open to following through with much of what the students would like to do.  Such as an activity to get to know everyone in your hall."
College Senior,2,A Valiant Effort – The cooks here at wvu tech work hard and are very appreciated but the foods do not cater to everyones needs. there is not enough variety and the kitchen is stuck in their country homestyle dishes. I typically enjoy the food but I do not complain much I have overheard other students giving the food a bad review
College Sophomore,2,"Needs Work – I am going to the community college part of WVU tech. Its not a very ""high tech"" or ""fun"" place to hang out. Needs some MAJOR work. Overall i give it a C because I am getting what i need out of it. my education."
College Junior,2,"Nothing Within 10 Minutes – Montgomery is a small town in WV. There is a Dairy Queen to eat in montgomery, and a McDonalds, Taco Bell, and a Tudors across the bridge in Smiters. There is a Faily dollar and a Dollar General if you need something. Other than that there is nothing to do around town. if you want somethin to do you have to drive 30-45 minutes away to Beckley or Charleston area. There are a lot of things to do there."
College Sophomore,2,"Refuses to Close – Snow, sleet, rain, or hail Tech will always remain open, we only had a delay this year. Most of the student body is in the commuting part so sometimes when it is bad weather, Attendance shows how bad it really is."
College Junior,1,2 Frats. No sororities. Enough said.
College Junior,1,Practically no parties ever heard of
College Sophomore,1,Food is terrible and meal plan is not cool. I have nothing nice to say about the dining.
College Freshman,1,"There are only private parties at houses off campus, but few."
College Senior,1,The dorms on campus are not safe at all. If you have a key you can get into any part of one dorm. Their is no security at the enterances so anyone can stay for an unlimited amount of time.
College Freshman,1,"The options are very limited for variety and the hours are simply not compatible for a student's lifestyle. The cafeteria serves dinner from 4-7 on the week days and from 4-6 on the weekends. Also, the dining hall does not open until 11:30 on the weekends."
College Senior,1,Greeks Are in the Shadows – If there are any greeks at wvu tech they are unheard of or receive little recognition. There are no parties or frats designated for the greeks. If their are Greeks here at tech I would like to meet them and learn some of their culture
College Junior,1,Get out of town!!!! Really there is nothing there for you. Our nights are hanging out in the Maclin lobby!
College Sophomore,1,"Our campus os boring. period. There is nothing to do outside of the classroom. No bars, clubs, hangout spots, nothing. If you dont have close friends.. well looks like you're packing on the hours and graduating early."

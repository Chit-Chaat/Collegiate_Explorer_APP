Senior,5,I absolutely adore Virginia Wesleyan University. It is an amazing school that helps you grow and find your place in the world. It feels like one big happy family. With the small class sizes you are able to receive more one on one attention with professors and peers. You can tell with the whole atmosphere that everybody is rooting for you and wants you to be the best that you can be!
Senior,5,Taking classes online is just as good as taking them in person. The class materials are all outlined and posted for you to view. The professors are available just as much as in person. You are still able to thrive just as good online. Communication is great online between students and and each other as well as students and their professors.
Freshman,5,"Love being near the beach, direct flights from New York & a major Navy hub.  Safe, clean suburban environment.  Niche reviews don’t reflect the dorm & campus facilities accurately. Beautiful new LEED building built sustainably for environmental science."
Freshman,5,Great school!! The faculty and administration care so much about the students and the resources are outstanding! The study abroad opportunities are endless and the Honors program is well put together.
Freshman,5,The professors are great to work with and understand how busy schedules can get. They really work with the students to ensure great success in their classes. They make it easy to stay on top of work during online learning.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Virginia Wesleyan university was awesome. The school is affordable, there are a lot of warm and welcoming people. The campus is clean and it smells fresh."
Alum,5,"My favorite thing about Wesleyan were the professors. They were always very responsive to anything I needed. The campus was beautiful and quiet to walk around, it always felt safe. The security personnel were always nice at the gate."
Freshman,5,It's so diverse and the staff refuse to let you do anything but succeed. there's always free tutors available and the lab is open constantly. the teachers work with you the best they can as well.
Junior,5,I love Virginia Wesleyan University ! I do not attend the University just yet but I have had dinner there & toured the campus & I must admit I'm in love. I will attend the Campus in Fall 2019 to study Criminal Justice and they have all the right programs for me. Virginia Wesleyan University has so many opportunities for the  students and I think they are doing a great job with all the students that will be attending in the future.
Freshman,5,This college surprised me with it's small and focused classes. The staff were friendly and accommodating.
Freshman,5,"The batten honors college is incredible and offers tons of opportunities and experiences. Dr. Easter will help you with whatever you need and she is incredible. The townhouses are also quite nice and were quite the incentive to get me to come. The caf food is ok, it's not as everybody makes it out to be."
Sophomore,5,the environment of the school is great and everyone around the campus is extremely nice. they offer wonderful major so for someone who is about to attend you wouldn't be disappointed.
Freshman,5,I love how Virginia Wesleyan University is so clean. I love how the professors are so professional and they help with any questions I have had in the past. I like how the campus is diverse. I wish I could have a one bedroom dorm but otherwise everything else is amazing!!!
Sophomore,5,"Virginia Wesleyan University is a very quiet place. Perfect for Academic excellence. I am a rising Sophomore and so far, I have had such a great experience. Students, faculty, and staff are friendly. If you are looking forward to joining clubs, then Virginia Wesleyan is the perfect college for you. There is a lot of organizations such as clubs and Greek life. Students establish a close academically relationship with faculty. The classes can only hold a few students, but again, this means that there is a higher academic performance rate. Has a great student body. The teachers are fun and very dedicated. So far with my stay here at VWU, I have always felt protected. The school provides the best security system. Although, I would say the food is not the best. They should improve the food by providing a lot of varieties. Besides that, I would Highly recommend this school to any student who is looking for a college to attend."
Sophomore,5,"Campus is really nice, and many things to see and do in the surrounding areas. Classes are small and professors are helpful, you'll receive a great education. Athletes show support for all sports on campus."
Alum,5,"It is actually known as Virginia Wesleyan University now, and it was such a pleasure to go here. Like my high school, it was a bit on the smaller side and I ended up having multiple classes with the same professors. This allowed a good relationship between the professors and the students, at least it did for me. If I were at a larger school, I probably would have been a little more hesitant to go and talk to professors if having an issue, but here? Never felt like there wasn't any professor who couldn't help."
Niche User,5,"One thing I liked is how protected the campus was. Another thing is the fact that you're right near the ocean. If you want to go to popular amusements parks, it's not a long drive to any of those either. The food at Virginia Wesleyan was really good. They have a variety of foods whether you're vegetarian, vegan, or you just can't eat gluten."
Alum,5,"Great university that allowed me to learn from professors in a small classroom size, which gave me the advantage to form close relationships with my professors and peers. The campus is small making it easy to get from class to class without any issues. The size of the incoming classes are also small as well."
Sophomore,5,My experience at Virginia Wesleyan has been very nice. I like how diverse the school is and how involved the school staff is with the students. Virginia Wesleyan seems like a safe and secure environment. The only thing I would want them to change is to add a football team.
Junior,5,"I like that it is a closed community college, I always feel safe walking from the building to my car at night. It's a tight knit community where everyone knows everyone (for the most part). The classes are smaller than most universities so you get a better learning experience. All of the staff are pretty nice and helpful and I always feel welcomed when I'm on campus."
Freshman,5,"Coming to VWU, formerly VWC, has been a great experience. I love my professors, the students, and everything I’ve learned in my first semester as a college student."
Senior,5,"Virginia Wesleyan has great small class sizes and professors and staff that are always willing to work with you. The campus is beautiful in all seasons, and you're never far away from a beach or shopping experience!"
Freshman,5,"I loved my first year at Virginia Wesleyan. I made so many friends and learned so much. There are many athletic and intellignet people around campus. There is always something to do, whether that be joining clubs, going to the beach, exploring downtown Norfolk and Virginia Beach. There is a pretty good party scene mainly thrown by the athletic students."
Freshman,5,"I love Virginia Wesleyan! The people, the programs, and the school itself are the perfect fit for me and my goals for the future!"
Alum,5,Great school great professors and great diversity. Overall a wonderful school but the down side is that it's a private school so tuition will vary and tends to increase each year.
Freshman,5,"I have had a great experience so far at VWC. The professors are very helpful and the workload is very manageable. There is plenty to do in the area and on campus, so you will hardly ever find yourself with nothing to do."
College Junior,5,"Overall, I enjoy the education and professors here on this campus. The classes are challenging and I feel a personal connection with the facility members. They cater to the needs of the students and understand things happen in life that takes people off track during the semester. I like how the classroom sizes are small and the courses are interesting. I believe the staff and education keep the students motivated and willing to continue being associated with this college,"
College Sophomore,5,"I think that diversity is very much celebrated at VWC and people for the most part are very accepting and open to ethic/racial diversity, economic background, political beliefs, and sexual orientation. I think there is some pressure for students to participate in going to church, but it is a Wesleyan college, so that really isn't a surprise, it's actually expected. But as a mixed-race (white and African-American) atheist, I have not been discriminated by anyone on campus as of yet, and I don't really expect to be anytime in the future."
College Sophomore,5,"I have had an amazing experience with my professors and courses at Virginia Wesleyan. I have formed very good relationships with a couple of my professors, one being both my academic advisor for my English major and my women's and gender studies minor, and my academic advisor for my theatre major. I have taken a wide variety of classes my freshman year. Because they are a liberal arts college, VWC requires students to earn a certain amount of credits from core subjects including math, science (lab), history, arts/theatre, and english."
College Sophomore,5,"I do feel incredibly safe on campus. Our campus has only one entrance and exit which is manned 24/7 be security. Our campus also takes advantage of the live safe app which students can use to track their friends' location if they are walking back to their dorm late at night, and if there is an emergency, it can alert authorities immediately of any danger. Our campus also had a huge sexual assault awareness informative program last year for all freshmen (which is what I was) and they really pushed the message across about how wrong sexual assault is."
College Freshman,5,I am enjoying my experiences thus far at VWC. I am looking forward to become more involved in the campus community.
College Freshman,5,I love my fraternity and the other organizations on campus
College Freshman,5,I love my school and the students and staff that attend. They Faculty is help in whatever field they are in just the school is really expensive and I wish I had more money not to worry about it.
College Sophomore,5,I love Virginia Wesleyan College.  I feel so welcome by everyone and I actually know my professors.
College Junior,5,"I am very pleased with my school and I am lucky to be attending. I love all the staff i have met with, they are wonderful people. I also like how the school is small and you can get to know everyone on a more personal level."
College Sophomore,5,it is difficult to compete in the increasing larger class sizes that the classrooms are not made for. The most important criteria for admission are that you try hard and get good grades in high school. They want to know they are accepting students with the will and drive to succeed and achieve and education and success in life.
College Freshman,5,The financial aid office is a lifesaver!
College Junior,5,"It great, everybody is different."
College Junior,5,"I have learned so much, so far and that was ultimately what I wanted from a school. I can't imagine being anywhere else."
College Junior,5,It feels very safe on campus.
College Junior,5,"The students and staff are definitely what set us apart form other schools. It is a community of friends and everyone wants to help one another. The professors are so intelligent and inspiring. Even the custodians, security, and other workers are part of the community. Everyone gets to know each other and everyone said hi, seems pretty simple but I love how friendly everyone is."
College Junior,5,The Athletic support is great!
College Freshman,5,I always look foward to dining off campus with friends and family.
College Freshman,5,Everyone is very easy to get along with. Everyone here is friendly.
College Freshman,5,Going off campus is always a pleasure for me. Going to the beach were the best parts.
College Freshman,5,"I have yet to participate in Greek life, but am looking foward to maybe trying it."
College Freshman,5,"The educational experience for me was difficult, but I was able to pull through."
College Freshman,5,Through the scholarships and finacial aid I able to afford coming here.
College Freshman,5,I wouldn't trade my overall first year experience at VWC for the world.
College Freshman,5,Just as long as you obide by the rules you don't have to worry about anything.
College Freshman,5,These events are were I have made the most friends. People are just so nice and friendly here.
College Freshman,5,The health and safety is extremely present on campus. I'd you'll see a security guard roaming every five minutes on campus at the least.
College Freshman,5,It is a very wonderful experience and I enjoy every part of it.
College Freshman,5,There really isn't a drug scene on the Virginia Wesleyan campus.
College Freshman,5,Living on campus is the only way to get the full effect of being at college and my first year experience was wonderful. I enjoyed every bit of the campus life. From the small classroom settings to hanging out with my new friends on campus during the weekends. I wouldn't trade being at Virginia Wesleyan for the world.
College Freshman,5,The academic level is great and helpful...they want to see the students that try succeed
College Freshman,5,Many things you wouldn't normally have are provided in the dorms/apartments.
College Freshman,5,"We have an enclosed campus with only one road entrance where you have to show ID or be called on to campus. The security office always knows who's on campus, and checks ID before you're allowed passed the gate. Security also rides around in golf carts, bikes, and security trucks to make sure everything on campus is safe."
College Freshman,5,Our gym is beautiful and the basketball games are so much fun to attend.  Our athletic training staff is very talented and have lots of experience.  The athletic training facility is the nicest of all the schools in the conference.
College Junior,5,"I honestly love this school, all of the opportunities it provides makes it a great place to go to."
Freshman,4,I've just recently started going through VWU for an online Business degree. My professors have been nice and helpful and my advisors are great! I'm excited for what's to come!
Freshman,4,I've just recently started going through VWU for an online Business degree. My professors have been nice and helpful and my advisors are great! I'm excited for what's to come!
Alum,4,"Professors are absolutely amazing and the classes I took are memorable. However, some campus security staff are needlessly rude, and the dorm rooms have cleanliness issues."
Alum,4,"Professors are absolutely amazing and the classes I took are memorable. However, some campus security staff are needlessly rude, and the dorm rooms have cleanliness issues."
Alum,4,"The reason I came to Virginia Wesleyan was because of the opportunity beyond the classroom and for the athletic program. I played volleyball all four years of college and my experience was incredible. In addition, I was able to connect with several career-opportunities in the area like NATO and I was also given the opportunity to study abroad in Madrid, Spain. I was well connected in the community both on and off campus and I think that's what makes VWU special: its small size and ability to connect students with future resources."
Sophomore,4,"I love my schools, my teachers are amazing, the classes are so small that I really feel like I get to be a part of class rather than a spectator of it. I've had the opportunities for so many cool experiences such as working as a dramaturg on the school play which was an ancient Greek play that I got to finish writing because the ending doesn't exist anymore. My only complaints are mostly things that don't affect me, the dorms aren't great, and sometimes there's a lack of transparency from the school's administration."
Niche User,4,I visited Virginia Wesleyan last year as a junior in High School. I took a tour and it was very interesting indeed. I was interested in playing on the Women's tennis team. I was also interested in becoming a english teacher.
Freshman,4,"The food is not great, but the dining centers are getting remodeled so hopefully it will get better. The professors and staff are also very nice and understanding and helpful. The students there are all very polite. It's fun to call out my dorm room window to my neighbours and have conversations. Security is very tight, they make me feel very safe."
Alum,4,"VWU is a great liberal arts school. The small on-campus community provides wonderful care, the campus is beautiful, and the professors are brilliant and kind."
Freshman,4,Every staff member and student are very friendly! A great mix of academics and social events! The only thing that could be improved would be the dorms.
Freshman,4,The school is small and there are really nice buildings on campus. I enjoy the people and there is so much culture surrounding the area as well. The cafe isn't the greatest but they have many options including healthy ones. I think the gym since it is open early and late during the week.
Sophomore,4,"In my experience with Virginia Wesleyan College, I definitely was given the assistance needed by the professors which are passionate and concerns about their students' achievements and academics on and beyond the campus."
Junior,4,I've had really great experiences here with the students and staff. The faculty are always trying to make sure the students understand and love what they are learning.
Junior,4,It is a very close knit community which allows for your professors to be very involved and get to know you well.
Senior,4,"I like that the school is small. It is a tight knit community where everyone knows each other. Some of the dorms could use a face lift, but overall the experience is what YOU make it and I have enjoyed myself thus far."
Niche User,4,The campus was not too big and not too small. The tour guides were really nice and answered all my questions. The students on campus were friendly and were to answer some of our questions.
Freshman,4,"I like Virginia Wesleyan because of the small class settings where you can get more hands on, and one-on-one sessions with your professor. I'm also playing baseball here so being well known around campus is also a plus."
Junior,4,I have a good experience of meeting new peers and professors in class and outside of class. I enjoy taking the course that I took prior to my art major and other subject that will help me lead forward to multiple paths where the success will be found in the destination.
Niche User,4,"The staff at Virginia Wesleyan is very accessible. They are very open and welcoming. The small campus community allows for a tight bond between students, faculty, and staff. It does need a little updating, but with the new science building in the works I think that is on its way."
Freshman,4,VWC is a small private christan school. You connect with God and have many friends. The school life is okay and the classes are small. The people are welcoming and willing to help you in whatever you need to do. Campus is bright and always buzzing with activity. Their is something to do for everyone at VWC.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently A sophomore at Virginia Wesleyan College and have attended the school for a total of four semesters. I found the people on campus to be very welcoming and friendly towards new comers. The atmosphere was one that was very inviting and I was able to fit in easily. However, I found myself wanting more out of the school with regards to on campus life such as social events and things of that nature. I found that there was a lack in on campus events that got students really involved with their fellow peers and faculty on campus. I feel as though if more campus events took place, it would in turn create more unity among students campus wide. I have had a great experience so far with regards to living on campus. students living on campus. In conclusion, there are several areas of the campus that could use immediate reconsideration, but other than that I find Virginia Wesleyan to be a great school and my experience has been wonderful."
Sophomore,4,The people make the school what it is. The faculty is hands on and everyone is so friendly. It's a community where everyone talks to everyone and your school experience is completely what you make it.
Freshman,4,"Virginia Wesleyan College is a great school to attend. They have all different types of majors and their academics are amazing. The athletics are good and student life is fantastic. You can do lots of things at VWC and you will never get bored. The clubs they have are great and you can even make your own club. Virginia Wesleyan College really takes care of their students. My experience as a freshman has do far been great. There are do many opportunities VWC gives their students. If you want to live the college life, VWC is the place to be. VWC is also around a lot of fun stuff. It is also extremely close to the beach, which is always fun. I do a lot of things at VWC because there always something going on. VWC id just a great place to get educated and have fun as well."
Freshman,4,"Being at VWC, it taught me that not only is it good to know your professors but that it's good to have a close relationship with them as well. In Many colleges a student is just a number in a class. At VWC you are not only a person, you are family. "
College Senior,4,There is always something to do or somewhere to go. A lot of activitiesto clear your mind.
College Senior,4,School spirit and athletes are huge at VWC. And the support they receive from staff and students is amazing.
College Senior,4,They help students as much as they can to continue and finish their degree with them.
College Senior,4,VWC ensures a safe campus (requiring ID at the entrance gate) in which harassment policies are updated and implemented often.
College Senior,4,"This school is safe, clean, small and friendly. As an older transfer student from a community college, I can definitely say that a majority of students are younger and com straight from high school. While everyone is accommodating, and older student who keeps to themselves can tend to get lost in the crowd easily - what I mean by that is, the faculty and staff tend to believe we won't need as much guidance as the younger ones and let us be on our own for the most part. 

If you reach out, they are certainly going to accommodate, which is excellent. 

Staff from the business office, security, financial aid, even to the bookstore are all wonderful, helpful and efficient."
College Senior,4,"VWC is a small school, which personally, fits me best. Aside from my personal preference, the small size creates a closer sense of community and agreeableness. 

Every faculty member is easy to reach, and even staff from each department are always readily available and genuinely listen and care in which what one has to say. 

The price point is a tad high, but being a private school, there does tend to be some additional grants for attending such a school, which is a nice leg-up when you really need it."
College Freshman,4,The college is a gated campus. Security ID's everyone on the way in so no one just walks around campus with out a reason to be there. You can also call security to walk you to your dorm at night which makes me feel very safe. VWC as a community also uses the LiveSafe app which helps students easily contact security or report suspicious activity.
College Freshman,4,"They have options for everyone, even single dorms and apartments/townhouses on campus. Dorms are co-ed by floor and bathrooms in the regular villages are communal. If you request a roommate and they request you then you are almost guaranteed to end up together, which is really nice. Overall, everyone at this school is very friendly and helpful, so if you have questions they're more than happy to help."
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very nice and helpful here! It's a good school and there's a sense of community here that I haven't felt anywhere else.
College Freshman,4,Its not really about how many people show up it is more like something we all do as a school if we wanted to to cheer on our school and support our athletes
College Sophomore,4,"I have not looked into internships yet because I am only beginning my sophomore year, but one experience I had that showed me that the value of a degree from this school is high is when one my Script Analysis professor had a guest speaker come to class who happened to be an alumni. The speaker's career was a professional dramaturg, and she talked about how her job took her all across the country, and how soon she would be going to Japan to do research for a particular show. This experience really showed me how important a degree from VWC can be, and it even inspired me to seriously consider being a dramaturg."
College Sophomore,4,"So far, I have enjoyed my time being a full-time student at Virginia Wesleyan College. The main reason why I chose to attend this college is because of the small population of students, the small campus, and the small class sizes. Being able to have easy and as much access as possible to my professors is really important to me. I wanted to attend a college where the professors would know me by name, and that is exactly what I got while attending Virginia Wesleyan. Students and professors are very friendly and approachable, and the community at VWC as a whole is very welcoming and positive. 

Although the campus is small, there are plenty opportunities to get involved with clubs, sports and organizations. I have been a part of my school's newspaper The Marlin Chronicle, and I also performed in a couple of one-act plays, and the spring musical. Despite coming almost 700 miles away from my home state of 18 years (Ohio), I was still able to make friends with many people because it didn't matter that I was from another state. Like many students attending VWC, I didn't grow up in the Norfolk/Virginia Beach area or in Virginia. Overall, my experience has been a great one, and I would definitely choose to attend Virginia Wesleyan again if I could to do it all over."
College Freshman,4,Enjoying my experiences thus far.
College Freshman,4,There many athletic activities available on campus for everyone to partake in. I am not an athlete so I greatly appreciate the activities that are available to me.
College Sophomore,4,"Everything is pretty diverse. parties, classes sports teams."
College Sophomore,4,There is not much drug activity on campus.
College Senior,4,The campus have many resources and assistance for any medical or safety concern
College Senior,4,Small campus very easy to contact the pofessors.at any time
College Senior,4,Services on campus are avaiable throughout the day and even job assistance for alumni
College Senior,4,"Greek life is a large part of campus activities, however students that commute to campus have a harder time attending the social activities on campus"
College Senior,4,Physical centers are available to faculty and students
College Senior,4,"Very engaging, professors very proficient in teaching"
College Freshman,4,Living on campus has been a great experience. I found the dorms to be reletively clean and spacious. Each student is given their own fridge and microwave in the dorms.
College Freshman,4,Greek life is a huge part of the campus community at Virginia Wesleyan. It is fun and very inclusive
College Freshman,4,Virginia Wesleyan is a great community of scholars that strive the pursue excellence and help others do the same. It is a welcoming community that forces you to think outside the box and be more creative.
College Junior,4,Many opportunities for nightlife on or off campus.
College Junior,4,Academics are rigorous. Professors have high standards. Workload varies depending on class. Writing classes have a tremendous amount of assignments. Not uncommon to have over 15 papers due in one class
College Junior,4,Safety officers are real policemen and know your name on campus. The campus is very safe but the neighborhood around the campus has a lot of crime. The city of Norfolk is also dangerous and I would recommend travelling in groups when leaving campus.
College Junior,4,Courses are rigorous and in most cases professors are there to help you but are very firm on due dates. Great liberal arts education and general education requirements are tough and in some cases seem irrelevant to what I'm majoring in. It's hard to get in all the classes you want because a great deal is offered only in spring or fall. Very few quality offerings in January.
College Junior,4,Freshman dorms are old and out of date. Free laundry services and WiFi in all dorms. Apartments and town houses are very spacious and up to date.
College Junior,4,High level of support and spirit for Varsity sports. Great opportunities to get involved in all types of extracurricular sports and activities on campus. Students are highly spirited and enjoy supporting all the team's.
College Junior,4,Virginia Wesleyan is a small close community of students and teachers. The campus is beautiful and dorms are very up to date. I feel like I have grown tremendously academically and have gained a sense of service and maturity because I've gone to school here. The professors are very helpful and the learning centers are very supportive for those of us who struggle academically. There are many opportunities for internships and mentorship. The only things that would deter me from this school again is the cost which is much higher than public schools but very competitive with other private colleges. Also the college needs to improve its student council which have no idea how to use due process for conflicts.
College Sophomore,4,"I am very happy with my college choice. I am not a number here. My professors know my name and care about my education. If I would do it all again, I would not change a thing"
College Freshman,4,I start my freshman year of college this falll of 2015. So far I have been to one orientation and it was so nice there. Everyone was friendly and I felt like I was at home.  College is right around the corner and I am so excited to be attending VWC.
College Senior,4,Virginia Wesleyan is a beautiful campus. I love the fact that I can build a relationship with my professors and easily make friends. Everything is easily accessible and it's fun place to be. If i could do school all over again VWC wouldn't be my first option due to the lack of Greek Life and other fun events other places have.
College Sophomore,4,I only feel unsafe on campus when walking behing batten/boyd. I have had multiple friends robbed/attacked there or followed by sketchy people. its not the security gate in fault but the ease for strangers ti walk on campus from behing the baseball/softball fields
Sophomore,2,"The food, dorms, and policies were all below reasonable standards. Earlier this Spring, Wesleyan was even on the news for how disgusting and even dangerous its dorms are. I personally know someone who got black mold in their lungs due to its placement in the dorms. Unfortunately, said person received no restitution and has even been placed back in the same dorms that could cause her additional physical harm, despite a doctor's note specifying the need for better housing conditions."
Freshman,2,"This school is a scam. They trap students here. Financial aid is near impossible and it is difficult to transfer out. Residence halls are outdated and disgusting. This school would fail a health and safety inspection. There is mold in the living areas. There are bolts in the food, which is not always fully cooked."
Freshman,2,"The methods were very hard to understand. It's so easy to be left behind in the class. People were loud on every floor it just gave me the feel of immature people in elementary school. The college is way to expensive for what you stay for. $41,000 a year and you learn nothing."
Niche User,2,"Academics are okay, if you're in the honors college. .The college is tiny and if you don't play sports you won't find friends and won't be able to fit in. Housing and facilities aren't great either."
Sophomore,2,"Nice people Great Area! Confusing profs not easy! Many teachers don't update grades nor mid-term grades till end of semester! Don't take foreign language here unless u already know some of it.
Food's trash! most days either raw/bloody or dry/overcooked! Rarely some days food good
Most Dorms rusty showers paper thin walls. 
Transfers get nice hotel room in Wingate or Comfort inn! room cleaned 2×week. School van to pick up hotel students & bring back.
Homecoming: Don't expect much or buy prom dress crappy party.
Go to art gallery events food catered by ppl outside school. lamb chops & fancy cheese!
Roommates often chosen randomly
Not really a Christian School
Travel abroad nearly impossible & expensive
Library & in Batten unreasonable work study hours
Chapel really good don't be afraid to go! Pastor Greg's great! 
Love my friends & everyone & staff but & bad teaching food unreasonable work hours & expensive cost are reasons I'm transferring"
College Junior,2,"The dorm rooms are spacious. However, the cost of living on this campus is not affordable after a student's freshman year. The campus has a severe insect problem and villages one and two desperately need an update. I have personally had to remove a trash from a hall below me because there was not one provided for my hall for two weeks. In addition, maintenance does not provide toilet paper to tenants who have a share a bathroom or have their own because they do not manually clean them. However, I remember specifically receiving a weekly roll from maintenance when I had a private room. Ultimately I am disguised with the living situation on campus and happily forward to graduate so I no longer need to be associated with this college. I would not recommend students to live on campus or they need to transfer their freshman year. Overall, housing on campus is poor piss and there are no excuses for that especially when the tuition is  $34,960.00 per year not including standard room and board.  the campus is quick to take students money but does not execute well so they can see their monies worth."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no police at this school, which kind of makes it ok for students to drink underage. If security catches you drunk and you happen to be underage, you get written up. You don't get arrested. But honestly, there is no fun at this school unless you happen to be drunk."
College Sophomore,2,"Even though I was at a small school, and typically it's one on one with the professor, it didn't feel that way. There was a couple good professors that everyone knew about, but a lot of them sucked. And it's because they get paid very little compared to the average professor."
College Sophomore,2,"I went to the career services center once to get help with my resume and cover letter and I was not accepted for that job. They try to help, but a part of me thinks they don't know what they are doing.  As far as the value of a degree from the school goes, I don't think the value is very is worth very much considering you are paying 40k a year. When you tell yoir employer you go to ""Virginia Wesleyan"" 1, they won't know where that is, 2, it's acceptance rate is 93% according to Niche.com, so the value isn't worth much."
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone gets sick at this campus, leaving for winter break for a month and a half and coming back, you get sick. Going home for a weekend and coming back, you get sick. The nurse on campus can't prescribe, but she will give you OTC medications."
College Sophomore,2,"Athletics here aren't big. There was recently a football stadium built (don't get excited,) as its only used for flag football. Lacrosse is ""big"" at this school, but big meaning all the guys who play lacrosse think they are better then everyone else at the school."
College Sophomore,2,The security is terrible they get people in trouble for the wrong things.
College Sophomore,2,The rule enforcement is terrible. The housing is pretty dirty and could be updated.
College Sophomore,2,I am on a sports team here and i feel that we are not supported. By both the professors and the other non sports students.
College Freshman,2,The cleanliness can be a lot better the bathrooms are gross and there is a horrible smell in my residence hall.
College Junior,2,"Food is terrible. Not enough options, lines are always long and food that is prepared takes too long. Food also gives people diarrhea."
College Junior,2,"Rooms have flaws, the bathrooms are filthy, and maintenance works in the early hours in the mornings which wakes people up. Cost is way too high for what the rooms are."
College Junior,2,"you get what you pay for, which is not much."
College Junior,2,Most of the food isn't any better than what you can get at a fast food joint. Not to mention food is more expensive for commuters.
College Junior,2,"Primarily fast food chains are available off campus, so it's not the healthiest of options for a student."
College Freshman,2,It's Virginia. It's cold from October to May. We have fall for a month and spring for a week.
College Freshman,2,Greek life is not very popular on campus.  There are only 2 sororities and 1 frat that is popular.
College Freshman,2,Our school doesn't really offer off-campus housing.  It's up to the student to find a house or apartment to rent.
College Sophomore,2,You need a car or a roommate with a car if you ever want or need anything off of campus. 
College Sophomore,2,"The campus dining is okay when it comes to sitting arrangements and layout design.  What makes the dining bad is that it doesn't offer food that is good.  The idea behind the dishes are thought out but aren't prepared well.  Using the Grille is nice every once in a while but the flex dollars run out fast because it can be expensive.  A better way to use the flex dollars would be to get outside food places onto campus like Chick- fil- a, Starbucks, or Pizza Hut.  Students end up spending way more money traveling off campus to get fast food than eating in the dining hall."
College Freshman,2,the campus food is not that great and the times are not the best. 
College Student,2,Not enough major options available. good internship opportunities though.
College Student,2,At all parties on campus you will find drugs and alcohol
College Freshman,2,You have some foreign students 
College Freshman,2,Too small and needs renovating and repairs
College Freshman,2,They have a shuttle bus. Peolpe walk skateboard ride bikes and scooters and most drive.
College Freshman,2,Not too sure about Greek life
College Sophomore,2,There is a lot of parking on campus. Most of the spots though are located away from the center of campus. By mid-day the central parking lot is full and you may have to park across campus.
College Freshman,2,"This school in my opinion does not have an interesting amount of diversity. There is unfortunately only 1% Asian and 7% Latino. The school is 59% White, and 23% Black. Now coming from a school where the races mingled with each other was great! I loved it . Sadly, when I came to Va Wesleyan the white people hung out it groups and the black people hung out in groups. It was extremely disappointing that they didn't really mingle together /: At my high school we all hung around as one. I just observed at VWC the races hang out in groups and don't really mingle together. "
College Junior,2,"There really isn't any transportation for students on campus. The school just came up with ""The Marlin Transit"", which provides transportation to only Walmart I believe."
College Sophomore,2,We often get emails about random scholarships but that is really it. There are not really events promoting scholarships or even advisors telling us to go after them. I feel financial aid should play a bigger role in that.
College Freshman,2,I think that for the girls there could be alot more variety of sororities and they are not really advertised here.  I think that it has a good balance but it is often overlooked
College Junior,2,"I live in the Townhouses this year, which I would give an A (The maintenance crew did an awesome job fixing issues this year).

Unfortunately, last year I lived in Teagle. My room and our suite bathroom had leaks in the ceiling, which wasn't dealt with for about three months (the dean finally came to check out the problem himself due to parental complaints). There was black mold growing in my room, and all they did was hire the cleaning lady to spray bleach on it. My suite-mates had an ant and spider infestation in their room, and it was not dealt with for over four weeks.

Greek housing and the apartments are pretty clean, though. I would give them an A-."
College Freshman,2,"The guys and girls at VWC are mostly athletes. They may be nice to look at, but certainly not to talk to (depending on your interests)."
College Freshman,2,"Lots of flooding, bring rain boots! During hurricane Sandy everywhere around school was flooded. Cars were covered by water all around Norfolk. Our school only announced which days we were to miss the night before. This made it so many of us were trapped on campus."
Freshman,1,"Would not recommend this school to anyone, my standard high school classes were more challenging, my housing, despite being some of the most expensive offered (I was forced to stay there due to being in the honors college which was a joke) was terrible, staff, especially reslife, was extremely unprofessional, I was barely able to eat in the dining hall because the time it was open was almost exclusively when I was in classes but I still had to buy the most expensive meal plan. Overall the worst experience I've ever had and I ended up transferring after one semester"
Junior,1,"David Stuebing is possibly the worst person to run a Residence life ever! Come to this school if you want to be required to live on campus all 4 years, and have nobody to have your back when you need help with your living situation. There is black mold in the AC vents. There are juniors and seniors in freshman dorms! Needs to be fixed. Stop building solar flowers and building when students need a place to live!"
Sophomore,1,"This was the WORST experience of my college life. I took exactly one semester and that was All that was needed. Not only is this school expensive, 33% more expensive than ANY other private school, they have offered absolutely NO help with paying them back. All they did was slap a piece of paper with a few websites up there and told me I was on my own. The staff are NO help. They give you this pitiful little smile and shrug and give no other help. The school is run down and absolutely NOTHING about it is worth $17,000 A SEMESTER!!!!! Nothing. The school is run down and they even have brown water running from their faucet in the Batton Student Center. The teachers in the science labs have poor teaching methods, so you kind of feel like your on your own with no help the whole time. My main problem is the cost of it. I realized I made the biggest mistake of my life by going here. DO NOT GO HERE!"
Sophomore,1,"This school is incredibly expensive and for absolutely no reason. The food is terrible, the dorms are small and insect-infested, the teachers are mediocre at best, and security is an absolute joke. Do not waste your time or money here, I wish I hadn't and can not wait to leave."
Recent Alumnus,1,Campus security takes their job way to seriously
Recent Alumnus,1,I am embarrassed to say I attended VWC
Recent Alumnus,1,Expensive for ancient dorms.  Off campus is better
Recent Alumnus,1,The greek life is tiny and full of goofballs.
Recent Alumnus,1,No money and small school equals bad athletics
Recent Alumnus,1,Horrible overall from social life to class.
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife doesn't happen, unless you go to a club off campus. The two main ones people go to are Peabody and Rainbow."
College Sophomore,1,"Few parties, the only ""real""  parties have to be approved by security first,  and they have a ton of rules to abide by.  Greek life hosts majority of the parties on campus, but they all suck.  And of course, you will find the occasional dorm party here and there but chances are you'll get livesafed by your neighbor and shut down."
College Sophomore,1,"The LGBTQ+ community here is dead, probably for a good reason, and there are still students at this school who are bigots toward them. The school as a whole isn't very diverse."
College Sophomore,1,"All the residence halls are out of shape, and probably not up to code. Roaches, mold, and all the issues of living in run down residence halls is disgusting. They won't let you live off campus, unless you happen to be married, which a lot of people seem to be doing for whatever reason."
College Sophomore,1,"Greek life is so boring at this place. There ""socials"" can't have alcohol, and are just super lame. Greek life isn't worth the money you spend to be in it."
College Sophomore,1,"I came to this school not knowing what to expect. It's very small, at only 1,300 students. You see the same people every day, you get involved in drama that you can't avoid, the school doesn't offer many options for dining, as you only have one restaurant on campus that's owned by Sodexo. I hardly had anything to do, I never felt apart of the school as a typical student that attends a large university would. I couldn't take it, I didn't feel right here. I had to get out."
College Freshman,1,There are not a lot of involvement or mentions of sports at my school.
College Senior,1,"Having people on campus that do not live on campus is awful. After a certain time guest are not allowed on campus, we are in college and we should be able to have friends visit us when we would like to. Anyways, we have to register guest that are staying overnight and they are not allowed to stay longer than 3 days, what if they are coming across the country just to see you? I believe they need to be more lenient about visitation rules. "
College Freshman,1,"Now I am pretty sure no one wants to live in Campus East or Lake Edwards. (the surrounding neighborhoods around the VWC campus) There are burgalaries , shootings, & a bad group of individuals.  I doubt any student would be safe living in off campus housing."
College Freshman,1,I grew up in Va Beach and lived here my whole life. Anyone who is from here knows the Newtown area is anything but desirable. It is a very trashy area with many stragglers that roam the streets. Perfect place for a college right? Not.

Niche User,5,"Utah State is a great school. They have really great ways to keep you involved. The atmosphere at Utah State is very student oriented I found It easy to be socially involved, while still prioritizing academics."
Sophomore,5,I have taken a few classes online and I really love the way that most of the teachers set up their Canvas accounts. I was so nervous taking an online class because I did not know if I would be able to focus but it all went great and I not love class online.
Sophomore,5,Utah State University is the land grant institution for the state of Utah and so that means getting an education from USU is so easy because they have so many campuses state wide. The main campus in Logan is beautiful and makes you feel at home.  I LOVE USU!!!!!!
Sophomore,5,"Utah State University is an amazing university and will undoubtedly give you an unforgettable college experience! Everyone is really chill and social and will be your friend in class.

I love Utah State and would recommend it to any graduating senior!"
Junior,5,"It is a great place to go to school. By going here I feel like i have really had the full college experience.

There is a variety of different kinds of people and the atmosphere has taught me a lot about life already."

Freshman,5,"Utah State is a large university that is still able to preserve the small town intimate feeling. The professors care, and are willing to work with you."
Freshman,5,"It's a little tricky with online, you have to be determined and focused otherwise you will fail the course."

The people I've met here so far want to make positive change in the world, and that's why they're here at college or working with college students.

Freshman,5,My experience of taking online course is that its much easy to do and makes thing a lot easy because I can take it just at the center.
Alum,5,"Beautiful, fun campus life. Amazing outdooor opportunities at your fingertips year 'round. Safe community with an excellent cheap cost of living bonus. Excellent education as well... had so much fun, I forgot that bit. ;-)"
Alum,5,"While I did not take classes that were entirely online, the professors at Utah State were very tech savvy and did their best to make the online material digestible and easy to find. Assignments were well-organized and expectations were clear. Professors communicated very well and I never felt in the dark with what I was supposed to be working on.

 What is unique about this university is that it has campuses all over the state and so their distance education outreach is amazing."
Alum,5,"I cannot adequately express how wonderful this institution (Utah State University) was.  Because I was involved in the undergraduate teaching assistant program, I got to know so many people. It experience, among others, made this university my university. The faculty here is very friendly and the students are down-to-earth and friendly. Based in Cache Valley with access to skiing and hiking, this campus is like none other.

When you visit this campus, you can actually see the love students, alumni, and faculty have for their university. After spending a day on campus (even while studying), it is easy to understand why. Professors are passionate about their subject matter and go out of their way to help the students. It is just a fabulous, fabulous place to be."
Junior,5,I am  a transfer student that is just getting ready to start my bachelor progam with Utah State. Thus far my overall experience has been nothing but a positive experience for me. The staff and departments have been very helpful in assisting me in my progress to start my education at Utah State.

Graduate Student,5,I love USU! I took pre-requites last summer and this fall I have been accepted into the School Counseling masters program!
Graduate Student,5,"I took online pre-requites class last summer and I loved it! The online format is easy to follow! Great instructors who love their students, are there for them, readily available to provide assistance and clarification when needed, online requires extra work but totally worth it and tailored exactly to what you need to prepare for exams!"
Sophomore,5,"After my first year at USU, I have felt welcomed and encouraged to a part of the community. Coming from out of state, I struggle sometimes with homesickness but by getting involved on campus, I have created a family here in Logan."
Sophomore,5,The online classes are really great. It just takes a bit more organisation to stay on track with the classes but they are overall very good.
Junior,5,The campus is beautiful.  The culture is very inclusive.  The teachers are amazing and there are so many resources provided to students.

Alum,5,"If you are a person that enjoys down-to-earth peers and the outdoors, look no further. Utah State offers such a unique experience. The campus is settled in Cache Valley and offers world-class hiking, camping, fishing, etc. This university truly is an outdoorsman's paradise. Utah State also boasts excellent academics that are continually expanding and improving. Professors are friendly, understanding, and ready to help their students. Sports and athletics are also a point of pride for the Aggies. If you haven't checked out ""The Hurd"" on YouTube, do it. All in all, Utah State offers an excellent opportunity for your education and your life."
Alum,5,I was able to take several online classes during my time at Utah State. What worries I had about feeling alone or falling behind were quickly assuaged. I really enjoyed my experience with the online classes I took and would recommend them to anyone interested in high-quality learning while maintaining a flexible schedule.
Sophomore,5,"When I attended Utah State University for about a year and a half, it was a great experience. The professors and advisors were very nice and helpful when it came to schoolwork or scholarships. They always did activities that would involve the whole school, so you can interact with new people or to just be active."
Sophomore,5,"With online learning experience, I took one or two classes online and they were also great. The professors kept in contact with you and if you had questions or concerns, they were happy to answer them. Then when virtual learning came along with the COVID 19, the video calls with class were excellent and the professors made sure you had access to the assignments."
Freshman,5,Utah State is the best school in Utah. I believe that anyone can feel welcome here. The people are inviting and everyone has a place on campus. Great place to be. One of the things I looked for when applying to colleges was the student involvement. I want to make friends and be a part of the community. Utah State University really helped me with that. They have so many courses and things to be a part of. I love that every person has a place they belong.
Freshman,5,I haven't taken any classes online through Utah State University. I have been contacted about starting classes and making the most of my year. I think that online learning will not be difficult.
Sophomore,5,I have loved Utah State ever since I was a young girl growing up in the same valley and have been so excited to actually join the Aggie Team.
Sophomore,5,"I only took online classes when the whole campus switched to them at the end of last semester. Many of my professors were prepared and were able to quickly transition to online classes for the rest of the semester. The material was presented clearly, and there were multiple options to communicate with professors and learn from them online. I personally didn't have any trouble with Utah State's online testing and course material. Some courses weren't able to fully transition to online, but they did a great job to accommodate for the rest of the semester!"
Sophomore,5,"I really enjoy being at Utah State University. I have so many opportunities to learn from experienced professors who love what they teach and are passionate about helping students to succeed. Many of my teachers have been extremely willing to work one-on-one with me and other students to help us succeed. The campus is beautiful, and the student-life experience is great!"
Sophomore,5,Utah State has many broadcast and online classes that they have been doing for a long time so it's a super awesome university for both face-to-face and for online classes.
Sophomore,5,Utah State University is the best because it is so inclusive and everyone is welcomed and loved. This University is perfect because its a large school but it is also not huge so you don't have to feel like you are downing in a bunch of random people. Everything is so central and everyone is so fun. This University is the best because they actually care about their students and it's awesome.
Sophomore,5,"USU is an amazing school. The campus is easy to navigate and is full of life. The university provides many benefits while attending. Free access to the on campus gym, campus buses are always going, many locations to eat at, and lots of events to get involved in. The school is very welcoming and has many traditions that are fun for any student. The university provides a great community, especially for new coming freshman."
Freshman,5,The counselors and other informative groups have reached out to me and helped me feel confident in my choice to attend USU this coming fall semester. They kept me updated and feel like I’m important.
Freshman,5,So far it’s been great! I haven’t attended USU yet but I am enrolled for this fall. And the learning modules they have given out have helped me learn a lot about applying and registration.
Freshman,5,"Utah State University is a wonderful, exciting place to go to school. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a full college experience, while getting a quality education."
Sophomore,5,The transition that USU made from face-to-face classes to online was smooth. Learning from the computer was a breeze and I have never done an online class before.
Sophomore,5,The academics are very good. Campus life is fun and there never seems to be a dull moment. The small size of campus allows for easy walks to all of your classes no matter where you are on campus. The professors are great and the students are all friendly and ready to help you if you need anything.
Freshman,5,Love this school. Its beautiful and the classes are great. Even the teachers are great. I've felt good about my choice for Utah state. There are so many things you can do in Logan and there is a great feeling amongst the people and on campus.
Junior,5,It is a wonderful school full of fun activities and opportunities. Lots of varieties of classes! Great student life and living! Never a dull moment.
Junior,5,Utah State was always keeping us students updated and making sure we had the resources we needed to keep learning at home.
Junior,5,"It took a little while to get adjusted to going online, but USU and it's professors did the best they could and were very understanding. Online is hard because everyone learns differently, but most of my friends say that they had a pretty good experience as well."
Senior,5,"Its an amazing environment, and the school is excellent. The professors care about your personal life, and want whats best for you."
Senior,5,"Ive taken both in person and online, and it has been amazing. The professors are excellent and there is a wide range of opportunities after we graduate."
Freshman,5,It is a great school! The environment there is awesome and central to becoming a learner. It’s definitely a school for all walks of life. Professors are awesome and easy to work with and will help as much as you need them to.
Freshman,5,"I love USU! The campus life is amazing! They have so much student involvement and tons of activities constantly going on! They have great support from faculty and staff, and have created a safe, fun, and tight knit community. I couldn't ask for a better place to go to school. And it is also beautiful in Logan, especially on campus."
Freshman,5,"I haven't done a ton of online work, but the professors are great to work with, and have been awesome in helping me with everything!"
Niche User,4,I took one class online and it was great while I was in the class but I have a difficult time learning online so It was a hard one for me. I personally think that the class is great or horrible depending on the professor. I had amazing professors so I personally enjoyed my time in my classes.
Sophomore,4,"The majority of my classes are online and so far the experience has been difficult but definitely manageable! The professors have been very lenient with the recorded lectures, Zoom, and exams! Though keeping up with every class online is difficult, I 've learned so much and I have better grades than normal classes!"
Freshman,4,"I started at Utah State during the covid-19 pandemic so things are bery different than they usually would be. However, the faculty and staff have made my first semester amazing. Their efforts to create a fun, memorable college experience amidst a pandemic do not go unnoticed. Im so thankful to be an Aggie!"
Freshman,4,"Online has never been my strong suit, but at Utah state I feel comfortable with the online curriculum. My professors make it especially easy to learn online because of their willingness to help me and communicate with me via Zoom, email, etc."
Freshman,4,Utah State has been a great experience for me this past semester. They have the resources to provide a well-rounded education to their students whether they be in person or online.
Junior,4,"I have loved attending Utah State University and believe that this truly is a great college town environment. Utah State is a very student involved school, which is so important when it comes to meeting new people, getting involved in clubs or activities and showing your school spirit. Not only have I benefitted educationally during my time at USU, but I have made the most amazing memories outside of the classroom."
Freshman,4,Professors for the most part have done a great job adjusting this semester. Some choose to post recorded lectures and rarely have class discussions which is fairly lazy and does not set students up for success.
Junior,4,"Overall, I've had a wonderful experience at USU! They provide so many opportunities for students to get involved in the campus community. There are student activities for everything, lots of sports events, and many ways to get involved with the community and meet new people."
Junior,4,"Utah State has a great online program! Their professors work well with your needs and schedule, they're easy to contact, and the assignments/instruction given are clear."
Sophomore,4,"I think USU is an amazing school. It has a beautiful campus, friendly people, and a great experience!"
Sophomore,4,"The college I go to is actually one of their eastern campuses in Blanding, Utah. It is a very good college if you like smaller class sizes where you are able to get more help or questions asked by your professor. Everyone is so friendly. The buildings are near by dorms so you wont be late for any classes. The cafeteria food is great. Has a variety of good food and the staff is friendly. The housing aides are really nice and do keep the dorms clean and in great shape. Everyone is so involved in activities both on and off campus. They have great sponsorship with a recreation center in the community. College kids are able to go there free. The academics are wonderful. Very safe on campus."
Sophomore,4,"I have found that the professors are very understanding with online courses, especially with the pandemic. Communication was easy and I was able to find answers to my questions when ever I had a problem."
Sophomore,4,There are a lot of resources for students such as free tutoring for a variety of classes. The campus is beautiful and people are generally very nice. The culture at the university is fun but sometimes a little weird. I would mostly blame that on the area. All in all academics are great and tuition is a lot cheaper than other universities!
Junior,4,"The education is good, but the social life has struggles. There are very few events that aren’t simply lectures."
Junior,4,USU professors were very good at transitioning to an online learning experience and most adapted very quickly.
Junior,4,USU is a very beautiful campus. If you love the outdoors and the city this is perfect. USU is nestled on the edge of the small city of Logan right next to the canyon.
Junior,4,"Online school isn't my favorite way to learn, but overall the experience at USU is very simple and an easy way to learn."
Freshman,4,"Utah State'small medium-sized campus promotes meeting lots of new people and having great experiences. Whether the classes are large or small, the professors care about success. Many resources are available from academics, mental and physical health, employment,  and involvement. The small town of Logan, UT is a bit quiet, but three canyons surround the school providing lots of places to explore. Overall, USU is a great school. The only thing I didn't is that the student activities are limited and it can be easy to get bored and feel isolated due to location. I recommend taking a tour of the school before deciding to go here."
Sophomore,4,The president of the college is very involved and deals well with the needs of the college. The professors and TA's are very good and the resources on campus are well maintained and accessible.
Alum,4,"Utah State does not receive enough praise for the quality of schooling it gives, especially while being as affordable as it is."
Sophomore,4,"The staff is kind and very hardworking. They put in a lot of effort to help students succeed. Professors are fun and make learning enjoyable.  It is a very fun campus with lots of things to do while not in school! Cache Valley is beautiful and campus really adds to it. You will never be bored here. From hiking to swimming to running to skiing, we've got it covered. Cache Valley is a very outdoors community with plenty to do all year round."
Senior,4,Utah State University has provided me countless opportunities to meet new people and network with professors. I feel more confident with my ability to problem solve and interact with new people thanks to all of the people who have helped along the way.
Freshman,4,Very good. I love the atmosphere but the food could be a lot better. Other than that I love the school.
Freshman,4,Utah state is very good place to prepare to serve a LDS mission and it has a really good engineering program
Junior,4,"I've really enjoyed the community at Utah State University, the students and faculty are all very welcoming, helpful and friendly."
Sophomore,4,I like how many opportunities are provided at Utah State. Everyone that I have met there are very kind and welcoming.
Graduate Student,4,I feel like I'm learning a lot. The only thing I would change is I wish the professors were more supportive of helping me graduate. I've been in my program for 11 years and still have yet to graduate.
Freshman,4,I have loved it here at USU. All of my professors have been good. Along with loving the classes I have loved the community in Logan. The one thing that is hard is the harsh winters and that it can be hard to travel around because of that.
Freshman,4,I'm and aviation student and i love the flight Program down here at USU Eastern. lots of time to fly compared to the main campus in Logan and the campus is much smaller and quite which I enjoy. Its got the big college degree with the small town feel.
Freshman,4,"Honestly a great school with all the different programs and ways they help you to be involved and to succeed as you go through your college career. They meaning teachers, faculty, and even other students"
Junior,4,"I have always lived in Logan and wanted to go somewhere else for school but because of financial reasons I stayed here. And it has been the best decision. Amazing academics, amazing students, amazing professors"
Sophomore,4,"A lot of schools have a lot of down falls. Utah state has all the benefits of other schools, without any of the downfalls. You can find your crowd anywhere."
Sophomore,4,"The thing I like most about USU is the different campuses across the state that allows anyone to attend school close to home. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the price of tuition at Utah State, unfortunately it continues to rise."
Freshman,4,"Can be seen as a party school in some ways, but there is a good atmosphere and you can find people who are passionate about their work. The staff is there to help the students and you can feel it every time you are willing to ask for help."
Freshman,4,"Teachers and advisors care, you just need to stop being scared or intimidated. It can be seen as a party school, but if you are with the right people you can spend each day learning. There are a ton of activities each month and lots of ways that students can be involved. I feel like they care about me, and that's a rare thing."
Freshman,4,"I've finished Fall Semester with them, and it's been a great school. I love the involvement that the school has and there are lots of different people from different backgrounds that go there. I can't wait to see what else they have in store for me as a student."
Sophomore,4,I like the friendly and including environment they have set up. There is so many activities that you can go to that help with careers or just for fun things to do.
Senior,4,As a distant student it was hard to find classes that I would want to take.  Class selection was very small.  I would like to see more classes offered.
Niche User,4,"I love the environment and the scenery around its beautiful campus. I loved how friendly everyone was and how close the community was as well. I would love to see more diversity in the religious area and more cultures, but other than that the campus was fantastic."
Sophomore,4,"This was always my university of choice from the get go. It is relatively cheap compared to any other university I've encountered, and it had the best Mechanical Engineering program in the state of Utah. Couldn't imagine myself at any other university."
Freshman,2,"USU is a great school if you are religious, if not it can feel very isolating and exclusive. There's not a whole lot of middle ground people either you're a hardcore partier or super straight edge which was really hard for me personally. The cops are also insane in Logan. If you're trying to party at all and are under 21 I would NOT recommend going to USU everyone I knew had MIPs or Citations  and cops camp outside the frat houses waiting to get people in trouble. If you aren't into partying, USU is a pretty fun school and I would say it's pretty safe."
Freshman,2,"Horrible parking, mediocre classes, terrible communication. Very difficult to get into classes that you want. Has a beautiful campus with nice people, though."
Junior,2,"Avoid Utah State University is you do not have a 2-year degree. USU will lock freshmen students in an endless cycle of General Studies requirements; also, the campus has a bad advisor retention average, most students will shuffle through 3+ advisors before their graduation. 

If you're a 2-year college veteran, and you know what you're doing, USU might be a fine option for you. But if you are a brand new student in higher learning, it is best to avoid USU."
Senior,2,"I did Utah State University online and have had nothing but headache when it comes to dealing with the administration or clerical side of things. The professors and classes have been great, but counseling, testing, etc. has been the worst! They lose paperwork, fail to contact me regarding important matters, and it just seems like their online programs are not organized. They don't know who is in charge of what and I'm constantly playing phone tag whenever I need to talk to someone because whoever they tell me to contact is never the correct person. They are very hard to work with and I feel like they don't have my best interest at heart."
Sophomore,2,"This college would be better known as BYU Logan. If you're LDS, and don't want to go to BYU, I'd highly recommend it. 
If you're not Mormon, avoid this place like the plague. You live and operate under constant scrutiny of Mormon people, the police and law enforcement watch you like hawks and make it their personal quest to ""correct"" kids enjoying the college experience. The slightest drug or alcohol offense means court, probation, I've even seen jail time. Only redeeming quality is the academics, which are fantastic.
As for Logan itself- it's not a college town. It's where old folks go to settle down and die in the ""mountains and outdoors"". 
Don't come here for ""the college experience"". You won't get it. It's like going to a summer camp. And if you do, for the love of God, do not live on campus.
Beaver mountain is cool if you're a skier or boarder. During the summer, you must like hiking, because it is the ONLY thing to do."
Niche User,2,"They have a very wide variety of classes and have high job rates right after graduating but they are extremely hard to communicate with. They refuse to communicate with other schools, making the student be the middle man. I had to send multiple emails and call multiple times to get any sort of response and then a few more days for an actual answer to my question or problem."
College Junior,2,"Greek row is actually pretty sad looking, nothing compared to the University of Idaho."
College Sophomore,2,Not much nightlife at USU unless you enjoy exercising at night in the gym. Public transportation ceases at 8 PM so if you don't have access to a car then it's a little harder to go downtown and spend quality time looking for the nightlife.
Recent Alumnus,2,I have struggled a lot with the counselors on campus and I believe that affects a lot of these aspects
College Senior,2,I am not huge into Greek Life because the people that typically join are people that I don't want to associate with because they drink alcohol and have low morals.
College Junior,2,"There is very little diversity on campus, though support is available for many minority groups."
College Freshman,2,All of my classes have been huge and I have had troubles getting into some classes.
College Sophomore,2,Parties are rare to come by unless you find the right group but you always need to be careful because the campus police and city police are always looking to bust people drinking especially underagers. There are only 4 bars in all of Logan so it is not a party atmosphere at all.
College Sophomore,2,Parties are not very big or common and the safest bet is to party with a small group so you are less likely to get in trouble from the cops.
College Sophomore,2,"Their is very little diversity, most students are from Idaho or Utah and are Caucasian and Mormon. Most of the diversity comes from our sports teams and a little with foreign exchange students. Wish their was more diversity because even being non-religious makes you less accepted but you can find a group who will accept you just not the vast majority of students."
College Junior,2,I have no use for athletics and never attend events.
College Sophomore,2,They are not very involved with the school and there are not a lot of options when it comes to picking a Fraternity/sorority.
College Senior,2,"This school isn't entirely the best in my book. It is a great school with a few caveats that some people need to look out for. It's cheap, great location (mountains, hiking fishing skiiing,snowboarding) lounging out on the lawn in the fall and summer is a must. Once you visit you are so hooked. However, if you are not conservative, let alone religious, you may have a VERY difficult time adjusting. When I visited it was absolutely awesome! But once I arrived for orientation and had gone through a week I felt fairly out of place. I just could not connect with anyone. I guess I just continually grew a negative attitude towards this school as I continued to experience everything. I didn't enjoy my classes, roommates and I wasn't entirely connecting/getting along with people with differing opinions. I consider myself an open minded person but this experience was just beyond ridiculous. I chose this school because it had very, very very low crime, it wasn't heavy on parties and you can get all the help you want. But what made me so angry was the social scene and the classes . Many of the professors I had had these ""bland"" attitudes, that just did not make the experience enjoyable. It's a such a shame. I was excited to leave home and start making new friends. I wouldn't say that I ""wasn't ready"" that some people say in defense of this school. I just had a difficult time finding meaningful friendships and classes that felt like it held a real value.   As a result I transferred back home and went to community college to get generals and prereqs done and moved on to UC Irvine. ."
College Sophomore,2,The party scene is not the most popular on Utah States campus. A lot of students are LDS and do not like those scenes and the cops are always out to get under aged students who have been drinking. Its hard to find a good party only because MIP's at the school are given out like candy even if you blow a .01. Every college student hears stories about when their parents went to college parities and had so much fun but Utah State is not that fun to party at. One of the most fun parties thrown by the school is the HOWL at Halloween every year which creates a positive impact.
College Sophomore,2,The process sucks and gets confusing.
College Freshman,2,"Can be difficult to access, unless you have a car. Quality is average."
College Freshman,2,"Not a very social atmosphere on campus, unless you bring your own friends. Apartment hopping is common and can be fun."
College Freshman,2,The social atmosphere is quite poor despite the initially positive vibe. The dorms are also rather small and are older with at least half a mile to most of the classes.
College Junior,2,"The only parties available are frat parties.  If you're a classy, low-key, or sophisticated person, there is absolutely nothing you can do in Logan for fun."
College Freshman,2,"I don't have much of a party life other then going to dances, which are awesome!"
College Senior,2,very hard for international students to get aid
College Freshman,2,"They seem to think that I can afford college because of my dads job, but even he could't"
College Sophomore,2,USU does not have nearly as many social events as the last school I attended.
College Freshman,2,"I'm not really involved in the Greek system, but coming from the south to Utah, I can definitely see a huge difference in Greek life. There's only a couple of sororities here, and there houses are not particularly big or decadent. I can't really say how they are ran because I don't know."
College Student,2,not very much Greek stuff going on.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not a lot of parties around here. The best parties take place when you arrange them yourself with your friends. Parties are great to meet people and have fun, and are an important part of the student experience."
College Sophomore,2,"Off campus there is nothing to do besides eating in a restaurant, buying food on a store, go to the movies or go to mall (which doesn't have many options)."
College Sophomore,2,I couldn't get any scholarships through the school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"I applied for many, many scholarships but did not receive any."
College Sophomore,2,"Even though, the students are friendly they are judgmental, as well. Most of the students are Mormons and will not date out of their religions and can also be picky within."
College Sophomore,2,i usually had friends and family from my home state come and visit me because if you are not mormon its hard to get in a group of friends
College Sophomore,2,ppl here are very one and are not excepting of Gays or lesbians and since everyone there is mostly mormon they group together and the non mormons are left to themselves
College Sophomore,2,everything was really old and didnt work very we usually ended up going to someone who had a working stove and in return we would let them use our microwave and freezer
College Sophomore,2,There are a lot of mormons and ppl there are very judgemental its hard to find ppl that are accepting of everyone
College Freshman,2,"I hate the snow! I am from Georgia so I'm not used to it. I am always afraid I am going to slip, sometimes the snow makes me late to class. Other than the snow, the weather is great!"
College Freshman,2,I was never granted financial aid. The school wasn't very helpful with helping me get money for school.
College Junior,2,"Pretty much white people everywhere.  But compared to the rest of Utah, it has a little more diversity."
College Junior,2,"The financial aid office is close to incompetent.  They offered me a lot of money for financial aid but took all of it away, saying that it was their mistake and I didn't qualify."
College Sophomore,2,"Living on campus is very costly. There are places to live that aren't as expensive, but there are dirty, far away from classes, cramped, and just not good living conditions. The worst part about living on campus is the fact that you must purchase a meal plan, which is very costly, and having supervisors always telling you what you can and cannot do."
College Sophomore,2,"At the fun social events, they have the place crawling with police officers. It is like they want to scare us and try to break up the fun. It is a dry campus, and a lot of the students do have religious beliefs that do not condone drinking, but when students are off campus they deserve to live in the way they wish. If you are going to host a fun social event, don't try to scare everyone away with the cops and threaten them with being arrested."
College Junior,2,"We need more bars. 'The Owl' has a cool roof, pool tables, and serves a mean burger, but they only serve beer. I want more alcohol options when I go out."
College Junior,2,The campus is located at the mouth of Logan Canyon. It gets intensely cold in the winter with the wind. Sometimes you get everyone on campus walking backwards just to try and avoid it.
College Sophomore,2,They really need to just know they are not the only ones in the world
College Junior,2,Terrible on campus parking.  Way expensive and hard to get a spot
College Junior,2,Same as other campuses.  A pathetic attempt at buying your friends
College Senior,2,"There is no nightlife unless you create it with your friends. The greek parties suck, and you can't drink in public"
College Senior,2,"The greek students are typically stuck-up, and the parties aren't even that fun. They aren't considered special by the rest of the campus, they just think they are."
College Senior,2,"Almost everyone here is white, straight, and Mormon. There are some exceptions, but it's hard to find."
College Senior,2,"The campus police are very strict on the no alcohol policy and will wait outside of parties to pick people up. Some of the RAs are really strict too, but some wouldn't bust you for anything"
College Sophomore,2,It is not very diverse here at all. There are a lot of mormons.
College Student,2,It can get very could during the winter time which makes it very difficult to walk from class to class.
College Sophomore,2,When the snow gets really bad it makes getting up to campus a little more difficult because the buses start coming later and they can hardly get up the hill.
College Sophomore,2,"Winters here are pretty brutal. After a few months of freezing, anything above 20 degrees fahrenheit seems pretty warm. But summers are as good as weather gets."
College Sophomore,2,Its extremely cold for most of the year. I commute by bike or walk when it's below zero quite often.
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much diversity on campus. It is a conservative, low key campus, which makes it great for study and focus. But the lack of diversity makes for a limited dynamic."
Freshman,1,"At first glance this school seems like a great option-  beautiful setting, small college town and affordable tuition. I came here super excited and then made zero friends once I was labled non LDS. There is ZERO diversity on campus as everyone you meet is Mormon and nontolerant of others. I haven't found other students who want to socialize or do anything outside of the LDS church. Prospective students should be aware that it's essentially a Mormon school that doesn't welcome other students."
Senior,1,I absolutely hate this school. I am an Elementary Education major and I feel like all the classes are awful! I wish that the school wouldn’t change the program every year. I hate the professors that are in the TEAL section. It’s great for agriculture. But save yourself the trouble if you go USU stay as far away from there Elementary Education program as you can. If they were not my only option to get a degree I know I would have quit a long time ago. I seriously hate all their professors. Can they please get some better ones? Good thing I only have 1 more semester or else I don’t think I could finish it. This is my first semester in the ELED program and I have hated every week of it. The homework is all just busy work. I haven’t actually learned anything.
Alum,1,"Do not go here if you are not a white Mormon. The advising department is terrible and the diversity is non existent.
Especially after the election it was an uncomfortable place to go to school being a minority. Students found it appropriate to say really offensive things about my race and make me feel uncomfortable. I filed a Title XI case against a teacher for discriminating against me because of my disability in April and still haven’t heard back."
Junior,1,"Lower graduation rates, inneficient student services, outrageous parking, poor job placement percentage, non competitive academic standing, terrible university personnel compensation, massive class sizes, school loans are keeping me from anything else."
Graduate Student,1,"I was a graduate student here. I came from California. People warned me, but I didn't listen. I have never felt so isolated and lonely as living in Logan. The town is boring (if you are not LBS), the people all look the same (it's creepy), the weather sucks, the canyon is overcrowded (in the summer), and the school is third rate. I have lived in 8 states and dozens of places, this was by far the worst. Left after 4 months!"
College Sophomore,1,We don't have sororities at the school either that or I am not aware of.
College Junior,1,No Greek life on campus
College Freshman,1,"Our campus is not very diverse.  We are in Utah, so we are all mormon."
College Freshman,1,It is really hard to get scholarships here and it is too expensive for me to continue going here.
College Sophomore,1,The police are very strict and it is extremely risky to use and drugs or alcohol because the cops will make you pay. You rarely see drugs on campus. Peer pressure is almost the opposite and you are more left out if you do drink or do any drugs.
College Freshman,1,"I've been to quite a few parties here. Most have involved alcohol and drugs, which I dont do. The ones that have not involved those were Institute dances. Those can be fun depending who you are with. Be careful where you go and who you go with."
College Freshman,1,"They care about making the Mormons happy. The rules are so strict, most of the kids here don't mind but if you don't come from this culture it seems very biased. I can't even walk home after a party that isn't even a minute away from my dorm because having alcohol in you is still seen as having alcohol on campus and the cops LOVE giving MIPs"
College Freshman,1,"It's AWFUL. If you want to party go greek, if not you will have the HARDEST time trying to find people with the same moral compass. If you do, then expect house parties that will likely be busted by the cops because Logan cops have nothing to do but bust parties. Go greek or enjoy small hangouts with friends because there is nothing else here."
College Senior,1,Every time I think about financial aid at USU it gives me a headache. The process is very complicated and I do not do something right. I receive some financial aid but it is never enough.
College Junior,1,They serve the same thing over and over. It get's tiring after awhile.
College Freshman,1,Hardly any academic advising and prepare to get parking citations no matter what you do.
College Sophomore,1,teachers here are horrible.. for most you have to figure out what they want you to write instead of what the facts really are
College Junior,1,"Parking is way too expensive, and there are barely any free options close to campus."
College Sophomore,1,"Since this campus is in Utah, most of the students are LDS. If you are not LDS it is very hard to find friends and people who accept you and your beliefs. Also, if you try to make friends with people who are LDS they try and convert you to think like they do. There is no respect for other's beliefs, but they expect you to respect theirs, and if you do something they don't believe in, they become extremely offended and will often not talk or be around you anymore. Ethic diversity, economic background and political beliefs are not the problem at this school; it is religious differences that make it hard to be accepted, which also includes the nonacceptance of different sexual orientations."
College Sophomore,1,"The weather is probably the worst part about campus. It snows and rains and is often in the negatives. Since the campus is so spread out, it makes going to school miserable. There is no way to get warm and you are cold all day. I wish the campus was more like UVU's, a huge indoor circle so the students don't have to walk outside."
College Junior,1,Nobody uses drugs on campus they go somewhere else to party and spend the night at a friends house that lives in town to party other then that every one is serious about there education and don't want to get kicked out of the dorms.
College Sophomore,1,"For the most part, this is a discount community with big families. They want cheep everything. There is a good farmers market in the summer. There is one good place for organic, veggie/vegan food- The Ibis. They are also very inconvenient if you are on foot. "
College Sophomore,1,There is a great nightlife if you party in your mind while you are sleeping. The two/three bars in town are rundown and gross. 
College Freshman,1,"Logan has a very low crime rate and is one of the safest places to go to school. So the campus police have to justify their presence/paychecks by handing out MIPs left and right. They have no regard for probable cause, even if you are minding your own business. They see you out late walking back to your dorm and often will come to talk to you. Know your rights if if you break the law. 

Noise violations of on campus housing is very strict. Parking is strictly enforced. I cannot express enough how many people I know that ran into a bldg for five minutes to get something and parked their unregistered car in a campus lot and wound up with a parking ticket, even on weekends when the campus is dead. "
College Freshman,1,"The sororities are terrible. They have a horrible, catty reputation. There are only two to pick from anyways. The frats are better. They throw half-way decent parties. Again, not a huge selection. Somehow, the need to network at USU bypassed the Greek life. Most people have common religious interests/ties that help them to meet other people of like interests.  "
College Sophomore,1,Mormons treat non members like secondclascitizens
College Sophomore,1,"I've been treated poorly, couldn't make friends, my academic performance suffered and i got depressed. "
College Sophomore,1,Lets just say most of the people go home over the weekends leaving campus deserted
College Sophomore,1,Their mentality is the worst i have ever seen in some states. 
College Sophomore,1,A few cheap old dorms. There are activities around but seems to be directed to students that are married with children. 
College Junior,1,There is no where to park in Logan. Most of my friends had to park in a no parking zone because there wasn't anywhere else. Tickets are expensive and the booters are ruthless.
College Sophomore,1,"A blue parking pass at Utah State University for one semester is $50. It is a pretty steep price to pay considering that the general parking lot fills up super fast and is pretty small. Sometimes it can be a little hectic getting in and out, but with my little truck it isn't so bad. I still live at home with my parents and have to drive about 6 miles to get to campus, so I really have to get up early if I want to find a place to park."
Recent Alumnus,1,There are lots of permits you can choose from. I bought the cheapest and walked far. I didn't like it. I prefered living close to campus to walk.
College Freshman,1,"The people are are just down right RUDE, when it comes to religion. Please, do not come here if you aren't LDS. It will just be a terrible experience for you. You're treated like a minority if they find out you don't go to church, even my roommate avoided eye contact with me.."
College Freshman,1,Parking on campus is AWFUL!! This is my biggest complaint about the school. There are people paid full time to walk around and wait for people to park and give them tickets. I understand it brings in revenue but its RIDICULOUS
College Freshman,1,"horrible costs, average cost is $200 and the parking is very limited still. many on campus places force you to buy one as part of living there. parking is always enforced, and boots are given out regularly which cost $75 to get off."
College Sophomore,1,"The winters in Logan are very long and very tough. This is my least favorite thing about the school. Getting to class is hard on very cold days, which is often. There's a lot of now and classes hardly ever get canceled."
College Freshman,1,The people they have working in the dining halls spend more time talking to each other than working so there are long waits. Also there isn't a huge variety of options and it feels like groups touring the campus get priority; I have been turned away because they were too full because they had a group. Th only thing nice about having a meal plan is you don't have to cook.
College Freshman,1,"There is very little diversity here. I would say well over half of the student body is white, conservative, and LDS. I think they are receptive to other cultures and ethntisities but being in Logan, Utah there is not much to draw other cultures in."
College Freshman,1,"I found beginning students tend to hang around with the group  of friends they had from high school and to go home frequently on the weekend. Not as open to outsiders and out of staters, very judgmental that you may be wealthier than them. Mountain View Dorm most guys park in their rooms and play video games at all hours, don't even attend mixers with the girl dorm! Club of department events are the main invitations."
College Junior,1,"Parking on campus is terrible! I don't even use a car on campus, but sometimes when I need to, even at nights, the parking lots are all filled! At nights, most parking is free which is nice, but it usually taken up. During the day, you can expect to see not one empty car space. They definitely need more parking. They are very strict and you will get a ticket if you don't have a pass (permits are expensive!) The tickets are about $14 if you pay after a week. You wouldn't need a car on campus if you lived close, but campus is butted up against a cliff on the top of the hill, so you'll be walking up a big hill if you live off campus."
College Sophomore,1,"I would rather take my classes online, so this semester (my first semester) I regestered for two online classes and on class on campus. come to find out they charge an extra $1,000 dollars for online classes. and if you mix classes such as online and on campuse they charge an extra free. that isnt cheap. I wish my adviser would have told me this when I talked to her about what classes to register for. when I talked to a financial aid adviser he told me that my financial aid will never cover my full tuition if I take online classes, it might if I take all my classes on campus!!!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"During the summer the weather is great, but during the winter the weather here sucks"
College Senior,1,Lots of white LDS people. what little diversity the campus has is most likely to come from an individual receiving a scholarship.
College Senior,1,If you are not LDS and you are looking for a decent bar scene then look some where other than logan the choices are limited and all of the options a not within walking distance of campus. If you are LDS the church and school regularly throws events that may interest you.
College Senior,1,"A recent study rated Utah State as one of the worst campuses in regards to freedom of speech. The campus is dry, meaning no alcohol; and that isn't just in a can, bottle, nalgene etc. state law includes your body as a container so even if you are 21 you can receive a citation if you are on campus property. the school turns a blind eye during tailgates of home football games but that is about it. Also because the majority of the campus is LDS they will not hesitate to call the police if they think you are drinking or if they think drugs may be present."
College Freshman,1,The rate is high and the aid department has done nothing but mess up on my aid.
College Freshman,1,i feel like the majority of the people on greek row are just wanting to go against their parents mormon routines.  They are not the cute people on most compuses or in the movies.
College Sophomore,1,"Not a whole lot of night life in logan, make friends and go to house parties. Underage drinking is bad idea especially in logan because the cops get a little bored"
College Freshman,1,Religious is flat out the thing here If you aren't mormon you won't fit in easily
College Freshman,1,"Busses stop running around 10, there aren't very many good parties, and the social night life is terribe"
College Freshman,1,Most people here are white and mormon. The only diversity here is most of the foreign students coming from china
College Freshman,1,"I do feel a high religious feeling here. No one does anything 'exciting'. There are so many people that go home for the weekend, and the campus is just deserted. The housing on campus isn't the greatest to be social. The social atmosphere is awful if you aren't mormon and are looking for some actual fun. Go somewhere else. If you are looking for very smart and attractive girls you are best going somewhere else too. ""freedom' is very limited here."
College Freshman,1,If you aren't mormon or religious don't come here. You will have a hard time fitting in.
College Junior,1,"I HATE the snow, and I starts dumping on us on the last week of October. It doesn't stop snowing until LATE April. Occasionally til May."
College Freshman,1,"This place sucks if you aren't mormon. Almost everyone goes home for the weekend or just stays in their room and does absolutely nothing. This isn't college, it is high school."
College Freshman,1,"The girls aren't attractive. If you want slightly pale and out of shape girls, this is the place for you."
College Freshman,1,i have had nothing but problems with this school
College Freshman,1,not enough spaces!u need to be quick to get a spot
College Freshman,1,"Doesn't give you the 'college experience' – There aren't very many outdoor clubs. I signed up for one club and i haven't gotten any email regarding meeting times or anything. The clubs are all poorly organized and down right not fun to be in. It's either a political club, health, book or a religious club. You have to pay to do everything that is outside of campus, there isn't much going on on-campus. The night life is terrible, there is nothing to do in town but see a movie. Now the interesting part, If you are not mormon DO NOT COME HERE. They are very nice..but not very fun..they just hang out in their rooms and won't go off campus. I also haven't heard anyone swear..no one has sex, no one drinks, no parties and greek life is pathetic. Come sunday, everything is closed. It is a ghost town when everyone goes to church. Also if you aren't a conservative, get ready to get into a few political arguments. In short..this is high school all over again"

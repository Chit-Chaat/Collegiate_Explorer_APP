Sophomore,5,"I am a returning student enrolled in Lincoln College & my experience there has been great.The professors there are phenomenal they are willing to give you one on one help, well organized,& are always reasonable with students and other professors. There is a tutoring center where commuters & full time students can go to get extra help with an assignment, writing a paper,or to just to ask questions. Living on campus teaches you how to be a responsible young adult you have the chance to learn from mistakes & make your own decisions.Lincoln being a private, independent liberal arts college still have provided students with all type of activities and sports that you can get involved in.We have a variety of foods that is serves for breakfast, lunch & dinner. I know the hardest part about college for most students is paying for it. Our financial aid office provides students with useful information. Overall I loved my Lincoln College experience and I would recommend this school to anyone."

Freshman,4,"I went on a college trip here and it was a nice experience. I have had some teachers that I have really enjoyed during my time here. I have also had a handful of teachers who weren't very good teachers. There have been a handful of classes that I've taken that I didn't enjoy or learn anything. A few of my teachers are very vague with their instructions and difficult to work with. The food is terrible, that isn't just my opinion most if not all students agree with me. However I have met some very wonderful people here whether it be other students or teachers. I have had good amount of fantastic teachers who are caring and great at their jobs. I've also made a decent amount of friends who have similar interests as me which is huge thing for a very shy person like me. I also really like the small campus and the friendliness of most people I've interacted with at Lincoln College."

College Junior,4,Some experience here are very interesting. Like in criminal justice every class we talk about something new related to criminal justice.

College Senior,4,"Great Preparation – Currently I am attending a small two year private school and I love it. The professors are able to give one on one attention, they know what each person may be struggling with and at least try to reach out to each individual student at least once. They have very clear office hours and are very flexible with their time if a student needs them to stay a little later than usual to help them with something they might not understand. Though my school may seem to move a little slower than big colleges and universities but it is a great stepping stone between high school and a big university. Because of great preparation I am excited and very comfortable with my transferring school next year."
College Senior,4,"i think the tuition should have more ""ganas"" meaning more disire on teatching and have a good pase so the students wont be lost on the topic."

College Senior,4,"Small Colleges Offers Big Rewards – What makes Lincoln College unique is that you get to really know your professers on a one on one basies. They are never to busy to help or meet with you. Lincoln is a small privet college and being from a small farming town it offers me what I need without being overwhelmed by size. One of my favorit experiences has been hosting a weekly radio program on the campas radio station, 89X. This is my second year and I really enjoy it. It has helped me to step out of my comfort zone. I love Lincoln College and all that it has given me. It has helped prepare me for the next step in completing my education."
College Senior,4,Very Smooth Process – It was a very easy process to receive financial aid at Lincoln College and the staff was a joy to work with.
College Junior,4,Good Challenge – The classes are difficult enough that I am learning and they are not to easy that i forget it once I am taught it.
College Junior,4,Melting Pot – If there was ever a diverse group of people it is here. The statue of Liberty should be outside their door.

Even though its a school of mixed demographics the students are able to get along with each other without judging one another.  We have career services who help students find jobs and can even help set up interviews with jobs whether they are in your field of study or not.
College Sophomore,4,"A Great Experience – The teachers at Lincoln are more than willing to take time out and help the students that need extra help.  The school also offer two tutoring sessionns every Friday.  The teachers and dean take time to make sure every student is comfortable in the classroom and comfortable with their grades.  Most of the teachers have their own unique was of teaching the a subject which makes the learning environment a lot less stressful.. If I had to do it all over again, I would DEFINITELY choose Lincoln."
College Sophomore,4,"Very Active Campus – The student body here is not huge. There are about 500 students enrolled on and off campus. There is much diversity in terms of race, religion, interests, etc."
College Sophomore,4,"Resources Are Acceptable! We Student centers, local libraries, campus activities, tutoring services, and a small college setting that allows students to feel comfortable and gain necessary attention in the classroom."
Freshman,2,"The food is honestly terrible, and the people have little respect for others. My classes have barely challenged me and there is no room for successful students to excel."
College Sophomore,2,It not a very organized system.ygry can drop your clases for mistakes the school made
College Sophomore,2,didnt get much help. we dont get treated well. the services that a student with out financial aid get is better then a student with it.

College Senior,2,"Physical Therapy Major – My school does not offer a physical therapy or pre-physical therapy major, which is the program that I am interested in so, it is somewhat of a headache trying to piece together what courses I need. But the classes that I am in at pretty interesting and professors are very interested in my needs and can be flexible with their hours."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The facilities at Lincoln College were great. They actually took time out to try to get to know the students and was there anytime we needed them. As for the activities, it was not really interesting and the student really didn't have any new equipment."
College Freshman,2,Not Worth the Money – I feel this school is holding its students back and not offering them a true college experiance. There are no student activites and lack of student participation. Many of the tearchers are new and not adjusted offten failing to help the student.
College Junior,2,it was okay im an auditory learner so i like traditonal classes. my worst grade
College Freshman,2,This school is extremely small. Do not come expecting to have the full college experience. The class sizes are extremely small. You will know everybody on campus with-in a week. Be prepared to fix your own food or spend a ton of money on going out to eat. You will however be able to get to know your teachers personally and the administration very well. The best part about Lincoln is that you live in your own apartment. But these are not lavish apartments. The school should not be as expensive as it is. It is also not a party campus school. You need to travel to other schools to have a good time.
College Sophomore,1,There was a time when one of the financial aid representatives sat there in smile in my face at my lack of tutition
College Freshman,1,There is not really anything to exciting or unique about this college.
College Junior,1,they only care about getting your money. once your loans go threw they can careless about anything else
College Freshman,1,The Lack of Flex Class Schedule – Not all students want to attend school at 8 am . When the school faculty mention that the school didnt really weight the students vote on class time/ schedule I felt cheated. I feel if im paying for classes they should be on my terms at the time I want to take them.

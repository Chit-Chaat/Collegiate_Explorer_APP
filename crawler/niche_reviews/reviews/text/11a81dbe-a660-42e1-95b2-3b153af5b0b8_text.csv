Freshman,5,"My experience has been good I am able to get adjusted to everything, from walking to class, going to places on campus, and exploring."

Junior,5,"The University of Central Missouri is an excellent university located in a beautiful small town. I would describe the campus as safe, welcoming, and inviting. There is never a dull moment here from attending classes and work, to participating in town functions and campus hosted events."
Freshman,5,All of my online professors are very understanding that this is a weird time and mistakes are going to be made.
Freshman,5,UCM has been amazing and very accommodating to those who don't feel the most comfortable with the covid situation.

Senior,5,It was the perfect mid sized school. Small enough to not be overwhelming and lost but large enough to explore and experience. Offers a lot from classes to student life.
Senior,5,"A great small town university with a lot of opportunities. The small class sizes and great instructors made the experience worth wild. You are in a great location for when it is time to look for jobs or internships, plus it is super affordable."
Senior,5,The services that are used for online learning are great. The professors are very understanding of how different of a platform it is for learning and are always willing to help.

Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at University of Central Missouri. I'm a political science major and am a member of the cross country and track team. I absolutely love attending UCM because I've made so many friends, love my team, and enjoy all of my classes. Every professor I've had so far seems genuinely interested in me and how I'm doing in the class. I also love all the coaches involved with the cross country and track team."
Freshman,5,"I was only at this school for a semester, but I encountered so many loving people who genuinely cared about my education as well as my wellbeing"
Freshman,5,"While I am only a freshman at UCM, I have already fallen in love with the school. Central Missouri prides itself on encouragement, networking, and being a worthwhile investment. The helpful staff push students to work hard and to keep the ultimate goal in mind, graduation and entering the workforce. Through this, networks are made that make finding a job after and during college a breeze. I recommend UCM to anyone searching for a fantastic school."
Senior,5,All the professors in my program are supportive in offering help with curriculum and general guidance. UCM is a great environment and a clean safe campus.
Freshman,5,"UCM is a mid-sized public university in Warrensburg, MO. Located between Kansas City and Sedalia, UCM offers unique opportunities to its students. In general, the campus is well laid out. Students don't have far to walk and the grounds are well maintained. I am taking courses in psychology, French, religion, and sociology during my Freshman year. The faculty at UCM are warm and inviting. The small class sizes allow for personal interaction with the instructor.  I highly recommend UCM to anyone interested in working on their four year degree."
Sophomore,5,"I love that the University of Central Missouri is very close to most major cities that students live in, which allows us to go home and see our family and friends frequently. I also love that the faculty truly cares about its students, and wants to help us succeed. I think the only aspect they could improve on is the housing and dining centers. People are being kicked out of their dorms because of hazardous health conditions, which leads to other dorms being overcrowded. The dining centers have had reports of bugs and mold, and we have not heard about this being fixed. I hope that UCM works to fix those issues while also maintaining the great aspects about the university as a whole."
Niche User,5,I really enjoy the atmosphere along with the teachers. All the teachers I have met with are very friendly and truly care about the students eduction.
Freshman,5,"After going to University of Central Missouri, i am very happy. At UCM there are so many opportunities on campus to do for social and academically. At first i was worried about going here, but on day one i knew this was my forever college.  I would recommend going here because the facility here is very caring about all the students and they actually teach you things in class that is very useful throughout life in general."
Niche User,5,I love this university's campus as well as the way that the people there truly want to see you succeed in whatever it is that you have set your mind out to do. It is kind of small but that helps you reach more of a sense of being at home. If there was one thing that i would change about UCM it is having more events that are held there because there can never be enough or too much options for someone to do.
Niche User,5,I have been to the UCM campus many times for science olympiad and I really enjoy the campus and I feel like I know my way around. I do some college classes through UCM and my professors are easy to communicate with and willingly help me with my homework.
Freshman,5,"While currently attend the University of Central Missouri, it has offered me many different resources to maintain my GPA and follow my career choice. It offered me a club which suited my major and helped me meet new people who are similar to me and can hangout with. The professors care for their students as the always help one of us if we are struggling and offer us materials for assignments to understand better. The location also offers many different opportunities such as jobs and internships. The campus is excellently maintained and offers many different options for high quality meals. The campus offers many different athletic sports for students to view."
Freshman,5,"It's cheaper than other colleges and it's a small campus so it's easier to get around! They are very admin about helping you succeed. They are several resources, from career services, to touring, to academic advising. They will help and anyway they can to help you graduate and succeed in the world."
Freshman,5,"I love absolutely everything about the University of Central Missouri. All our professors are hands-on and are willing to help if you have any questions. Everyone is super friendly and is always willing to get to make new friends. The campus staff is friendly as well. Also, on-campus jobs here are nice to have because these jobs will understand what your schedule is and they can work around it. Also, student life is an awesome part of the campus here at the university. There are so many clubs and organizations for students to attend and there are so many activities going on for students to get involved and make some new friends along the way. I honestly would not change anything about this campus."
Junior,5,"The atmosphere was super great weloming and inviting. It wasnt hard to make friends, a definite friendly enviornment."
Junior,5,This university was one of a few that offered my degree.  The teachers are good and helpful.  The one item i would change is that it is sometimes hard to get to the right person when help is needed.
Junior,5,I feel like the University of Central Missouri is preparing me for industry once I graduate. My program requires that I complete an internship in order to graduate. The professors in the engineering department are very helpful and go beyond the mile to help their students understand the material. There is a lot of 1 on 1 help you can get with the professors for extra help. I would recommend UCM to those who are looking to work in engineering.
Senior,5,I love UCM. I've always had help from administration and staff when needed. The atmosphere of campus is great and the intermural activities are a-plenty!
Graduate Student,5,"I have recently been admitted to UCM, and the program stuff has been very helpful to welcome me. The program is designed to meet my career goals, so I am excited to be part of UCM."

The University of Central Missouri has one of the greatest safety programs. They also have a great greek life on campus.
Graduate Student,5,"University is located in a great city. Campus is beautiful with a lot of new additions within the past year and in the near future. Great college town experience, but not too far from Kansas City. The professors and staff are extremely helpful. A lot of ways you can be involved with the university in regards to ""campus life"". I have received my B.A. in Psychology here and the knowledge of the professors is astounding. The classes and guidance I received prepared me  greatly to work in the field of Human Services."
Niche User,5,"I used to live in the town and follow my mom around campus. Its a safe and communal place that is an amazing spot to relax, read, study, or people watch. The architect is stunning as well. The buildings are gorgeous and eye catching. The library is covered with interesting stories and books over topics of any variety. The professors are friendly and open minded. I highly recommend attending or just a stroll through campus."
Niche User,5,My experience with the university of central missouri was good. I enjoyed the campus and found it decent for the amount of money being paid for it. The food there is excellent. They have a variety of food choices for picky eaters and also fat kids.
Alum,5,"I had a wonderful experience.  The professors were all so supportive and always showed they really cared about their students.  I also worked on campus and the work environment was awesome.  They were so flexible and really wanted their employees to succeed as employees and as students.  It was almost always really east to get questions answered.  The application, housing, and registration process was super easy.  It was clear that the motivation of the whole campus was student success."
Freshman,5,The University is a great place were the professors care about you. They work with you as well. One of my professors offered to let students bring their kid if their babysitter fell through.
Alum,5,"I graduated with a BS in Anthropology and now I am pursuing another Bachelors of Education degree. The staff and proffers are extremely encouraging in my pursuit of knowledge and have been a tremendous help as a first generation, no traditional student."
Junior,5,"Great programs and professors! Small community makes it feel like home. Tons of student activities that will keep you busy and they're a great way to meet new people. 
There's Chick-fil-A in the  student center, you 
can't  beat that. The gym is renovated and awesome! It's worth the time to tour the campus. It is beautiful. The advisors are also very knowledgeable and will help you meet your goals. They watch out for you even when you think they're not 😁 My only complaint is parking... Make sure you have some comfortable tennis shoes for all of the walking. They're is help everywhere for you, this school really want you to achieve!"
Senior,5,This campus visit was very inviting. The tour was very helpful with both educational and activities.
Sophomore,5,"I like how UCM isn't a huge, confusing campus. It has many clubs and activities to get students involved, like intermural sports and academic fraternities. Most of the professors are kind and well experienced. The academic advisors are very helpful in choosing your classes."
Niche User,5,"UCM is my dream school. I thought I had my mind made up about where I wanted to go to college until I visited UCM. The campus is absolutely beautiful, The community is diverse and the school isn't too big."
Niche User,5,"I am a senior at Ruskin highschool, I recently took a collge tour there and I fell in love with everything this collge has to offer, This is absoulutely #1 on my list of colleges for Fall 2019."
Freshman,5,"This is my first year here and so far I’m loving it. Most of my professors are great and seem like they care about our futures; the dorms are pretty nice, better then some of the other colleges I visited; the overall campus is pretty good too. It’s a decently sized campus to where you don’t have to walk forever to get to class to class, but not too small to where you feel like there is nothing; there are plenty of places to eat here in Warrensburg and the dining halls foods are usually good. The menu however can be very repetitive from day to day."
Senior,5,"The professors are attentive enough they know you by name the second week. Classes are of a decent size and the campus has an excellent layout. School spirit is definitely not an issue at UCM. With different on campus groups and events, there's something for everyone!"
Niche User,5,It was an amazing experience to visit this college. There is a huge welcoming environment that makes the whole place very likeable
Senior,5,"I just really love the whole college experience here.  I want to be involved in probably too much.  I am a retuning student, so I feel like I need to soak up the college life I missed earlier in life.  I would like to see more students take advantage of their time here at UCM."
Freshman,5,"Fantastic advising staff. They really work with you to help you graduate, unlike other schools that want your money and then leave you to figure everything out."
Junior,5,"I love the University of Central Missouri because I love the openness of the campus. The campus provides so many different opportunities, such as a gym, coffee shops, and a huge library. There are also so many great clubs that you can join. The classes offered are amazing as well and there are so many different majors to choose from here. I chose this college because it is in the town that I live in and never really thought much about it, but as I was walking around a few weeks back it made me realize how nice it actually is. It is a really beautiful campus overall."
Freshman,5,I loved the atmosphere in the class rooms. The professor makes learning entertaining and fun. The people around campus are always positive and eager to help in anyway possible.
Freshman,5,"Even though I'm a Freshman, I absolutely love it at UCM. There are lots of resources for learning and lots of activities. The professors and students are all around friendly and it's really just a very good community. The Campus itself is very pretty and they make sure it stays clean."
Freshman,5,"The University of Central Missouri is the perfect university for a student who wishes to have the college experience but, not is overwhelmed by it. Its a medium sized college where students are able to get one on one help if needed but also bug enough where activities are always going on. Another great thing about UCM is that it's a safe campus!"
Freshman,5,I loved the atmosphere and the staff and the people around campus are very helpful and nice.  I have talked to many schools but UCM has been the most helpful with every area I have needed help in. I am very grateful for them.
Freshman,5,"I really enjoyed my freshman year at University of Central Missouri! I came from a high school that never really cared about individual students grades. When I came to UCM it was like a breath of fresh air. UCM truly cares about each and every student and their personal needs. I need scholarships in order to attend UCM next year, I am really hoping I am able. I really enjoy that UCM also advertises the wins of every sport and club that is available on campus. It does not just talk about the popular sports. While I love UCM, Warrensburg is a small town that does not have a lot going on. While it was hard, I adjusted to it, and I love the little town now!"
Freshman,5,"I have really enjoyed all of my courses here at UCM, as well as my professors! UCM has a great campus, friendly & helpful staff, and great academics."
Junior,5,Its been a great experience so far. The people and professors are amazing! The food could be improved on but the local restaurants are OK. I like the housing and have made many friends. I work on campus and that has been a nice to make money for school.
Niche User,5,I enjoyed the social work program they have there . It helps you get a lot of good work experience and opens doors for great opportunities and allows you to get hands on work experience for what you will be doing once out of college. This school walks you through it so you don’t get confused and know exactly what to do.
Freshman,5,The people that work here are very kind and helpful. Any time that I had a problem it was fixed as quickly as possible as long as I took the initiative to get it fixed.
Freshman,5,Professors are all very caring. Dorms are clean and so is campus! Food is a little iffy sometimes from the dining hall but there are plenty of other food places on campus and around Warrensburg.
Junior,5,- the overall campus is very nice and the people here are very welcoming to new students as well as transfers. You’ll find your niche in no time.
Junior,4,"My online experiences have been great, the plus side to having all online classes would be that I wouldn’t have to live on campus."
Freshman,4,Online has be good so far I haven’t had any problem with it. COVID-19 is the reason we’re online sometimes. I am still able to learn the information and teachers help out with that as well.
Freshman,4,I have meet a lot of cool people here. I university is doing a lot of stuff to make students feel as safe as can be with coronvirus. The desserts at Ellis dinning hall are some of the best deserts ever.  Wish they have more options for food at the dinning halls. This year all of the dorms are single rooms which is nice. You get your own bathroom to share with one another person. normally when you have a roommate it three other people. But way nicer then sharing with a whole floor of people.
Freshman,4,Teachers are very understanding if you need help working with zoom. Some of the teachers haven't worked with zoom before now so there learning to use it at the same time students are. Most of the teachers will email you back when needed and make sure you get the help needed even if the class isn't fully online. A lot of the classes are hybrid right now which mean online and in person. There some that are fully online. Over all online learning isn't as bad as I thought it be.
Sophomore,4,"I have taken only two online classes at the University of Central Missouri and they both have been great. I'm not a big fan of online, but the professors made it as smooth as they could. With reminders and weekly schedules!"
Sophomore,4,At the University of Central Missouri they offer many majors to chose from and if you are indecisive they have great staff that will guide you into the right direction to help you find something you will love. It is very diverse and can be very easy to make it home. They have wonderful help with any class that you are struggling with.
Sophomore,4,"Schooling being moved online didn’t hinder my education, but with everything going on that caused classes to be moved online it was sometimes hard to focus on tasks."
Senior,4,"I loved the school academically, but not as much socially. It offered a multitude of opportunities for me to learn but to meet people was much more limited."
Sophomore,4,The university to me is a home from home. The campus is small enough it is easy to access at all times and all the professors are easy o work with. Housing is kept up and it is easy to make new friends and make memories. On-campus activities keep things exciting and eventful. The athletics are great and the investments on majors have always got the people I know the best opportunities.
Junior,4,I have been a fully online student and I have found all the professors to be great! They want to see their students be successful.
Freshman,4,"The school and programs are amazing, the teachers really work with you if you need help or having troubles. Something I would like to see change is the dorms, for the price each semester, the are not that good, they need to be remodeled."
Niche User,4,"My overall experience with the school was pretty good, although I'm not going to actually be enrolled in the school until the fall of 2020, I found my college visit to be very informative and interesting. One thing I found interesting about this college is that they give you $1000 dollars for graduating on time!"
Sophomore,4,"I definitely loved the campus, the students and the teachers. Some of the policies when it comes to what classes you have to take and when you have to take them are utterly ridiculous, especially for transfer students, and the academic advisors aren’t terribly helpful, but the professors are more than willing to help you out and make sure you’re taken care of. All you need to do first is ask."
Sophomore,4,"I like the fact that the teacher cares. Distance not too far. Campus feel safe. I enjoy the culture difference. I am looking forward to be a successful graduate. The college experience is a lot of fun, if I could change anything it would be the opportunity to have a lot more positive clubs"
Sophomore,4,UCM offers numerous opportunities too students. They have a great student life and many people are connected.
Sophomore,4,The reason why I choose the University of Central Missouri is for their Criminal Justice program. The department is one of the top criminal justice programs in the state of Missouri. The professors are great and so is the atmosphere of the campus.
Junior,4,I love the campus at UCM.  It is the perfect size for me and they keep it beautifully maintained throughout the year.  I would like to see more programs organized to help struggling college students better understand the resources available to them.
Sophomore,4,"I am a part of the Christian Campus House and I love how loving and welcoming this ministry is. I have been going here since my first day at the University of Central Missouri and was instantly welcomed with open arms. In fact, this group of students and a few alumni quickly became my family and made my freshman year of college and amazing experience. One downside to UCM would be the dining hall food, I would like to see this aspect changed but overall the University is fantastic."
Sophomore,4,"This is my second year at UCM and I would have to say as a school, they are amazing simply because of the resources and support they provide. Although its a small college town, they have everything you would need to be successful."
Sophomore,4,University of Central Missouri is a very diverse campus so everyone feels welcome. Everyone I've come across is so friendly and the professors are very helpful!
Sophomore,4,"Good people for the most part, great interactive and personal professors. School feels very hands on the whole time through and they work with you to make sure you graduate on time."
Sophomore,4,This is a small college where you can make fun out of any situation. UCM offers a multitude of clubs and organizations and if you can't find a club for you then you can start one of you own. The campus is the main spot of the city and it is a safe city to go to school.  I would recommend this college for anyone who wants a small school with close comminuity ties.
Freshman,4,"This has been my first year here and it is not what I expected. I find this place to be home after just a few short months. Although, the campus is not great, the food is worse, and the dorms are over priced for what you are getting."
Sophomore,4,"STUDENTS CONSIDERING AVIATION - There's a few things you should know about the program/department before coming here. All of our instructors and professors in the department are truly great, including the department head, Terry Hunt. Furthermore, all of our planes are maintained very well - better than most other flight schools I've seen.

HOWEVER, the program has exploded in popularity over the past few years, and as a result the Aviation department is experiencing a lot of growing pains. Sadly, there's often a lack of communication between the department, instructors and students over things, such as certain policies that the department as set in place. Also, expect to be put on a wait list to get an airplane during your flight lessons - there just aren't enough planes to meet the demand, and as of now they aren't buying any more either. 

Those things aside, the Aviation programs here are pretty good overall, ESPECIALLY for the money - but be prepared to get frustrated at times."
Niche User,4,"I personally have not attended University of Central Missouri, however, when I visited a couple months ago; I found the campus very amazing. It was very clean and I really liked the location. The people are also amazing as well, there is so much diversity. I would love to attend this college because I think this college has amazing students that actually work hard for their work and would make great friends."
Freshman,4,It is my first year at University of Central Missouri and I love it here. Good for people who like smaller sized classes but not too small. I made a lot of friends here so far and the classes have been good so far with only a few questionable teachers.
Sophomore,4,"The system for roommates is a little off. It can be hard to find the answers you are looking for online. Classes are good. In the dorms, you can hear people really easy which is annoying. There are lots of activities. The food in the dining halls is ok, there isn't any variety."
Freshman,4,The staff and students are very friendly and welcomed us as first year students. I would recommend their design program!
Freshman,4,"I may be calling it too early since I just got through my first semester here, but I have to say that I've found the school I truly belong at. I enjoyed my classes (except math, cause I hate it) and I made lots of friends and I even got a good job on campus! I only hope that I keep feeling this good during the next semester and the years to come."
Sophomore,4,"So far, UCM had provided me with the college experience I want. It has been very fun and interactive, but I do need to get involved more. There are tones of activities and clubs to participate in, but I have not, which I imagine would make my experience even more fulfilling."
Graduate Student,4,I like the freedom of online courses. Most of the professors are very helpful and get back to you in a timely manner.
Sophomore,4,This is a very good school . It is highly diverse and there’s a lot of things to join on campus . There is always something to do or something going on to help one get out the room and be active . There are a lot of resources to help one as a student get through anything and most of the people there to help you are trustworthy . I would like to see better cafe’ food
Sophomore,4,UCM offers students a unique experience packed with academic opportunities and also creates a great learning environment for everyone.
Sophomore,4,"I love most of my professors, my academic advisor and my work supervisor! They're all very helpful. I don't particularly enjoy the dining hall food or the dorms."
Niche User,4,I've been to the campus several times for school activities and athletics and I enjoy it a lot.  The campus is really pretty and there are very nice people there.
Niche User,4,"I enjoyed the overall campus. Even though I am still in high school, I really enjoy every time I visit the school which says a lot."
Sophomore,4,"Helpful and informed professors. Lots of opportunities to get involved, excellent recreation center, pretty campus, and good faculty student ratios. Positive student environment."
Junior,4,What I liked about UCM was how connected the professors are with the students.  They show that they truly care about the students and they wish for them to succeed.  One thing I would change about the school is for more student involvement in events.  There is a lot of support for football games but when it comes to basketball season the support is gone.  I wish the school would promote which games are happening via email and not just posted on there website.
Sophomore,4,"So far, My experience a UCM has been very good. I like the college experience, and have learned a lot about how to be an adult and make it on my own. The classes give me a challenge, but don't generally stress me out too much. The campus has good places for studying and lots of entertainment. The food is mostly good, but I wish there was more variety, it's a lot of the same stuff every day. The dorms are nice, but pricey. Overall, I'm happy with the university, but there's always room for improvement."
Sophomore,4,I have only attended UCM for only a year now. Being there it has helped me discover things about myself that I would not have learned if I stayed in my hometown.
Junior,4,UCM is a great mid-sized college. It is easy to meet people and the choices of activities is great for the size. The professors are very personable. The Greek life experience has been a bonus.
Junior,4,"Overall University of Central Missouri is great for students who are looking for a small classroom with great learning experience. Profressors are there to help if needed, campus is small enough to walk to dorm to dorm, and the students life is great if you want to be an out going, social, and/or studious, University of Central Missouri is the college to be at! Go Mules & Jennies!"
Freshman,4,This university offers a lot of majors and everyone on campus is very welcoming and helpful. If you are a dedicated person then Greek life is a good choice! Your sisters or brothers in the chapter will support you and keep you on track with all your school work as well as have fun and show you around town if you are not from the area. The campus isn't too big and it only took me 10-15 minutes to walk to class. The dorms aren't too bad but I wish all of them had elevators cause walking to the 4th floor everyday is very tiring. I also wish that there was more to do in town because if you aren't involved in a lot of clubs or organizations you will be bored because the town is small and there isn't anything to do. I like that the campus is pet friendly. I wish the dining hall food was better and I wish there were bigger parking lots cause good parking is hard to find.
Freshman,4,The University of Central Missouri is a very good school. The campus is very nice. The staff are all great. The size of the school is on the smaller size which I like.
Sophomore,4,"As a sophomore at UCM, my time here has been quite short. While it's been short, it has also been a very pleasurable experience. There are plenty of opportunities offered here; some that I have pursued are: a Dietetics major, Sport Nutrition minor, Food Science minor, competed in athletics, joined a host of clubs/organizations, volunteer work, and on-campus job opportunities. Besides being required to take an unnecessary amount of General Education classes, I feel as though the academic standing at this school is top-notch. I have met plenty of great people who will help me reach my goals and graduate within four years."
Freshman,4,I plan on attending The University of Central Missouri and I planned out a visit not too long along. I loved the campus and the environment around it. The campus tour was amazing and all my concerns and questions were answered.
Freshman,4,"Everyone is very friendly on campus they make you feel welcomed here. UCM offers a variety of social events to participate in and attend on campus, which is nice because the town of Warrensburg does not offer many things to do."
Freshman,4,I like the atmosphere of the college and I how helpful all of the administration and staff are. I also like the housing and the dining options they have.
Senior,4,It has been a great place to attend for the past four years. Small class sizes have allowed that feeling of being known by teachers and easy to approach for questions.
Freshman,4,"I love that the staff at UCM truly wants to see its students succeed. They are always kind, and professors are always willing to help students in and out of class. There are so many resources for students to take advantage of, such as the Learning Commons and writing center in the library. Here other students and tutors will help each other to better their learning experience. Students are kind and helpful to each other, and the environment on campus is so welcoming. The dining halls have good hours to accommodate all schedules, and the dorms are good sized and have timely maintenance available. There is a campus safety team that is available at all times to walk students to their cars or dorms if they feel unsafe, and I think there is a bus system as well so that students do not have to walk at night."
Niche User,4,"I am a dual credit student through UCM, I nejoy all of my classes and the professors are very helpful."
Freshman,4,I love it here because everybody is friendly here. The teacher here are very nice and they actually try to stay in contact with you. So when you need help they will try their best to help you. Here at University of Central Missouri the people here want you to graduate so they try everything in their power to make sure that happens.
Junior,4,"I'm a transfer student, who transferred from a local community college with AA. granted I have only been here for two semesters now, but it has been a rollercoaster of a ride. However, it is nice to live off campus, so that I could decompress and still stay independent."
Freshman,4,"Great campus, relative class size, not much to do in the town, but you are required to live on campus for 2 years."
Freshman,4,They offer a large range of classes and majors which makes it easy to find something you enjoy. However it is a large school so in some classes it is hard to get help from the teacher.
Junior,4,"My experience at the University of Central Missouri has only been a full year so far, but I have enjoyed the time I've spent. Being a student that transferred here, it has been pleasant to feel like I made the right decision. It is a much bigger school than the private one I came from, but at the same time more than half as cheap. The biggest difference is the student life. There are so many more opportunities and ways that you can get involved on campus, or just interact with what others are into. It also has given me the chance to move away from home in the Kansas City area, but it isn't too far to where I couldn't go home any given weekend if need be. I am finding that the longer I am at the school, the more motivated I am to get on the right path towards what my future holds, as well as doing better with my courses."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoy the atmosphere here, it's the right size school, not to small not to big. The town is little and cute, and everyone is so nice. The school really helps you find yourself and helps you discover what's important to you, and really gets you ready for the workforce. I can't imagine going anywhere else."
Sophomore,4,"As a current student at the University of Central Missouri (UCM) I get to see a lot of new things happening around campus. The football field has been renovated; new apartment buildings are being built right off campus, and the academic and athletic departments are working constantly to bring the best to the student population. With the recent funding cuts at UCM I am amazed that we are still functioning to the same degree as in years past. It is a testament to this college's ability to adapt to change and provide for the student community. 
As a student I would like to see updates to the student housing; the dorm rooms themselves in particular. I would like to see increased student involvement around campus and more events centered toward building a community among the students.
The University of Central Missouri is a wonderful campus. It is easily accessible and easy to navigate. It brings a small campus feel to a student body of over 14,000. 
Go Mules"
Alum,4,"The public relations program at University of Central Missouri (UCM) is top notch. The professors are extremely helpful and supportive. Greek Life at UCM helped shape me into the person I am today. I would highly recommend getting involved on campus and meet as many people as you can. I was also a part of athletics at UCM and we were always praised and given content support from staff. If you are planning on getting an MBA after graduation start to study for the GRE early. I was misguided by a staff member, which made me unprepared for the exam. Other than that UCM is a great and affordable school."
Junior,4,"UCM is a very fun school. Not just the partying but also in the classroom. The professors made it so easy to learn. They were very helpful and flexible when it came to students education. UCM is a fun place to learn, the professors get evolved and made learning easy and fun."
Junior,2,"I have had no issues until this year (my third year on campus). I’m right now living in Foster/Knox on campus apartments, and have had a huge issue with bugs. I keep my things clean but have seen roaches, beetles, crickets, and a number of other things in the buiding. All they did to fix it was put down glue traps in my apartment and tell me its an old building with “a bit of a bug problem.” Kinda frustrating considering how much I pay to live here. I don’t recommend living in Foster Knox if you want to live on campus. Great school with great professors, but this makes me want to reconsider where I’m studying."
Alum,2,"It was a very small school, great college town things, just a lack of access to much, very dated, and began to take a turn for the worst via campus issues."
Junior,2,"UCM is one of the worst experiences I have ever had in my life. The title ix system is terrible, they do not care about what situations you may have going on in your life and they play to the low income areas of missouri to scam highschool seniors out of their money. Terrible place to go to school."
College Freshman,2,I do not feel safe on campus. They send emails about crime happenings on campus and all it does is scare us.
College Freshman,2,Greek life needs to be done over at UCM. There are only a few who actually do something positive for the community and those around them and there numbers are low.
College Freshman,2,"As a non-greek, the greek life is very snobby, cliquey, and annoying."
College Freshman,2,"Must be a frat to get into the party unless your DD, to get in you have a pretty good chance if you're normal?"
College Sophomore,2,"The local town is pretty terrible & remote, but us college kids make the best out of it. Kansas City is just over an hour away & St. Louis is 3 hours away if you want to go there."
College Junior,2,"I don't know really, I just don't really see a lot about it, plus I dislike ""Greek Life"" it just seems to encourage irresponsible and irrational behavior."
College Junior,2,"I signed up to room with my friend, but they didn't put us together, which was fine, but he changed his major, so now he can't be in the building he had prefered, so not only are we not together, but he doesn't have a room. So we called and asked to have it  changed and they said we have to wait until two weeks AFTER school starts... We have to move in, move out, and move in again. Why? No idea. Plus, he doesn't have a room at all."
College Freshman,2,"Everyone hates the sodexo food, its really not that very good. Its served at odd hours and if you come by after the lunch hours the food is usually cold. The people who work the dining halls are also very rude and are not pleasant. Except for ester and miss patty!"
College Freshman,2,I do not recommend eating at the dining halls everyday it can get a little bland.
College Freshman,2,"There is not much for kids that are under 21, low cost, and want to have a good time. There is no mall or any major attractions you would have to go out of town to have harmless fun."
College Freshman,2,This is a small college town and there are not very many choices to choose from outside of campus.
College Freshman,2,"The weather is very crazy here, one minutes it's freezing and another its extremely hot. Usually its very windy and classes have been cancelled because of weather on occasion."
College Freshman,2,"There are a lot of rules and regulations, but people still get away with violating them without getting in trouble. That may be due to the fact that they don't get caught though."
College Freshman,2,"The only options for off campus food is fast food restaurants, pizza places, and chinese. That's about it with the exception of a rib crib and applebees."
College Sophomore,2,"Downtown is small, but there are some pretty cool stores there. Aside from that there is a shopping center about 30 min away and thats about it as far as places to shop. There are fastfood places and pawn shops but nothing really special."
College Junior,2,"Financial aid is hard to get especially when you are a student whose parents make an ""average"" amount. It is upsetting that you only qualify for loans because your parents make enough money to support themselves but not enough to contribute to college funds."
College Junior,2,"I do not personally live in Warrensburg, but my friends do and it took forever for the maintenance to show up after their heat broke down! I have also heard that they have not very cooperative in returning security deposits."
College Sophomore,2,I didn't receive any money because my parents make to much. BUT I HAVE THE GRADES AND SCORES TO GET THEM!!!!!
College Freshman,2,"I've heard the rules, but I've also seen plenty of people break those rules, and nothing seems to happen.  Plus, the administrators even told us that their biggest enforcement is the ""honor code,"" so they basically just expect us to obey the rules, even though they aren't going to do anything if we break them.  I think they need to try another method, because that one doesn't work very well."
College Freshman,2,"The only public transportation here (that I've heard of) is the train.  I have a car, so I haven't looked much into it beyond that."
College Freshman,2,"As a vegetarian, I can't eat anything at most of them.  There's a lot of different options, but they're a lot friendlier towards the omnivorous diet."
College Freshman,2,The weather is so confusing here! One day it will be beautiful then the next it's snowing or raining.
College Freshman,2,The transportation is bad because if you dont have a car just walk.
College Freshman,2,The financial system for this school is terrible.
College Freshman,2,"Well so far that i know, you better be interested in sports because that was the majority or scholarships."
College Sophomore,2,"If you like small town sure it's good, but if you like night life and just life it's not good unless you just like to drink."
College Freshman,2,Most students take part in drinking but fewer take part in marijuana use but some still do. 
College Freshman,2,"No matter how much the campus administrators and police try to control it, the party life at UCM is very strong. Underage drinking occurs often and parties are always going on. Other than walking back to your resident place of living when you have been drinking, riding with a designated driver is pretty much the only other option. "
College Senior,2,Not much intrigue with the bars or parties for me personally.
College Junior,2,"There really isn't a whole lot that I would say that is good about my school. The campus is pretty, but it needs to be updated. They charge you for everything, whereas there are several schools that don't charge you for every little thing. I am not really impressed with the teachers in my program. "
College Junior,2,"I have applied for several scholarships through the school and haven't received one. The only scholarship I received, was not a scholarship at all, it was a service award. I don't think it is right that the ""Red and Black"" scholarship is only available to gain as an entering Freshman. "
College Freshman,2,they have a car service but it costs 10 bucks
Recent Alumnus,2,There were not many health vegetarian options.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not all dorms have air conditioning , and there is no difference in price between them. Some of the dorms are very dirty and out of date too."
Recent Alumnus,2,It is a very conservative campus... 
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is nothing in town or on campus most nights, especially if you do not drink."
College Senior,2,"Warrensburg, MO is a small town outside the Kansas City area. The food here is very repetitive. The community has 6 different sub places but only 7 restaurants to choose from that aren't fast food. The cost of places are the same every where because they are chains. The school gives out student discount books with coupons to help the students out. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are taxis, but most housing a lot of restaurants are within walking distance."
Recent Alumnus,2,The parking for this school is one of the worst things about the school. All of the lots are extremely small for the amount of students that we have attend the school and sometimes it becomes near impossible to find a spot. The school needs to find a way to build a parking garage on campus.
College Freshman,2,I guess the guys and girls at my school are okay. I'm really not a sociable person.
College Senior,2,They're friendly but have no knowledge I go back home for the  doctor instead.
College Senior,2,They charge you without telling you until near the next school year and the will be an hold LUbon your student account.
Recent Alumnus,2,It is always kind of a pain dealing with the Financial Aid because they never seem to remember any of my information from the year before and I continually have to repeat the slow process of receiving my aid.
College Junior,2,"Parking can be a nightmare, you have to arrive early."
College Sophomore,2,"The reason that I gave this grade is because there aren't very many convenient spots on campus and the few good spots that we have are ALWAYS taken. When it's freezing cold, raining, sleeting, hailing or snowing, the last thing that anyone wants to do is trudge for what seems like a mile before they get to the dorms."
College Freshman,2,"Only two places to go, very limited variety. Some days it's great but usually not so much."
College Junior,2,"I lived in the dorms for one semester and I didn't like them very much, granted I dealt with campus housing for 4 years.  I prefer my own space, bathroom and no other rules."
College Sophomore,2,"i have had nothing but terrible expiriences with the financial aid, someone would tell me something completely different than everyone else, my fees came to over 300 dollars for not having the correct papers but yet no one would explain what exactly it was i needed, the amount i recieved was perfect for my tuition but because of the fees they put on my account i almost couldnt enroll and now owe money."
College Sophomore,2,"Food in the dining halls are not too bad, but the meals seem repetitive. There are limited options."
College Junior,2,"If it weren't for the wonderful staff the major wouldn't be worth it. The work load is ridiculous, the class layout is difficult and the amount of classes expected to be taken is unimaginably high. Most of the classes don't even have anything to do with my actual major."
College Junior,2,The dining hall staff does not know how to properly wash dishes. I constantly catch colds from the dinning halls. The food choices are not good health wise. The on campus security is good but slow. If I ask for an across campus escort I will be waiting for up to half an hour.
College Junior,2,"Nothing Interest to Do Except Studying at the Library – The school is so quite at night and you will feel a little scary walking on campus at night. Most of building close before 5 p.m. so if you want to go somewhere and get information after you are done with classes, they would say ""Would you come and see us tomorrow?"" 
Only the library opens until midnight but also the cafe in the lib also closed at 4:30. If I am hungry or want a coffee, I can't get any without a car. My school has a tons of international students who doesn't have a car or a friend who doesn't have a car, neither."
College Senior,2,Dining Is Average and Minimal – There are not too many options for dining out and restaurants seem to be shut down on occasion for health violations
College Senior,2,"Greek life organizes events and clubs, but are not overbearing."
College Senior,2,"More Demanding With Same Benefits – Science majors are extremely demanding, while  majors such as business,art, english, etc... get the same benefits. As a science major it is expected to have at least 5 hours of homework a night, while everyone I have lived with, dates, or known has had more time for jobs and more financial stability."
College Senior,2,"Expect to Be Punished – Parking tickets are given way more than safety is upheld. If you slip on grades, even if counselors reassure you, they will most likely be 50/50 on whether they are correct."
College Senior,2,"Little to Do – Unless you are above 21 and like to drink a lot, there is not much else to do at night."
Sophomore,1,"I am currently a student at UCM and the only good thing is the professors. The dorms are all covered with mold, it’s ridiculously expensive and the school doesn’t even have loans you have to get outside loans. The financial aid personnel don’t know anything, same with the success advisors. Online tuition costs twice as much as in class tuition. Safe yourself the hassle and go somewhere else. It was a mistake coming here and spending thousands of dollars on a school that doesn’t care a bit about helping you."
Junior,1,I did not like very much about UCM. They need to change the way that they run mostly everything and stop spending student money on changes that are not needed.
College Senior,1,i do not feel the Greeks are friendly.
College Freshman,1,The food is disgusting and has no variation.
College Freshman,1,"I do not like the rule about how they want  freshman to stay In  dorm for 2 years or pay $2200. To me that is not fair. Housing people should think how people have different religion and they don't eat dinning hall food .  To me I prefer cooking by my self . So, freshman should not have to  pay money if we want to  get out from  dorm ."
College Junior,1,"I hate alcohol. I hate drinking. I hate that all the time, you walk through the halls and see and hear drunks. It just pisses me off."
College Freshman,1,Everyone there is terrible and full of themselves
College Freshman,1,"It's painfully boring, and I want to leave"
College Freshman,1,There is a lot of crime.
College Junior,1,There is very limited parking close to campus.
College Senior,1,"The local atmosphere can easily be explained as...when the weekend comes, people do there best to go home as often as possible."
College Junior,1,Warrensburg is such a boring town. There is really nothing to do there if you aren't going to a bar or a party. There is nothing closer than an hour away either. The town is pretty dirty too. 
College Junior,1,There is no campus transportation. The campus really isn't big enough to need transportation. 
College Junior,1,"In essence the nightlife is really good at UCM, but the amount that occurs in my opinion is far too excessive. The amount of underage drinking that occurs is not good. I have never been to parties, but you can hear everyone coming in from them, especially on Thursdays. "
Recent Alumnus,1,Many of the people in the department don't care and are unhelpful.
Recent Alumnus,1,This town is very remote and boring.
College Sophomore,1,"I do not like the fact that the University doesn't directly assist students in my situation with financial aid in a proactive way.  Instead, one must search, find and locate scholarships and financial aid independently.  A little more help would be appreciated."
College Sophomore,1,"parking is terrible, the parking pass is expensive, there are not enough spaces, they are in odd places, and there are not very lit at night, there are not enough safety poles and the spaces that are usually left are in dark secluded areas"
College Junior,1,I would give my campus housing a D because of my old sweetmates. They were dirty and rude; I almost got kickout of my dorm because I was going to fight both of my sweetmates. Other than that I enjoy the new friends that I have made living in the dorms. I am now living in an apartment because living on campus is to much for me and family to pay for.
College Freshman,1,its negative but we have teachers that are still in schoool themselves and I do not think they should be teaching kids who are either the same age or older then them.

Alum,5,"Not really applicable for me, but the limited online functions that were there when I went there worked quite well."
Freshman,5,"Washington College is a very lively college with the most helpful and friendly staff and faculty. The class sizes are are an average of 15 people, which helps to make the learning experience personal and more in depth. All the professors are available outside of class to talk about homework, class work, and even topics not about the courses. The professors I personally have met with are extremely willing to sit and just chat, giving great advice on other classes, next career steps, or even when we need a mental break from all the studying and work we have as college students. The campus is beautiful, especially on a crisp fall day walking down the Cater Walk or sitting on the green with friends. The school hosts so many fun events such as Build-A-Bear or Midnight Breakfast and puts on great shows and concerts all semester long, and there are so many opportunities to meet new people, even with how small the school is."
Freshman,5,"Washington College is special because of the history it holds. While being right on the Chester River and having easy access huge DC, Baltimore, Annapolis, and Philadelphia allows for short trips on the weekends. The education is special here because of the professors drive for success for their students. Athletics is what keeps Washington College going. Having multiple sports teams and clubs as well allows for many different ways for students to connect."
Junior,5,"Excellent learning environment. This is small school where one on one attention is available and classes are discussion based learning and seminars. A very professional atmosphere which prepares students for the real world. Internship opportunities are always available , and a fully staffed career center for helping shape students future success by providing the tools needed to prepare for a career."
Senior,5,I enjoy attending Washington College. The staff is always ready to help & are committed to our success.
Alum,5,"Washington College offered me a wonderful and welcoming undergrad experience. A liberal arts college geared towards feeling like a family and challenging students in unique and supportive ways, my four years flew by and were filled with unforgettable opportunities. I spent most of my time in the theatre building (Gibson Center for the Arts), but I also enjoyed the Lifetime Fitness Center and the dining hall. Chestertown is a sweet, fun area with a lot to offer if you are willing to engage with the community and step off campus. The Rose O'Neill Literary House was another highlight for any aspiring writer or person who loves literature."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love everything about WAC. The campus is gorgeous. The professors and faculty all know so, so much about their subject. Every faculty member is more than willing to get lunch with you to talk about life or to go over something from class. You can choose to live off campus your junior and senior years, to live in breathtaking Chestertown. Everything is within walking distance, and everything is beautiful when on the water."
Freshman,5,"The campus is small, which gives me an opportunity to meet with professors one on one. I enjoy the campus, the organizations and clubs. My experience here at Washington College is great, I love meeting new people and actually getting involved in activities. I learned different interests in people, this school and the town. I wish the school can bring black sororities on campus, more black people so it can be diverse and change the food. Otherwise, I like my school!"
Alum,5,"It's a great school. Once you find your niche in the campus it's very welcoming, and you know a lot of people! The professors are very tough, but understanding and want to see you succeed. There's been a lot of change over the past 4 years, and honestly it's made the campus even better, with more involvement from the College President, and more of his office asking what the students want to see and do with the school. I highly recommend this school to anyone looking to push yourself, but make sure you're okay with a liberal arts education (you're gonna have to take a little bit of everything)! :)"
Sophomore,5,"I love going to this school. It has a tight-knit community and everyone is helpful. The professors are all hands-on and the school work is not too overwhelming, leaving time to socialize but also making sure we are learning good material. The sports teams are all fun to watch and everyone supports each other."
Junior,5,Washington College offers a real college experience that isn't too overwhelming. The college provides a small-world feel that encompasses you into their community. The college works hard to provide you with a sense of community and is welcoming to people from all over the world. The professors are very knowledgeable in their fields of study. They treat each student as an individual rather than a number in a classroom. Students are willing to help out one another in and out of the classroom.
Niche User,5,"I toured the school and it was amazing . its a 5 minute walk to the water that has a cute old town. the campus is beautiful. it feels so welcoming, everyone is so nice."
Sophomore,5,"Washington College is a great place to be with its many benefits. Being a small campus, students are able to work with their professors one on one and the student body is very tight knit like the community surrounding the school. There are many different study abroad programs offered that will appeal to anyone. Long story short, Washington College offers outstanding academics, many opportunities in terms of networking/internships/job experience for students, personable and extremely talented professors, students from all over the world, and a beautiful campus."
Senior,5,"It is such a welcoming environment and all of the teachers really try and get to know you to help give you the best learning experience. There is always something to do on or off campus so you'll never be bored! It's the perfect size so whenever you're walking to class you can find someone to say hi to, but you also see people on campus that you've nerve seen before."
Senior,5,"After touring eight other schools, Washington College was stop number 9 and after that day I knew I didn't need to see another school, I was home! As someone who has seen Washington College from a variety of point of views I can honestly say there is no place better. Whether your passion is in athletics, student government, theatre or anything else on our long list of available opportunities you will find a home at WAC. 

On the side of academics the professors are the ones who deserve so much credit. They will go out of their way to ensure that your are living up to your true potential. With class sizes of about 16-17 students it's hard to hide in the corner or skip class without your professor noticing. Trust me, this is a good thing. If you get the chance to visit campus be sure to swing your department of interest and talk to any of the professors there! Washington College is truly a special place."
Sophomore,5,"As a current student, Washington college has done more for me than I could have ever imagined. From helping me land my dream internship after only my sophomore year to providing fantastic campus job opportunities and all the programs that are put together specifically for students, I know that my Washington college education is invaluable. The professors get to know all their students individually and cater classes to them. They are all entirely invested in ensuring that we receive the best possible education. I've met my best friends here, and I know I wouldn't be where I am today if I had chosen any other school."
Sophomore,5,"Washington College is a fantastic school. Everyone here wants to know you as a whole person, not just as a student who takes tests and writes papers. People here are extremely welcoming and genuine."
Freshman,5,I like that the class numbers are small and the professors make time for their students. I like how everything on campus is walking distance and all the staff and kind.
Sophomore,5,"It is set in a small town in a rural area, which is what I like best. It is located within walking distance of the Chester River and is superb for water activities, such as kayaking. Being on the water, the college offers science classes that are rarely found in other universities. I was drawn to this college because of the variation among earth sciences. I could minor in earth sciences. They also offer a lot of outdoor activities."
Sophomore,5,"The amount of students at WAC is pretty small, but they definitely have a big school menality when it comes to parties. They're usually not too exclusive and the greeks know how to have a good time. Academics-wise, the professors are awesome and the small class size is really helpful."
College Freshman,5,"This school is amazing. The academics are simpler than I thought, which ended up being very great, yet the classes are just right. I love the professors and how small the class sizes are. Even though the school is small it does have fun on the weekends, but as soon as Monday rolls around the library is where everyone resides at. I love my time here so far and would recommend it to anyone. I have met so many great people and have made a great friend group who will always be there for me and we treat each other like family."
College Sophomore,5,The Career Development Center is an excellent resource on campus that helps with internships and other opportunities. I myself have had several chances from the center.
College Sophomore,5,Very much supportive and understanding. The counselling center is an amazing place for the victims in case.
College Sophomore,5,"I just finished my first year WAC and it was fantastic. Everyone respects you for who you are and it is easy to become close to people,"
College Sophomore,5,The professors at Washington College are very knowledgable in their field and there is an emphasis on activities/talks/field trips that enhance your overall experience.
College Sophomore,5,"As a member of a sorority on campus I love the Greek Life on campus. It is a lot more low key when compared to the huge universities, recruitment is not a week of hours of events. I have met a lot of amazing people that I am happy to call my sisters and friends."
College Sophomore,5,"I love WAC, I have always had a hard time making great friends but at Washington College everyone is so friendly and nice. For example, any time you walk towards a building the person in front of you will hold the door open for you and I just think that is amazing. There are so many little things that make such a difference. All the events that the school holds are fun, entertaining, or interesting in some way and the best part is they are always free."
College Junior,5,High quality courses and professors. Good variety of courses offered but sometimes the timing of the classes interfere.
College Junior,5,"As a member of Zeta Tau Alpha, I personally believe that Greek life on this campus has a very positive impact on this campus."
College Freshman,5,The Career Center is really an outstanding facility to use and they have been so helpful with everything (I'm only a freshman). There is a great wide of connections that they are able to to provide for all students of all majors.
College Freshman,5,"The professors want so much for you to come and ask them for help. They are willing to go above and beyond for those who put the work and show up. You will find a great group of friends who share so many similar interests and experiences. It's so easy to find your college ""family"" due to the size. If I had to go through the college search experience, I would have made more effort for a higher GPA and higher SAT scores, in hopes for more scholarship money."
College Sophomore,5,I am a student athlete so I think the facilities are awesome! So many people participate in athletics either varsity sports or intramural at my school. People come to cheer on the athletes and really make you feel special. Our teams are in the Centennial Conference so the competition is tough! We do well some years and other years can be building years. The coaches are great! The encourage all athletes to put their education first and work hard in school.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Washington College is home. I graduated in May, and I miss being there everyday. The professors care about you and set you up with experiences you just can't get in big schools. My friend published a psychology research paper/project when she was a sophomore. Many of my friends are now published authors. I, myself, got to work with multiple professional theaters, and I traveled to London to see 7 different shows and take classes. The opportunities are endless and the professors make sure you make the appropriate connections with people in the profession. Professors are top notch and are amazing at helping you find jobs through people they know. Even after graduating, you can always call them up. My professors have turned in to great friends. The small campus also makes it extremely easy to get around. This school went from being a school I settled for to my dream school. If I could do it over, I'd choose Washington College every time."
Recent Alumnus,5,"A lot of students are athletes. Even the ones who aren't have full access to the athletic facilities and they are well maintained and updated. The events are fun to go to and usually get involved with other clubs on campus. For example, the Relay for Life committee and ZTA usually get every team to dress in pink for a game to promote breast cancer awareness."
College Freshman,5,Small college with great opportunities.
College Freshman,5,The academics are really great here. they really challenge the students to do better
College Freshman,5,the public safety may be annoying at times but they really are there to help and they help out alot.
College Freshman,5,COMPARING IT TO OTHER COLLEGES i am doing alot better than most of my friends at their colleges. there are not many parties on campus but there is lots to do club wise.
College Sophomore,5,Great school. Offers great selection of classes. Professors are amazing.
College Junior,5,Washington College is the best ever.
College Freshman,5,The school has a very open and welcoming environment. It makes you feel like you are already apart of what's going on without having to do anything.
College Freshman,5,"It's really small and feels like home. I'm from the eastern shore and have tons of family in Chesterton, so I'm no stranger to the area or how the people are in it. The food is good and the campus is beautiful."
College Sophomore,5,"My school has such a welcoming environment, it felt like home the first weekend on campus. Upperclassmen and underclassmen alike are encouraged to meet new people and try new things throughout their entire career at my school, not just their freshman year. My school is unique because of its tight knit community. The small class sizes allow you to really get to know your professors, and build special one-on-one relationships with them, which can help down the road when it's time for letters of recommendation or networking. Furthermore, school pride is overflowing at my college. Despite being a smaller division 3 school, sporting events are always packed to the brim with fans. The school also runs several extracurricular programs during the summer and winter breaks that take students to every place imaginable, from spending time with the Native American peoples in Navajo Nation to building schools for children in Tanzania. If I could go back and do everything all over again, I would choose my school a thousand times over. It's the perfect place for me."
College Freshman,5,"My school truly makes me feel cared about. I don't feel like I'm just a number, I know that I really matter to them."
College Freshman,5,"The trainers are some of the best around and the JFC has great accommodations for athletes and non athletes, everything in the gym is open to all of the students and easy to access"
College Freshman,5,I like the late night hours.
College Freshman,5,I love the college. I don't know much about administration but there is a new president and I have heard great things!
College Freshman,5,They were extremely helpful and it went quickly and smoothly
College Freshman,5,"Write a good app. essay for the merit scholarship and actually talk face to face with financial aid for the rest. They will work WITH you! Have a campus job? Ask about federal work study. Already have one FWS job, but have another campus job that isn't FWS? Talk to Natalie Story and she'll set you up with more FWS dollars to spread to the other job. It's great!"
College Sophomore,5,"New shops open monthly! Most recent was Cafe Sado, a sushi restaurant!!"
College Junior,5,I feel safer at school then at home.
College Sophomore,5,"The Kent Crossing apartments are big, spacious and a great location. Students can get them through regular room draws. Having a kitchen and washing machine is a great benefit. The shuttle runs every night, but it would make more sense to run it earlier in the winter when it gets dark earlier."
College Junior,5,There are two shuttle services that operate around campus: Safe-ride and the Kent Crossing Shuttle. Both are free and flexible.
College Junior,5,They've been so helpful and have given me a scholarship and a grant.
College Sophomore,5,"There is plenty of diversity if one really takes a look. Everyone is very accepting too. There are definitely still somewhat separated ""groups"" of people, but no one is putting anyone down or leaving anyone out based on race, sexual orientation, political beliefs, religion, or economic background."
College Sophomore,5,"We have a ""Safe Ride"" program available to anyone who needs it. The number is given to all students and it's very easy to contact someone and receive a ride. This program is especially useful to anyone who finds themselves or someone they know under the influence and in need of a ride home. There is also a transport system to and from the local apartment complex in which many students live. That is always readily available and very convenient."
College Junior,5,"For the 21 and over crowd there is very little choice in places to go in town. There are only two real bars in town, and the closest nightlife hub is over 40 miles away. Most students can walk to the bars, and underage drinkers frequently get into these places."
College Junior,5,I love my program. I was able to study in the specific area I am interested in and I got a chance to participate in a program that will be invaluable when I am looking for a career.
College Junior,5,The academic programs here are top notch. The career center is always willing to help with internships and faculty advisers are a great resource as well
College Junior,5,The school has many clubs and other activities on campus and also offers many abroad programs and summer trips.
Junior,4,"Great faculty and education, all the staff is open, honest, and helpful. The campus life is accessible and students thrive."
Junior,4,"Professors use zoom at the regularly scheduled time which keeps all students accountable and on a schedule, assignments are posted in advance and everyone keeps their class organized."
Alum,4,"The school is located in a rural farming community, which is not for everyone.  You will need a bit of self-drive to make the town work for you, but the opportunities are actually second to none if you put the work in.  Work opportunities for pre-law students that do not exist in urban areas can be found."
Alum,4,"I just recently graduated from Washington College and wanted to leave my thoughts after four years.
In short, it has its ups and downs. Starting with the positives, parts of Chestertown are beautiful in all seasons and worth visiting. The town is full of interesting shops and characters that help keep student life interesting. The campus itself is nice. The professors here are engaging and interesting people, which helps with the small class size.
However, there have been some administrative issues. Part of the Board of Governors (who de facto run the college) operate the college from a financial standpoint with austere measures, which results in crucial budget cuts to student organizations. Furthermore, the town has had issues with racists harassing students of color, and the administration has only given lukewarm responses. This has been especially pronounced the last couple years, leaving a tense and dull environment to some.
There is potential growth at WC, but know what's up."
Alum,4,"In my experience, Washington College did an adequate job with online classes. It left it mostly in the hands of the teachers, who tried their best to work with the sudden changes. Changing all courses to Pass/Fail also helped, especially for seniors."
Sophomore,4,Small school with engaging professors and strong student participation throughout the entire community!
Freshman,4,I really am enjoying my experience at Washington College because of the environment that comes within it. All of the professors have your best interest at heart and that really shows. The people there are great too! Joining Greek Life has also been such an amazing experience!
Freshman,4,"This school is very small and it's easy for me to make friends. I come across the same people quite often, and I feel like it's my second home. The only downside is the closest Target from here is like a 45 minute drive away. At least we have ACME. The people here are nice and the professors are amazing. Don't be scared by the sticker price of Washington College!! Most students do not pay that price! The school gave me a huge scholarship, probably because of my grades. I'm not trying to brag, I'm just saying don't let the price scare you away if you have good grades!! The dining hall has fries almost every day and there are options for vegans and vegetarians. There are also gluten free muffins, but they run out quickly (my bad...) and it would be cool if they were refilled a little faster."
Freshman,4,"Very good academics, small campus it gives you a lot of opportunities to connect and know everyone on campus by seeing them often. Small town surrounding campus"
Freshman,4,"Washington is absolutely beautiful and all the professors are great.  The classes are extremely challenging and there is a very heavy course load. However, Washington has many resources to help for succeed and they are free. The dining hall food is not very good but that is common to college campuses. Washington has great internship opportunities and job connections."
Freshman,4,"All of the professors that I have had are amazing, they are all there to help you become the best version of yourself. Overall everyone is so welcoming and friendly."
Freshman,4,"I love how engaged and dedicated the professors who work at this institution are, often times professors would rather meet over a cup of coffee rather than in their office which makes it personal and more comfortable. I have also had some amazing opportunities with the Signature Centers on campus such as the Starr Center and the Center for Environment and Society. At both of these facilities I have been working on professional skills and am getting hands on experience most Undergraduates do not get. For example, I have experience in curating, archiving ,museum design and in an archaeology lab setting. I would like to see the local community show more enthusiasm to college kids, all of them say they love the students but do not have College Student friendly hours. I also would like to see longer dining hall hours."
Alum,4,"Washington College offers a range of courses, excellent professors and a close feeling of community due to its relative small size. It is an expensive private school, but is rewarding for those who enroll."
Junior,4,"I love how it had what i wanted to study when I get into college which theater, the cost to get in capable within my family and mine income . The staff members seem extremely nice and helpful and the professor seem caring as stories the I've had been told."
Freshman,4,"The major concern with this school is the “party scene.” Obviously it’s not a large state school, but I think it might be even harder to find your place here socially. The “party scene” is divided by athletes and greek life that have off-campus houses. There are definitely people in with both groups, but this is kind of rare. ALMOST EVERY SINGLE PARTY YOU ATTEND WILL HAVE A LIST. This makes it hard to actually meet people at the party and “get on a list.” So from a “fun” “party” perspective this school is far from welcoming. However, the Student Event Board and other organizations have many opportunities for “good clean fun” which is fun until you get FOMO about not making the cut to be in the party scene. The town of chestertown has 3 bars total (2018) and one is a professor bar so it’s actually two."
Junior,4,"Washington College is an institution which felt like home to me from the very first time I had the opportunity to visit its campus. There is no shortage of opportunities for upward mobility and experience provided by the college. From the career center and its openness to assist students either in building or editing their resumes, to the wide array of internships which the college is willing to sponsor. The professors on campus are also eager resources, and provide a number of opportunities for students to practice their skills in their fields and to learn how to properly network with their community in order to build a name for themselves. The campus allows students many chances to serve as their own independent body and to dictate how their college experience will be shaped on their own terms."
Senior,4,I like the college quite a bit. The only downside is that it can feel a bit boring at times but I think it's because of the town it's in.
Alum,4,"I loved the small town, close knit community feel that surrounded the campus and nearby town. The education was top notch with close professor relations based on small class size. The downside is the pricetag."
Sophomore,4,"Academics here a very good. The classes are small allowing you to form meaningful relationships with your professors and get one on one help if needed. The professors take genuine interest in you succeeding in their classes if you show the effort. The only complaints I have about the college are there is not a terrible lot of diversity. Most of the students are upper class white people, some of which aren't the friendliest. However, you will get a great education here."
Freshman,4,"Washington College facilitates a warm and welcoming community that accommodates and supports students of different backgrounds and aspirations. The most frustrating part of the school is its lack of accessibility in Chestertown, Maryland."
Junior,4,"Washington College is a lovely, little liberal arts college. The administration tries its best to make the campus feel welcoming. Since the school is small, it's very easy to seize great opportunities from simple things like spots in cool classes to participation in departmental programming."
Senior,4,"The school provides a very personal touch, which makes it beneficial. Campus is beautiful, great professors, nice support. All around, WC helps develop its students as overall individuals which I like."
Junior,4,"I just finished my sophomore year here, and I wouldn't want to be anywhere else. The small size of the school allows for individual attention for students, and there are many opportunities to get involved in topics or activities that you'd never expect to be involved in. As it is a liberal arts college, it is possible to take classes in various departments, which helps the students become well-rounded instead of only focusing on their main interest. The dining hall options have taken a recent dive, but the management team has obtained opinions from students, so hopefully that will change next year and become what it once was."
Freshman,4,"Washington College is a small school in a cute, quaint town. It has a beautiful campus, with small class sizes and friendly people (students, professors, faculty and even people in the town itself). The only drawback is the price, which is still a little high. If you want small class sizes and a tight knit campus in a beautiful, historic town, it may be worth the price."
Junior,4,Washington College (or WAC) is a tight-knit community that provides excellent opportunities for the future. The faculty is made up of the best of the best and are always available to help students excel. There is always something fun to do on campus.
College Freshman,4,"Living here is pretty nice. The dorms are nice and I actually met some of my best friends that live on my floor. I wish we could loft our beds but our building does not allow that, but overall they are really nice."
College Freshman,4,"As a freshman you can only rush into a sorority your second semester of freshman year, which gives you enough time to pick your favorite one. There are only 3 as well so it is not completely big around here."
College Freshman,4,"Although I don't play a sport, I do sometimes do to sport games and from what i can see they are really good and train the athletes well."
College Senior,4,"When I first came to WAC, I thought the party life was going to be bland. I strongly considered transferring to a bigger school, thinking I would get a better experience. Turned out WAC knows how to have a good time, considering how small a school we are and that we are in the middle of nowhere. Plus, alcohol is pretty cheap in Maryland compared to most places. My advice to you is to give it a chance, take advantage of what you have, and live life to the fullest! Just because we are a small school doesn't mean we know how to party/drink!"

College Senior,4,Teachers know their stuff and are always willing to help
College Senior,4,They make a good effort.
College Senior,4,"I thought WAC was going to be a boring school because of its size and location, but it ended up being pretty fun. You have to take advantage of what's available and live life to the fullest! Take a chance! Considering the size of this school, WAC knows how to have a good time. Networking is also good too."
College Sophomore,4,I'm very happy to be a part of the Washington College community.
College Sophomore,4,Feels safe to be in there.
College Sophomore,4,It's both social as well as service based. A great thing to look on campus.
College Sophomore,4,They're very friendly and encouraging. And the athletic staff motivate and encourage the non-athletic students too take opportunities from the college.
College Sophomore,4,One of my best decisions of life to get into Washington College.
College Sophomore,4,I am not a part of Greek life but have quite a few friends in sororities. They are very involved. They do a lot of fundraisers and they interact with non greeks.
College Sophomore,4,The fitness center is fantastic and up to date. Athletes and non athletes are allowed to use the equipment.
College Sophomore,4,"I am going into my sophmore year so I have only lived in Freshman housing and I am going to live on the Western Shore this upcoming school year. I lived in Reid for my Freshman year and I loved it, I had a great RA and an amazing community of floormates. Reid was also a great Freshman dorm because it has a kitchen and a pool table in the basement which is great."
College Sophomore,4,The athletic facilities are very nice and open to the entire student body. Many students go to games but most only go when they are on campus.
College Freshman,4,I don't know much but they get themselves known and I believe there are many internship opportunities. We get weekly emails to notify us of possible internships and jobs we may be interested in.
College Freshman,4,"Professors are great and actually want to get to know each student. There is a variety of courses offered within my major. Class sizes are small and the professors tend to be one-on-one with you in and out of the classroom.  It's no big deal to go meet with them outside of class, or to see them in the dining hall or around campus."
College Freshman,4,The health center makes concerns aware to the school and students. So they are there if the students need them.
College Freshman,4,"The dorms are great. You're gonna get a freshman dorm when you're a freshman but the newer dorms are fantastic. It's costly, though. The housing process can be a bit stressful. The dorms, for the most part, are close to classes and the dining hall."
College Freshman,4,There is more of a sense of helping and caring for the community with Greek life.
College Freshman,4,"I easily found this school to be my second home. It's a small campus; however, it is settled in a small town so there are many opportunities to be a part of the community. It is right along the river which is a huge plus for outdoor sciences and labs, and also for recreational purposes. I found a school where I can be myself and found many people to help me grow in important aspects of my life, not just in academics but also in my faith."
College Freshman,4,"The campus is very safe, even at night. This has to do with the college being in the middle of nowhere and in a town of old people."
College Freshman,4,My professors generally were very supportive and wanted me to succeed. The class sizes were small which helped me.
College Freshman,4,"I had a professor who didn't like me and accused me of stealing a pen. He also didn't grade my papers fairly. Other than him, the professors are nice enough. The English department has some really great professors who make the classes fun and interesting. ENG 101 is shouldn't be a requirement but the GRW is actually a good class. It is worth the requirement."
College Freshman,4,"The career center is geared towards getting as many graduates as possible employed. There all multiple career fairs throughout the year, and the small student population means there are numerous opportunities for each student to network with alumni or potential employers."
College Freshman,4,"Professors all genuinely care, and there are many support services for anything a student may need. The only drawback is that this is a very small school in a very small town, so social life and parties are lacking. However, almost everyone knows that going in, so no one is really unhappy with the level of parties here."
College Freshman,4,"The school is a small community with students and faculty that genuinely care. It is encouraged for everyone to get involved in as many things as possible, and it is also relatively easy to find something that you're interested in. I would definitely enroll here again"
College Freshman,4,The school is small and so is the classrooms.  The teacher to student ratio is great.  The Professors are truly interested in the students succeeding
College Sophomore,4,"My experiences with professors and courses have been great. I have immensely enjoyed almost every class I've taken at WAC, and the professors are the biggest influence in making the academic environment as good as it is. My professors, save maybe 1 or 2, have all been VERY competent, very articulate, prepared, and insightful. Classes are very small, so attendance is fairly strict; you can't skip without the professor noticing. Classes are usually discussion based with heavy amounts of writing. WAC prides itself on the competency its students as writers, so you will be exercised thoroughly in writing during your time there. For a small school, they offer a wide variety of majors. However, not as many classes are offered in less popular majors, so you don't have much wiggle room when it comes to selecting classes to meet your requirements."
College Sophomore,4,"The biggest sports for Washington College are Lacrosse, Rowing, and Baseball. Every year we face our rival school's lacrosse team in an event called ""War on the Shore,"" and it's a huge party. Whether we win or not people have a great time cheering and boozing on the lawn near the stadium. I am not personally interested in the sports at WAC, so I have only been to War on the Shore, since it's one of those can't miss events unique to Washington College, however I know many students regularly attend the baseball, basketball, and soccer games and sports like Rowing bring in big wins from regional Regattas."
College Junior,4,Our public safety is great at ensuring our safety and security on campus.
College Junior,4,"the career center at this school is phenomenal, they really work with students to set the up with internship and job prospects."
College Junior,4,"I love my school, it's a small liberal arts college on the Chester River consisting of a tight knit community. It's truly a home away from home. Class sizes are small so you get to know your professors and peers in a very intimate environment, and there are a variety of ways to get involved on campus."
Sophomore,2,Come here if you want to live on campus all 4 years. That seems to be what the school is pushing for.
Freshman,2,"Not the right fit for me. I've met a some good friends and I like my professors, but that's really it. There isn't a lot to do both on and off campus and I honestly have found myself going home most weekends rather than staying on campus. The only things there really is to do is either party, lounge in other people's rooms, or drive a full thirty minutes and go to Middletown to grab some food or see a movie. The overall quality of dorms, food, and activities/clubs is pretty also low. I can see why some people really like it here because it's a really small and personable school, but I'm just a person who doesn't really fit in with that environment. A small school in an isolated rural environment just doesn't really evoke my idea of the optimal college experience. I'm going to be transferring to a much larger college next semester and I feel like that's just a better fit for me."
Freshman,2,"As a student athlete, I thought I would be welcomed on campus. this school feels like high school and is extremely cliquey. If you are not an athlete you're outcasted. Parties are held by frats and sports houses but everyone still only worries about themselves. People are not welcoming, very self absorbed. It is hard to make friends after the first week because we everyone is in their own little clique that its hard to break. No one is very inviting and will not go out of their way to be nice to you. Since it is in the middle of no where it is hard to escape. You walk the same path everyday and see the same people. The academics are extremely easy and a joke, I was not challenged at all. If you are a recruit and going to be an athlete here, be prepared to find yourself alone for most of the time, there is no nice team atmosphere. Most freshman want to transfer because the school is so small and is not a good value overall. Everyone is cliquey and self absorbed."
Freshman,2,I am currently a freshman at Washington College and I don’t enjoy it.  The town is so small there is absolutely nothing to do.  Anything fun to do is at least an hour away so if you don’t have a car you’ll be extremely bored.  The parties are boring and you’ll only enjoy them if you’re drunk.  There is no school spirit.  There is little diversity on campus and the Greek life isn’t lit either.  The school itself is just very boring.  The positives are that it is a beautiful campus and the class sizes are small but other than that you’ll most likely be looking forward to going home the entire time you’re there.
College Junior,2,Most of the time public safety is more worried about finding students underage drinking then students who are actually in danger and need help
College Student,2,"Its a funky processes i think for any school, this one is no different."
College Student,2,"Most freshman complain the first week of school how it gives them the runs. Very gross, and very mediocore food. But amazing kitchen staff!"
College Freshman,2,"Not much to do, as Chestertown is very isolated. Aside from it being a historic town that some people tour, not much to do as a young adult."
College Freshman,2,"Not a lot of housing options aside from Kent Crossing, which has apartments also available through the school."
College Sophomore,2,"It is no secret that a Washington College education is on the rise. For lower income families like myself, I constantly think about if I am returning the following semester or not. It is a scary thought due to the fact that every dollar counts."
College Sophomore,2,Just avoid the red meats. The sandwiches are always good.
College Junior,2,"My financial aid does match to what I really need.  Students with wealthy families receive more aid than I do, even though I come from a lower standard of living."
College Junior,2,I can count the number of place to eat on one hand
College Junior,2,Not practical to apply to different fields of study.
College Junior,2,Their is not enough racial diversity.
College Freshman,2,"The dining hall is fine if you have no allergies or other dietary restrictions. If you do, good luck, they're going to try to kill you at least once and starve you on the daily. I cannot eat meat or cheese, so most days I just get a bowl of chick peas from the salad bar. Mondo's Subs is great though. They have good options and the food is delicious. Also, some of the staff are great guys and always brighten your day. Java George has reasonable coffee and muffins, so it's no waste of dining dollars to go there from time to time."
College Freshman,2,"We are nearly homogenous racially and socioeconomically. Of course their are exceptions, but overall it is about as white and upper middle class as they come.  There is a lot of unintentional ignorance in regard to racial issues. There are a couple confederate flags hanging in dorm windows, which most people do not condone, but no one really seems to adamantly condemn either.  We do have a fair number of international students, mostly from countries in Asia. Most of our diversity is in opinion. I have met more people with different views and perspectives at WAC than any other place I've been. Additionally, we have a really active LGBT rights group called Encouraging Respect of Sexuality (EROS) and recently added gender neutral housing."
College Freshman,2,There is a shuttle that goes from Kent Crossing (the off-campus apartments) to campus. That's it. There is no other way to get anywhere without a car.
College Freshman,2,Having Macs are great but what's the point when the network is slow or doesn't work?
College Junior,2,Some members of Greek life believe they are far more important than they are when they account for 15% of the school population. They don't throw great parties and they aren't influential.
College Junior,2,Most places in town offer a student discount however as far as restaurants go there are very few quality choices.
College Sophomore,2,"I am not going to include the apartments that the college makes available as housing options in this review.

Off campus housing is rarely used, simply because it's not convenient and living in it removes you from the campus enough that you tend to miss things. Also, Chestertown is a pretty expensive place to live."
College Sophomore,2,"Most students are white - something that took some getting used to, considering I went to a school where less than 40% of the students were white. This year incoming class had considerably more black people. Race doesn't matter here, though I can tell there's a bit of newness that has made a bit of a subconscious barrier to casual socialization between races."
College Sophomore,2,Free campus parking is difficult to find as is on campus parking. The difference is on campus parking costs about $70 and our security likes handing out tickets. However as long as you know what times of days to try for the free parking it is right next to campus and is not too difficult to find a spot.
College Sophomore,2,"There are one or two place but I honestly do not know much about them. I know people underage can get in but this is not a town with a lot of night life options, especially off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"You have the fast food places and the pizza place, along with Chinese food and then it jumps from there to more expensive cafes and restaurants that are mainly reserved for when family visits. Not a lot of in between."
College Junior,2,Chestertown is a very small town with no transportation systems available to get anywhere unless you have a car. Many students don't have cars and this is a big issue on campus. The school is not diverse in which I feel the school should do a better job at that.
College Junior,2,"I loved physics in high school and knew I wanted to be an engineer in college. Here at Washington College I thought this program would be great, three years here for a Bachelors in Physics then two at Maryland for engineering. Although the program sounded too good to be true I would find that my physics classes would be the low point in my day. The professors are sometimes vague, hard to follow, and can sometimes take forever to get back to you.There were times in my three years here where I didn't think I was going to make it. The physics department here is definitely one of the departments that needs work."
College Sophomore,2,"Lots of sickness always, but every college is like that."
College Sophomore,2,"Parking permits are relatively expensive and that seems to be a little ridiculous because there are always spots open. Also, I was given a parking violation hours after I parked my car during move-in day."
College Sophomore,2,I definitely had problems getting financial aid. They didn't tell me everything I could get. My mom had to do some deep searching to figure it out on her own. I've had friends that also had problems with people saying that she wasn't approved when it was already approved more than once. I don't know if that's the school or not.
College Sophomore,2,"The computers in all of the labs are of really good quality. They're all Apple or Lenovo desktops. The printing seems to always be having problems though. The internet gets pretty slow at times, I think it's because people use Skype even though we wee specifically told not to. It's definitely a great idea to have your own computer because the library does get crowded during finals and because it does close eventually. I like to be able to do my work whenever I want to."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a couple cute places to eat in Chestertown, but by no means do we have a variety of options. The places usually close very early, but each restaurant is within walking distance of the school.  Sam's is a good place for college students and the Fishwhistle has delicious food with a price that is great for fancier occasions."
College Junior,2,"What Is School Spirit? The varsity sports scene at WAC is pretty pathetic. Your usual scene at the sports stadium is the same as it would be at a little league game, cheering parents, siblings, and friends of the players. There are the couple townies who tend to show up but all in all its a pretty pathetic site all year round. The only great sporting event is War on the Shore and Spring Fling, where attendance soars, but this is due to the amount of drinking done, not school spirit and support of the teams."
College Sophomore,2,"Limited Choices – The night life is always the same, so new things to do at night is rare."
College Sophomore,2,"Process Can Vary. I have had good and bad experiences with financial aid. I do not agree with the process that the school takes when handling the sources of funds. I suggest that anyone who is considering going to college should stay on top of their financial aid and their accounts. I have enough money to pay for my college education, however i do not see the money. The outside scholarships that i received were not given to me and i was unable to use them for my books and other expenses due to the way the system is set up."
College Freshman,2,"Open Campus Leads to Downfall of Safety – Our campus is not fully protected from residents of the surrounding town coming to our parties and taking advantage or becoming violent with students. While I am aware that our public safety is doing their best, the police of the town have nothing better to do (due to low crime rate in the actual town) and should be trying harder to keep us safe."
College Freshman,2,"Shuttles- Eh – They need to improve the system. Only two shuttles run on friday and saturday. One at 9am and one at 4pm. I've heard they are working to fix this however, and I really hope they do. That's why I'm glad I was able to bring a car or else I'd truly be stuck."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life is ridiculous here. Girls pay for their friends, the moment they get accepted they all love each other. (they dont realize that they don't know each other yet...) Highly fake. They are nice girls however and the reputations of our sororities are more based on individuals and not the sorority as a whole although there are basic generalizations. The guys in frats, not noteworthy. only good for their dance parties and even then they are usually lame. Some guys are great, haven't had a bad experience with them. Can't tell you much about the frats. Besides kappa sig, all are nerds. most other colleges they're ""the s***"" frat, here they are made fun of. I used to think it didn't dominate the scene, but it sorta does since theres nothing else to do here."
College Freshman,2,"Shuttle Is the Only Option – Public transportation at Washington College is poor. the only form we have is the shuttle, which is free, but only runs to D.C and the Annapolis mall. There is no other form of public transportation, which is a problem for most students like myself who don't have a license."
Alum,1,"This school will likely fail financially within the next 20 years. As a recent alumni I can honestly say that everything about this school is a scam. From the housing to the dining hall to the academics, the school puts forth a mediocre product that is not remotely similar to what they advertise. The school also has significant problems with racism and classism that go ignored by the administration. It does not matter how much money they give you it simply is not worth it to go here. They could pay you to come here and it still would not be worth it. The campus feels like jail and most of the students are depressed 90% of the time. Save your time and money and go do literally anything else with the next four years of your life."
Junior,1,"One of the worst decisions I have ever made. Everything about this school sucks. Administration don't care about anything beside money. There have been 2 sucides in the past 5 years which is absurd. If you want a school that is going to feel like highschool with a lot more racism then Washington College is for you, otherwise stay away."
Alum,1,"Disgusting, awful, and unsanitary. Beware of the townies. You will be STUCK in this campus with nowhere to go. No crosswalks-- very dangerous to walk anywhere. Students are standoffish and cliquey. The food in the dining hall is gross and inedible. Always check your plate/cup/utencil to make sure it is not dirty. Dining hall staff are incompetent and rude. You will be forced to write a thesis (mine was 80 pages) your senior year and it will consume you. This school will financially cripple you and then only contact you to ask for more money. DO NOT GO TO THIS SCHOOL!"
Sophomore,1,"This college has major problems and the administration does not want to acknowledge them. Mental health problems pretty much go ignored even if they are reported by RAs. Racial bias issues are pretty much just talked about but nothing is done to fix the racism on campus. People aren't held accountable for their actions. Budget cuts have killed anything good. All the administration cares about is getting more money. The food has gone downhill this year. Anyone with a dietary restriction (vegetarian, gluten free, vegan) should go to another school. Nothing happens on campus during the week or weekend so everyone gets drunk constantly. The professors are the college's only saving grace. This college might as well be held together with duct tape. :("
Senior,1,"Literally the most horrible school. I wish I chose a different school. You'd be glad you did. This school steals money from its students. Not worth the money. It FALSE ADVERTISES. Remember that Admissions Office is a business. They may come across all kind and smiles but its so fake and they are two sided. They literally get paid to smile. Its so laughable. If you are smart, don't chose this school. Its in the middle of nowhere and the academics are overrated. Getting an ""A"" or ""B"" from this school is unheard of. Professor do NOT care if you fail. In fact they live to see students struggle. Take this from a senior who knows the ins and outs. Don't come here. Save your soul."
College Sophomore,1,"We only have a Dominos and McDonald's open past 8pm and the latest campus options close at 11. So if you need to eat anytime past 11, you are forced to eat fast food. Other than those places, we have 1 mexican place and 1 sit down Italian place. No variety in town restaurants."
College Student,1,Its all fast food. Its gross and it causes alot of freshman 15 gain
College Freshman,1,"There isn't any. If international students weren't here, there'd be 4 non-whites student, seriously."
College Freshman,1,"There's the shuttle-bus that takes you to the mall in Annapolis and the metro-station, other than that, there's nothing else except for SafeRide on weekends, which isn't always the best."
College Freshman,1,"If you don't have a car, you can walk and get Taco Bell or KFC chicken, or eat at the Chinese Take-Out place. Or order pizza or get donuts from Dunkin Donuts. In general, it's unhealthy and disgusting foods. Not worth the commute, money, or time."
College Freshman,1,"Just drinking, that's all. The activities that the school provides are lame and barely anyone goes to them. There's no ""nightlife"" and the bars have overpriced drinks and they let in pretty underage girls who throw glitter on their bodies and wear clothes that barely cover themselves."
College Junior,1,"Parking permits cost way to much, and there is virtually no student parking near the academic buildings."
College Junior,1,"Public transportation is limited to a campus anti drunk driving program called safe ride, and one shuttle to and from the the local apartment complex."
College Sophomore,1,There is hardly any diversity at Washington College
College Freshman,1,"Because the town is small, most people commute to internships, or do them in the summer."
College Freshman,1,"Small Town, Can't Expect Much – There are three bars near campus. One doesn't card much, one almost got shut down and recently had a name change, the other I haven't been to. Mostly for upperclassmen over 21. Nothing much to do for underage besides drinking in dorm rooms. Lame scene, town is dead. Everything closes early besides the bars. Having a car is essential. Annapolis and DC are great escapes. Trust me, it's a small school-you will need to escape. They claim birthday ball is one of the top 5 reasons to go here, it wasn't fun. Too hyped up and really disappointing. If you want a good nightlife dont come here unless your ideal nightlife is getting wasted in a dorm room and everybody knowing who you hooked up with the next day. Reputations spread fast."
College Sophomore,1,"Not for Me – Other than the college's ""off-campus"" apartments for upperclassmen, there's not a whole lot available (unless, of course, you can shell out $8K+ a semester, and then you're racing to beat other tentative tenants)."
College Junior,1,"Student Gov't Wastes Money on Greeks – The most popular students tend to be involved in Greek Life. Joining a frat or sorority is a huge status symbol, and members flaunt their membership tirelessly. Greek Life is also awarded a lot of the funding that is available from the SGA, minimizing the amount that is available to other clubs. However, frats and sororities are known almost exclusively for the parties they throw and not for their philanthropies."
College Sophomore,1,There are essentially no ways to get around Chestertown minus the shuttle taking people to Annapolis / BWI before and after breaks.

Freshman,5,Cogswell college has been extremely patient with me and my family as we scramble for financial aid. They have been so kind to my father who suffers from a brain injury due to a motorcycle accident and have been super supportive of me and my dreams. It is clear that they push their students to success.
Junior,5,"This is an amazing school if you're not looking for parties but rather for practical skills and industry knowledge. I'm in the audio program and would not study anywhere else. Most instructors care about your learning and I'm lucky to have Julius as my studio and sound design teacher, who is not only the best of the school but one of the best in the industry. I'm a junior and have been part of three Cogswell projects and I'm taking MediaWorks right now. In MediaWorks we are working with a well known large company and produce a full blown animated audio project for them. It's fast and sometimes stressful but awesome to work like you are part of an actual company. The professors give us their best advice to make it in the business that they also came from. I keep growing my professional portfolio and can't wait to start working for an audio company soon. If you're looking for practical education, put Cogswell on your shortlist."
Junior,5,"I like the small environment of Cogswell, allows for easier communication with teachers. I would just like to see change in the classrooms, better workspace and desks for the students."
College Student,5,I feel no threat at school ever.
College Freshman,5,"I have not heard of anything bad happening on campus. I believe the campus is super safe. There's security measures to make sure that only people that are supposed to be there, are there. I don't worry about anything happening to me when I walk around alone. I feel safe."
College Freshman,5,"Classes and the administration are very helpful in helping students break into the field they're studying for. Students have to work hard, because a lot of the internships are competitive. However, that doesn't stop anyone because we have a pretty strong support system."
College Freshman,5,"Not exactly on campus, the college has set up a student housing system where students stay in nearby apartments. It's very quiet and spacious."
College Freshman,5,The students are all very friendly to each other and the teachers are open to help.
College Sophomore,5,Have never heard or had any issues with safety
College Senior,5,"So far, I've loved this school! Everyone is really friendly and since the class sizes are small, usually between 10 to 15 students, the teachers can really help you after class or even through e-mail. There's a lot of clubs ranging from a simple Anime Club to a serious Game Development Club."
College Student,5,"Welcoming, small campus with personal attention."
College Student,5,Steven was extremely helpful and always available to answer a question.
College Sophomore,5,"Literally steps from the door. Always a spot. must be 400+ parking spots and only 300 students and most commute, some bike, others walk."
College Sophomore,5,"For the careers that our students go into, this school is in THE prime location, and has THE definitive reccomendations from professors who have not only worked in, but also paved the way, in their respective fields."
College Sophomore,5,"I am really happy with my program. My career goals is to be a concept artist for video games, and once I graduate, looking for a job in that field will be tough. But, I'm learning so much at this school and am looking forward to learning even more."
College Sophomore,5,Everyone is extremely accepting of one another. There are no clicks or segregation anywhere. Expect to feel at home when at this school
College Freshman,5,"There are plenty of computers readily available on campus. Whether you need to work on homework or projects. Although, during the midterms and finals, there will be more pople using the computers but there will always be some that are unoccupied. It is not necessary to own a laptop, but I like the fact that I can carry around my work with me."
College Sophomore,5,"I love the program I'm in. Being in DAA, I find that everyone around me has very similar interests as I do. Be it video games, anime, animation, art, as well as many other 'nerdy' things. It's nice to be in an environment were everyone seems to be on the same page when it comes to interests. I don't feel alienated or left out because I can almost grantee that there is something similar between myself and my classmates. The courses themselves are hard and challenging, but in a good way. I feel that I'm being taught the things I will need to know if I want to further myself in this career."
College Sophomore,5,"The process of getting into my major was pain-free and very easy. The administration works with the students to make sure you get all the classes and credits you need for each semester. Though the programs can sometimes not be as cut-and-dry as other colleges, you are still learning what you need to learn to be able to advance in the career you choose."
College Sophomore,5,"Great, Many Labs – Most students have their own computer, but we were rate top three school with most computers per students"
Sophomore,4,"A college that focuses on what I believe to be our generation's Gold Rush, which is Game Design, Sound Design, Business, and many more.  Cogswell represents nerd culture in it's rawest form, and that isn't a deterrent.  A lot of the alumni, teachers, and students are there to create an environment that feels like a pseudo-family.  I can confidently say that a percent of famous artists, or skilled coders will come from this college.  The campus is small enough that it'll keep you focused on what you came there for."
Sophomore,4,"Transition from on-campus to online has been difficult, but I think the efficiency of the transition is to be celebrated."
Junior,4,"Has professors who know their stuff and have worked in the industry on shows you may know from your childhood and even now. The staff are kind and ready to help you whenever, the equipment is up to date with the latest computers, tablets, and programs like Photoshop and Maya. Only issue is the price of tuition, understandably high with professional artists on hand, but for the past four years the tuition has been slowly raised by at least 2% each year. They also will take at least six years, if you are not affording summer, to graduate."
Sophomore,4,My experience with Cogswell so far has been helpful in terms of my growrth among a community. The student size is very small so it's much easier to network and work together with fellow students outside of coursework. It is also much easier to communicate with the Professors due to the small class size. Most of the Professors are still in industry or have worked in it so when we get advice from them it's relevant to how it is now.
Sophomore,4,"The professors are excellent at teaching the materials and are very willing to help. All the school work is manageable as long as you cut your day job down to four days maximum. You won't have time for both if you work five days or more. 

The school is right by a landfill, so walking or driving to school with the windows down is a bit of a pain. Almost all of the people I've spoken to are indoors-type people and are hardcore into anime, games, and movies. You'll be left out of a conversation often if you're not in the loop.

The options for food are limited down to a food truck, vending machines, and a coffee machine. For this reason, people end up bringing their own cooked foods. There is a convenient refrigerator to store your goodies in so there aren't any worries. Food thieves don't exist in the school as far as I know.

The school's academics - Great! The campus and people - It's manageable..."
Sophomore,4,"First off, This school's great. But not for everyone.
If you're thinking about going here because you ""just like games"" or ""just watch movies"", then don't. To make it in the industries that this school is trying to prepare you for, you need to spend every spare moment of your time working or revising projects, and studying these skills on your own. 

Otherwise you'll be like many of the other students that went to this school thinking that jobs would be handed to them on silver platters.
Just because you can get into a game-design/animation school doesn't mean your good enough for it. And this school will take anyone, regardless of their ability, so beware of that. 

My advice, If you're straight out of high school, save your money, go to a CC first and evaluate yourself. This is a place where the return on investment is very much dependent on the type of student you are. If you're mature, dedicated and competent, you'll do fine."
Senior,4,"I love the smallness of Cogswell and how all students will help one another whether it is through student tutors or just being in the same class.

I also Appreciate that the Teachers are willing to help as well before, during,and after classes. 

I am sad that they don't offer more in the Master Degree so I could continue my great learning experience and help others."
Freshman,4,"The professors here at Cogswell are very nice, and so are the students. Everyone at this school seem to get along great, so making  friends here won't be a problem. It doesn't matter if you're a chatty cathy or if you're as quiet as a church mouse you'll definitely find some great friends here."
College Freshman,4,"The walk to school from the housing is short and grants a breath of fresh air. I enjoy the topics I get to learn about, especially Digital Imaging Concepts, which is currently my favorite class."
College Sophomore,4,Not much crime goes on at the school.
College Sophomore,4,There are small classes and the teachers are helpful if you ask for help.
College Freshman,4,"So far I love the classes I've taken and Most of my professors. I've only had an issue with one. The class sizes are great. They're small, so no one feels like just a number in a room."
College Freshman,4,"I don't live in the dorms, but I have visited my friends' dorms. They are pretty amazing. They're not dorms, but actual apartments that the college bought. They are expensive but also convient, clean, and beautiful."
College Freshman,4,"My school is definitely unique, even though no one has really heard of it. It's a small school but I believe this is a good thing. Teachers and administration are easy to get in contact with because of the small student body. This makes the environment better, in my opinion, than a popular university. I would recommend this school to anyone that wants to go into the technology and media field. If I could do it all over, I would still end up going to Cogswell."
College Sophomore,4,"Great apartment, but very expensive in my opinion"
College Student,4,"Close parking lot, quiet area"
College Sophomore,4,"It's been great so far, except for that one time when the financial aid office underbudgeted my semester by over a thousand dollars... so yeah, i get to make that up in payments over the next semester... or two -__-"
College Junior,4,The atmosphere is alright. We are in the heart of big businesses and there are usually places to eat nearby. There is also a roach coach that comes to the school everyday.
College Freshman,4,"Being in DAA (Digital Arts & Animation) I really look forward to apply for an internship. I've never ""worked"" for a company before and I'm curious to know what will be expected of me."
College Senior,4,"Aside from the student housing program, which is rather good, there are many apartments nearby of different prices and commodities."
Freshman,2,"This college is a scam, I received no financial aid, just pure loans. College credits won't transfer, education is at a ""Community College"" level. Some professors are excellent, but most are just reading through a text book. I'd avoid this college at all cost, as it will try to squeeze as much money off you. I have to pay $10k off my pocket as I dropped out for being too expensive."
Alum,2,"Teachers have an interesting turnover rate. They come and go. Most the leave are good teachers. The teachers aren't really appreciated by the students and the school itself. There are a handful of good teachers in there, but there are also those that aren't. Some professors are like Dave are instruction heavy and good. Some are belligerent and don't lecture at all. There are also great teachers that left due to what the school has been doing to them. Some, already on the verge of leaving. They also replace some teachers with teachers that aren't so qualified at times.

School is run by a hotel company that used to own Heald. It's called Palm Ventures.

Computers can't handle Maya at full capacity sometimes and we have to playblast to see our animation run smoothly. Some rental stylus pens also have a messed up pen pressure and the nib would go inside the pen if there's a little pressure put on it.  Good equipment like Cintiq only seen in Animated Film Production studio, not in class."
Alum,2,"Classes I needed were not available because of cost cutting. Dorm life was extremely stressful. And teachers were not available for extra time after classes. The work load was tremendous considering each project required thought and skill. Faculty and instructors would often pick favorites among the students. I found myself odd girl out, and was constantly criticised by both students and teachers, contributing to my lack of self esteem. I was allowed to graduate without a demo reel, but my tuition was paid in full to them even though I'm over burdened with student loan debt, and still working a retail job."
Recent Alumnus,2,There really aren't that many places to have lunch or dinner outside of school besides the normal fast food places.
Recent Alumnus,2,"The school does not have a cafeteria; they have a small room they call the student launch where students can go eat awful, overpriced, frozen vending machine food. The best option for food was to bring your own food or go out for lunch. The student   

launch area was not even a good place to go eat because it was always full of loud students playing games and whatnot. I used to bring my own lunch and eat at the computer labs or library because I found the launch area annoying."
College Sophomore,2,"They have trouble running multiple programs, the network is super slow and the servers can't handle the capacity"
College Sophomore,2,I always find a problem with email EVERY semester.
Senior,1,"Cogswell College is a very expensive school. It is a for profit college. It is managed by people who came from other for profit colleges that have not done well like DeVry University, Art Institute, etc. If you are going to spend a lot of money to learn animation, go to animschool or Academy of Art."
Alum,1,"This school is a scam. Credits don't transfer, get dean's list every semester and still can't find work, and it's owned by a hotel company. Heald. Look it up. This place is going to rip you off."
College Sophomore,1,This is a technical college full of nerds and geeks. This is the wrong school to go to if you're an athlete.
College Junior,1,The campus want you to do what they ask or you are kicked out.
College Junior,1,There are no on campus meals
College Sophomore,1,"Really shitty conditions, the ""Student Lounge"" is always full of teenagers yelling and screaming and watching videos at full blast, blowing up their food in the 2, overused and undercleaned microwaves that the entire campus shares. There are 5 vending machines, one for ice cream, two for sodas, and two for candy and chips, those are THE ONLY food options on campus. We JUST started getting food trucks to roll by on a bi-daily basis."
College Sophomore,1,"You literally can not walk to a bar within a 5 mile radius. Also, it appears that 90% of the students are under 21."
College Freshman,1,"There is no dining hall on campus. There is a lounge, and there are vending machines that supply ""meals"", but most of the items are snacks. There is a food truck that stops by around noon and a lot of people get their nourishment from there. Some go off campus to Togo's, McDonalds, Burger King, etc, etc. I've only been to Togo's and the cafe next to and they are close by."
College Student,1,"There is little Greek life, but it is there. It does not affect the atmosphere or learning environment."
College Freshman,1,"Don't See Much If Any – I don't think i see any athletic places, but sense we have a fire science major then i assume we have some sort of athletic place. Ether way i'm not the athletic type."

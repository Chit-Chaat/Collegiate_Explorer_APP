Freshman,5,An amazing school and open minded professors and non judging school. There is always something new to learn and it helps you apply it to your own work and also they teach how to draw clients towards you and you work.
Freshman,5,The experience that I have had at the Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design is unparalleled. I enjoy my time on campus. It is very forward thinking and very open to everyone.
Freshman,5,"My experience at Milwaukee institute of art and design has been amazing. It is my first semester as a freshman, and I never believed I would have been able to learn soo much in such little time. MIAD has a freshman program which put you in classes that give you a little bit of each major so you have an entire semester to choose your majors and minors. This school provides you with amazing teachers, and have a maximum of around 20 students per classroom. Which leaves lots of room for questions and for the instructor to work with you one on one. MIAD uses apartments instead of dorms which is amazing, every student shares a full kitchen and two full bathrooms and a living room  with 5 other students (2 students in one room 3 in the other) and they are across the school! :). This school is also located in Milwaukee safest and artsy part of the city in the third ward. And not to worry about transportation, the school comes with a free bus cards so you are able to get around."
Sophomore,5,Amazing institute. The teachers' support for students is amazing. I have yet to be in a class that I don't see useful in my work field. All my classes are together on one website so it's very easy to keep up with what is due and when. They are so generous when giving scholarships and are very supportive with helping students find other scholarships.
Freshman,5,"The school is great. The teachers are really friendly and are really good at teaching. Although the school is small and not like most colleges everyone is really nice and seems to care about all of their students. In the cafe there are always chicken, fries, fruit, hamburgers, and deli style sandwiches but they have  a special that's different every day. The food is really good and reasonably priced."
Niche User,5,"the campus is small which is really nice for navigating to and from classes, the staff is very enthusiastic and kind. they are a really hands-on learning school and will help with all creative needs. the people that you will meet there are amazing helpful and kind people."
Freshman,5,"What I like about maid is that there are so many techniques and skills for different art categories being taught there. Categories like video and film, animation, photography, illustration, print and product design and more than I can name off the top my head. As there are so many courses to pick and choose from and one might not know exactly what they're going in for there major, the first year is set p were you get to experience different things. They do this to push one in the direction they like best and to give an experience in what they might consider or re-consider depending on how their interests lay.
Right now I'm in the second semester of my freshman year and I'm really enjoying my experience. I don't live in the dorms so can't really give an overview of that but I have seen them and they're really nice. Being downtown the area around the school is busy and has many different kinds of shops to go into.
I hope this review helped, even a little."
Niche User,5,"What I like about MIAD is that it is full of diverse art work and it gives its students
their own studio space."
Niche User,5,Everyone is super nice and helpful and the school is exactly what I think about when I think of an art room.
Alum,5,"Great student:teacher ratio; helpful critiques from outside professionals who are current  and successful in their respective fields; intense, vibrant atmosphere created by demanding instructors and competitive students who are universally dedicated to producing outstanding art & design--very hard work but really fun and exciting for those who love to push themselves and their creativity to the limit.  Excellent professional preparation for the artist or designer who wants to be an artist or designer forever--and make a living at it."
Sophomore,5,"I love MIAD, when I first heard of MIAD I was nervous and unsure because I never even visited the school. But now it is my second year and I really love the place. The teachers are nice, the classes are interesting, and I love being able to go to the labs and make cool projects."
Freshman,5,I love the feeling to the college and how w I believe is the perfect fit for me. I think that’s important especially when we are paying for it. The staff really help me with application  process. And made sure we got all the information we need. This school is one the few who actually do that.
Niche User,5,Great school for an aspiring local artist looking to be near an urban setting in a populated and diverse city like Milwaukee.
Niche User,5,"I am a senior in highschool who drove to Milwaukee Institute of Art and Design because I got accepted and received a scholarship there, it is also one of my top school choices. When I was there I was blown away. I love how close the building is to the dorms, and how there is an art store right there too. The dorms (where I would be living) looks amazing too! I love the environment inside the studios in the art building, it was very interesting to see so many people working together or working independently. they all seemed very invested in their work and it is very nice to see."
Freshman,5,MIAD is an amazing place to go to college. You are free to be yourself and everyone is so nice. MIAD offers a lot and is an amazing place to be.
Freshman,5,"This school is phenomenal. If you come with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn and take a direction, you are sure to thrive as an artist and designer. Hard work is expected, but the ride is wonderful."
Senior,5,"My experience with MIAD has been amazing. It is an expensive school, but worth it in the long run. You make memorable connections with both your peers and your instructors. The competition among your peers is healthy and makes you strive to do better than the last critique. It’s location is great, next to the lake and plenty of cafes and restaurants to grab a bite and other places to find inspiration. I wish I had known about this school much sooner than I had. And I will be sad when I leave it behind. I would highly recommend going to this school. But, only if you are willing to bear the costs and the heavy work load."
Freshman,5,"Absolutely fantastic. Very open-minded place, and friendly too. Is a safe place to express yourself, and you get to meet amazing people along the way. Also, MIAD has many connections to help you in the future!"
Freshman,5,"Coming from out of state, I can say that I have truly fallen in love with the city of Milwaukee and MIAD. The professors here are friendly and accommodating, and I can tell that I am set up for success. My advice to incoming freshman: just visit! See if you like it yourself. MIAD (and art school) is not for everyone."
Freshman,5,"I am in love with all of my classes. I came 2,000 miles to go to this school and I'm not disappointed at all. The improvement in my skills in just these first 3 months is absolutely outstanding. The teachers are all very helpful and understanding, but not scared to provide you with criticism. The classes in freshman year are very diverse and I've discovered that I really love woodworking. The advisers in the various shops and studio spaces are incredibly helpful too, whether it's for a class or independent project."
Niche User,5,It has a lot of things you can go and make the people feel at home. It offers a Bachelor of Fine Arts Degree in 5 majors and is considered the successor to the Layton School of Ar
College Freshman,5,Brand new apartments make for an amazing living experience and the close proximity to school is even better!
College Freshman,5,I think the professors are very knowledgeable in the field. It's nice to have teachers who really care about our progress as artists.
College Freshman,5,I think there is a great ease to finding a career on campus and being able to discuss with Career Services.
College Freshman,5,I think TWO50TWO is absolutely the perfect housing experience.
College Freshman,5,MIAD is an excellent school for discovering who you are as an artist. The Foundations (Freshmen) year is designed to really help students figure out who they are in their first year.
College Freshman,5,Almost every student that graduates finds a job in the career they are looking to seek. The school it also very good with finding internships and jobs. The alumni is also very close with the school and is good with helping students financially. Some of the alumni even hire students strait our of college and a good chunk of them provide internships.
College Freshman,5,"There are tons of restaurants around MIAD... if you're willing to pay the price. The Third Ward is a very wealthy area, so the restaurants are pretty high end. However, it's not hard to take a bus to brady street where there is fast food and other restaurants and coffee shops, or even to UWM area near Oakland where there is a lot of fast food and pizza places. Pizza Shuttle is always a solid option, and you can always order delivery."
College Freshman,5,"Being an art school, the administration is very lenient. I know many people who do drugs and drink underage- I'm not saying it's part of the artistic process or anything, but it seems like these things are more common among artists. However, if you are doing something that is harmful- like smoking IN the dorms where you will incur smoke damage, or doing something foolish, they will make sure that you are reprimanded, though they make it clear that their goal is to keep you safe, not to get you in trouble. I haven't heard of the police being brought in for anything at the dorms this past year, despite some students getting caught for Marijuana usage and drinking underage, etc. One thing to note, alcohol is not permitted in the dorms regardless of your age, so if you are 21, you're still going to have to find somewhere else to drink and/or store your booze."
College Freshman,5,"MIAD is super generous with their scholarships. I received enough to be able to go to the school for free! I received A LOT more from MIAD than I would have at other schools, despite MIAD being less expensive than others. The high tuition prices allow MIAD to have enough money to give out these scholarships- sorry to those students that come from wealthy families and have to pay out of pocket, but you're helping me get a degree!"
College Freshman,5,"Living in the Two50two apartments was fantastic. The dorms are right across the street from the school, so you are able to easily get to your classes on time without having to take a bus (like the last dorms), and you are easily able to go home between classes or even during breaks during your classes. You are literally on top of a Blick store, so that is super convenient, and DigiCopy is a two minute walk down the street for you Communication Design, Illustration, and Photography majors! The dorms are like living in luxury- they're nicer than your first apartment will be, they're practically brand new right now, and they come fully furnished and with all appliances (except a toaster)- you really can't get any better. Just make sure you have good roommates and your time here will be a blast!"
College Junior,5,Milwaukee is a great town for foodies
College Junior,5,Artists know how to get down if you're open minded
College Junior,5,I am graduating debt free thanks to scholarships
College Sophomore,5,"The computer labs are extremely advanced and there are always computers available. As a CD student, the amount of printing I do doesn't get covered so sometimes I have print out of my own pocket which is ridiculous. The network is reliable and high speed "
College Sophomore,5,Everyone at MIAD is incredibly individualistic and as a whole everyone is very accepting in regards to personal style and looks
College Sophomore,5,"The off-campus housing situation is extremely convenient and the available living spaces are everywhere. The cost is significantly lower then on campus housing, although the parking situation is abysmal. MIAD does not assist students in finding off campus housing "
College Senior,5,I truly adore this school. It's a colorful and inviting environment filled with art to inspire you and your work. The cafeteria offers a larger variety of food than I ever expected. The staff are more than willing to help on a personal level with any school related and occasionally personal issues you may be having. The student life is generally friendly and encouraging of each others work.
College Junior,5,"I would do it all over if I could go back. I have grown and stretched so much thus far, and in fact I wish i would have found the degree sooner. Industrial Design is still somewhat of an obscure and esoteric field, yet broad in possibilities. The program focuses on so many old-school and new school methods, so it is quite encompassing."
College Sophomore,5,"Being in the Illustration programs at MIAD is very fulfilling thus far. I have learned a great deal and i'm only a sophomore! I can't wait to advance in my years and learn more about the field I want to go into. The workload in Illustration, like most art majors, is very heavy. We have a pretty sizable project every week that's usually due in a week. One has to be pretty decent at balancing a lot of homework. Although this is a slight downfall the overall reward is very promising. One thing I also think is wonderful about MIAD is they help you find jobs and internships related to your major in your Junior and Senior years. Also, every major pretty much has their own designated floors in the school, so one doesn't run into lack of space or such things like that."
Sophomore,4,A good choice for a private local art school. The size allows for close relationships with peers and great availability to faculty
Junior,4,"My overall experience so far has been pretty good. When I was there my first year, they did all these group activities so we'd all bond with one another. We explored the school, had a group lunch and there was one day where we went to the beach for a sand building competition. The teachers are very involved with helping us students and wanting to see us grow. I've learned a lot about working with different mediums from wood working to photography to welding. There are so many different tools for me to use to better my education and craft. Also, I just like the feeling of it as a whole. It's so great to be surrounded by all these talented individuals who support one another."
Freshman,4,My experience at MIAD has been extremely positive thus far and the professors are outstanding. The campus is cozy and the dorms are amazing.
Freshman,4,"I like being a first year at Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design. It's a private art school and there's so much hands on work you can do. It may be expensive to go to MIAD, but the scholarship and financial help you get pretty much covers majority of your cost. I wouldn't recommend living in the dorms because how expensive to live there and housing and tuition are separate from each other, but if you're covered by loads of scholarship it's definitely a place to live. The local area is nice and safe, but if you want to go grocery shopping you're gonna have to take a bus to go shopping for food and materials. MIAD isn't much of a party school and it's really quiet. Also If you want to do sports well good luck cause there's no sports/gym at MIAD unless you travel to Marquette University and use their gym, but I really don't know if they'll allow someone into a sport."
Freshman,4,"I don't feel like there are people who can relate to my cultural experiences because of the lack of diversity, they need to work on promoting the school to the minority artists of the future."
Freshman,4,MIAD is the place to learn if you really are interested in anything related to art or design. There's a wide variety of classes that relates to different majors. The professors and counselors there are really friendly and are willing to listen to your concerns.  The scenery around the school is also extraordinary.
Freshman,4,I love the amount of labs and places people of all grade levels are able to use. Plus the small campus is easy to navigate.
Sophomore,4,It's a very good school for art students. Get to experience different mediums and try out new things. A very safe place.
Senior,4,You gain experience as an artist in multiple fields even if it isn't your major. The school has a lot to offer and I've learned a lot that I will take away once I graduate to apply it to my career.
Freshman,4,"There is so many different kinds of people here and from all over and the school community is very accepting of many different ideals and beliefs. The walls are always covered with some kind of art, and there are regular art shows in the galleries located on the river level and the forth floor raw space. You will see faculty art work on the walls of the river level as well, and even in the gallery. Student work is also shown and it is mind boggling to see what is created. There is also a photo gallery on the second floor which display work from many different artist. "
College Junior,4,"The school offers professionals in the industry as instructors, which is awesome for learning about the industry but sometimes not so helpful in the ways of learning the trade/craft side of things. Although the school has been compared to Bauhaus, there also isn't a lot of opportunity for interdisciplinary education."
College Junior,4,"The building is brand new and right across the street from the building classes are held in. I lived there for one year and the dorms are student apartments with two students in a bedroom and two bedrooms to a unit. There are also two bathrooms. The building doesn't accommodate social events very well because eager participation is low. The school is located in a very expensive district of the city so the housing price is excellent in comparison to what is directly around, but still extremely expensive."
College Freshman,4,"I haven't started at MIAD yet, not until the fall of this year, but so far my interactions with staff and other students has been amazing!"
College Freshman,4,"I think the security team is great, and I feel pretty safe with them."
College Freshman,4,"The only Greek organization available is the Honor Society, which is relatively easy to become a member in!"
College Freshman,4,"Most classes have a max of 15 students. The class rooms are nice, because it not just a bunch desks in rows, they are all different and create specifically for certain types of classes."
College Freshman,4,"The housing is nice, but expensive. There is more space then the average dorm, but for the amount you pay it should be more. You are promised high speed internet, but it only works half the time and is not even close to fast. It is nice because its right across the street from the campus and is maintained well. I would recommend it if you don't live in area or don't like traveling."
College Freshman,4,"M.I.A.D is a great school. At your first year you try out a little bit of all the degrees they offer, then you get to decide what major you want to choose. It is good for a school to do this, you never know you like something util you try it. The school is small, so your teachers will know who you are and most of them are friendly, with a few exceptions, of course. The teachers also go by their first names and that makes them seem less intimating and more friendly. The school is also good with dealing with bad teachers, if you have issues it is easy to let someone know. Actually if you have any issues they very open to suggestions. Most of of the school is designed by the students and it is always improving and changing."
College Freshman,4,I'm having fun and learning what I want to learn.
College Freshman,4,People and environment around school is friendly and nice most of the time feel safe around campus unless really late at night.
College Freshman,4,Admission treated you like a person and part of the school already. Very friendly people.
College Freshman,4,People are more open to your opinion and more freedom. The people there are friendly and instructors are a first name bases to help make it feel more friendly. Although very friendly atmosphere there are some areas in departments that could use some better funding.
College Freshman,4,"Off-campus housing can take you pretty far from the campus because MIAD is in such a wealthy area- most people live around Brady street or in Bayview or UWM area. However, you can't go wrong- even living by yourself, you'll spend less money than if you were in the dorms, and you don't have to have that horrid meal plan. I'm getting a 3 bedroom with two other people in fall and will be spending no more than 400 a month total for rent and bills."
College Junior,4,"Pretty good, lots of nice old buildings + lofts"
College Junior,4,It's an art school so things are run liberally
College Freshman,4,I am happy with my choice
College Freshman,4,My school is not too bad
College Freshman,4,Show your best work and the best capability. MIAD admires dedication and over coming obstacles
College Freshman,4,"My school tries to provide everyone with a intern opportunity, they help us find jobs after college. They even coordinate a majors dialogue  for freshman to get an idea on what they want to do with their careers."
College Freshman,4,I really enjoy coming to school each day.
College Freshman,4,"I did not receive as much financial aid as i needed, however the school did give me a rather good scholarship. There is still a good amount of money that I owe the school."
College Sophomore,4,"It's in an old warehouse building. personally I love it. High ceilings, concrete floors, it's small but it feels spacious in a way, and it's great for doing artwork in and on. There's usually lots of events to go to, things to get involved in, or people to party with, depending on where your interests lie."
College Sophomore,4,"If you don't mind a bunk bed the dorms are better than 90% of college dorms I've seen. They're brand new, it's basically 4 people to a normal apartment, you have your own kitchen/bathroom/living room. Right across the st from the school, to expensive if you're a college student trying to afford it on your own."
College Freshman,4,"You will absolutely need your own laptop. You might run into problems if you don't bring a Mac (virtually everyone has a Mac), but it's still totally possible.

Computer labs are plentiful, state-of-the-art, and loaded with great software. Huge student discounts for the high-quality printing (lots of options, you get $20 of credit each semester pre-loaded onto your printing account). It's great to have your own printer but not necessary, most things can be submitted digitally and school printing is cheap.

The wireless is pretty fast but very spotty in a lot of the classrooms, some places you can't get it at all."
College Freshman,4,"A lot of great spots, and the Milwaukee Public Market is only a short walk away. Lots of hipsters in the area, so if you're vegan, they're expecting you."
College Freshman,4,"I am an Integrated Studio Arts major, so I have a lot of flexibility over the classes I take. You have got to have a huge amount of motivation, especially in the fine arts. Workload is intense, but ultimately you decide how hard you want to work. I really love it because it doesn't restrict me from working in any media I choose."
College Freshman,4,"There really isn't too much to do on campus (it's only one building) but fortunately there's always something fun going on in the area. People like MIAD students and are pretty used to seeing them, you're not going to get weird looks for being an art student."
College Freshman,4,"Everything went really well--if you have any problems, and you probably will, contact the offices! They are wonderfully helpful, know exactly what they're doing, and, as the school is small, will pay you the attention you need."
College Freshman,4,"Fairly diverse on the whole, it's great to have the ""art school"" mentality, any sort of judgment between people is usually the ""fine art vs. design"" feud, but almost never something personal, they're all very accepting and don't make a big deal out of the unusual."
College Sophomore,4,many options to choose from
College Sophomore,4,"The campus crime rate is extremely low, only recently there were a couple robberies occurred but other than that MIAD is an extremely safe campus"
College Sophomore,4,"Although most people at MIAD consider themselves liberals, everyone is accepting of any religion, ethnicity, or political belief. Everyone is open to learning from each other and respecting each others differences in lifestyle"
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, the academics are satisfactory at MIAD. The professors on campus are usually willing to meet with you for extra guidance/help in regards to your work. The workload is extremely demanding and rigorous, as a student you're constantly working on projects and progressing. "
College Sophomore,4,The internship and job opportunities in the Communication Design program at MIAD are abundant. It's encouraged that you seek out employment or internship opportunities before you even graduate. The CD program in general is an incredible learning experience and helps create versatility in your work as an artist. 
College Senior,4,"It's gotten a lot better since I was a freshmen. The food is made with healthier materials and there are much more organic options than GMO options. There's only one cafeteria, and it runs mainly average cafeteria hours. As long as someone mans the register, it can stay open pretty late. "
College Senior,4,"Since we're so closed to downtown, there's lots of places to get a beer and coffee and small breakfast and large lunch. Cafes, bars, restaurants are all abundant and location in downtown doesn't really affect pricing. Graffito's is nice for a good professional luncheon, and The Swinging Door Exchange is great for amazing food and to watch the game. It's a hotspot for construction crews and lawyers to come and eat, the atmosphere agrees with almost any brand of occupation.  "
College Senior,4,"Being in a major, any major, is always tough work. It takes a buttload of determination and motivation to get through four/three years of it. 

Personally, Interiors, Architecture, and Design (IAD) is one of the best and worst majors ever. It takes soo much work and requires so much of your attention and time. You have to sacrifice a lot of things to get where you want to be, to have a worthwhile career. I despise the workload because out of the entire school IAD requires the most time and classes and credits. It's so much! But I do love it. Nothing you want is easy to work for. And IAD is something I love, very much. I have never not enjoyed designing something. It's stressful, yes, but it's totally worth it. 

As a student in IAD you generally have 3 specific teachers who will stick with you throughout your 3 years in their major. They all are very intelligent and competent. Internships are always there, but you need to put in the effort and apply for it yourself to get it. The school doesn't baby you and apply for you, it's a do it yourself kind of thing. "
College Senior,4,"MIAD is less than a mile away from Summerfest ground, the waterfront, the Milwaukee Art Museum, Discovery World, The Harley Davidson Museum, the Amtrak Station, and downtown where all the big shindigs happen like the Marcus Center for the Arts. It's a city and bad things happen eveywhere, but MIAD is located in the safest neighborhood in all of Milwaukee. The community really enjoys getting involved with students and being involved in school events too.  "
College Senior,4,"I have never actually lived in the dorms but have visited. They are new, spacious beautiful, a wonderful social experience. They are also lenient with visitors and have common space to enjoy social time. The only negative, I'd say, is the expense."
College Junior,4,"This is an art school with most of the things one would come to expect from a small Bauhaus inspired school. One thing that sets MIAD apart is their 3D lab, and the trained staff that run it. Also, the industrial design program is one of the best in the nation."
College Junior,4,"The building is an old factory warehouse converted into the school, so it has a fantastic industrial aesthetic. The school is also located directly on the river and has some pretty nostalgic old Milwaukee scenes, like the tug boats that still move coal up the river."
College Junior,4,"They are mostly pretty good. I have never had an issue with any of the in-school computers. Of course there is a mandatory laptop rule, so I mostly used my own computer."
College Junior,4,"The Industrial Design Program is one of the most demanding majors in the school. There is so much to learn about the field and so little time, so the workload is quite overwhelming at times. But, if you are dedicated, the work can be quite rewarding."
College Junior,4,"The workload can be tremendous at times. If one does not possess time-management skills, they may be in trouble."
College Senior,4,"The network we have is pretty reliable and fast, there is wireless available, you don't NEED a personal printer, but it is much more convenient to have one, especially since our printers get really overused during finals. It's better to have a personal computer for school here. At school, it costs money to print. There are about 10 computer labs all on one floor, extremely available from 8 am to 11 pm on weekdays and noon to 5 pm on weekends."
College Senior,4,"MIAD gives the students free bus passes every semester including summer. And the buses are relatively reliable. Taxis, just like everywhere are pretty expensive. I don't know anyone at school who uses taxis. The airport is a 15 minute car ride away, and really good. There is a shuttle that takes students to and from the 2040 lofts as well as the dorms we have leased on the UWM campus called Park Place. Bikes are always welcome and there's a parking lot for student vehicles."
College Sophomore,4,At MIAD you sort of declare your major when enrolling into the school. However that is subject to change during your time at MIAD and professors and school officials recognize that. During your Freshman year you go to many seminars that describe all the majors to help inform you on what those programs deal with and towards the end of your first year the school holds a Major Declaration Night. During this event you choose what you want and go to that particular room. They even have a room for people who are undecided. This helped me a great deal during my first year. It really cleared things up for me and i'm glad the school decided to host a helpful event such as that.
College Sophomore,4,"As an Illustration major, I wasn't too sure if this was the major for me, however, after the school held many events to show you what all the majors were about I knew it was the major for me. As an Illustrator you have to know how to work with many media types. Anywhere from pens and pencils to digital software such as Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. The first class I took definitely stretched my knowledge of these programs and other media types I had never worked with before. The instructors are wonderful at there job and taught me a great deal of things this first year. I can not wait until I can start looking for internships in the field of my dreams."
College Sophomore,4,I had to contact the financial aid at my school and they arranged if I was qualified for it or not. It was relatively easy and I was able to receive a decent amount of financial aid
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, I believe the process was relatively easier than most. I applied online and had to write an essay on a question they asked regarding yourself. I believe an admission counselor contacted me and scheduled me for an interview to take a look at my work and ask me questions. I think the most essential criteria for the admission process is your works of art. You need a specific amount and be ready to explain each piece."
College Freshman,2,"MIAD doesn't really offer any athletics, which is an issue. I don't think there necessarily needs to be Sports, but health and wellness should be pushed further."
College Freshman,2,"I'm not a fan of the food at MIAD. The Cafe is pretty much horrible, and the worst part of my freshman year was that, since you are required to live in the dorms, you are required to have a meal plan, which means I spent $500 for crappy food. The food is very fried and greasy and disgusting from the cafeteria... I advise people to stay away from it. However, it's easy enough to just go to the grocery store and buy food that you actually want, and the dorms have full kitchens, so preparing food is a breeze. I think the food is really the only downfall of MIAD."
College Freshman,2,There are no sports here for my school is an art school
College Freshman,2,"Pretty much the only spaces near the school are reserved for faculty, and anywhere within easy walking distance is usually restricted to 2-hour parking, which means in a 3-hour studio class you will have to leave in the middle of the class to refresh your parking meter. There are spots a bit further away, but if you're hauling a piece of artwork with you (and this will happen) you're going to be dragging it a few blocks.

Unless you're a commuter who can't make it by bus, a car is definitely not necessary, the whole school is in one building."
College Sophomore,2,"The actual financial aid I received was nice, but if you have any trouble whatsoever during the process, the financial aid department is extremely unhelpful. It's irritating. The best way to go about receiving aid is get everything taken care of before you even attend MIAD because it's a pain trying to get anyone to assist you here"
College Senior,2,"Hello hipsters of the world! If you've ever dyed your hair weird colors, shaved the side of your head, worn Victorian clothes daily, wear tights under short shorts in the middle of winter, this school is probably a good place you'll fit in. It's relatively cliquey, and there's not a whole lot of straight guys. So if you're going to college looking for a relationship rather than a career, there's plenty of women and gay dudes here. Go crazy."
College Senior,2,"They are strict on what they need to be (drugs and alcohol) but very open and lenient towards ideas of students for the school (activities, food, events, courses, etc.)"
College Junior,2,"I was offered a very small scholarship, I wish there were more opportunity to apply for additional scholarships... I guess that is why I'm on here."
College Senior,2,"Guesstimate: a Little More or Less the Half – I don't know for sure, but I'd say 3/4 of the student population of MIAD drinks, and maybe half does drugs. As far as I know, there is not a lot of peer pressure, it's more of 'do it if you do it, do it if you want to, or dont do it if you don't want to'. I hear people talk about going to a party and doing drugs or drinking a lot, but about 1/8 of the school gets caught or I see drinking or doing drugs."
College Junior,2,"Milwaukee Bus System – This is the most common method of transport. Unfortunately, a lot of the bus drivers are 10, sometimes 20 minutes off schedule, or just never show up at all. But I guess 85% of the time the buses get you where you need to go reasonably on time."
College Junior,2,"Mostly White – The student body is mostly white. The city itself has a lot of diversity, though."
College Freshman,2,"Pass the PBR – Milwaukee is a town made for drinking so if you are not 21 or older you are out of luck. You find parties through friends of friends who live on the outskirts of the city and you will probably come back early like most people do. Occasionally, a good band comes around and that is nice but you will have to pay a pretty penny to go since their are not a lot of smaller venues that host musical acts. If you are of age, you'll pretty much play beer pong."
College Junior,1,There is no Greek Life at MIAD.
College Junior,1,There are no athletics affiliated with MIAD and the club atmosphere is terrible. Most clubs are run by students who don't really know what they're doing and don't have enough time to put effort into them.
College Freshman,1,"Wisconsin weather is notorious and there's a good reason for it. The snow, sleet, rain, hail, dangerous wind (or all of the above... simultaneously) plus traffic puts commuters in a nasty spot, but the teachers are very understanding about it, and most of them will let you text them if you're going to be late (just ask, they'll probably let you).

School is almost never cancelled for the weather, which is awful for anyone in searing -30 wind waiting at the exposed bus stop down the road."
College Sophomore,1,"The permit cost is obnoxious, although most students don't have to deal with it because very few have cars to worry about. The distance from the school is fine and you can usually find a spot, but the cost isn't usually worth it"
College Senior,1,"Though there is a small lot a block and a half away, the spots are small and tight and cost $200 per semester to weasel your way into a spot each day. The living expense in the area is pricey so cars are a common way to commute from a place with reasonable living expenses and therefore it is needed to buy this pass. The parking officers are handy with their tickets in the 2 hour parking that surrounds the school."
College Senior,1,"You have to work really hard at MIAD to make the experience worth your while. A lot of people will go out for a few drinks here and there, but the students spend a lot of time on projects, which is not a bad thing at all. The students still go out and do karaoke, to the beach, to the bar, to a coffee shop, but we don't go all out like every other school and get wasted whenever we can."
College Sophomore,1,"There is basically no parking at MIAD. Not even for the teachers. There is a small parking lot for guests, but when I say small I mean very small. It's even sometimes inaccessible for no reason. The school will put signs in front that say you can't park. A friend of mine brought her car up to Milwaukee for obvious purposes and ended up having to buy 2 parking passes. 1 for day/street parking, and one for night parking. Each about $60. Before she even got those however, she received around 3-4 tickets ranging from $10-$60. So if you have a car and not a lot of money, it's best to leave your car at home and just take buses everywhere."
College Junior,1,They recently took out 99% of the computers at school since we are required to have laptops. It can get very frustrating.
College Junior,1,"Don't Mess Around – In dorms, drinking and other punishable activities are not taken lightly. Punishments are strict and results for multiple offenders in loss of housing or being kicked out of school."
College Freshman,1,"The dorms are 3+ miles away from campus. OUCH. Yeah they're nice, but pretty expensive, and the people there are rude, and the MIAD transportation is nonexistent. It's seriously so bad. Get your bus pass and get over it."
College Freshman,1,"Milwaukee Institute of Art & Design let me down in almost every aspect. Their classes are like community college art classes (even though you paying well over community college prices), their food is pretty bad and their is NO variety, and your social life is basically nothing until you turn 21. The only way I would ever reccomend this school to somebody is if you are an interior architecture major because they pretty much get all the time and money spent on them. They get all the privelages while the other majors lack and lag behind in the dark."
College Freshman,1,"There are clubs, but no real school athletics. A lot of the kids that go to MIAD have never participated in a sport. We have fun activites that incorporate sports, but there is no MIAD Atheltic Program sadly. If people do like sports and athletics, then we join a club and do something once a week or once every other week."
College Freshman,1,"Students Are Very Class-Oriented – You'll notice in teh upperclassmen that they all tend to stick together. Each year sticks with their own classmates and doesn't associate with any other class. You can tell who belongs to what class because of how they dress. Each class dresses the same too. No one really seems to keep the appearance they came with as a freshmen. They all have the same haircuts, same style of clothes, same glasses or hats or shoes. Not EVERYONE is like that, but most of the upperclassmen do conform to eachother."

Alum,5,I love that it was a work program college and that the classrooms were small so you got more one-on-one time with the professor and because it was a work program college your tuition was sliced in half. as well as if you don't have a work history you build one up at the college and you can do multiple jobs there if you wanted to advance your career.
Sophomore,5,I am having an amazing time at Blackburn. The atmosphere is so tightly knitted and family oriented! Blackburn also has so many opportunities that help their students succeed!
Junior,5,"Blackburn college is a great university, it gives a family feel. People around campus are very helpful and is there to help you succeed. Blackburn is a small campus also and that’s good is you don't do well in big environments and that’s something i enjoy the most about the campus."
Freshman,5,"I love that Blackburn is a small campus in the middle of a small town, my hometown. The people have always been nice and supportive and I've heard great things about their programs. Looking forward to being there this fall!"
Freshman,5,"I absolutely adore Blackburn College. I started here because it is a small, private, liberal-arts college. And added bonus is the uniqueness of it... it is one of seven work colleges in the country, and we are the only student managed one! I feel such pride and feel so proud to be here. I am a first-year student, and can already say I am a resident assistant and the future president of Student Senate for the 2019-20 school year, and much more. The professors are wonderful, the academics are good because they are challenging, and so much more. I am so proud to be a Blackburn student."
Senior,5,It is an amazing experience. The admissions team is very respectful I think it'll be a good fit for me as well as others.
Sophomore,5,"The classes are small and I get a lot of individual help and one-on-one.  I get to meet with my counselor regularly.  I can also get in touch with my professors pretty easily and they are really receptive.  The dorms are older - the whole campus is older but really pretty.  There are a lot of student activities.  The students really all stick together and we play campus golf and a lot of other things. The town is very small but the local bowling alley hosts nights for college students that are free and so does the local movie theater.  I personally play baseball and my coach is awesome.  The other sports feel the same way about their coaches from what I can tell.  The one time student activity fee gets us in to all of the events - soccer, basketball, baseball - free.  Overall, it has been great for me!"
College Junior,5,The financial aid program at Blackburn is excellent. I get to attend for next to nothing which makes it possible for me to go to school.
College Sophomore,5,Work Program – The work program at Blackburn College is amazing.  Every resident student is required to be in the work program while commuters can opt into the work program.  The work program allows work experience while studying at college.  The work program is also completely run by students.
Sophomore,4,The professors here want you to succeed. Its a small college so you can get to know everyone. Class sizes are small so you can get a 1 on 1 feeling with all the professors. It is also a work college so you can get part of your tuition paid for.
Niche User,4,"I liked the professors and the student staff, as well as the works program and the athletics. The community around it was very nice and everyone was very helpful"
Freshman,4,"I like the fact that the professors are readily available to help out students at almost anytime due to the smaller class sizes. 
I wish they didn't force the people that live on campus to take a meal plan because I could be saving that money."
Junior,4,I love blackburn. The staff are very helpful towards students who need help. They help take some pressure off of the students and I wish to keep going.
Freshman,4,"I have conducted my own research as a freshman psych major, which is not seen in undergrad especially as a freshman plus I presented it at an international conference in Chicago. That research I am publishing now with my psych professor. To have that on my CV and to continue with new research and publications every year is going to add up at the end of 4 years! As a diverse student, I would like to see more diverse students on campus, the school can't really change that unless those diverse students attend."
Alum,4,Future employers will LOVE to hear about your work college experience. It definitely gives you an edge over other candidates.
College Junior,4,Never have had a major problem with a professor. They are all usually pretty friendly
Recent Alumnus,4,"Blackburn is one of seven work colleges in the United States. Aside from that, it's the only work college in the U.S. that is student managed. That is one of the things that I love about Blackburn; you can start from the bottom of the work program totem pole and build your resume up to the highest that it can possibly be (work manager). I also love the faculty to student ratio. I have many close relationships with professors that I don't think I would have had anywhere else. I am completely thankful for attending Blackburn because, it has opened many opportunities and provided me with so much that I don't think I would ever go back."
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy Blackburn College for the small class sizes and the personal relationships you can build with the professors.
College Sophomore,4,"This is my first semester at Blackburn, but I really like it so far.  I love the small class sizes, and the professors really make an effort to get to know the students.  So far, I have really enjoyed my courses and found them to be very informative.  They do a great job of relating the information being taught to how we will use it in the field."
College Sophomore,4,"Blackburn is known for its education programs.  I transferred from Lincoln land Community College, so it took a little getting used to.  I really like the small class sizes at Blackburn, and the professors really seem to get to know the students very well, which is extremely helpful."
College Sophomore,4,The lady in the financial aid office was very helpful and sat down with me and explained all of my options.
College Freshman,4,"Since it is a small town, housing is very cheap off campus and always close to whatever you need."
College Freshman,4,Blackburn was on top of letting me know what I needed to do for my major and getting me into classes and extra things that I needed to do.
Recent Alumnus,4,Most of them are good. Care about the students and want them to do well. They are easy to get a hold of if have any problems.
Recent Alumnus,4,I love the Sports Management professors. They know alot and very easy to get a hold of need help.
College Junior,4,BC offers a wide range of degrees and actually has a program where if enough interest is put forth new degrees can be added
College Junior,4,I am from Northern IL so its odd to not have snow as often bits typical IL freezing one day and hot and humid another thats just IL
College Junior,4,there are appartments that cater specifically to offering very cheap off campus living to students
College Junior,4,My schools Biology program is filled with very educated professors who love what they do. It can be a very stressful degree because the expect so much out of you though.
College Junior,2,"We have security, but they are students. I think the college should hire out for security to make it more reliable"
College Freshman,2,I've only met a few prof. who I believe actually care about their students education.
College Freshman,2,"Not well developed

Nobody really cares

No determination from student athletes"
College Freshman,2,I would not choose this school again. I need a much larger school with much more opportunities and competition.
College Freshman,2,There is not very much fan support and school spirit.
College Freshman,2,"The only ""security"" we had was students and half of them were not in very good shape and did not make me feel safe."
College Sophomore,2,Average. I like the fact that Blackburn is small but the dorms aren't too clean at times.
College Freshman,2,"Some of the parking lots are gravel, which is terrible for cars that are new or freshly washed. Don't even try to park in Jones lot, whoever thought of that design must have been a mad man."
College Junior,2,"Very Hot – It is very warm in the fall and spring, but the dorms do not have air conditioning. It makes for a very miserable stay; it is almost cooler outside than it is in your room. You are also not allowed to bring in your own window air conditioner, only fans."
College Junior,2,"Rule Breaking Goes Unoticed. There are many students at Blackburn who get away with cheating in class, or getting the easy way out of homework assignments and teachers often do not mention or have these misdemeanors effect one's grade in the class. It can often be unfair to those students who are doing what they are supposed to."
College Sophomore,2,I've never been to another school but Blackburn is pretty quiet and not much really goes on.
College Sophomore,2,"Security Is OC – The campus itself has strict rules and its group of security are there to regulate and maintain the rules. There isn't much crime or disturbance that goes on on campus, so it isn't too necessary to call security at all. And the security are students because it is a working college and those who chose to be security are. Being they are students you would think they would lax off and not be so intrusive, but many find a way to always bust someone for something because they feel the need to. I think they should be there to protect us when needed, not looking for excuses to get people into trouble."
College Freshman,2,"Carlinville Cuisine. Carlinville is a town of ~5500 people, so choices will be limited. We've got the obligatory McDonald's down the road, and a Hardie's close to campus. There's several restaurants in town, as well. About 20 miles away, also, is Litchfield. They have ANY kind of food you could imagine, as it's an interstate town."
College Freshman,1,It sucks because we don't have them
College Freshman,1,"Too small

Not right classes 

Teahers not engaged"
College Freshman,1,"DCC has great parking, but the Jones Hall parking lot is so horrible."
College Freshman,1,"Everything you need you can walk to. However, if you want to go home you will need a car because Blackburn is in the sticks."
College Junior,1,We no longer have a football program and the sports we do have aren't necessarily the best in standing. The soccer teams tend to do well though.
College Junior,1,There isn't much to do off campus especially if you don't have any money. There are free events on campus usually about once or twice a week. Events range from free movie nights to bingo or comedians.
College Sophomore,1,Troubles Every Year – Every year I seemed to have one or more financial aid issues.
College Sophomore,1,"Jones, an all girls dorm, was considered a sorority and North, an all boys dorm, was considered a fraternity. Unfortunately, the feeling of Greek family has died and those dorms are just like regular dorms."
College Sophomore,1,"The facilities here are horrible! The bathrooms are disgusting, including the bathrooms in the main buildings. The gym is full of broken equipment. The school is just so small and run down. The only time it looks presentable is in spring when the trees are blooming - that's it. Even the library is unappealing and the heating system makes a loud banging sound that is very distracting."

Alum,5,I can not rate this appropriately and there is not an option for me to omit this category. I did not have any online learning experience at Miles College so I can not give this particular review an honest response.
Alum,5,"I thoroughly enjoyed my Miles College experience. This small, family-oriented HBCU allowed me to make life long friendships, network with exceptional professionals in my field, and taught me rewarding lessons that I could use after college. I loved the pride and comradery amongst the students, faculty, and staff. The campus life was filled with endless activities and numerous clubs and organizations to join. The dorms and student recreation center were nice and not far from ""the yard"" were the greek organizations hosted step shows and cookouts. The football team had a winning record and continue to win SIAC championships. Most importantly the teachers genuinely cared about each and every student and wanted everyone to succeed. Miles College embodies ""Culture, Class, and Civility""."

Sophomore,5,My experience at Miles College has been one to remember. My main enjoyment came with the overall good feeling the campus gave me whenever i walked on to it. The teachers are very close and personal with you to ensure that you understand the work presented.

Freshman,5,Since I been at Miles it helped me mentally. I never been a peoples person before but seems like its a great vibe everywhere  I tend to open up to new people every day. Everybody wants to see you succeed its always from students on campus to professors nobody is going to tell you how you cant do something.  Miles is really like a big family taught me I can open up to people and not regret it. I'm  also in the band so I traveled a lot and met new people its just a wonderful experience that you'll have to see.
Senior,5,This school was a first for me outside of my home state of Nevada and it showed me culture like no other. I lived and grew to love some amazing people here at Miles. But most in important I gained a new love which is my career in Education. I also found the love of my life here as a Golden Bear.
Sophomore,5,Miles college is a place where learning is the most important thing. And every student needs to be in that kind of environment.

Junior,5,I have thoroughly enjoyed my collegiate experience thus far I've gained so much wisdom and knowledge since attending the institution it's almost become like a second home there is a vast amount of wise intellectuals there that seem to have the students best interest at heart I would like to see some changes but they would be a bit far fetched since attending I have already seen so many changes and watched the campus progress immeasurably in just a couple years I have watched some people that may have been considered the least of the litter transform into positive classy civilized and cultured individuals Miles college is a beacon on a hill in a desolate land attracting men and women with potential and transforming the individuals from the inside out this metamorphosis that takes place within these individuals births some of the most intelligent prominent promising men and women like no other

My favorite experience is when I receive the opportunity to be a Miles College Ambassador. You have to be involved at Miles College. They have great events and activities to attend it is up to you if you are willing to put in the work to become selected. The honors society and CAE program goes out of the country, half of the things I experience I know no other school does and pays for it all. "
College Sophomore,5,"On campus security is great,i have not felt unsafe so far, but as you know I am just a freshman at Miles College."
College Sophomore,5,"I had no problems with my application, the main thing is to read and understand everything that is on the application."

College Sophomore,5,Cool Air – This is when the weather is just perfect an i am just loving it
College Sophomore,5,"Miles College is the best college in Fairfield Alabama. I love being apart of the Miles College life. If you like to party and you don't like to study when it's time for the work, then you're in trouble. My freshman year I enjoyed myself, but when it was time for me to get in the books I knew what I had  to put away. If I had to start all over again an pick a college to enroll in I wouldn't trade Miles College for nothing."
College Sophomore,5,Team Performance – The team peformance at Miles College is good! I absoutely love them. We have so much support from the students and facility. Football team and softball team making it to the SIACC CHAMPIONSHIP. The work the coaches and students put into it.
College Sophomore,5,So Much to Do – Miles College is an awesome school. If you are looking for a college to go to in Alabama Miles Collge is the place to be. It has an awesome Criminal Justice Program if that's something you are interested in. The surrounding is very safe no problems at all.

The football team is very very good also the softball team both teams won the SIACC CHAMPIONSHIP. I love my school and will proudly be an alumni when I graduate.
College Senior,5,"Miles College has an Honor's Curriculum program, of which I am a member of. It affords me the yearly opportunity to take trips across the states to honors conferences to network with other intellectual college students and as well as present scholarly research. Each trip I have attended has been exceptional.
Miles Coleege is a also a Center of Academic Excellence. This program provides scholarships to its members, offers international trips, and training information in career areas such the FBI, CIA, and other government agencies for studies to get jobs there once they have graduated.
These programs are great and is what sets Miles apart from other school."
College Freshman,5,"Always a Variety – Well around the campus of Miles College, there is a huge Variety of restaurants to choose from. You have Mcdonalds, Hardee's, Milo's, Sonic's, Pizza Hut, and The Western Hill Mall had a few dining places available, theseare just a few of my favorits and are located down the street from the school. Let's not foret The Bear Cave which is a restaurant located in the school. Go Bears!!!"
College Freshman,5,"Perfect for Me – From the very beginning I was super excited about going to Miles College. Yea it's a little small but it's perfect for me. The classroom sizes are perfect, not to many not too little. I get As much one on one attention as i need. All the teachers and students are super helpful and nice. I love the good ol' southern feel that the school gives me. Miles college also has many gropus and clubs that you can join, such as CWM, SIFE, SGA, UNCF..and etc. I participate as much as possibe and so far i've had nothing but fun both inside and outside the classroom, and i've had a great deal of opportunities given to me. I love my Miles College. I couldn't have choosen a better school to attend. My Miles is Perfect for me in every way!"
College Freshman,5,"Because Miles College has a very large parking lot, parking is never a problem on campus. As long a you have a parking decal everything is fine. Parking decals cost $35 dollars and can be bought in the Business Office. You only get a ticket for parking in an area that shouldn't be parked in such as the yellow curbs or the entrance of a building. The campus is set up in a circle, so it is unnecessary to drive to class unless you live off campus. The buildings are all in one place and can very easily be walked to without driving. Honestly, the only use for a car would be to leave for lunch or hold your books as if a locker. All of the parking spaces are surround the separate buildings so it's convenient for the people who like to park right next to their hall. The parking is really nice here."
College Freshman,5,"Though there are many different ethnic groups at Miles College, the campus maintains a clean-cut, family-oriented environment. No one is put down for being who they are and it's not even an issue here. Miles College is campus that strives for excellence in everything it does and devotes itself to culture, class, and civility. There is no discrimination at Miles College and that is something that many other colleges cannot say for themselves."
Senior,4,"Miles College has made me proud to call them my HBCU. Not only are they teaching my curriculum, they are teaching common sense and how to live in the real world. Even though we don’t have the luxurious of other 4 year institutions, it teaches us students to make the best of every situation because we all have stories. No matter the background, we are all given many chances to succeed."
Freshman,4,"Miles college is very interesting like the classes are good the campus is a little small but it's okay. The diversity is average there is a lot of connections that could be made here, the professors so far are pretty invested in us so that's good. Also the food is okay. The dorms could be better like the mattresses and the bathrooms problems with those but everything else is okay."
Niche User,4,"miles is a perfect college ion see nothing that have to change. my first experience at miles was over the summer with my cousin, i enjoyed the experienced folks are really nice up.. the students, staff everything about miles is wonderful place an hopefully i'll be an golden bear one day. the food is just amazing, got that positive energy around that get you all hype. miles is just so different from any other college,its like once you get there you don't wanna leave.. another thing i love about miles high school is their football program. not to mention they won the SIAC  championship and now they are in the playoffs to win not one but another ring"
Freshman,4,I love my school. They have great school spirit. We have plenty of activities to do every week. The things that need to be changed are the bathrooms in pitts hall. We should be allowed to have visitation in each building because it's making a lot of students drop out. We want to see our other friends and play games in each other's room. The weather changes and it be too cold or too hot to hang outside. The food needs to be better. They rush to cook the food and it don't even taste right. The dinner times should be from 6 to 8 instead of 4-6 because some people can't afford groceries so t=hey eat in the cafe early and be hungry again later and thirsty.
Sophomore,4,Miles College is a small College. It’s easy to make friends there. They make you feel at home right away.
Senior,4,Miles College has a great biology and computer science department the teachers and advisors in that department truly care about their students.
Freshman,4,when I went on tour then school was great there was nice staff members to help me find my way around
Junior,4,I have nothing but positive things to say. This college has produced some of the most impacting and influential people in the city.
Sophomore,4,I have only been through the registration process but overall everyone was very helpful. It was very organized and efficient. Th wait was kind of long because students did not have all the proper paperwork done. But over all staff was really helpful.
Senior,4,"My experience here at Miles College has been a wonderful experience  the reason I say that is because doing my years  at the college I have done many things such as join the band and also cross a sorority name Tau Beta Sigma National Honorary Band Sorority. While traveling with the band I have had the opportunity to visit many city such as Chicago, Tennessee, and Atlanta. I am also apart of the Honors Curriculum where I have received many cords for my accomplish.  The things I like about Miles is that the school let the students have actives on campus an also the work system is a another thing I like about the school they make sure you have everything done in order to attend Miles.  Miles needs to get more parking space an stop giving students fees they have to pay such as laundry, an dorm usage fee what's the point of that if we already have to pay $100 to get a dorm every year and paying for your housing plan."
Freshman,4,The teachers are very helpful and very understanding they look after you when you need anything. The more you want to be in school the more they will help you stay in school. The campus life is okay but they make a way for us to have fun and have a great college life experience
Freshman,4,"It is really fun like there’s always something going on, on the campus like everyday. Also the professors really want you to succeed & they are very helpful. Everybody at the school is really friendly and you’ll make friends I’m the blink of an eye."
Sophomore,4,"Miles College is a 4 year Cme Hbcu college. Medium sized campus, 6 dorm halls, some of the majors they offer are Management (Business), Business Administration, Biology, Accounting, Early ChildHood Education."
Senior,4,"Within my 4 years there, my overall experience has been a good one. Besides the lack of poor campus security and very limited parking, my advisor, along with my department instructors makes up for what the campus lacks. Positive individuals willing to help their pupils meet their goals and aspirations besides graduating."
Junior,4,I love my HBCU!! We may not be the best of the best but through it all we are a team and family first that sticks together as one.
Junior,4,"I love that Miles is so small, because it gives you a chance to really interact and get to know the people around you. I would love to see the cafe food change honestly, the food could definitely be better considering its an HBCU plus there could be more scholarship opportunities for currents students not just incoming freshman. Miles honestly feels like home though. Its a place where you miss so much when you leave."
Freshman,4,"Miles College is a small college. It's a nice environment to get an education in. While there is no way to really get around without a car, the school does do their best to meet and handle each students individual needs. The classroom sizes are very small. The teachers are very hands on wand will help all students"
College Junior,4,"The courses that are offered are great for me considering that they have my major and my major happens to be one of the popular ones on campus. The class sizes are small which I love, that means more one on one time for me with the professor."
College Sophomore,4,There are different styles of dorms to chose from
College Senior,4,"I wasn't an athlete, but the athletes are very well celebrated and have great opportunities afforded to them."
College Freshman,4,i love all my teachers so far.
College Freshman,4,my experience so far is good . ive meet lots of cool genuine people.
College Freshman,4,The class sizes are good and professors are honest and keep it real with there students
College Freshman,4,The sports at the school are good but the band is the best at miles
College Freshman,4,Miles college is a great school I love the how they really put there students first
College Freshman,4,With personal safety on campus is pretty great considering we have emergency poles in case if anything happens
College Freshman,4,Everything is ok I just wish there were more activities
College Freshman,4,I think that the sporting activities are great because our football team won the SIAC Championship and I feel like they played to their abilities and also the Band as well.
College Freshman,4,"I am having a great experience at Miles College because I am in the marching band. Marching band has definitely helped me to socialize and explore. I even have done better in class through networking with my fellow band peers. It especially makes transitioning easier because their is someone you already know who can help you. For students who are NOT in some sort of extra-curricular activity, campus can be quite boring."
College Sophomore,4,"I love my HBCU! All the classes are small , which is better for me because the teacher can work with me one-on-one. The campus has its problems, just like all schools better they can trying to make it better and make it comfortable for the students ."
College Freshman,4,the food here is really good and it is nutritious
College Freshman,4,All of the student housing buildings were newly renovated
College Sophomore,4,The Greek life on campus is fun sometimes
College Sophomore,4,The party scene is very good. Good time to be sociable.
College Sophomore,4,The campus life is what you make it.
College Junior,4,It's really awesome I enjoy for what I pay for the cafe had a new building and it's very spacious for the studrnts
College Sophomore,4,the school spirit is okay alumni helps us out alot
College Sophomore,4,The people that work in the financial aid office are really helpful
College Sophomore,4,Homecoming needs to be a lot better in my opinion with the SGA we need a better artist
College Freshman,4,Everything is good its just that the fire alarm is so sensitive.
College Freshman,4,Its pretty cool. The fraternities and sororities throw pretty cool parties and we have a few clubs next to our school.
College Freshman,4,the teachers really care about you
College Freshman,4,"football season is great, basketball is another story. although, the girls are good !"
College Freshman,4,"majority of them are nice and helpful, but there are the few that are plain rude and nasty."
College Freshman,4,Most of the greeks are social and very open as to what their sorority and fraternities do.. I have to say they do throw some of the best parties
College Freshman,4,the Greeks are very active on campus
College Freshman,4,"The academics offered at my school are outstanding. All the professors will go out of their way to just help in any way that they can, they really do want to see better yourself. The curriculum is not that hard but it is not easy, you still have to do your work or you will not make it at all. The registration process is hectic at times much like other schools, but you have amazing advisors that will you all along the way so you will not be that stressed out about anything. Work is work, at any higher institution of learning you will have to do the work."
College Freshman,4,People here are really friendly and helpful
College Senior,4,"Officers definitely patrol the campus at all times. Officers and administrators have no tolerance for nonsense. Academics are indeed number one. If students are lacking in academics, extracurricular activities are hardly non existent for them."
College Senior,4,"The guys and girls are very diverse as far as personality. There is no one type of guy or girl. Some students are very friendly, sociable, active, intelligent, studious,  and some are completely opposite. It definitely varies."
College Senior,4,My overall experience has been great. I enjoy the social life and the relationships that teachers form with their students. The teachers and administrators truly reach out to their students personal bases. This staff shows they care and challenges their students in every way.
College Senior,4,"Diversity on campus is interesting. There are many different beliefs, sex orientations, religion, and more. In addition, many students are very open with their diversity. I have learned many different aspects of  beliefs, sexual orientations, religion, backgrounds, and more."
College Senior,4,Athletics at Miles are greatly supported. Students come out to the games and support the team. Alumni pay to get in the games as well as tailgate on campus. It truly is a great experience
College Senior,4,Greek life is very nice. You don't have to be a Greek in order to enjoy Greek functions. Greeks host a lot of campus activities and are very active in school programs as well.
College Senior,4,My financial aid process went pretty smoothly. It helps when I sit in the financial aid office to do my fasfa. This gives me the one on one help that I need when I have questions and concerns. The financial aid staff is always very helpful and hospitable towards me.
College Senior,4,I like living on campus due to the fact that it's very convenient. The girls are very helpful and sociable as well as the dorm mother's.
College Senior,4,Dining options are great off campus due to the fact that the options are convenient are a few.
College Freshman,4,our security is amazing they are always somewhere and very friendly.
College Senior,4,You can go to a house party with friends and later find a club.
College Senior,4,"For the students who dont have a car can catch the bus, at the front of the school and ask the guard for a bus schedule. If the student befriends a person with a car they can pay gas money, $5 is fine for close surroundings $10 and up for shopping or more."
College Freshman,2,"I don't appreciate how unhelpful the staff is. The Business Office is lazy, the officers are lazy, and the disciplinaries either are too leniant or too brute. They can turn even the most innocent situation into an overblown situation. They'll ask your side of the story but wil not actually listen. They'll even be so rude as to interrupt you while you're speaking but if you dare do that, they will get even more upset. They will treat you like an ignorant child instead of an adult. They do not have, nor do they deserve, my respect."
College Freshman,2,We're not that safe at all because it is far too easy for strangers to access our campus at all times of the day/night. We have a serious incident at least once or twice a month. We don't even have a nurse on campus incase of injury. You better find somebody with a car.
College Freshman,2,The reason that it's bad is because males are so isolated from females and it effect some people grades because if my partner a girl she is not able to come to my room and study in piece we got to sit outside where there a lot of distractions
College Freshman,2,Miles college is a small school based on in a bad environment. People will shoot right outside your dorm . They aren't technology based and they don't have school activities. This school is so boring. The dorms are like jail cells and no visitation or we can barely sit on the steps outside
College Sophomore,2,No safety as well as costly travel and food aids.
College Sophomore,2,They need a lot of help
College Sophomore,2,Living on campus has its goods and bad. The RA's sometimes trip about visitation They are lazy. I am always seeing bugs. The cost is way too much to stay in a dorm that you cant have visitation and on my side of the room I cant watch TV because they only have one plug where a TV can be watched and I have two other roommates. Other than that I feel safe and its cool sometimes.
College Freshman,2,"My financial aid covers almost everything except some of my dorm,I still have to pay money to live in my dorm"
College Freshman,2,I don't feel like campus security does their job like their supposed to
College Freshman,2,if you don't have a car or know someone with a car your stuck unless u walk which a good distance and the shuttles buses barely come
College Freshman,2,the housing is horrible and its not worth the money for staying on campus especially the location dangerous area
Recent Alumnus,2,They are late for everhthing .
College Junior,2,"We only have one cafeteria and it gets so crowded that waiting for food takes forever, they are in the process of making a new one though."
College Junior,2,To be honest it is not a very diverse scene at this college and everybody acts pretty ignorant. Other than a few people my social life on campus is not very exciting.
College Junior,2,Admissions offices can be a stressful process especially if the people working in the office are rude.
Niche User,2,Same community fast food resturants
Niche User,2,The dorms are the worstvthings on campus
Niche User,2,Most people dont come to school when the weather is terrible
College Junior,2,For the most part there is a lot of use of marijuana as I'm sure there is on a lot of college campuses.
College Junior,2,This college is a Historically Black College University.
College Junior,2,We get a lot of snow in the winter and a lot of humidity and heat in the summer. We have had a lot of school that has been cancelled because of snow storms.
College Junior,2,"It is a very poor community to say the least in Fairfield, Alabama."
College Junior,2,I was born and raised in Southern California so my college experience in the state of Alabama has been quite different.
College Sophomore,2,There is nothing around the town is in the middle of no where. But there is a near by town thats 10 miles away
College Junior,2,"No student discounts. Just all the unhealthy restaurants, McDonalds, Rally's, Hardee's, Fast Food Restaurants to create obese children. "
College Junior,2,"The cost is very expensive, TOO Expensive. The size of the dorms are not fair. For example our new dorms has four people in a suit with ONE bathroom. Four people to a bathroom is not cool. It is not enough space. I do not think they involve the students to ask what we like or what we think enough. The social atmosphere is cool. Everyone talks in cliques noone really comes together and just enjoy themselves. "
College Sophomore,2,When the weather is bad students stay in and sometimes it affects in campus activities.
College Sophomore,2,We don't have a student health center. And the security does there jobs when they want to.
College Sophomore,2,Parking decals are way too expensive and there is hardly available parking spots available.
College Senior,2,Inadequate staffing and lack of interest in politics. 
College Senior,2,"Not enough of an  experienced staff.
"
College Senior,2,"The school I attend is a Historically black college so there isn't much diversity for that reason , however, I am seeing more white and latino students coming here and it makes very happy to see that."
College Senior,2,"The dorms have strict visitation guidelines and are not co-ed. The non co -ed atmoshpere creates a social devide between male and female, becasue we are forced apart from one another by the school."
College Senior,2,"We have good sports teams but no one is fully behind anyone of them . Our football team just won it's division champion ship my freshmen year , that was two years ago , now that I am a sophomore , I haven't seen much zealousness about the team going to the big dance , I guess it's just a manifestation of the overall respect student have for the school as a whole."
College Senior,2,"In my two years here , I have seen moderate improvement now with the addition of  4 new buildings to a very small campus . There is absolutely no student involvement in the school because tthe school doesn't show much interest in the student body to begin with. I wish there was a way to give my school that certain spark. "
College Sophomore,2,"Very slow process, suggested you complete all information as early as possible"
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is a boy's dormitory located off-campus. I've had friends who've complained about constant theft within the dormitory and the impossibility of ever being compensated for the blatant shock and property loss. 

As far as campus security goes, it is mediocre. As I've said, there is a boy's dormitory located off-campus. There are two parking lots associated with the dorm; one lot in particular is normally full. So, dorm residents have to park on-campus--if they have a parking decal, which is normally not the case. Keep in mind that it's a fairly long walk to any of the on-campus parking lots. 
Students also have the option of parking, for lack of better words, in the street--which is not very far from the truth. The streets are so narrow that cars often have to pause and pull aside to let another car drive through.

Nonetheless, I've deviated  thus far to say that the cars in the off-campus lot are at a higher risk of being vandalized and/or broken into. It has happened to friends of mine. And they've each been told that the school isn't responsible for property stolen or broken into within those particular lots. Also, people who park their cars on the street in front of the a fore mentioned dorm--simply because there is nowhere else to possibly park--run the risk of having their cars booted and fined if they do not have a decal ALTHOUGH Miles College Security technically does not have the authority to boot and fine cars outside of campus."
Recent Alumnus,2,"My freshman, computer experience at Miles College was terribly disheartening. As a result of the poor wireless network availability and technical support at the time, I lost a letter grade in a class--simply because the internet connectivity was little-to-nonexistent at the time of my end-of-semester final and also because the library computers, which are the only computers that students who aren't in clubs and certain majors can use liberally, were unavailable. It was after that experience that I worked diligently to obtain my own laptop. 
After I entered my major, a computer lab was made readily available to me. But by that time, I had already broken free from the chains of ""computer lab availability."" The printers have a dreadful habit of crashing/going offline as well. I learned from that as well and ""scrapped"" together some change to buy a portable printer for my dorm room."
College Sophomore,2,Smooth and Rough at Times – I havent had any problems but i kno some fellow classmates that has had problems. It could be tough but if you have the patience it wouldnt be that bad.
College Sophomore,2,"There are four total dorms at Miles College. Two male dorms and two females dorm. The best dorms are Bass for girls and New Mens for the male. They are the best because they have bathrooms in the dorm. The food here is ok. Its nasty sometimes but if thats all you have to eat you'll eat it. It has a good social atmosphere, its a small college so everybody know each other."
Freshman,1,When I was told we were doing online classes.  I assumed we would be doing zoom calls or something along those lines. I take six classes online and I have not seen or had a instructor explain anything. It's pretty much login do the syllabus and submit. Every student learns differently so I know I'm not the only one having difficulty retaining the information
Sophomore,1,"I chose this college at a college expo because Miles had really made it look amazing. They even had a jump start program that I attend and love, but the crime is seriously BAD! I am now a junior and the crime as not got any better. I remember one time that really made me upset is when we had a drive by shooting Miles College band students got injured and Miles College said the shooting was not on the campus but it clearly was it happen in front of the dorm. Miles SGA do have a lot of activities you can do on campus also.  When we are going to the library there is no paper to print something you have to bring your own paper. I think that is crazy!"
Sophomore,1,"Terrible school! I read these reviews thinking it was a good school and it isn’t! It actually cost more than it says, the school is always on lock down, the caf food makes everyone sick they restrict everything and everyone! U don’t get visitation in the dorms! It’s absolutely terrible!! Do not go here! These “good” comments were probably made by the staff don’t believe it!"
Sophomore,1,dont let this school be your first  option or even your LAST. Please save your money and time and LIFE. By going to another hbcu this school is highly unprofessional especially the staff. This school is dangerous as well 2 people got shot and 1 got robbed. Please please please don't go here! If you want a better college attend somewhere else. Miles college is just a giant high school. Please please beware of this school I wish I would have.
College Freshman,1,"There is no drug regulation that is actually executed. But who cares, right?"
College Sophomore,1,We have no kind of freedom they treat us like high schools sometimes and it gets aggravating
College Freshman,1,very few outside our race(black)
College Freshman,1,"Its very poor food choices, nothing but McDonalds and Hardees open late nights. The service is very poor at both places"
College Freshman,1,The dorm i lived in was in horrible conditions and should not be that high of money of you don't get for what u pay the other dorms are OK they are decent but not worth the money
Recent Alumnus,1,Im fighting to get they retained money they have .
College Freshman,1,campus policies are very strict. they will fine you for anything.
College Senior,1,"Strict and the school officers are disrespectful,  rude, and lack humanity."
College Junior,1,"Each year that I apply my fasfa here there is always a new problem that magically appears which either stalls my process or makes me get less financial aid, and in this semesters case gave me a balance on my tuition fee."
College Sophomore,1,the sports teams are horrible
College Sophomore,1,the greeks are boring compared to any other hbcu
College Sophomore,1,defiantly a 2 yea collage you don't want to do your 4 years here
College Sophomore,1,defiantly need a car to go to this school
College Sophomore,1,Eventhough you need to bring your own printer and computer and laptop there is a chance your things can get stolen.
College Junior,1,the campus has just built a new cafeteria but the old one was terrible not that much healthy meals or options. Salad was always available. You knew on fridays were chicken tenders and fries. Sometimes they will create meals. For example one day they put a slice of bacon on the pizza and called it bacon pizza. 
College Sophomore,1,Students are treated as if they were in a correctional facility

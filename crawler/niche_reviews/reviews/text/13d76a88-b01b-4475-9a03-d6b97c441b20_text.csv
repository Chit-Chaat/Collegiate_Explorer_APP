Alum,5,I enjoyed TWU.  The campus was very nice and safe.  It is not hard to get from one side to the other.  The gym was new and improved while I was there.  My classess were interesting and my professors did a good job at teaching.
Alum,5,"The second half of my degree was all online.  TWU did a good job at making sure the content was relevant and made sure I was able to comprehend and use the information that I was being taught.  I still lived by campus so it made it easier to still meet up for groups, but I believe if I lived far away I could have made it work as well."
Junior,5,My professors have really strived to adapt to the interesting new climate that the Corona Virus has created. Very proud to be a part of this school.

Niche User,5,"I am not enrolled yet, but I hope to be after I apply this fall for next spring. It would mean the world to me to attend their nursing program in Denton, Texas. My father and mother both were nurses, and after seeing how passionate they both are I can only hope that I pursue this same degree of passion. I currently work at a nursing home facility administering patient care to the elderly. I truly love and I pray to be a geriatrics nurse to make my family proud. This is something I would like to do for the rest of my life, but unfortunately I do not have the funds for this. With the help of this generous scholarship, I would like to be granted the opportunity of showcasing my hardworking skills."
Niche User,5,"I am not attending this school yet, so I have no valid information to give considering online classes."
Graduate Student,5,"I took several online courses for my graduate degree. The coursework was very well structured and organized, easy to follow along with and straight forward. The  professors were very engaging and answered emails at all times during the day, even outside of office hours. There were times when I worked on a group project and a few group members were not engaged, the professor reached out and gave the students amble time to get their work in, as well as allowed the rest of the group to move forward without being penalized for the missing parts of the work for that group member.  I had one professor who was the head of the department teach a course, and she was also a on the graduate board. The professor was very humble and kind, very interested in students learning and being successful in the program and in their career. That's why I really TWU and why I chose the school for undergrad and graduate school."
Graduate Student,5,"I really like the class sizes are small, the professors are easy to talk to and the curriculum is applicable to real world work experiences. Students can be very competitive but everyone is friendly and welcoming to all."
Junior,5,"Regarding online experience, the university had to make a drastic transition during the pandemic, of which was performed almost flawlessly and allowed students the opportunity to remain on campus if internet and other necessities were required. The prompt reply of inline professors is unmatched as well, all typically replying by end of business day, or by following business day as stated in syllabus."
Junior,5,"Texas Woman’s University employs some of the best professors in the field by far. Regardless of major, you are met with faculty and staff of whom strive to provide support in completing your degree."
Alum,5,"My online experience varied from class to class. Most classes were fairly comprehendible and the instructors were active and involved, responding quickly to emails and answering any questions you may have."
Sophomore,5,"I love TWU. The environment of staff, teachers, faculty, students, etc is so amazing, diverse, and equal. I love how TWU celebrates all cultures and respects their students"
Sophomore,5,It's been tough but our professors are always available to help with our problems or needs. They always expect us do do our work but they will help us along the way. TWU college professors actually care about their students passing and that is an amazing feeling
Junior,5,"Besides the online experience due to COVID-19, classes were engaging and the material was very understandable."
Sophomore,5,"I am currently a sophomore at Texas Woman's University. My first  year of college was very smooth, not only did i make lots of friends, but i got involved in so many activities throughout school!"

Freshman,5,"I love Texas Woman´s, it is literally my dream school and everything I could ever  wish for! I think their academics are amazing and you can go there for anything you want to pursue. I love the dorms and it just makes me feel really safe."
Freshman,5,Very friendly and well organized. This school has wonderful academics and professor willing to work with you through the course.
Sophomore,5,I enjoyed my experience at TWU. I love the small feel to the school. This school is very convenient to all of the stores and shops in the denton area. The staff and faculty were very nice and helpful. The teachers were lenient on certain assignments and offered me extra help outside of the classroom. I was able to get an on campus job my freshman year and I was so thankful for that opportunity.
Freshman,5,"I'm about a pioneer resuming fall 2020 semester. I can wait to be in the school premises because it is so beautiful, the environment, dorms is just perfect and neat. beautiful views from the floors"
Senior,5,Great online bachelors program options for non-traditional students. Decent price per semester hours compared to other universities in the area.
Niche User,5,I liked Texas Woman's University because of how open individuals were and how safe I felt on campus. On campus if you are coming home late from studying you can go to this poll that calls a campus police officer and he/she will walk you back to your dorm to make you feel safe. The atmosphere on this campus brings joy and excitement.  The housing options are flexible here which means individual students can choose what is best for them.
Alum,5,"I enjoyed going to school at this institution. I thought it was neat going here because of the diversity, the amenities, the commute and class sizes especially.
Getting to go to school here was a huge opportunity for me and I enjoyed working on my major here."
Junior,5,"Diversity
Small Community Feel
Organizations and Leadership Roles
Welcoming environment
Academic success
Food"
Freshman,5,I transferred to Texas Woman's University for the Spring 2020 Semester and after about a month I find myself wishing that I had been at TWU since the beginning of the year. It was very easy to find people that I can relate to and and super comfortable with. The professors and GA's are very attentive and explain all materials so well.
Sophomore,5,"TWU is a public school with a private school feel. It is smaller, has low tuition costs, and has great academics and professors. It is known as the Campus with a heart and truly lives up to that title. All the faculty and stuff are willing and eager to help with any questions and do truly care about your success."
Junior,5,"I am a transfer student that began at TWU fall 2019, and honestly it's been the best decision. Not only am I studying for my bachelor's and having fun, the faculty make it such an amazing experience for the students. Everyone's always treated me with kindness and care. The professors CARE about you and your aspirations."
Niche User,5,"It really cares about the students, the second they walk through the door, either oncoming freshman or the regulars. All with big smiles, kind waves. Being new is tough but coming into such a warm atmosphere really helped. I cant wait to start my life with Texas Woman's University."
Junior,5,I absolutely love this school. I've felt nothing but safe here and constantly assisted by the faculty. I've been attending this school for 3 years now and I am almost graduated. I am contemplating attending grad school here as well. I see the same psych students every day and everyone has been nothing but kind. This school is very diverse with hundreds of clubs that suite anyone.
Niche User,5,"The experience is great, everyone is so nice and so helpful. i would recommend anyone to go here, although this school is for people who want to suceed not party."
Junior,5,"I really love the teaching staff, they are supportive and educated in their fields, which makes being a student here easy- in times in which it is often not. The campus is large but is under construction and they plan on developing a research center and adding to the many buildings. The average student is close enough to plenty of places to walk to for food, entertainment, and more. Overall, I am satisfied with TWU."
Niche User,5,Texas Women's University has been a great school for my siblings and I can't wait until they tell me all the fun they had in their college years.
Sophomore,5,"I love how the campus is set up, they always have fun events going on. The stores around it are very nice and also the professors are really caring."
Freshman,5,"Texas Woman’s Univeristy is a campus where you can enjoy going to class, the campus is usually calm and very nature based. The university is its own little neighborhood where everyone is familiar with everyone and isn't afraid to ask for resources, they’re endless!"
Senior,5,It has a nice atmosphere with the nature and the people are nice. There are great professor here. And the campus is safe.
Sophomore,5,I was thrilled with how easy it is to get to Texas Woman's University where I attend school. There are so many ways to get to school and most of the ways to commute is convenient and roughly takes the same amount of time. It is easy to avoid traffic in Denton despite the construction. I appreciate the lively atmosphere and how the staff make it their duty to go out of their way for their students. I had an advisor spend almost three hours helping me out with grants and other programs and she did not have to do any of that at all.
Alum,5,"Texas Woman's university is nestled in one of North Texas's cutest college towns. I completed my bachelor's degree here and loved my experience. The campus is beautiful and clean, and the history behind it is evident and proudly displayed. The library is 3 stories and lit with magnificent chandeliers. Artwork of past and present student hang on display. Students have free access to computers and printers, and there is a Starbucks in the library for tiresome study sessions. The fitness center is immaculate. I loved taking advantage of the top of the line equipment, basketball court, and group fitness classes. The university is cheaper and smaller than others in the area, which were more perks in my opinion. The professors were committed to the students. The classes were not always easy, you have to apply yourself, which you should expect for a college. I highly recommend Texas Woman's University."
Graduate Student,5,The Online programs at TWU are wonderful I love the transition to Canvas away from using Blackboard. Professors are easy to reach and the office staff are friendly to distance education students.
Freshman,5,"I would say that going to Texas Woman's University is one of the best things that I have ever done. The campus is small, so the classes aren't as big, which means that you get to be more personally connected with professors which is awesome. The campus is also so beautiful. It is green, filled with trees and flowers and squirrels running around all over the place. The school has a very relaxing vibe to it. It is also super cheap. It feels like a private university, with the cost of a community college. It is great."
Sophomore,5,Texas women’s university is the best university in Denton area. Please don’t hesitate to be a pioneer!
Freshman,5,"Everyone at TWU will welcome you like family. I've never met such loving and caring people in my past 18 years. They offer you financial support, counseling, academic tutors, and campus activities to grow as a community. Their food is spectacularly served with smiling faces making every experience even better than the last. I'm so honored and excited to be apart of TWU for many years to come."
Sophomore,5,"There are endless things to do and see in and around Texas Woman's University: from the beauty of the campus to the endless exciting activities you can find both on campus and around town. The daily life here is wonderful. Whether you live on-campus or commute you will find your experience to be streamlined and overall quite positive. The campus itself is quite small, however, the potential for enjoyable activities is huge. There are plenty of great spots to visit on and off-campus. These spots range from popular and delicious food joints such as ‘J&J’s Pizza’ to interesting and fun-to-visit oddities, such as the ‘Minifigs, Bricks, & More’ lego store! There aren’t many guarantees in life, but I can assure you that your time at Texas Woman’s University will be accompanied by countless positive experiences and will leave you with many wonderful memories."
Freshman,5,I Loved it! There are alot of available resources to help you out if you need it. The campus is small so its easy to get from class to class. The faculty and staff are very attentive and willing to help.
Freshman,5,It was a fun experience and I hate to had to let it end but I think it absolutely fun. Although I had a hard time with the teachers it was a really good school to experience so much more in work life.
Freshman,5,I feel like home at Texas Woman's University because everyone is welcoming and accepting. What I liked the most is that the campus is small and it kind off reminded me of my high school. The classes are actually small and it gives you more opportunity to get to know your professor. The professors actually care about the students learning and are always helping.
Alum,5,"This school does not have a football team however there is so much school spirit. As far as academic help, the tutoring is excellent!"
Graduate Student,5,"Love the availability of the professors! Everyone is so helpful , the entire staff on campus is always willing to help out for any student needs"
Freshman,5,"Although I have not started school yet, I am extremely excited to be a part of such a great school. I truly enjoyed the atmosphere and diverse opportunities the school offers. The community here is great and I can really feel how tight the student body is with each other."
Freshman,5,"From what I have seen from TWU, the campus is small and close to everything you need in the local area. With a small campus, it means there are small classes where you can connect with professors and other students, making a major impact on the students academics. Even if the student is commuting or living on campus in and LLC, there are many chances for students to connect to the campus."
Sophomore,5,"Im currently a sophomore at Texas Woman's University in Denton Texas, My experience has been far most amazing. There are so many things to like at the campus the people are every friendly the environment is so peaceful. I would not want anything to change at that campus."
Freshman,5,I have friends that attended Texas Women University. I love it that is promotes the sciences and it has been noted to be a great school. The Students are very competitive and very open to taking their Careers to the next level. Looking forward to starting my nursing program here.
Junior,5,"I absolutely adore this university. The faculty and staff are incredibly kind and helpful, the academics are challenging and create growth, and there are a multitude of fun activities to be involved in. I came to this college simply expecting affordable education, and I’ve been given so so much more. I owe large parts of who I am today to the time I’ve spent at this university. I wholeheartedly recommend it."
Junior,5,Texas Woman's University has been the most welcoming place and I really enjoy my time on the campus. It is a small area so easy to get to classes fast and gorgeous views of nature.
Sophomore,5,"Texas Woman's University has a beautiful & small campus. If you wake up 15 mins before class, no worries! You'll probably still make it on time. All staff is very friendly. I feel safe on campus, even when walking back to my dorm at 2am, when the library closes. Campus police is present at all hours."
Alum,5,"The teachers were always helpful, and genuinely wanted their students to succeed. The Math and Science resource centers were super helpful when stuck on a topic or problem that didn't make sense, and they often had multiple ways to explain a topic for various learning styles. 

The student body was fairly diverse - while it was a mostly female campus, I had classes with many different international students, as well as students from various ethnic and religious backgrounds. It helped to give me a wider perspective on the world, and I genuinely appreciate the students who were willing to talk about their experiences. Additionally, the majority of the students that I interacted with were very focused on their studies, and had come to TWU to learn - not to party. It made the experience so much more satisfying to know that I wasn't alone in my desire to be very serious about my education."
Freshman,5,Every interaction at TWU has been very timely and personal. I cannot wait to begin my college career at Texas Woman's University.
Junior,5,I like attending TWU. The classes are informative. I like the online options that Texas Woman's University provides.
Sophomore,5,"Texas Woman's University is an amazing campus filled with welcoming and enthusiastic staff and students. I always feel at home and if I have any problems or concerns, the staff is very helpful. The organizations are great and serve as an amazing way to make friends."
Graduate Student,5,"Great people! Great campus! Also I love the fact that I can study Library science online. I always wanted to be a librarian since I was in middle school. I have to opportunity to make that happen thank to Texas Women University. Living on the other side of Texas has been difficult, but thanks to the online version, I can make my dream come true. I really like how I can communicate with my classmates using Google Hangouts. This has made communication with professors and classmates a breeze. Texas Women University is not just for the ladies, I am a guy and I am proud to be getting my degree at Texas Women University."
Freshman,4,"I take 3 classes online and 3 in person which are all great. The professors make the online classes almost the same as if they were in person because you still get all the homework, lectures, and class engagements. They always reassure us to email them if we need any help on the homework or understanding the lecture better which is very nice. I haven't had any difficulty understanding how to work canvas which is where we do everything. We still even engage with other students by discussion posts and having small groups responding to our work."
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman at Texas Woman's University and I love going to this college so far. I don't live on campus, but when I do go for some of my classes it is always very pretty, safe, and chill. Something that I really like is that with a pandemic right now, the school has been very resourceful on how to deal with this and also understanding of financial and mental health needs. I haven't had any problem with any other students or professors about coursework and trying to communicate with them about assignments or other information. This school is not too big which allows for closer connections with staff and faculty and students also are able to participate in events virtually and sometimes in person while maintaining  social distancing and wearing masks. This school is worth attending to because it is also very affordable and you have great professors that teach you so well."
Senior,4,online this semester its a good school didnt really get to participate in much. its in a college town so its really easy to find something to do. some teachers are great some gave me a hard time
Senior,4,they use the canvas online system which is easy to navigate and keep track of due fates. I enjoyed the online experience
Freshman,4,"Due to the pandemic this year . My freshman year hasn’t been “normal” . Half of my classes are taken online . The online process hasn’t been so bad , the professors and the staff on campus are very flexible and supportive."
Freshman,4,I’m currently a freshman here attending Texas Woman’s University Majoring in Nursing . TWU has been very supportive during the pandemic .  My college experience so far has been great . I met very supportive people and attended really fun and educational events while of course being safe .
Sophomore,4,I would like the students to e more diverse and continue to grow. I love the atmosphere here it is very home like. The campus is very safe and friendly and helpful always.
Freshman,4,My freshman year of college went well from what I had expected on Texas Woman's University. I made new friends due to having similar classes along with pursuing the same career in which was great. The campus size is average in where professors are able to communicate with their students to a point it is not such a huge campus in were some professors do not remember some of. their students names.
Sophomore,4,Very easy to stay connected with peers and professors. Great experience. I took a couple of online courses and they were easy to operate and stay focused on.
Sophomore,4,This is only my second year but I can tell you that this university is really great. Staff are caring and supportive. Professors want to see their students be successful and  will work with the students that ask for help.Kitchen staff and maintenance are friendly and always smiling. This university cares for the well being of the students both physically and mentally.
Alum,4,TWU has a beautiful campus with a very welcoming environment. We were always given an abundance of material to learn from. The professors also did a good job of incorporating various types of material to adhere to the multitude of learning styles.
Junior,4,"I would like the Department of Housing a Dining to listen to their non-pro-staff on issues involving leadership, planning, and holistic wellbeing."
Junior,4,I love Texas Woman's University and would recommend it to anyone who values a quality education for an affordable price.
Sophomore,4,A very decent experience. I wish they had a better financial aid system as well as dining system. Housing is a bit off as well with the rooms being quite small. But overall it is a good school.
Sophomore,4,"I’ve had good experience with the online classes. Nothing more, nothing less. Overall good professors."
Niche User,4,"Texas women's university is a very diverse school, the area is great to live in. I would like to experience more moments there."
Freshman,4,"When I went to tour, I felt so included. They made me feel welcomed and I had so much fun. I can't wait to go there and live on campus and enjoy the student life."
Niche User,4,Texas Woman's is a lovely campus whose fields and plants are a sight. Its surroundings is a bit tight but not as busy as downtown Austin. The professors I had through my online courses were nice and always understanding. There's diversity in the campus for sure.
Junior,4,"I really liked the campus. It is very large and safe. I fell in love with the library, it is a great place to study. I really enjoyed my classes and my professors were really nice. I wish there were more food options on campus. However, they do have some healthy food choices. Printing is already included in the fees that they charge which is better because you don't have to pay every time you're going to print out something."
Junior,4,"The opportunities is gives students to succeed in a welcoming, small campus environment. Additionally, the close knit community vibes that the campus gives off it is one that I have grown to love."
Freshman,4,"I love everything about Texas Woman's University, it was honestly the best decision I have ever made. It is so diverse here and I am beyond bless to get to know more about everyone's culture and people are also so nice here and does not make me feel out of place. The only thing I would change would be the parking because their is more commuter parking than their is parking for people that actually lives on campus and it is so stressful tbh and I hate having to walk so far at night, by myself."
Sophomore,4,"I like the student to teacher ratio. There's a small enough population of students on campus to where the professors can learn all their names but not too small to the point where it feels deserted. The classrooms are intimate which makes sure you're getting your money's worth. The community bathroom in dorms are unsanitary. Campus police isn't around all the time, I feel there can be more measures to be taken to ensure student safety, especially at a woman's college. There are local shops for your wants and needs all around. The party scene isn't lively but UNT is not too far away."
Junior,4,"Denton and Dallas locations are fairly small and manageable to navigate and make it to classes on time. Even though the Denton campus is a stretch, it was great living there in such a quickly growing and adapting town! The Dallas location is conveniently located for the specialties taught there, parking isn't always the greatest but they do they best they can with how much space is available. It is a fantastic school overall!"
Freshman,4,"Although the campus is fairly small, it is still developing and continuing to build up. The campus is very beautiful and has many resources for staff members and students."
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my short time at TWU, however my final year was a bit challenging as I had many obstacles appear that I could not control. The one discouraging thing was having to put off graduation for a whole year due to one of the courses I needed for my major ONLY being offered in the fall."
Junior,4,"I love that there is a lot of acceptance of the different backgrounds but ironically, there isn’t a lot of diversity. The buildings are nice but they do look old. I wish there were more restaurants and variety."
Freshman,4,It’s a really great school but I feel as if the school is over priced and it is a bit organized. There’s really great stuff to do and the classes are amazing. I actually learn pretty good and all the professors I had were amazing. With the money we’re paying it could go to better things such as in the classroom.
Freshman,4,"My experience so far at Texas Woman's University has been decent. I had to switch rooms about a month into my first semester because my roommate was a nightmare, which isn't the university's fault. The dorm rooms are very nice but I would like to see Stark Hall be renovated much like Guinn. The library is a beautiful place for the campus and is great for studying at if you need a quiet place. The campus is quite small so it isn't too terrible of a walk from one side to the other. Although during the hot months I was struggling."
Freshman,4,"This is my first year at Texas Woman's University but I love it here. This is my first time being independent from my parents and I think that the staff does a good job at making us feel at home. This school has been in my heart since I was younger, I used to come to the gymnastic meets and I feel in love with the campus. With the construction has brought new dining options for students and the modern looks is beautiful. This campus is beautiful and I am lucky to be student at TWU."
Sophomore,4,"The high school I came from was a predominantly white institution. However, I was pleased when I became a college student here and saw how diverse this university is. This was something that I hoped for for my high school. The morale is very welcoming and the staff wants to help you succeed. Although I wish that there were more options to provide aid for students because I am struggling with financial complications myself. I want to continue to attend this university, but I do not have the financial means to keep doing so. I hope that in the future this doesn't become a reason students choose not to come to this campus."
Freshman,4,Texas Woman's University is a College for the people. It is full of opportunities. The Campus is amazing & full of life. There is always activities going on for Students to enjoy. It is very diverse.
Senior,4,"Excellent professors, great academics, and a very beautiful campus. The University lacks in student life, not having very many recreational organizations within the community. However, the pros of the academics far outweigh the cons of student life."
Senior,4,"I had an overall great experience at Texas Woman’s University. When I first started, the staff was very helpful and I was never confused about how to apply or how to apply for financial aid. The classes are small which makes it easy to ask the professors for help. I used to be a nursing a major and some of the professors could have been clearer on what they wanted on their assignments, that’s why I give them a 4 star instead of 5. When I switched to education, the professors were wonderful and wanted you to succeed. They always encouraged me to try my best even when I made mistakes. I am currently student teaching and plan on going back to school when I graduate in December 2019."
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy being at Texas Woman's University because of the environment. It is an extremely safe school to be at, everyone feels safe no matter what part of the school you are at. It is also peaceful and quiet so you can study anywhere and anytime."
Sophomore,4,"The university is a good size with a diverse student body. The atmosphere and environment are good for studying. The only downside for me personally would be that the student body is mainly female. However, that doesn't mean that there are no males in the school."
Freshman,4,"So far, everyone at TWU loves being at TWU. There's no toxicity on campus, all the facilities are kept in great condition, and the professors are great at teaching."
Alum,4,"I loved my program, instructors, and department. I know there are a lot of changes being made to campus since I have been a student, so I am excited to see the future of TWU."
Freshman,4,"Everyone is very nice and there is always a welcoming atmosphere! Staff if for the most part friendly, and all seniors/alumni are always happy to assist any underclassmen/undergraduates who are lost or need assistance in regards to anything (such as registering for classes, searching for a specific building, etc.)"
Freshman,4,Everyone is so nice and are there to help. when you have a problem 9/10 the professors know where to send you. it is a small campus so its easy to get anywhere fast.
Freshman,4,"As a female freshman at TWU, i can whole heatedly say, i LOVE this school. It has a great blend of many different diversities and cultures, everyday I meet someone new! The campus is small, but feels so warm and welcoming. The academics challenged me many times, but its good to challenge yourself! There is no lack of help around campus, there are so many professes and counselors that are there to only help you."
Freshman,4,Texas Woman's University is great if you want an academic based school with no reputation of being a party school. The school is really quiet which is perfect for studying and you're right next to University Dr. which is where the food and shopping outlet is located at. You get to meet other students who are academically driven like you and you don't have to walk that far for your class.
Junior,4,"The professors were all helpful in making sure we understood the subject material. One thing that I struggle was with advising for the health studies department. A certain advisor was counseling and teaching, which was cause her to not be available that much."
Niche User,4,"The enviornment of this University was overall beautiful. There was open space and students hanging around with smiles on their faces. The students were kind enough to talk about what their major is and where they prefer to study. The classes were not as big, which fits in my best interest."
Freshman,4,I would like to see more parking being added to the campus. It has become harder to find parking without coming at 7 am in the morning to park. What I like about  TWU is the fact that it is old. It has a history in which I like and knowing that people I have danced with as a young girl walked the same sidewalks that I do makes me feel at home. It is also close enough to home that I can see my family but I do not have to be a couple miles close to them.
Sophomore,4,"I just got in and after that, I really do not know what I am doing. In capstone, we are doing the presentations now which is pretty nerve-wracking and I absolutely hate it but i is not something I have not handled before. I do not know which week it is but it feels like we only came in two weeks ago really."
Junior,4,I love the price of tuition. However there is a lack of community outside of the classes if you do not live on campus.
Niche User,4,"I went on a trip to visit the campus and it was very enlightening. I loved everything about the housing, the cafeteria, and the facilities. So far, it's the best college I've visited."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is beautiful! Professors are generally kind and helpful. Because of its small size, TWU has many opportunities--research, volunteering, and more."
Sophomore,4,"Very dedicated instructors that are eager to help you learn.  You must study a lot because it will not easy; however, this is an investment into your future. You will get out of it what you put into it."
Junior,4,"Texas Woman's University is a nice small campus in Denton. They are well organized and most helpful. The tuition and parking permit fees are affordable. Parking spaces are limited, so either get to campus early or late. Also, the dorms are very small and old thus not worth the money invested."
Niche User,4,"I visited for Pioneer Preview Day and it was a beautiful, old-fashioned campus. I'd love to see some more modern touches throughout the campus though. I also wish the dorm rooms were bigger."
Alum,4,"I attended TWU's nursing program and graduated in 2013. Their level of education was excellent and the program prepared me well to be an excellent, meticulous registered nurse. Most students are female and it is a small, public university. Tuition was not too high, but the library was disappointing as study rooms were almost always in use."
Freshman,4,Really enjoyed that is it built like a private school with lots of foliage. I can’t even tell there are 16k students here. Parking is terrible and you are shoehorned into getting a 500 dollar parking pass to park in the parking garage when normal pass is 70 dollars. Professors are good but don’t be surprised if none of them know your name. Academics is great but sports seem non existent
Junior,4,"I aspect of the TWU library that was interesting is that they have nap ""pods"" in the library to rest and ""recharge"" as you study. Convenient for those long study days before finals."
Senior,4,"Texas Woman's University thus far, has been a beautiful experience to say the very least. I have done the majority of my course work due to the long commute, but while being on campus it is a quiet place and a place where studying is at its highest the majority of time."
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed the welcoming environment in that school as well as all the activities they had for us. Also one thing I would change was how some advisors are, they should be more involved in the interest of the student not act like its a routine."
Freshman,4,Texas Woman's University is a great place. The environment is nice and the campus is small enough that buildings aren't too far from one another. The professors are friendly as well as other alumni.
Junior,4,"When you first see the campus it is beautiful, with many things to see around campus. This is such as the water fountain by the library, the woman's statue on one end of campus, the big logo in the middle of campus, and many more things. The campus is small and makes me feel safe and at home with usually seeing familiar faces. The professor are great at teaching, they explore knowledge we may know but in different perspectives. What I would like to see improve is adding a bigger cafeteria because when lunch rolls around the lines are long and eat up most of the actual time we have for lunch waiting to get food. I would also say create more parking. Because if one is commuting we have to get there early to get a good parking spot, and not have to walk from the outside neighborhood around the campus."
Junior,4,I love how the university focuses on getting the students to graduate on time and how diverse their majors are. The faculty is very kind and helpful. The campus is pretty and small in size.
Junior,4,"Overall, TWU has been a great experience for me! I love the small classroom sizes, which gives me better focus and a closer learning experience with the professors and my classmates. I recently got accepted into the Nursing program in Houston as well, so I am looking forward to graduating with my BSN degree in the near future!"
Junior,2,"The school and teachers itself are fine, but the advisors we’re so bad and incompetent that they ended up causing me to take an extra two semesters worth of school and caused me to take a semester off. Overall it’s a decent school, but you get what you pay for."
Freshman,2,"To be honest, I wouldn't recommend going here if you want the typical college experience. The university is very bland and the students are very odd. Being as it is an almost all women's college, there is a lack of chance for relationships. Campus is usually entirely dead by Wednesday and there is a lack of school spirit and no traditions. Student life in general is horrible, the campus is pretty though. The overall mood is just extremely drab which bothers me."
Sophomore,2,School does not give helpful advice on paying for classes. I was forced to leave when they dropped my schedule due to lack of funds.
College Freshman,2,"My main issue with TWU is the housing. If TWU wasn't your first college choice, finding a nice dorm or apartment to live in will really be a struggle. They make you move into a hotel and then move into a triple or quadruple dorm , which is complicated for everyone in the room due to limited space availability in it. On the other hand, academically, professors are pretty nice. Work load is a lot but easy if you put in the extra work to get that A and study a lot. Socially, if you are not extremely outgoing or in a Greek or other kind of organization, making friends will not be easy to do unless you know people from your high school."
College Sophomore,2,I wanted to rush but then I noticed that greek life at TWU wasn't the best. Very disappointed.
College Freshman,2,The atmosphere is horrible. The rooms are nasty.
College Freshman,2,"The rooms are small, the walls are brick, and the floor is tile. I live in Jones Hall and the bathrooms are rarely cleaned."
College Freshman,2,"I personally have a hard time with financial aid. I feel as if I am constantly in the financial aid office talking to Phillip, the receptionist. They are horrible at communication and will change your financial aid package without any notice."
College Sophomore,2,They are strict especially in stark for no reason.
College Freshman,2,there is like no variety
College Freshman,2,"Not very many diverse options a couple for the entire TWU campus population to apply for.  Many scholarships available for Greek, NSCS, and having a 4.0 GPA."
College Freshman,2,The people participating in greek life are barely noticed in school. There is no difference from being a part of greek life.
College Freshman,2,These people have almost no social lives and are more concentrated on studies. There are almost no guys here so you will always recognize the few guys that do go to this school.
College Freshman,2,I never hear about the sports events.
College Freshman,2,There are only a few options and most of the places are not that convenient. Night class students need to have food ready before to not starve at night.
College Sophomore,2,"Typically there are not alot of parties on the TWU campus, but if you know the right people or have friends over at UNT you can definitely find some fun parties to distract from classes for a little bit. If you like to go to bars, watch games, or just hang out with friends, then you could always go to the square (downtown) or Fry Street which is located next to UNT."
College Sophomore,2,"The undergound (cafeteria) has poor service and the food is not the greatest. It also does not have speedy lines and one is having too rush through their lunch and not able to enjoy their meal. Also, having to only use at dine in dollars in certain places instead of anywhere is not very convenient either. I would also like to add that it is not convenient to only have a meal plan because most of the time I try to avoid going to the cafeteria even though I have already paid for it."
College Freshman,2,The parties aren't really fun. They seem repetitive and lack innovation.
College Sophomore,2,Not a very athletic school
College Junior,2,"There are not a lot of Greek organizations on campus. They are not very prominent, and do not have any separate housing."
College Senior,2,"The prices are ridiculous. The places I can afford, I don't feel safe at."
College Student,2,It is not as live as other campuses at all. It's actually boring.
College Student,2,I wish the dance department would hold more students accountable for bad grades and absences.
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many scholarships offered at this school.
College Freshman,2,"I haven't got into my serious courses yet, however i feel like everyone is very willing to help everyone to get to the top. Everyone goes to school for one and the same reason."
College Freshman,2,"I can say the job opportunities are not as open for everyone, since i am 17. Although, i thought it would be an advantage. Right now i am taking my basics going for criminal justice, so far so good. It is hard, but hard work pays off."
College Freshman,2,"Considering there are people that are 21, get leeway other people not so much. You have to speak for yourself and do whats right. We have police on campus that highly enforce it."
College Sophomore,2,The weather out here is so bipolar. One minute it's  pretty and warm outside then the next it's cold and dreary.
College Freshman,2,I am not sure of the footprint of greek life at this school
College Freshman,2,The campus is not near any of the night life in Denton.
College Freshman,2,There is nothing to do around the school
College Sophomore,2,I am tiered of eating the same thing over every week
College Sophomore,2,There is not much to do off campus. The mall sucks
College Sophomore,2,There has been couple of ice and snow days causing the campus to close.
College Sophomore,2,"It is complicated, not too many scholarships offered."
College Senior,2,"A good amount of students here commute from the Dallas area so they won't be people you can just call up on the weekends to hang out with so that stinks.  Also some people are serious try-hards and seem like they wouldn't be down for normal college things that don't include studying.  (Don't get me wrong, I recognize that college is for getting an education, but there is also the option to have fun too)  Some students here are regular college kids though, they are just hard to find.  Also lots of moms here."
College Sophomore,2,"As a commuter student, parking is always a nightmare."
College Sophomore,2,The apartments look old and run down.
College Sophomore,2,"Snow, school is shut down."
College Student,2,i had to get a loan when i first got to this school because they didnt tell me ahead of time that i need certain papers
College Sophomore,2,"Parking fills up extremely fast, and when it's filled, it's hard to find another parking. Expansion on parking spots is highly necessary, and I think they should look into that quickly.Parking permits are required, and if you parked on campus without a permit you will be ticketed. A car is not highly necessary, but it will help getting around socially, or if you want a job off campus."
College Sophomore,2,"If I had the opportunity to do it all over again, I would not choose this school. Student life is dead, there's nothing to look forward to on campus, campus is dead by 7-8pm. Every once in awhile they'll try and spice it up, but it's not enough to write home about. I'm not going to lie, but 2012-2013 was a pretty good year, but it also depends on the type of friends you make. Also, campus had A LOT more activities that was going on. Academically wise, this school is good. But once you bring up social life, it all goes down the drain."
College Sophomore,2,"This past semester advertisement for the Athletic teams were horrible, I never knew when games were happening. Last school year was better, there was always advertisement for the sport teams. They were everywhere, from the dining halls, to the library, to the dorms. The games always had great turnouts, with a lot of give aways. This past semester, I don't even know if they gave out as much items, since advertisement was so low."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The dorms could really use some updating. There really isn't many ""hangout"" spots available on campus. Most of the time if we want to hang out or something, we leave campus."
College Student,2,People are weird and don't really talk to each other
College Student,2,Parking lots are not very large and the ones that are closest to the dorms are open to all types of permits. The closest dorm parking lot should only be open to current on-campus residents. 
College Sophomore,2,"TWU is unique in that a good portion of it is non-traditional students.

Overall, I feel like the administration and faculty are poor. Most staff do not seem to be very professional via phone and in person. Also, I feel like it has been interesting coming in as a transfer student. Many times I feel like us transfer students are thrown in the dark and expected to figure out everything on our own (which is what I had to do). It would've at least have been helpful to know what department, administration, individual to contact with my various questions for each place seemed to be annoyed at my questions and want to point me in another direction.

Aside from these kinks in the administration and faculty, I enjoy the small student body feel on campus. Most of the professors in my Family Science department are enjoyable and good. I have appreciated them and their courses. "
College Senior,2,"TWU does not have a lot of financial aid for those who are not in ""severe need"" and most of the financial aid consists of loans. "
College Senior,2,"Parking on the Denton campus is difficult to say the least as there are very few parking areas to accommodate for the faculty, students, and staff on campus. "
College Freshman,2,"IT'S THE SAME FOOD ALL DAY, EVERY DAY. THE UNDERGROUND IS DIRTY. THE BAKER'S DOZEN, THE GARDEN ROOM, AND CHICKFILA ARE BETTER. "
College Freshman,2,IT'S BARELY EXISTENT. MOST PEOPLE COMMUTE OR LIVE IN DORMS. 
College Sophomore,2,"Housing was just an experience and not for me. My roommate and I got along fine until the end of the semester which made living on campus dreadful, our kitchen area on our floor was always dirty and the microwave was disgusting, and the trash always over flowing. My RA was great until second semester when she disappeared and forgot about us. There is a convience store in the dorms which is nice and with a meal plan they allot you a small amount of money to use there for late night runs, when you run out of toilet paper and have no time to go to walmart, and they have food. I think there was too much estrogen for me. I got along great with the only two guys on our floor and we had a lot of fun. It can be really loud sometimes and even if you ask someone to quiet down because your roommate is sleeping or you are studying you just get eyes rolled at you. I believe the experience is decided on who you live with and how well yall get along. They do do a personality test and try to match you with someone with similiar qualities and unfortunately i did not get to do that. I met her at freshman orientation and got to know her for a day. They also do living learning communities which is nice because you live with people who are studying your major and designated classes are set so you will get to know these people and be able to do homework together and can study."
College Junior,2,Greek life is here but it's not a big deal to be in it or to not be in it.
College Senior,2,"Not an extremely diverse campus but it does have some diversity. As an initially women-only university, the campus is, naturally, overflowing with women. I have heard many jokes about TWU being overrun with lesbians and that is actually not the case. Most of the women there are actually straight women and I believe we have an equal amount of lesbian women at our school as any other university in the country. The thing I would note as the biggest problem with making friends at TWU is that since most of the students commute, you can't exactly call any friends up to just hang out on weekends because it'd be a 45 minute drive for them."
College Senior,2,"Parking is very strict if you do not follow the rules you will get a ticket from campus police. I got a ticket for parking within 5 feet of a driveway, which wasn't true, but I waited too long to fight my ticket."
College Freshman,2,There isn't really a night life at TWU. Most of the partying that goes on around TWU is either at someone else's house or at University of North Texas
College Junior,2,I didn't even know there was a Greek life at TWU. It really doesn't affect or make a difference if you're in a sorority here. I don't see them doing many activities and it just seems like people join just to say they're in a sorority.
College Junior,2,I commute so I don't know much about public transportation.
College Junior,2,The school is mostly populated by females. There are about 12-14% male.
College Sophomore,2,"I feel that at my school sports are no promoted enough, not many people attend sports events and due to the fact that we don't have a football team a lot of the other sports are offered are overlooked."
College Freshman,1,Not really a party school with everyone leaving on the weekends. The ASO and other organizations mostly Greek try really hard to make parties happen. Still not as popular as UNT is for their parties and events so most students go to UNT ones instead majority of the time.
College Freshman,1,Mostly take place in UNT due to a lot of people going home on the weekends or trying to focus on class work. I wouldn't know much about parties since they are not common here.
College Freshman,1,"TWU made the mistake again of accepting too many freshmen, so housing was a hassle. I was one of those who had to stay in a hotel for a few days (a week to be exact) and then assigned to a FORCED triple dorm, so the space is horrid. If TWU isn't a first choice for you and if you don't apply really early for housing, it will be a challenge. Hopefully next semester it will be much better and easier to leave the triple dorm. Also, the furniture in the room is horrible. The drawers are made out of wood so it is chipped. The bathroom is dirty from previous students, and the sink and floor are rusting along with the bathtub and shower head. The blinds are dusty and the fridge is not working and leaks water while melting and spilling the food. Resident assistants are so not helpful half the time and some have attitudes when asked a question even though that is their job..to answer. This is my personal experience in Stark hall but I'm sure it's better for others in double rooms or in Guinn. It's a bit far from classes if you do not live in Jones Hall. Still wouldn't consider the semester payment to be worth it. But hey, we all start somewhere. Social atmosphere is eh... Everybody usually stays to themselves or only talks to their roommates."
College Freshman,1,I have no desire to be a part of Greek Life. I think it is overrated and a waste of time. I would rather use my time studying for my classes.
College Sophomore,1,So far I have not received any internship that has peaked my interest and I believe I will not in the future.
College Sophomore,1,This University does not offer any athletic facilities.
College Sophomore,1,"I stated my first year with an F on my transcript and $1,152 in debt because of some miscommunication and flaws within the system."
College Junior,1,"Probably the only thing I hate about the school. It is very difficult to actually apply for financial aid, prepare for a maze of stress, confusion, and desesperation."
College Freshman,1,I seriously hate the food at the underground! I hate having bad reviews but it sucks they had to cut back on so much stuff and it is just gross! The meal plans are super expensive for what we get for food !
College Freshman,1,"I wanted to live with my parents since I live close to the campus. They almost didn't let me! I had to go through a lot of pain in order to stay at home and save a couple thousand dollars. Then, after I FINALLY got the okay to stay at home, everyone continued to shove dorm life down my throat and tried to force me to live on campus."
College Freshman,1,The only parties I have ever heard of are happening on different campuses.
College Freshman,1,No one here really parties unless you know some people at UNT.
College Sophomore,1,Party life sucks at TWU
College Student,1,The Ridge at North Texas is where I currently live and it is absolutely terrible. Towing is ridiculous in off campus housing!
College Student,1,HORRIBLE! Everything is so old!
College Freshman,1,"Today it was sunny and then i seen the sky get dark and it got very windy. I left the school headed to Dallas, then my dad text-ed me asking if i was okay because he was worried. I didn't know what was going on then later found out that it was hailing and raining and a tornado. I left just in time to miss the storm, however it is RIDICULOUS. Denton and Ft. Worth areas always get hit harder than anywhere else."
College Freshman,1,"Most fines are 40-60 dollars. I park in Stark and it can sometimes be a hassle in the mornings and nights. I kept hearing about new parking, never knew where but Stark parking is the closer!"
College Senior,1,Our parking situation is ridiculous. There is no reason the school could not put in some parking garages. For what we pay to park and then not be able to get a spot is ludicrous.
College Sophomore,1,We have no night life. TWU doesn't have parties.
College Sophomore,1,We have no school transportation.
College Sophomore,1,"Nightlife at TWU is horrible, but with UNT as our neighboring school, there's mostly likely something to get into around that area. This is where everybody goes, or they go to Dallas, or Arlington."
College Student,1,I dont even want to talk about it.. that's how bad it was.
College Student,1,The staff that was supposed to help with financial aid was THE WORST
College Senior,1,"The one thing I hate about TWU is parking. They prowl the campus lots and effectively divvy those damned yellow tickets to everyone who's not got a permit DESPITE the fact that they do not have adequate parking for anyone in the first place, paid parkers included! I bought a parking permit one year and I will never do it again because it is not worth the headache of trying to find a convenient spot. I was ten minutes late to class once even though I was on campus fifteen minutes early, which means I looked for a parking spot for twenty-five minutes. That's unacceptable."
College Sophomore,1,"Too many people, too few parking spots. My teachers told me that they oversell the parking permits under the assumption that not everybody who bought will be trying to park on campus at the same time."
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking on TWU campus is horrible. Commuter parking is the farthest from the campus and the on campus students take up all of the close spaces instead of parking in front of their dorms.
College Senior,1,"The only university sports teams that I'm aware that we have are soccer, gymnastics and softball. The students don't really get into the sports teams as much as other universities do which is a shame. Unless you have a friend in a sport or someone in your class who is a student athlete, you may not even realize sports exist at TWU."
College Sophomore,1,"The dorms that we are supposed to live in during our first two years in college are bad. I did not like the room I lived in at all. At first, I had two other roommates in a room built for two and it was too cramped and they put too much furniture in it for us to be comfortable. The paint on the walls were cracking and peeling off, the drawers were squeaky, the showers were dirty and most things had stains on them."
College Sophomore,1,Parking on campus is a catastrophe.  TWU does need to build more parking for students. I personally refused to spend $75 dollars for a parking pass and I would just walk a couple of blocks to school.  Were everyone is allowed to park is also a bit confusing for incoming students. And you WILL get ticketed if you park in the wrong spot.
College Freshman,1,There is no nightlife at TWU it just sucks all around
College Freshman,1,This year the enrollment rate has tripled leaving less parking spots. People have a stare down
College Student,1,The campus is very strict from the teachers to the parking police.
College Student,1,I don't think there is much advantage with fin. aid at this school. Things always get lost in the shuffle and then the staff blames the student. My recommendation would be to keep copies of everything and if you can't do it in person then send it certified mail.
College Junior,1,"There are never enough parking spaces for everyone at school. Every morning there are numerous people driving around every parking lot trying to find a spot, which are completely filled. Usually took 30-45 minutes. I finally had to come to the solution of parking places off campus to ensure I made it to my class on time every day."
College Freshman,1,The Housing Set up is not based on what u like in a person
College Freshman,1,There is no nightlife at Texas Woman's University. Most students are commuters and go home every weekend. The campus is usually deserted by Friday evenings. If you want to party most people just go to the UNT campus.
College Freshman,1,"I personally dislike the financial aid process here. Just apply early and consistently, also apply for all free money that you can (financial aid, scholarships, etc.)"
College Junior,1,finding a parking spot is hectic and sometimes one would drive for over 20 minutes trying to find one
College Freshman,1,The parking at TWU is a nightmere for every commuter!! They have way too many students than they do parking slots! Several students (and sometimes teachers too) have to drive around for 30 to 40 minutes to find a spot if they arrive after some class periods have already started. The only way I can work around this is get their really early in the morning.
College Junior,1,Finding a parking spot is impossible. You need to get to campus about 30 minutes before class to get a spot but if you want a decent parking spot you have to get there about an hour or so before. Sometimes I have to walk 10 minutes before I get to my class building. The traffic lights around campus also take forever.
College Freshman,1,"There is a strict enforce on visitation hours, and room checks and parking tickets. It feels as if they are parenting us with the visitation hours."
College Student,1,"At Texas Woman University at Denton does not have that much options when it comes to sports, the closet thing we have to an out door activity is a Gym with a rock climbing and tons of work out machines. We have a population of 9,010 student which is not big at all. Most of our activities has to do with the environment such as picking up waste and maintaining the trees that surround the campus."
College Freshman,1,"The parking on campus can be horrible throughout the week.  I reccomend that once you find a parking spot, don't move unless absolutely necessary because you will probably have to drive around to different parking lots in order to find another spot.  On the weekends parking is great because everyone is gone, which makes it the only good time to move your car around.  Other than that, parking is very hard!"
Recent Alumnus,1,There Isn't Enough Information – TWU has its problems and its upsides but this is a problem. We aren't informed at all about any internships and I've been trying to find one for months now.
College Sophomore,1,Ok ill be honest the parking at TWU absolutely sucks. The commuters get to use the same parking area as the residentials which causes lots of issues. There are never enough spaces for us. One big issue ive alway had was the motorcycles. They are they littlest things ever so i dont understand why they cant have a different area to park. They take up all the space for the normal cars. If there were bigger parking structures then I dont think we would have this problem.
College Freshman,1,Smart and Classy – If I would explain the girls in Texas Woman's University with two words I would say smart and classy. Texas Woman's University girls are very smart and they push themselves to do better in their education. They really do not have time for their social time they are always in the library or dorms studying. They are classy because they dress nice and they talk properly. Texas Woman's University girls respect others as they would want to be respected. Guys in Texas Woman's University are very outgoing guys. They are friendly and flirty. Many of them are very immature but they do take responsibility for their education.
College Freshman,1,The Guys Are Not Attractive – All of the guys I've seen here at Texas Woman's University are NOT attractive. Most of them are gay so what does a girl here have at hooking up with them?
College Freshman,1,The New Gym Saves the Grade. We have a new recreational facility which is very nice compared to the previous one. That's all though. Our school lacks tons of excitement and constant vibrant energy. We have no sports so i would think we would invest in more fun activities outdoors and live bands or something but none of that really exist.
College Freshman,1,"All though the Campus has a less expensive parking permit ($70), the availibility of parking is only good if you get there at night. The parking lot across from the dorms has very few parking places and the only other choice from that is completely across campus. The fine for not having a sticker or the sticker being in the wrong spot can be anywhere from $40-$60. I've known people to have the fine for the same thing yet it cost differently. I also got in a wreck in the middle of the semester and when I went to get another sticker I had to pay another $70 for a new sticker even though I had one for the entire year. The people who work at the on campus police department are EXTREMELY rude and have attitudes the entire time you talk to them. Even getting a temporary parking sticker seemed to be an issue for them. When I told them about why I needed one because of the wreck, they commented ""I bet it was your fault""."
College Sophomore,1,"The Zoo – When I attended at Texas Women's Universtiy for my freshman year it was nice only because of the scenery but thats it.... there would be times where it was too noisy & there was always drama!! It almost felt like I were in a zoo full of women, hungry for men! after that experience i vowed never to live on campus ever again!"
College Junior,1,One room library on the Dallas Presby Campus. No where to study in private without interruption or conversations.
College Sophomore,1,"Transportation is free if your traveling locally with your student id,however, there's about two or three bus transfers to get to one destination. It cost five dollars to travel to your the city and there's no need for a bus to be mobile around campus"
College Freshman,1,"This School's All About Academics – Although I sometimes fear that one of my classmates might do something idiotic; this school's all about academics and seldom are there any cases about drugs. they're so strict here, no one can smoke in or even near the building. Drinking is permitted as long as the student is 21 and in his/her dorm."
College Sophomore,1,Not so great! If you live in Guinn or Stark Hall there is very little parking right by the dorms. You have to park across the street normally at the very back. It's not very good if you have stuff to carry or it's raining. Also if you live off campus you'll have a very hard time finding somewhere to park before class. TWU put all this money into building a new rec center when the school is growing rapidly and they should be caring more about other situations (including parking.)
College Sophomore,1,Need a parking garage that has a lot of levels because there is almost no place to park on this campus!  There is also very little parking for visitors.  The University of North Texas is another close campus and they do have a parking garage but it is not enough levels to accomodate all the people that even buy paking passes because it also allows other people who pay by the visit to park as well.
College Freshman,1,There definitely has to be lower standards at overwhelmingly popular girls school; and more diversity for girls. Example: delta delta delta. (Tri Delta)
College Student,1,I Am a Commuter – The best thing about living off campus is I do not have to deal with campus strictness. I just go to school to learn and I come home free from harass or any other tatcus.
College Sophomore,1,"A Car Is the Best Option – Public transportation in Denton is slim and very sluggish. Even though it is free for college students to ride the buses, the service and convenience is terrible. Without a car, it is very difficult to get around in Denton."
College Junior,1,"Public Transportation Is Expensive – Coming from Dallas.  It cost me $17 per day.  Whereas, the UNT students who has a student ID does not have to pay for transportation.

Due to the fact that I don't have my own transportation.  I have not experienced having to park on campus."
College Junior,1,"Apartments Are Expensive – Being that it's a College community, I expected the rent to be more reasonable and affordable, but I was unable to find a reasonable apartment.  The two  best option is to find a roommate, which sometimes can be a bit difficult to find.  The other is to look for a family who's willing to rent a room in their house to you."

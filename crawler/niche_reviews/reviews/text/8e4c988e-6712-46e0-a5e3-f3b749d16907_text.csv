Alum,5,I did not take any online classes so this is not applicable for my education. All classes taken were online.
Alum,5,I did not have to deal with this since I am a recent graduate. But I have heard good things from friends.
Alum,5,An amazing school with great opportunities. I love all the clubs and organizations available to make the large campus feel like a small community.
Alum,5,"No online classes taken at Cornell. However,  they remain a leader in technology and learning.    >>>>>>>>>"
Alum,5,"Cornell is the toughest school in the Ivy League. If you want to work hard; make strong lifelong connections; and have top employers and grad programs look at you as smart, tough, and inventive enough to be worth their investment, Cornell is your place. 

However, if you're planning to slough off because you made it to the Ivy League, Cornell will knock you off your feet. Cornellians work hard and play hard—but most work harder. Slackers don't graduate with a Cornell degree. But, if you want to be treated like a grad student and you want to know the every ""A"" you earned, you the hard way—by doing the work—Cornell is your place. 

That work ethic is derived from Cornell's working class origins. Ezra Cornell was a self-made man. An abolitionist, he founded an institution open to both Black students and women in an era when nearly every top college was segregated and single sex. If you want self-discovery and advancement surrounded by natural beauty, Cornell is your place. Onward."
Freshman,5,"It is the best experience. It is a very diverse community, and the professors and TAs are very friendly and easy to approach. Classes are well structured to cater to the need of each individual."
Freshman,5,"It is the best experience. It is a very diverse community, and the professors and TAs are very friendly and easy to approach. Classes are well structured to cater to the need of each individual."
Sophomore,5,"I love Cornell. I feel like I have really found a home there. The classes have been great, the food amazing, and the awesome people. Having joined greek life was also a great way for me to maintain a balance with school and having fun. 

The only thing Cornell needs to do better is when addressing financial aid..."
Sophomore,5,I love this school. It is beautiful and the resources are incredible. The workload is tough and the classes are hard but the opportunities are there to get help and achieve a lot.
Freshman,5,"The staff members and local community are very kind and welcoming. The academics are rigorous, but there are a lot of resources to get help."
Freshman,5,Online classes at Cornell were very straightforward and simple to understand. The professors have no problem giving help as long as you ask for it.
Freshman,5,As a freshman at CALS I can 100% say I LOVE it at Cornell. The atmosphere is amazing and everyone is really nice.
Freshman,5,"My experience has been great regarding the assistance and aid I received to make college possible. I am a first-gen student and the admissions officials have ensured that I receive aid every step of the way. I appreciate it a lot and wish more low-income, inner-city students had the opportunity I had."
Sophomore,5,"My time at Cornell - albeit short - has been grueling, challenging and transformative. Within a single year, I've learnt more than I could've imagined. I was encouraged to push past my comfort zone and grow academically, socially and as a person in general. One of my very first classes was about nano-science, where I not only expanded my knowledge on transistors, microscopy, microfluidics, and quantum mechanics, but also got hands-on experience with operating microscopes, growing carbon nanotubes, fabricating resistors and so much more. The class was Cornell in a nutshell: difficult but rewarding, academic but also applied. 
But by far, my favorite part about Cornell is the community that's always engaged in personal growth, discussing new and innovative ideas, and taking the initiative for social change. It was clear from the moment I stepped on campus that I was surrounded by people that would change the world and I'm excited to see where this takes me."
Alum,5,"Proud to be an alumnus! I have a great experience that set my starting point in my career. The campus was, and still is, beautiful.  I know that I received a top notch education and I can trust when I see Cornell on a resume that the person is hard working and critical thinking."
Alum,5,N/A - I took all of my classes in person. But their platforms were exceptional and I still utilize the portal when I need to interact with the university. Self service is easy and functional.
Freshman,5,"Professors were understanding and accommodating, and made online learning as engaging as possible through breakout rooms, comment threads, etc."
Freshman,5,A stimulating and diverse environment—the faculty and students are all beyond passionate and accepting.
Sophomore,5,"I really appreciated how well my professors transformed to virtual learning. They focused more on us and our situations. The changes made in the curriculum was able to help us learn the material better. For one of my nutrition classes, my professor gave us exams with real life situations. This made me understand the material better because I was applying the knowledge I had gained. My evolution class was well put into videos and team activities that I actually enjoyed watching. Implementing these changes made my learning better. It wasn't all about memorization. It was a new experience and my professors have done their best to make it a memorable experience. Now I am trying to take a general chemistry 2 course online which I need funding for. I am very excited to take the class but, coming from a low-income family and parents not having work for two months, financially I am not able to pay for the course. I am looking forward to continuing my online learning experience"
Sophomore,5,"I have absolutely loved my time at Cornell so far! What makes it so different from other schools is its idea of eclecticism: from its incorporation of all types of architecture on campus to the multitude of classes available, it truly is an institution where any person can find instruction in any study."
Niche User,5,Cornell University is one of the best education systems in the world where students from all over the world come to this University to learn and further educate themselves and the people around them.
Niche User,5,"I love the community and environment of Cornell. It made a perfect new home away from my family. There are some flaws (the rooms don't have a/c), but is an amazing place so far."
Freshman,5,I love Cornell's strong academic program and the flexibility given to students to study absolutely whatever they want. It is simply excellent!
Niche User,5,My brother and mother both attended and I have spent my entire life on this campus. It's definitely worth every penny.
Niche User,5,"An amazing school with amazing people, I couldn't imagine myself anywhere else. The teachers are all excellent and provide world-class education that is unmatched."
Freshman,5,"It was definitely worth applying. You’ll be met with a great crowd of people from all walks of life. The winter really isn’t that bad. It’s pretty nice actually. Cornell works hard, plays hard. I have learned so much already."
Freshman,5,"Cornell University is an amazing University with highly esteemed professors, plenty of research opportunities and so many class options that you will be left rethinking your schedule until the last day you can change classes. The people are so friendly and I have already found a wonderful group of friends. Everyone is amazing at what they do and each student can find their place at the school; whereas this may seem intimidating at first, overtime people will find their routine and groups to hang out with and see that everyone is there for a reason."
Junior,5,"The academics challenge me to work hard and improve myself. I am in an environment where everyone is supportive and focused. Even though it is a large school, you feel close knit within your own program."
Junior,5,"I'm a Junior studying Social Entrepreneurship through the Interdisciplinary Track. I love that Cornell gave me the freedom to build my own curriculum and provided me with countless resources to build a career from my experience. In my time here I've joined several pre-professional organizations, founded my own (Social Enterprise at Cornell), joined a Greek House, work with startups and student entrepreneurs daily, and have access to an extensive alumni network (who 9 times out of 10 are more than happy to help me in any of my career goals). There is so much Cornell has to offer beyond the classroom. Not to mention being able to live in the best college town in America (and some of the best food in the US!). Cornell is the perfect combination of an Ivy League education with a bit of a state-school feel; and you get to enjoy it all while feeling academically, socially, and professionally challenged."
Alum,5,"Academics was challenging, but overall, I love the activities and student life on campus! I met incredible friends who I still keep in touch with today. I also learned from top professors who greatly influence my aspirations and lifestyle today."
Sophomore,5,"I love Cornell. The work is definitely difficult, but whenever I needed help, there was always an advisor who would steer me in the right direction and who genuinely care about my success. It's super cold here though. :("
Freshman,5,"It's a good school and beautiful city life. Love walking around campus, very safe. One thing is that it's pretty competitive so there's a lot of stressed students."
Alum,5,"I graduated from Cornell (College of Engineering) in 2017. I'm not going to lie - it was a TOUGH four years, but the skills I learned are invaluable to me now. I met some amazing professors and students who are still part of my life. To prospective students - prepare to work hard, especially if you're in STEM!"
Niche User,5,"I had a wonderful time touring Cornell. The beautiful campus, location, and buildings are everything I look for in a college. I am especially thankful for our wonderful guide. She answered all of my questions and seemed to have a very genuine admiration for her school."
Senior,5,"I have loved my experience so far. All the professor are great, they really push you to perform the best that you can. Additionally the campus is beautiful and the food is great"
Sophomore,5,"You'll meet a lot of students and professors who constantly push you to be better on a daily basis. Winters are cold, challenging, and can feel extremely isolating, but you come out feeling stronger than before."
Sophomore,5,"Cornell has such a great and welcoming community. The campus is absolutely beautiful, from the antique buildings to the nature surrounding them."
Junior,5,It has that old and classic campus feel which pushes you to perform as best you can. Knowing the great minds that walked the halls and taught such as Richard Feynman is captivating.
Niche User,5,Cornell University is absolutely beautiful. They are very Eco friendly and very clean. The campus has students from all over and everyone is very nice.
Sophomore,5,"The campus is beautiful. The professors not only have a strong understanding of course material, but they also care deeply about their students. Many great places to study around campus, and beautiful weather in the fall and spring."
Alum,4,Cornell is an amazing academic institution with diverse  educational opportunities. There are majors available for every interest.
Alum,4,"It was the perfect choice for me, but not everyone would be perfectly happy there. The motto ""Any person, any study"" is technically fairly true today, but that does not mean that the road is free of obstacles, inequalities, and bureaucratic nonsense. Ithaca is beautiful, and many departments, professors, and courses are fantastic and make it worth it. Cornell is a diverse and competitive place; you will still have to work hard to find or make your own community, which will be the most important part."
Alum,4,"I only took a few online courses, and so I'm sure the system is different now. I found many professors to be adaptable, kind, and creative with teaching styles, which is necessary with online learning."
Freshman,4,"This school has a beautiful campus and does not feel small at all. Because of Covid-19, a lot of campus activities have been put on hold, but Cornell has made an effort to make the year feel as normal as possible. The classes and professors are amazing as well. The only thing I may say is that there is a lot of trouble in terms of dealing with the financial aid office and the cleanliness of some dorm lounges/kitchens."
Freshman,4,"It is troubling very often, but that is a shared experience by not just Cornell students, but students across the nation and the rest of the world. My professors have made their courses more interactive and appealing to be in/attend since it is easy to doze off or ignore class since it is just a screen."
Sophomore,4,Online learning as a whole could be improved but I think that Cornell is doing the best with what the circumstances are right now.
Freshman,4,Most of my classes are online and they're actually going pretty well. The professors are great and the schools has put things in place to make online learning easier.
Junior,4,"Overall an amazing school, I would not trade my experiences for anything. Academics are top notch and people are great. Even though we are a big school, I appreciate how all weed out classes give a lot of support through LSC tutors and extra support classes- you just need to actively find it. I love the city of Ithaca as well, super scenic and beautiful although I do wish it were closer to the city."
Sophomore,4,"I love it here. Campus is gorgeous, there is such a diverse array of classes one can take, and generally there are good resources for undergraduate students. It is in more of a rural location, but it really doesn't feel like it. There's always a lot to do.

The food is super good with a large variety of options. Housing can be hit or miss. The housing lottery isn't great, but the dorms are usually nice. Renting an apartment off campus is expensive though, due to a monopoly on prices."
Senior,4,"Overall I couldn't have asked for a better undergrad experience. I was able to grow as a person through many of the clubs and organizations I joined while attending. I've had some amazingly passionate professors teach me new content that has since shaped the way I see the world. 

However, the university is very competitive and rather large. It can be difficult finding your place there at first. And as a black student sometimes it can be difficult to access the same opportunities as your white peers. But of course, if you have grit you can succeed anywhere."
Sophomore,4,"I have not taken any official online courses with Cornell but all my courses were forced to go online due to the COVID-19 pandemic currently in the world. Despite having limited time and resources to provide high quality online courses, my professors managed the transition quite well. They uploaded recorded lectures on time, were quite lax with deadlines and even held virtual office hours to cater to our needs."
Freshman,4,"I just started at Cornell University, but it seems to be a very good school. I believe more of an effort should be made to diversify the school, and to listen to student demands/requests. Additionally there are many teachers that numerous students are not very fond of. However, Cornell does make an effort to teach students what they need for their future academic/career-related endeavors. There are also many clubs, teams, programs, etc. to keep students interested and involved in activities outside of their classes. Furthermore, the classes offered cover a vast range of interests and students take such opportunities to develop new interests and learn new things."
Alum,4,"The Cornell experience can be described by the often over used saying, ""We play hard, we work hard"". A campus full of adventures, Cornell University is the perfect place to become an adult. The mix of people, scenery, and opportunities is eye-opening. The people you meet are very different and many students are open to try new foods, cultures, and languages."
Sophomore,4,"Cornell is a great institution that offers a number of opportunities in the real world. My first year was so far the hardest year and that is mostly likely because I was not sure of what I want study. Also the fact that I was worried about my capabilities of doing well. However, I was able to figure out my interests. I am majoring in Biology and Society with a Nutrition and Health minor. I work at one of the campus libraries and the staff radiates warmth. I am involved with the community service fraternity. Most importantly, I have a supporting friend group. I have a family at Cornell who is always there for me. Professors show empathy and care about their students. College in general is a unique experience because this is the time you take to expand your horizons. Cornell works hard to create a beautiful college and real life experience for their students. I still have two more years at Cornell and I am excited to see what is upcoming in those two years."
Sophomore,4,Cornell is a very academically rigorous school and the students can be equally competitive however there are many things that balance it out. There are at student run organizations to participate in as well as varsity and club sports. Despite the many different types of students on campus they all have one thing in common: they are all proud to be Cornellians. Go Bears!
Sophomore,4,Most professors did their best to accommodate students. It was difficult to transfer such rigorous classes online and only have access to office hours over zoom. However I believe that the professors worked out some of the issues over the remaining course of the semester. Some of my professors switched exams to take-home exams whereas some had the exams taken over zoom. I found take-home exams to be a lot more convenient and fair because not all students have access to locations at home where they can study and focus so it levels the playing field for all of the students. I believe that the courses that had zoom finals could have done a lot more to accommodate students in this difficult time and could have had more lenient grading.
Sophomore,4,"A large breath of subjects and learning styles are available at Cornell. While it is an Ivy League university, it doesn't quite have to inflated ego of the others and students there have to work hard in order to earn a good grade. While it certainly is a difficult school, Cornell teaches you how to work hard, organize your projects, and build your independence. If you don't mind the cold and the rural campus, Cornell is the school for you."
Freshman,4,"There's lots of interesting classes and opportunities if you just look for them, and Ithaca is beautiful. Downside is you might not have time to do everything you want depending on course loads and the fact that Cornell charges for every little thing."
Freshman,4,"It a huge campus with great diversity. You get to meet people all over the world and learn cultures and lifestyles. The academics at Cornell is very hard not comparable to my high school experience. You have to invest a lot of time preview and review the class works also have to put a lot of effort for assignments to earn satisfying grades. Even though the academic is really hard, you learn a lot from it."
Niche User,4,"Great school, one hundred percent recommend going there if you want a good education. Not going to lie though, it is quite cold there throughout the winter and the greek life is a large part of the college."
Freshman,4,Love the campus. Amazing teachers and soooo many activities to do! One thing I would improve is that there's noAC in some dorms.
Freshman,4,"Cornell University is a great place to study, especially for those interested in conducting research or getting involved in extracurricular activities. Overall, the food is great and when you find a good group of people, the large student body has a place for you."
Freshman,4,"As a freshman, attending Cornell University for the first semester was a bit overwhelming. What can help a student out in this situation, is the multitude of help one can receive. First-year students have many resources available and it is important to take advantage of those. Though some lectures may seem huge, Cornell quickly felt like home thanks to the welcoming atmosphere. The four years you spend at this college will be full of amazing memories of studying in one of the many libraries, eating dinner with your friends at the amazing dining halls, or attending classes and participating in activities and clubs."
Junior,4,"Cornell University has an amazing variety of majors and courses. There are numerous opportunities for learning and growth, in terms of education, career, and personal life. The school could improve communication between advisors and students, so that students may find these resources more easily."
Sophomore,4,"Cornell is an amazing blend of people from various cultures who have come to one place for the purpose of pursing an education. I come from a very small town in Maryland. Coming to Cornell has allowed me to experience different cultures in lots of new ways.  However, I believe that Cornell could work on accepting people not only from diverse backgrounds, but also from various socioeconomic statuses. I am middle class. My father is a principle of and I am grateful to have a well-supported family. Many Cornell students are in top-earning families. Currently, I am taking a class called “Controversies About Inequality.” I have learned that Cornell accepts more students from the top 1% than they are from the bottom 1%, and this cycle continues. I would like to point out that Cornell is very aware of this issue and is taking steps towards leveling the playing field for both high and low income students. And the food is absolutely amazing here, so that’s a huge plus!"
Alum,4,"I loved the range and extreme diversity of classes offered; from a class about mushrooms to one about humanitarian efforts in Darfur, Cornell offers something to satisfy any person, regardless of his or her major."
Sophomore,4,The transition into college life as a freshman was very difficult. I did not feel that Cornell did a good job of getting students acclimated to college life and making this campus feel like home. Greek life on campus is amazing. The community is so supportive and gives students a place to call home on this large campus.
Junior,4,"Cornell is truly a great school.  The academics are excellent and people aren't afraid to help on homework or geek out on whatever. There are clubs for everything and generally the student body is very involved, there isn't much else in Ithaca.  Things from business clubs, project teams, Greek life and more tend to be needlessly exclusive which can contribute to the general competitive culture."
Graduate Student,4,I am a graduate student at Cornell. I really like its campus and high academic quality. the competition atmosphere makes you to study hard what leads to success.
Niche User,4,Attending Cornell really made a difference in the way I saw life as a whole. Their study abroad program is a very good way to learn about different majors.
Sophomore,4,"I love the campus and the level of education. I found it intimidating to try and make connections with professors in large lectures, but I would find that at any university. I enjoyed freshman dorm life and food is above average with great diversity and options."
Sophomore,4,"I'm a rising sophomore and have come to love Cornell in the past year. Although it can be very stressful at times, everything from the food, atmosphere and education is of the highest quality. The big community can make anyone feel welcome as you have the opportunity to explore any/all of your interests!"
Sophomore,4,"Cornell has been a challenge for me but in the best way possible. Academics are difficult, but I am surrounded by people who always puh me to expand how I think and challenge me to do better."
Sophomore,4,"Beautiful campus, strong study environment. It is very lively because of the large student population. Academics are very rigorous, especially for STEM majors. Professors can be helpful if you're willing to go to them on your own time. Exams and workload can take some getting used to, especially when everyone around you seems to pick it up so easily. There is a lot do in Ithaca but you'll find campus to be sufficiently stimulating most of the time. Some good places to eat in Collegetown but a lot of the restaurants are downtown. It is a large campus so a lot of Freshmen take the bus the first year since it's free but it is fairly walkable."
Freshman,4,"As an incoming freshman, I felt immediately welcomed to the campus. It was my favorite of all the Ivys."
Freshman,4,"Academics are excellent, but the social atmosphere is cliquey and lowkey unwelcoming until you find your group."
Senior,4,Academically rigorous but some departments are better than others. Pretty isolated campus but beautiful area.
Alum,4,Had a great experience here in undergrad from a quality of learning perspective. I originally went in premed and I don't feel like the school really provided enough support to the premed students maybe because of the number.
Junior,4,Like the resources and the people there. The course work is very rigorous and stimulating. I've learned a lot here.
Freshman,4,"Prepare to work hard - especially if you're in STEM.  As an engineering major my life here is a never ending cycle of attending classes, working in lab, engineering project team related work, doing homework and crashing/going to bed at 1-2AM.  It may seem rough to the outsider but if you're coming from a challenging high school (as I did) its a relatively seamless transition and I am infinitely happier here at Cornell!  There is constantly something new happening from the range of amazing speakers visiting, cool things your classmates are creating/doing, Ithaca's quirky charm, your eccentric professors , etc...  I came here expecting the competition to be intense and thank goodness its not ; there's a sense of general comradery amongst engineers.  The motto 'any person, any study' is really true.  They have just about every major allowing allotting the opportunity to study a great variety of fields.  Fair warning about Ithaca; it gets REALLY cold!  Invest in a warm coat!"
Niche User,4,"Cornell gave me a sense of family and feeling connected. My application process went smoothly, I was well informed, and was given many opportunities for help."
Freshman,4,"Cornell's policies towards cancelling classes in inconvenient weather is not very good, but otherwise the school offers a plethora of classes and opportunities for students."
Freshman,4,"Cornell is a very rigorous school set on a beautiful campus. What attracted me to this university was the specificity of my major, Fashion Design Management. I think it's really interesting and enriching the focus Cornell puts on work experience. The hotel school has its own hotel that they can practice on, the fashion department has a costume collection students can help curate, etc. This leads to further knowledge and insight into the respective industries students want to go into in the future."
Alum,4,"Amazing education and opportunity, diverse student population, vast resources. No attention to mental health, run like a business, conflict of interests financially."
Junior,4,"Overall, I loved the learning environment at Cornell. The material covered was thought-provoking and challenging, while the professors were passionate about their students. The social life is also pretty great. With a beautiful campus, and convenient off-campus housing, I enjoyed all of my years attending university at Cornell. The only downsides to this place would be the cost of attendance and the distance from any major city. However, these drawbacks were definitely worth it in order to obtain such a prestigious degree."
Freshman,4,"Cornell's beautiful campus is always bustling. Although the presence of Ivy League elitism is somewhat detectable, the education and student experience is great."
Sophomore,4,"The professors here are great - consistently available with office hours/appointments.
One thing I really like about campus is that everything is within walking distance. Freshmen get free bus passes but as a sophomore I don't, so having all of my classes within a 20 minute walk is great."
Alum,4,"I truly enjoyed my time at Cornell. It is beautiful, made great friends, and is very academically challenging. I took one star off because the faculty advisers need some assistance and training on accountability."
Freshman,4,"Cornell offers a lot of opportunities to its students, and the workload is honestly what you make of it. If you can manage your time well, you won't have trouble doing well. The professors are all super patient and there's a huge diversity here."
Junior,4,"Incredibly fruitful experience. I find the culture however,  to be very anxiety-inducing and restricting to creative minds."
Junior,4,I love Cornell University. This place is the most challenging and interesting university environment. I am consistently pushed to do my best here and surrounded by excellent educators and resources to help me achieve my goals. Campus is beautiful. The only thing in need of change is the university culture at this Ivy League institution centers heavily on competition; it is easy to get overwhelmed in this environment. More focus should be placed on mental health services here.
Sophomore,4,"I love the environment and community, and the hidden cafes and delis are a delight to find and sample. The slope, rivers, gorges, lakes, waterfalls, and trails are soothing when the semester gets hectic, and there's no shortage of available activities, clubs, events, and things to do on campus! The winter is harsh but its gorgeous to see, and the overall environment is very friendly."
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the numerous activities the students can partake in. The city is also very beautiful in the spring. On a negative note though, it’s a hilly environment so there will be a lot of climbing up and down to get around. Depression is also a major problem at Cornell. The system of median-grading in many of the classes results in a rather competitive environment, which doesn’t help that problem."
Niche User,4,"Great campus, great food, great atmosphere, and great education to be had. Wished it was cheaper or at least offered some sort of scholarships."
Sophomore,4,"Although predominately white, Cornell does seem to make an effort in terms of diversity. The campus is beautiful and the people are very welcoming. Financially, however, it can be a struggle."
Alum,4,Cornell was stressful at times but I had support for friends and faculty who helped me succeed during my four years.
Alum,4,"Cornell University offers a campus life with all the bells and whistles - the impressive dining halls with it's own ice cream from Cornell Dairy, appealing gothic architecture, and a landscape echoing the paintings of the Hudson River School in an isolated Ithaca, New York. The academic offering is equally impressive and expansive as it offers the top education from architecture to agriculture, engineering to hotel administration. The education is practical and skill-based and students can easily take classes that peak his or her interest outside of his or her major, which is a great asset. The large student body, however, does make popular lecture classes feel impersonal due to the large class sizes which would be the opposite at a smaller liberal arts college. There is also a strong sense of conformity in student social life as the majority of the student body joins sororities and fraternities, which makes it difficult for more individual-minded students to make friends."
Graduate Student,4,Cornell University is located in a gorgeous town in upstate NY and experiences all 4 seasons! Not only is the campus beautiful but so are the surrounding areas. The academic courses are demanding and require a lot of your time as a student but there are many things you can do on campus to balance the rigor of the courses. Overall Cornell is an Ivy League institution and that status allows the university to offer its students a lot of unique experiences that other colleges cannot.
Junior,4,"Cornell is a community of brilliant people with varied interests. I have met talented students in many different disciplines through the extracurricular activities available on campus.

The work at Cornell is difficult; however, the student body is very collaborative. Students work together late into the night to complete major projects, and at the end of a course the knowledge you gain prepares you well for the professional world.

Especially in the engineering program, there are many opportunities to be involved in student organizations that offer technical experience and hands-on work applicable to roles you might accept for an internship or full time job. While job-hunting can be competitive, career services on campus ensure every Cornell student is prepared well to interview with their dream company.

Overall Cornell is a great experience, despite the long winters. The vibrant social scene also makes it easy to forget that you are far from any major city."
Sophomore,4,"I was one of various students from University of Puerto Rico chosen to form a part of the Hurricane Maria Relief Program. I had an amazing once in a life time experience where I enriched my vocabulary and academic knowledge. Also, had so much fun in all the activities coordinated through out the year. Cornell University is in Ithaca, NY where unfortunately there is not much to do, but if you make a nice group of friends you will be all right."
Sophomore,2,I'm really disappointed with the online learning experience at Cornell. Having to pay full tuition for online is not worth it. They should refund all of the students doing online. I don't believe there is a difference between Cornell online and any other online school.
Freshman,2,"The online curriculum was not extensively planned out before the pandemic emergency. For that reason, my online learning experience wasn't the best and professors were often lenient with course work. It was also difficult to participate academically from back home, which wasn't the best learning environment either."
Freshman,2,"For Engineering, based on my research of curriculum, interviewing instructors and students, and cost; Cornell is overrated in almost every category.  Potentials would be far better with Univ of Penn or University of Michigan."
Senior,2,"While the university has great resources , they are not necessarily available to students.  Since it is a research university, many professors do not have a primary focus on teaching.  Each department varies greatly.  Some departments are small and a student can grow tremendously throughout their years there, while others have students and professors taking the easy way out--defeating the purpose of the institution."
College Junior,2,"Students at Cornell generally prioritize academics over athletics. Cornell is in the Ivy League, which means it can't give scholarships for athletic performance. For this reason, varsity athletes are first and foremost students. Most students do not regularly attend sporting events or even know when or where they are. 

The exception to this is Cornell Big Red Hockey. Students fill Lynah Rink every home game and enthusiastically cheer on their home team. Hockey games are full of traditions and rituals, such as throwing fish on the ice every time we play Harvard. It is highly encouraged that everyone attend at least one hockey game during their time at Cornell"
College Senior,2,"If you are in the gothic buildings on West campus like I was, its just bad period. But the dorms on north for freshman can be quite nice."
College Senior,2,"They are everywhere and unavoidable. If you don't plan on joining, they will still affect your life at Cornell in many ways."
College Freshman,2,Greek life is very prevalent. It rules the school.
College Junior,2,"It's Cornell so it's obviously not a party school, but alcohol is very prevalent."
College Freshman,2,"I am not personally involved in Greek life at Cornell, for various reasons that I have pondered over for some time. I have observed Greek life to be cliquey and also to cause social and even legal problems on campus or just between students in general. I know for a fact that hazing is common in the Greek life at Cornell, due to the fact that some people I know in fraternities have confessed to being hazed, quite badly in fact. Greek life members lie, cheat, act like sexual predators, put down others, objectify women, use hardcore drugs, and otherwise influence their members and those around them to do wrong. I am very unimpressed with the social impact of Greek life on our campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The teams are all pretty bad except for Track, Wrestling, and Hockey"
College Freshman,2,"Too much work, very exhausting, not enough sleep, and difficult classes"
Recent Alumnus,2,"Greek life is huge at Cornell, but non-Greeks don't regard of Greeks too highly. There are definitely nice people in the Greek system, but there is a negative stereotype that the non-Greeks put to Greeks at Cornell. As a non-Greek, I might have a biased opinion towards this topic."
College Sophomore,2,"There is school spirit for certain sports, and none for others."
College Sophomore,2,TCAT is the worst in the world. Beautiful area
College Sophomore,2,"From what I understand, people will start signing leases in the fall of their sophomore year in order to get a place for their junior year. You need to make friends early and be ready to jump into things. Things can get expensive and overwhelming.

Many people will choose to live in a house associated with their fraternity or sorority if they take part in Greek Life."
College Sophomore,2,"If you happen to get lucky with Cornell's lottery system for housing, or if you have a friend that is lucky, then the housing process can be okay. From what I understand, trying to secure a spot on West Campus is extremely stressful. I was one of the unlucky ones who will have to live on North Campus for their sophomore year (primarily freshman.) Cornell guarantees housing for two years, but the ""good"" or ""desirable"" housing is out of reach for most."
College Freshman,2,"I always hear great things about Cornell's financial aid, but they really screwed my family over. We are paying nearly full price and my family certainly is not rich. They take into account things that really have no influence over the actual amount of money we have or are able to pay, such as the value of our house (which we built ourselves) and the amount of property we have (which we acquired 20 years ago). The financial aid office was extremely unhelpful when my dad went to talk to them about the aid and basically just told him to get another mortgage and forget about retirement."
College Sophomore,2,"Last thing: Cornell offers the worst soap! I pay so much money; I want higher quality bathroom soap, not the shi**y pink and white stuff this school offers! My hands never feel clean! YUCK!"
College Sophomore,2,"The party scene is great, if you like Greek Life. Outside of Greek Life, there are very few parties. Yeah, even if you're in Collegetown, the parties they hold are usually held by annexes.

Additionally, the party scene has a terrible impact on the student experience, in my opinion. It promotes a rape culture, machisimoism, and binge drinking. From what I see as an outsider, parties don't happen at Cornell unless there's alcohol, and lots of it. Really, if there is no alcohol, or if you can't do an all-you-can-drink fest, students will get bored quickly. The Center for Jewish Living on Friday nights is a good example.

The university administration is also completely delusional in terms of how they think it is appropriate and efficacious to deal with parties. Yes, they got rid of hazing, but binge drinking still happens all the time, and you'll find Cayuga Medical Center lined with students on the weekend. Yeah, it's college, go binge drinking! No, that's a terrible attitude to hold, because binge drinking often is (1) just as bad as smoking a pack of cigarettes a day, (2) ruins parties for lots of other people, (3) makes for an unsafe and rape-friendly culture, and (4) is boring!

All in all, the party scene is not great, since it focuses so heavily on alcohol and sex, and it doesn't feel like you can go to a party and just dance and have alternative forms of fun."
College Sophomore,2,"There is inequity in campus housing. The freshman dormitories are new and well-maintained, but even then, it depends on where you live. My freshman dormitory was good, but some dormitories, like Jameson, squeeze four students in one room.The Collegetown dormitories have very few amenities, and the community life is very poor. Overall, not great in terms of dormitories.

The housing process is a mess. After your freshman year, the likelihood of you getting a housing match that you want is truly up in the air. Good luck. Also, add in the fact that living off-campus is not at all managed by Cornell, which means that apartment landlords overcharge because demand for apartments is so high, and demand is so inelastic! Really, take whatever housing you get and cherish it, because unless you live in a fraternity or sorority in which you chose to live there, or you get lucky, you're sh*t out of luck.

Social life, as you can infer, depends on luck. You can get placed in a great dormitory with a resident advisor who involves and engages students and a great community culture, or you can get placed in a dormitory in which students don't talk to each other.

All in all, campus housing could be so much better, but the housing administration is not particularly competent."
College Senior,2,"Collegetown is constantly closing down businesses due to the sky-high rent. Many restaurants near campus are asian-inspired (e.g. Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian). The rest is typically unhealthy (e.g. pizza, burgers)."
College Senior,2,"Many students are extremely interested in their social standings, wealth, and material objects. The social life feels to be very cut-throat and not friendly, especially for someone from the laid back west coast."
College Freshman,2,I wish I chose to stay closer to home.
College Freshman,2,It is too rural. NO big shopping malls.
College Freshman,2,It is loud and smelly.
College Sophomore,2,The only school in the Ivy League that does NOT guarantee housing.  Housing is only guaranteed for Freshmen and Sophomores after which point you are forced to move off campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Other than lax and hockey, our sports are terrible."
College Senior,2,"The best part is the cleaning. Otherwise, it's awful. the rooms are tiny, the space is OLD OLD OLD. Two years that i was in campus housing, I had to deal with abestos warnings almost every day! that's unsettling."
College Sophomore,2,It's not the best quality and the landlords have students paying excessive amounts of money for rent even though their properties are trash.
College Sophomore,2,They're assholes whose parents paid their way into Cornell.
College Freshman,2,No one really cares about much besides the hockey team.
College Freshman,2,"Dorm security is VERY lax.  All it takes is one swipe of an ID card to get in; there's no actual human security presence, and if you're standing outside a dorm someone will usually let you in."
College Senior,2,"Many frats have been closed down recently because the university is cracking down on hazing. And the sororities are so cliquey. All the girls look the same, honestly. Greek life is pretty much just all about drinking and trying to get laid."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Ithaca is an expensive place to rent, but that is because of the property taxes. The demand for housing is super high, so landlords have no need to make the places nice, because people NEED to buy them, especially since you are not guarenteed on-campus housing once you are a junior."
College Senior,2,Ithaca weather is brutal and can definitely bring you down
College Freshman,2,Pretty much the middle of nowhere!
College Freshman,2,Cold for 6 months from October to April.
Recent Alumnus,2,"During the spring and summer, it's great. There was an unusually warm fall. As an Arizonan, I will definitely say that the winter ruined it for me. Too cold."
Recent Alumnus,2,"The bar scene is small and is mostly located downtown and in Collegetown. Many of the bars feature bad music, sticky floors, and unpleasantly large crowds stuffed into tiny spaces."
College Junior,2,CUPD tends to want to give out tickets for almost anything.
College Junior,2,"I'm sad to say people don't come to Cornell to care about sports. Men's Lacrosse and Hockey are pretty big/good. But Football is bad, and there is relatively no tailgating."
College Freshman,2,The weather here is not the best.
College Sophomore,2,"Housing is awful here. Apartment rent is most definitely overpriced - anywhere from $900 to $1100 per month per person, if lucky $800. I would like to continue to live in university dorms, but they have no rooms for upperclassmen."
College Sophomore,2,Have to pick housing quickly at the beginning of the year and its usually expensive.
College Sophomore,2,"The weather is pretty bad because it's cold for a large portion of the year, and grey skies along with that. There isn't too much snow but it definitely stays winter from about November to April. Last year there was snow in early May, which was ridiculous but very fitting to Cornell. You can work around it though and it's fine, it just isn't wonderful."
College Sophomore,2,West campus sucks. its full of nonsocial kids and expensive
College Sophomore,2,Most of the social scene revolves around going to house parties or sororities/fraternities and drinking.
College Sophomore,2,The school is very willing to help with finding off-campus housing but there doesn't seem to be enough supply to meet the demand for off-campus housing.
College Freshman,2,Cold and windy and not pleasant winters.
College Senior,2,Strict and cracking down on underage drinking.
College Senior,2,Not enough parking and it's too expensive. 
College Sophomore,2,"These nerds don't really know what a good party looks like. Frats are LAME, but there is always something going on."
College Sophomore,2,Campus housing is incredibly expensive and limited.
College Freshman,2,Off Campus is very expensive for students and every fall people are already filling out leases for the next school year. You are guaranteed on-campus housing Freshman and Sophomore year. 
College Senior,2,"Ithaca is COLD, snowy, and fickle. I have literally experienced days where it is 75 and sunny one day, and then 30 and snowing the next day. That's not an exaggeration either, nor is it atypical."
College Senior,2,"Cornell is known as one of the greenest campuses in America. That being said, parking on campus is intentionally made difficult to encourage walking, biking, public transportation, etc. However, MANY people of campus have cars, so definitely feel free to bring one if you do have it. It's so much more convenient to have one, especially if you plan on living off campus. There are paid parking spots in a few places on campus that charge money per 15 minutes, which can get expensive. But if you have to turn in a paper due at 8:00am and you woke up at 7:50am, having a car can be godsend. Also, free parking after 5:00pm!!"
College Freshman,2,Freshman do not need a car. There's basically zero parking on central campus by all of your classes. Virtually everybody walks to class from North or Collegetown and it's not a bad walk. The bus system is perfectly suitable for campus travel.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There's not really a ""nightlife"" besides the frat houses. There are 2 bars near campus and they're almost always crowded"
College Freshman,2,Way more upper class republican Caucasian people than anything else.
Alum,1,"Not worth a word
Poor Student's Mental Health Program 
You start dying once get in
Run away and look for University that embrace who you are"
Alum,1,"Not worth a word

Alum,1,This is not a safe campus. I have zero idea how anyone can ignore this fact or say otherwise in good conscience. The professors are okay if they don't decide to cop major attitudes. The students I could mostly live without. They're generally so competitive it's sickening and entirely counterproductive and unacademic. I both attended and taught at this university and I definitely wouldn't recommend it although it has some positive things to offer if you can get around the safety issues and unbelievably toxic attitudes.
College Junior,1,"After spending almost three years here, I can conclude that I either wish I worked harder in high school so I could go to Brown or Penn, or slacked off more so I could go to Michigan"
College Junior,1,"Greek life runs the social scene and is honestly pretty miserable, but we're in Ithaca... What else is there to do?"
Recent Alumnus,1,"About a third of students are involved in Greek life. It colors much of the schools social scene, and has caused some problems in the past. Of note, there have been multiple severe injuries and a hazing-related death in the fraternity system over the past few years."
College Freshman,1,Too much work for not enough recognition; difficult classes
College Freshman,1,Extremely difficult to get them to increase your financial aid budget.
College Sophomore,1,"I had an indifferent viewpoint toward Greek life, but now I despise it. Note this review ONLY applies to social Greek life and is my OPINION.

Greek life adds very little to Cornell. The philanthropy they carry out is often for publicity stunts, and they do very little philanthropy and volunteering. The students very rarely care much about academics and are only concerned about sliding by classes with good grades and getting good jobs. Greek life is cultish and cliquey, and I find that if you're not part of Greek life, you may be able to get into parties, but you'll generally be excluded from the Greek community as a whole. And even the social scene they offer is very limited and almost always revolves around alcohol. I'm sorry, but wine tours? How is that fun!?! Because you go and get blasted out of your minds! Although Greek life states that it exists for academics, philanthropy, and fraternity, I, as stated above, find that it's the complete opposite.

The worst part about the issue with Greek life is that it seems that the administration ignores the woes of Greek life because students in Greek life will end up being the most generous donors to Cornell after they graduate. Yes, I've said it: The reason why I think the administration is often lenient (note: NOT always lenient, especially with regard to hazing, thank the Lord) toward Greek life is because Greek life becomes a symbol of fraternity to Cornell students, which increases the likelihood that they'll enjoy their experience at Cornell and want to give back. So I think that the administration actually discriminates toward Greek organizations.

Additionally, what Greek life does do can be accomplished with through on-campus housing. Philanthropy? Look into the PSC (doubt many Greek life even know what it is). Fraternity? West Campus, although it may not be the best fit for many students, is plenty fraternal. Academics? Honors and preprofessional fraternities.

I'd say more, but no more space."
College Senior,1,"Unfortunately, our sporting events are very poorly attended. While we do have many talented athletes, they are not largely supported by the campus."
College Senior,1,"SO OVERPRICED. For bad amenities, and horrible locations for transportation. I am dreading the winter season because I am scared the place will not be shoveled at all and I know a girl who died last year from slipping on the ice on the way to class. That's just ridiculous."
College Freshman,1,Dont make any mistakes the first time because they ignore corrections. Speak with customer service as they are slightly more helpful.  I wish I had better advice but my experience is that the office is mean and not willing to help. Keep all copies of emails and watch for improprieties.
College Junior,1,"Terrible process, you have to sign leases a year in advance, the prices are absolutely outrageous, and it is a hassle to find a house."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Fall last 2 weeks, spring last two weeks. The entire school year is winter. Snow starts on Halloween, and ends on the last week of classes. It is really really really cold (-30 F), and grey most of the time."
Recent Alumnus,1,"IF you do not live somewhere with a parking lot, then you will almost certainly get a ticket at some point. In C-Town it gets very hard to find parking, about 1% of it has parking laws that actually allow you to park during reasonable times. They are basically out to get you."
College Freshman,1,I did not receive aid even though I need it and went to the office.
College Freshman,1,It rains a lot and snows a lot. Gets super cold. It really nice late spring/summer/early fall though.
College Freshman,1,"ITHACATING. Our weather here is horrible. Rains, snows and hails all in the same day, and then suddenly turns sunny. It's insane and makes me sick, literally, quite often."
College Junior,1,"I'll be honest, it sucks. It's been snowing and cold ever since thanksgiving. It wasn't that bad the previous two years though, so could just be a bad winter."
College Sophomore,1,"It's fine that apartments are the typical crappy college student apartments, but their costs are ridiculous- if you're looking for a 3 or 4 person apartment, don't expect anything under $750 a month even if it's a falling apart s***hole. They know they have a monopoly since dorms are expensive, and there are no real regulations on prices or when people can start renting so it's a mad rush for crappy apartments that there aren't enough of at the start of each year."
College Sophomore,1,The winters in this place make me want to leave immediately and never return.
College Senior,1,The weather usually sucks but nice in the summer. 
College Freshman,1,There is no point of having a car on campus. The buses run all the time and there are free bus rides for all incoming freshman and first years. 
College Junior,1,"Cornell is notorious for the horrible parking. Whether it's on-campus or just off of it in Collegetown, you'll have a hell of a time finding decent parking. It's always terribly lacking, and the rates are almost as much as New York City. To get permits costs a lot of money, and people renting spots out take advantage of the necessity. "
College Sophomore,1,Off campus housing is a disaster. Collegetown renting is a oligopoly and a pain to deal with. Landlords are difficult and housing is insanely expensive. 
College Junior,1,$700 to park on campus!!!! That is insane!!! You can just find a spot a little off campus and walk. But those spots are hard to find also because they fill up so fast. And do not park somewhere you should not be. You will get a ticket.
College Junior,1,"I do not like the setup of academics here. I have 3 classes over 100 students and two over 500. That is ridiculous. You never meet the teachers. Also, the work is annoying. Nothing is hard here except managing time. My community college I transferred from had harder exams and I learned more there. Luckily I do not need to study much but people take their grades way too seriously. I have heard of students bragging about who has pulled the most all nighters. If you go to Cornell make sure you're doing something you love with all your heart, or else it's not worth it."
College Senior,1,"The forecast says it's sunny and warm, but it's really snowing and freezing.  It is cloudy more often than not during the academic year, but when it is nice out, everyone is out!  Get used to walking in the snow/wind/rain uphill...both ways.  One must search for the weather's redeeming qualities."
College Junior,1,"Greek life is very big in Cornell, and therefore the drug scene is also pretty big. Drinking is an extremely popular activity, and alcohol visibility is high in areas near frat houses and around campus, with varying degrees, from Wednesday night to Saturday night."
College Junior,1,"It's basically winter time from the end of October to the end of April. It snows a lot, but classes never get cancelled. When it's not snowing, it rains a lot. But I didn't give the weather an F because when it IS nice outside, it is absolutely beautiful."
College Senior,1,Parking on campus sucks. The passes are very expensive and it's impossible to find a spot. You're better off taking the bus or riding your bike to class if you live farther away.
Recent Alumnus,1,"nearly impossible. You have to pay meters all the time and the ""Parking PD"" will slap a ticket on your car the second your meter is up."
College Sophomore,1,"It's fairly miserable here weather-wise.  It's gray and very cold for a vast majority of the school year, which, even when it's not precipitating, makes walks around campus hellish and contributes to temporary depression for many students."
College Freshman,1,Parking is available near the dorms but is not reliable for getting to class on time. Recommend walking or using public transportation for getting to class
College Freshman,1,"I have yet to meet a student who drives to class. Public transportation is readily available and reliable, and much cheaper than obtaining a parking permit and maintaining a car. Parking is almost always reserved to farther than normal walking distance due to space problems on campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,Have Applied- Got Nothing – I am a junior..I have applied three times (every year) and have yet to receive a cent.
College Junior,1,"Nowhere to Park – Even if you are just visiting or need to park somewhere for a 20 minute meeting with a professor, you will probably need a $500 dollar permit or you will get a ticket."
College Freshman,1,"Epic Winters – The only reason I didn't give this an F is because I hear the summers are really beautiful here. Other than that the winters are notoriously bad. Im quote on quote ""used to the cold"" but that doesnt help when u have to go dinner in it and walk to class in it when the TCAT bus gets too full to pick up more people. The weather is also known to be bipolar. IN one week I saw rain, hail, snow, and sunny skies."
College Sophomore,1,Too Grey – Too much snow and too much rain makes the campus grey and sad most of the year.
College Senior,1,"The Worst – Good luck. Parking is a nightmare, the permits are so expensive running at about $900/semester and you will always get a ticket if you're parked illegally."

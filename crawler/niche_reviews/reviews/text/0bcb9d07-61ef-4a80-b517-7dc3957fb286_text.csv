Junior,5,"Penn State Altoona is truly a special community. The smaller class sizes allow for personal connections with professors and students. Even as a commuter, I am immersed in various activities and opportunities provided. Everyone is so welcoming and the beautiful scenery makes me feel even more relaxed walking from class to class. I love going to Penn State Altoona and I highly recommend it."
Junior,5,Great experience! I am in the accelerated nursing program and love it. I plan to apply to the Nursing Master's program offered here once I graduate.
Junior,5,I have not taken any course online yet. I am scheduled to take my first online course this coming Fall.
Sophomore,5,Excellent campus. Very reputable school. Convenient distance from State College. Knowledgeable and helpful teachers. Excellent diversity. Not too many parties. Campus food is good quality and has several options. Housing is nice and clean and spacious.
Sophomore,5,Living on campus allowed me to meet great friends who were also in the same major as myself. Now I have some great study buddies!
Senior,5,"I haven't started my college years there yet, but by the looks of it and all it's going to be great."
Junior,5,I spent most of my college carrier at University Park which is a nice campus. I preferred the Altoona campus however. It had smaller class sizes and commuting/ getting from class to class was easier.
Freshman,5,I loved the homey atmosphere and everyone here feels like family. I even got a job at Port Sky and I can say that that is where I met most of my friends.
Senior,5,"Penn State Altoona offers an extremely high-quality education, with excellent professors and small class sizes."
Niche User,5,"I like the whole experience they provide from the degree paths, campus location, to the professors and student life."
Sophomore,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful and the students and staff are all such nice people. The professors are very helpful and there are plenty ways to get involved on campus. From all the different clubs, sports, events, and on campus life there are a lot of different ways to make friends."
Freshman,5,I love Penn State Altoona because of the small campus. The classes are smaller than most which allows a lot of one-on-one time with the professor. Most of my professor's have been very helpful and caring as well. It is clear they truly want you to succeed.
Sophomore,5,I like how the small class sizes lead to you really knowing your professors. They will recommend research to you and write recommendation letter for you. Getting to know people at this campus is very easy. I would have more places to eat closer to campus if you don’t have a car it is more difficult to eat off campus.
Niche User,5,The campus itself is beautiful. The staff and students are very welcoming and will help with any questions or concerns. Everyone is there to help you succeed and continue your education. The class sizes are small and the professors will be on a name to name basis with you. I wouldn't change anything.
Freshman,5,"I love the campus and classes sizes, it really allows you to build good relationships with your professors. There are so many sports and club opportunities as well. The possibilities for success are truly endless here."
Freshman,5,"All staff is very helpful and supportive with both academic and life circumstances. They provide access to different websites allowing you to set up appointments with professors and advisors, as well as places to store documents and other information for classes."
Sophomore,5,"Penn State Altoona felt like home from day one, from walking on campus during my first tour at Penn State Altoona to leaving after finals week in the spring. The campus is beautiful with the huge pond in the center of campus and landscaping during every season of the year. Not to mention if you're an animal lover, there are plenty of ducks around campus that I guarantee you will see walking between every class.  The students are very kind and everyone treats you with respect, including the professors. The teachers are very understanding and will give you the attention that larger campus professors wouldn't. If you are looking for a relaxing and smaller campus Penn State Altoona is definitely the school for you!"
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Penn state Altoona was way better than I expected. It was so easy meeting friends. Everyone is so nice and it’s a little campus so it’s extremely easy to know everyone. The professors are nice and understanding. They help you as long as you go out of your way to get the help you need. The dorms are nice and clean, the cleaning ladies are extremely nice too."
Sophomore,5,PSU Altoona feels like home. Everyone is so welcoming and the campus is very beautiful. The learning experience is amazing.
Freshman,5,Absolutely AMAZING!!! I will transfer to UP next year but I will truly miss this place. It was the time of my life. Going to a smaller campus at first is definitely the way to go.
Freshman,5,It is a lot of fun being here. I am a lifelong Penn State fan so going to a Penn State campus is a dream come true. This campus may be small but it is a nice step for students to take right of high school especially if you come from a small school like I did.
Freshman,5,Penn State has a huge main campus and offers a 2+2 program which allows you to start at a small branch campus (like Altoona). it is also nice to start small to get a feel for the college.
Freshman,5,Penn State Altoona is a great local campus in PA that offers lots of educational opportunities for different fields. The student life and staff also shape the experience PSA gives. The food selection is great too and they offer meal plans along with dorm plans as well.
Sophomore,5,"I love the small personal campus setting that Penn State Altoona provide. I recieve a Pennsylvania State University degree without having to be on a large overwhelming campus. The campus is beautiful, and classes are not too far from the dorms at all. You can participate in sport, clubs, greek life, and everything you want on campus. Since it is small, it gives you tight knit relationships with people you can keep till you graduate."
Sophomore,5,"I've been going here for two years. My intention was to go to main campus, but I got accepted and went here. I didn't like it at first but by my fourth semester I fell in love. If you're social, the party scene is awesome. If you're not, there's plenty of other stuff to do."
Sophomore,5,I love the Altoona campus from the beautiful campus to the caring professors. The ducks in the pond are great to watch while studying or eating but never harrass you. Great place to walk in your free time or just in between classes.
Freshman,5,"I have to yet started, this upcoming academic year will be my freshman year, but so far I can tell Penn State Altoona truly cares about their students. Upon contacting the campus with questions they graciously answer them and even offer extra advice. At a campus tour the Lion Ambassadors were kind and enthusiastic."
Senior,5,"As an (almost) graduated student from the Penn State Altoona campus, I can say I have truly enjoyed every opportunity I have had here. Originally, I wanted to transfer up to University Park, but fell in love with PSUA's community, and gorgeous campus! I love that it's personal here- I get to know my professors very well and have many awesome opportunities to become a leader on and off campus."
Niche User,5,"Great campus, love the city. Penn State Altoona offers a lot of different courses, and one of their specialties is the Rail Engineering Program. Everyone on campus was nice and the tuition is very reasonable"
Sophomore,5,I have been living my best life at college. The campus and the environment pushed me out of my comfort zone and made me outgoing; resulting in me getting involved and making friends.
Senior,5,"An extreme personalized experience with higher learning, every teacher cares about every student, and will take the personal time to assist them with assuring their future success."
Sophomore,5,"I am a recent transfer student to Penn State Altoona, however my experience so far has been great. The academic advisors are extremely helpful in setting you up for success at this university, and most of the professors are great."
Junior,5,"The Altoona campus is quiet, convenient, and beautiful. I came to this college after struggling at a larger university and I have grown so much. The opportunities you get to interact with and learn from your professors made my college experience amazing."
Sophomore,5,"Penn State Altoona is a great stepping stone for every student. Everyone here is friendly and the teachers are very passionate about their topics. There are numerous resources to help you succeed and to help you prepare for life after college. The campus is beautiful and there is lots to do. Your experience here is what you make of it. If I could, I'd do my time at PSU Altoona all over again."
Junior,5,"Penn State Altoona is like a home away from home. The class sizes are small, and each professor knows their students. They offer amazing help to those who ask."
Freshman,5,"Penn State Altoona, is a great place to start your future. It’s good to start your classes here and transfer to University Park your junior year."
Freshman,5,I love Penn State Altoona! It offers such great opportunities for everyone who goes there. The campus is beautiful and small which is nice for walking from class to class.
Freshman,5,"Penn State Altoona is a great place for a young adult to get ahead in life. Within my experience, the small town is nice and calm. The campus is lively, open, and welcoming. The staff here are nice, but could improve. Our Math department is the toughest department here. If you are a person looking to major in math and learn the ins and the out of the subject without escape, then Altoona is the place for you. Overall, This small campus is growing and it has become a nice place to reside."
Sophomore,5,"I love this campus.  It's small, but full of life. Events are being held multiple times a week for students to socialize with each other. The classes and professors are amazing, and they really bring the material to life.  It's much more than just a school with homework and tests; there's activities, friends, food, and acceptance all throughout the campus."
Freshman,5,I really enjoy the smaller campus feel and feeling like you can talk to anyone on campus whether that be a professor or another student. The campus has activities to get everyone involved in something. I do not have a car with me but I have everything I need on campus. Being at the Altoona campus I am close enough to attend events on main campus. The football games are so much fun and it's amazing how the students come together to cheer on their school. So far my college experience has been amazing.
Niche User,5,I studied at Penn State Altoona for two years and it was a great experience. It was nice transition from a small highschool. The campus is small so it was easy to make friends.
Alum,5,"Penn State Altoona offers students a high quality education in a small town environment. As a Blair County resident the school was perfect for me and allowed me to commute. Further, I worked at the school part-time, which provided me the opportunity to help pay for my education."
Alum,5,AMAZING! I had the best professors on campus who really cared about their students. I was involved on campus and they had so much to offer. You were never bored!
Niche User,5,Penn State Altoona is very small but ti has many opportunities for student to be their best and to be involved! Their apartment buildings are beautiful and the new athletic building is looking good!
Junior,5,"I enjoy this campus and encourage as many people as possible to attend and complete college. Penn State is a great college and offers many opportunities. This campus has many resources for students in terms of jobs, internships, and networking."
Sophomore,5,"When I applied to Penn State University, I really had my heart set on going to Penn State Main Campus.  I got accepted into Penn State, Altoona, and I was a little disappointed at first.  After going to Altoona for 1.5 years, I can say that I love it!  The small campus makes it really easy to get around.  My class sizes are pretty small, and I am able to get to know my professors and other class mates a lot easier.  I was able to get Penn State football tickets, and I would drive up to all of the home football game with my friends.  It was the best of both worlds.  I got to enjoy large campus life by going to home football games, yet I got to enjoy the benefits of being on a small campus.  Since my dream is to go to Penn State, Main,  I am still going to transfer to Penn State Main Campus for my last two years, however, I am very impressed with Penn State, Altoona, and I would recommend it to anyone."
College Sophomore,5,"If I had the opportunity to choose a school over again, I would still pick PSA. You get the Penn State feeling without being stuck in a place with 40,000+ people in one area. The school spirit is the best there is."
College Sophomore,5,"Penn State Altoona is the best college in the world. You still get the Penn State experience with the small campus, tight knit community feel. There are so many chances to get involved, study abroad, see concerts and football games, make friends, and excel academically. The professors are great and really want to see you succeed and there is a wide variety of classes to take. I wouldn't change my college experience here in any way, and I love it here."
College Senior,5,everyone is in support of them and it really helps us come together
College Senior,5,"the whole atmosphere is inspiring, social, fun, and together. everyone is into supporting different organizations and there is something for everyone which make you feel at home."
College Sophomore,5,Penn state is one of the best schools in my opinion.  My older sisters went to penn state and have succeeded in their careers and I am eager to do the same!
College Sophomore,5,I have had only good experiences with my professors and courses at this school.  I do not mind going to class because i am ready and excited to learn.  All of my professors have been very nice and helpful and I have enjoyed all of my courses and learning new things daily.
College Sophomore,5,I absolutely loved living on campus.  I am doing it again and I am going to be a sophomore!
College Sophomore,5,I love my school.  The campus is a perfect size and the classes are small enough that you get to know your professors on a personal level.  The people on campus will give you a smile when you pass 99% of the time and a helping hand is always right around the corner.  I have made the best friends I could have ever asked for and I could not be happier with my choice.
College Junior,5,some of the best sports teams in the country.
College Freshman,5,We are supporitve of others.
College Freshman,5,Receiving a degree from this school could show many qualities in a person. The alumni network will help connect to future job opportunities also.
College Freshman,5,"I love everything about my school. It is not to small, but not to big. The class sizes give me an opportunity to be somebody and not just a number. All of my professors care about their students and what they teach. PSA also offers a variety of interesting courses."
College Freshman,5,"Penn State Altoona has a class size of 40 at the maximum and about 80 maximum to a large lecture. All of my professors know my name because I make sure to introduce myself the first day of classes after class time. I have not had one bad experience my first year here and plan to stay here all four years due to my nursing degree. My first semester I dedicated all of my time to my school work so I could succeed. The time I put into my success, resulted in a 4.0 GPA. My GPA has motivated me to work hard so I can stick out among the others."
College Freshman,5,I believe I will be able to get a good job as soon as I graduate.
Junior,4,"Taking classes online was a brand new experience for many of us. Most of my professors got back to their normal groove after a few weeks. The transition was difficult for all of us but I noticed that all of my professors managed to keep their passion and love for teaching apparent. Their positive attitudes, even in the stressful times, inspired my peers and I to keep pushing through."
Sophomore,4,"I had to finish the semester online and I believe the professors made it work. We were still able to learn what we needed to, and we had a lot of resources to help up get through the topics."
Sophomore,4,School did everything right. Most classes had many materials online already which made the transition easier. Teachers were accommodating and understanding.
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Altoona is the closest branch to main campus. They offer a lot of resources to struggling students and have professors who care about their students. Although not all professors are the most helpful (some being high school teachers), most are very helpful."
Niche User,4,I loved Penn State. I actually Visited last weekend and the staffs were so Welcoming. I loved the small engaged classroom setting and how the professors had patience while teaching.
Freshman,4,"The people and faculty are very nice and this school feels like home. Though there is not much to do in the area, it encourages people to spend more time with each other and get creative in fun things to do. Professors are mostly really helpful and want to see you succeed; most are very understanding and willing to meet if you need help. There are other opportunities to get help also. The food is mostly okay."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed my time at Pennsylvania State Altoona considerably so far. A lot of the teachers are lovely and genuinely care about their students. The math department here is quite tricky, and the calculus classes are remarkably difficult. The small campus is an excellent introduction to college and will help prepare students for the workload of college."
Niche User,4,Penn State Altoona is a smaller version of University Park in State College.  It is a beautiful campus where the professors and teachers aids care about you as a person rather than just a number.
Sophomore,4,The staff and students are friendly and helpful. The campus is beautiful. Some classes are lecture heavy though.
Freshman,4,The Campus is centrally located with great transportation. The people I have met have been very helpful. The campus itself is very nice. Very clean and very safe. The buildings are very well kept and the food service is clean with a lot of variety. Classes are easy to find and the athletic complex is very modern.
Freshman,4,"The communication between students and faculty is sometimes inconsistent, there is a huge lack of gender and racial diversity, and the campus is"
Junior,4,This campus allows students to connect with their professors in a smaller classroom setting which is nice. The staff overall are very helpful and kind. This campus allows you to navigate fairly easy. Overall my experience with Penn State Altoona has been good and I’m excited to see how the rest of my college experience goes.
Freshman,4,Great interaction with admissions and follow up to questions. Email driven to students needs to get you  all information and provide you with a  step by step guide so you can receive a response as quickly as possible.
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Altoona is a good campus for schooling, however I feel as if many things can and should be changed. The campus is very open, meaning that non-students can freely walk on campus and enter the buildings with no problem. Being that this school is a Predominantly White Institution, there should be a great amount of diversity, but they lack that factor. I come from living in big city and I am still trying to transition into the lifestyle and this is my second year. Academically, there should be more options with classes and more extracurricular actives for students to be involved."
Sophomore,4,The university offers a great acdemic experience with challenging courses that actually test your knowledge and make you grow. The professors show a genuine concern on your grades and try to help as best they can. The downside to the campus is its feeling of isolation. There isn’t much to do around the university itself.
Sophomore,4,"I just wish it was cheaper. I also wish all of campus was in one spot. I have to drive 15 minutes downtown twice a week for my nursing courses because instead of building vertically, they build horizontally. They just redid the gym, which is really nice. I also wish there was more food options."
Senior,4,"It is an interesting school. the campus is small though. If you like a small class size and moderate tuition pricing, then this is the school for you. Most of their programs have you start the first two years there then transfer to university park to finish the last two years."
Senior,4,"To this point, going into my senior year I can say I have had an amazing education that has helped me grow both academically and as a person. Most of the faculty that I have encountered have been so helpful and eager to guide me and help me reach my goals."
Junior,4,"Penn State Altoona is a smaller campus which offers much more personal classes, making a more relaxing learning environment."
Senior,4,"I love the class sizes at Altoona and feel like students get a better gen ed experience there then they would at University Park. When you get to a higher level in your major you get the chance to know your professors well, and the classes become more enjoyable as you also know your fellow majors. I would like to see more programming on the weekends, and I would like to see more quiet type of activities instead of blaring music at every event."
Freshman,4,"I chose Penn State University for a few different reasons. When I toured the Altoona campus, it gave a sense of a small, nicely set up campus, which has a good student-teacher ratio. This is exactly what I was looking for considering I focus more on my academics than anything else. Penn State is also a school widely known for their tradition and sense of family, including everyone especially in their trademark, ""WE ARE, PENN STATE"". Another reason to study at this institution is because after graduation, the alumni will play a big part. Penn State is known to have the largest alumni association in the country, which will help immensely while applying to professional schools and looking for jobs in the future."
Sophomore,4,"Going to Penn State is amazing, no matter what branch campus you are at or even if you are at Main, you get a Penn State degree and that is an amazing thing! As a business major I am downtown and I just love how the buildings are it makes it very easy for me to go to all my classes and see my professors in the same building."
Freshman,4,"The overall experience of Penn State Altoona is what you make of it. Putting yourself out there is the best thing you could do! I did not hold back on what I am interested in and joined the Society of Women Engineers, when none of my friends were interested. I met even more people through the organization. I like going to watch all the sporting events and everyone is always very engaged!"
Freshman,4,Penn State Altoona is great due to the close proximity to State College. It is the largest branch campus and it offers a lot of the same opportunities which are available at University Park. The atmosphere on campus is not as overwhelming as University Park and the people here are more personal. I would like to see improvements and updates in some of the facilities since this is the oldest branch campus and some of the facilities are very dated.
Senior,4,Penn State Altoona is a small and beautiful campus  that has the enthusiasm reminiscent of University Park. I love how you are able to know your classmates and professors better due to smaller class sizes. I think the student parking permit process needs to be improved upon. It would be more helpful if passes could be mailed to you after you apply for a permit instead of having to wait and then pick it up in person.
Sophomore,4,"Overall great experience, beautiful campus and friendly staff.  The professors are helpful and easy to get along with. The area was very nice but hard to get to places if you don't have a car especially in the cold winters."
Sophomore,4,"The only thing that bothered me was that the town was very small. But overall I loved the campus , the people are friendly & helpful! I love it because you can focus on your work!"
Junior,4,"Penn State Altoona has a lot of great qualities.  The only negative aspect is the lack of involvement for commuter students.  Most of the time, I was unaware of special events being held on campus.  I am paying the student involvement fee, I should be able to enjoy the events."
Freshman,4,"At Penn State Altoona, I feel very ""at home"". If you're someone like me, coming from a small town, and a graduating class of only about 55 students, larger universities seem rather daunting. Penn State Altoona offered a small community feel that I am accustomed to while also offering me the opportunity that Penn State has available."
Sophomore,4,"Penn State Altoona is a great school especially for students that want the big school opportunities but a small school feel.  Altoona is close to the Main campus and we had the opportunities to attend football games and other events at the main campus.  We would spend weekends at the main campus and attend classes at Altoona.  The class sizes at Altoona are small and you have ability to get to know your professors.  The dorms were average, but the offsite housing at Nittany Point is very nice.  I would recommend Altoona highly."
Freshman,4,"For me, Penn State Altoona was a perfect fit. It is a small campus with a wonderful sense of community."
Freshman,4,"Altoona is a quaint, small city that has a lot to do.  Overall, Altoona provides most of the amenities of University Park while still being close to the party scene in State College."
Freshman,4,I really like Penn State. It is a great school and everyone is so friendly. Penn state has an amazing atmosphere. I wouldn't want to attend any other school.
Freshman,4,I like the eclectic variety of classes that they offer. I also enjoy the fact that I can stay close to home to save up money but still take classes directed towards my major to prepare for my transfer to Penn State Main.
Freshman,4,"The thing I appreciate at Penn State Altoona is the community environment. Everyone acts like a family and the campus is beautiful. There's a club for anything you can think of. The resources are also a good benefit, and class sizes are small which makes it easier to learn."
Freshman,4,Altoona is a great campus for someone from a smaller high school. The campus isn't that big so it is easy to get around. However having to take classes at the downtown is time consuming due to having to take a twenty minute bus ride.
Freshman,4,I love the people and somewhat the campus. The town sucks and is so so boring. Do not come here if you want city life. 
Freshman,4,"Most of this college is very nice. It is a beautiful campus. Most of the teachers are very nice. Some are not so much. I guess you will have that anywhere you go. You cannot just look up your current GPA (which is extremely difficult when you need to maintain a certain GPA), and some teachers don't even bother updating the grade book. It is a small enough campus that even though some parties go on (hey, it's college), there is never enough to be distracted from. You never hear of anyone getting hurt. The main buildings are close by, you are mainly in walking distance from class to class, although some classes are further downtown. The food here is not bad, either. Overall, it is a very nice school."
Freshman,4,"Penn State Altoona is a beautiful campus. Everything is walking distance, the professors are great and the social life is amazing!"
Freshman,4,"This campus is perfect if you are looking for a small, but diverse place to get an education. Friendly peers and cooperative professors!"
College Sophomore,4,"I never feel in danger on campus. There are campus blue lights that alert the police if we feel threatened. Also, to get into the residence halls, you have to have an ID and live in that building or be escorted by someone who lives there."
College Sophomore,4,"Greek life is very popular at PSA, but it does not put a barrier between the students"
College Sophomore,4,"Being a Penn State school, we are more focused on the sports at University Park. However, we also have several sports that are well attended at the Altoona campus."
College Freshman,4,"Living on campus is great because I'm close to everything... classes, dining and soon, a brand new gym."
College Freshman,4,Playing an NCAA sport is a dream come true!  My coach is absolutely wonderful and gives all students every opportunity to play.
College Freshman,4,"My school is giving me the fantastic opportunity to play an NCAA sport, participate in the Honors College and be a science major. How incredible is that?"
College Sophomore,4,The housing is great with maids coming every week to clean your bathroom. But you have to leave the campus during holidays.
College Sophomore,4,A lot of sport clubs with advanced training.
College Sophomore,4,My school is an institution that cares about its students future. One thing that affects students negatively are scholarships.
College Sophomore,4,"We have job fairs where people from all fields will come to recruit students to work for them. We also have an internship office that can help steer you in the right direction for an internship. The career services office is also really helpful with getting jobs, connecting with alumni, and choosing a career path."
College Sophomore,4,"We have tons of different varieties of classes within curriculums here. I have taken sciences everywhere from chemistry and biology to a natural disasters course, where you learn how to survive in hurricanes and tornadoes and such. The professors are really helpful and easily accessible, and they are the only ones who teach you. There are no TAs. Class sizes are mostly a small 25-30 size which allows for a lot of 1 on 1 attention."
College Sophomore,4,"We have really great health facilities like the Sheetz Health and Wellness Center which is like our doctor's office. It's really fast and easy, and they can give you prescriptions there. Our campus is also very safe. We have police patrols, the police services building is nearby, and we have a blue light system that allows for even more safety."
College Sophomore,4,"Living in the dorms was a great experience, and I recommend it to anyone who wants the full college experience. The only thing I didn't like about the dorms is, Penn State is all about keeping tradition and integrity, so the buildings weren't very updated and there weren't many living options compared to other schools. The dorms provided we with a lot of friends, a great roommate and community feeling, and a really short walk to class."
College Sophomore,4,"There are a variety of different sports at Penn State Altoona. The club and intramural sports are just as supported as the varsity sports, and there is something for everyone. Our student section is so much fun, and our students really support the athletes here."
College Senior,4,the only down side is no air conditioning and wifi in some rooms
College Sophomore,4,"I feel safe on campus due to the options we have, but things still can happen."
College Sophomore,4,I don't mind going to a varsity sports every once in awhile! I love going to the gym there too.
College Junior,4,Some greeks are very selective.
College Junior,4,I love it and hope it gets better.
College Junior,4,Penn State is a really good school and is one of the best so a degree from here will open doors.
College Freshman,2,There was a lack of Student Athlete support
College Freshman,2,It was hard to feel or get involved.
College Freshman,2,I don't really hear much about this
College Student,2,Lack of transportation creates an environment of disconnect.    Public trans is horrible 2 hours on bus to get to a mall
College Junior,2,I am not fond of the people I know who participate in Greek life. Many of my friends agree with me.
College Junior,2,Greek life on Altoona campus is a joke
College Sophomore,2,"Class of 2018. I am going into my sophomore year at Altoona. Basically every guy you see, smokes weed. You may not think they do, but trust me, they do. You cannot walk through the apartment complexes without smelling weed smoke. Greek life is stupid. They all think they are cool, when in reality, they are just dumb. 

I have only gone to a few parties, but basically everyone just gets as drunk as possible. You may be trying to study while people are partying, and that makes it very hard. 

PS. I lived at nittany pointe. I wouldn't recommend it if you want to pass any of your classes."
College Sophomore,2,I do not see the point in having to pay a big chunk of change to be part of a group but this is coming from a non-Greek. Greeks do say they love their chapters. They do have many fundraisers for good organizations like THON.
College Freshman,2,My friend was walking back from his car at 4 am because he had to drive another friend to the hospital. He was harassed by locals. Most of the blue lights are out of order and have been all year. There are about 6 blue lights on the outskirts of campus. Police are so worried about giving students underages they don't care about safety.
College Freshman,2,One frat: Sigma Pi. They're the poorest excuse for a frat I have ever seen
College Freshman,2,No one cares about anything here
College Freshman,2,No selection and very poor quality
College Freshman,2,"Old, Small, Dusty, Dirty. Very poor"
College Freshman,2,"Honestly, Campus Housing is a joke. RA's take things too seriously (I got the police called on MY ROOM because my hallway smelled like marijuana, when Rachel the Maple RA knocked on my door and informed me that police were coming, I told her I had somewhere to be but if she wanted she could step in my room and look around/smell. My room had no smell of marijuana. She made me wait for the police and they found nothing. I didn't even get an apology from her for wasting my time.  Wifi is terrible, Janitors are rude, and overall punishments are given out for poor reasons very often. If Altoona wants their campus housing to get better then they need to treat it like there is actually something wrong. Every day when I go to shower, the shower handle falls off. Every couple of days, the water is ice cold and does not heat up. Occasionally, the Prox cards do not work. Finally, if you have an issue with your roommate, it is very difficult to switch rooms. Overall, Altoona if you want your dorms to be better, do a few things. Train your RAs better, Fix problems when they occur, stop letting the dorm fall apart, and just make sure things are working smoothly."
College Freshman,2,It's not the best but it's not the best.
College Sophomore,2,"unless you count frat houses, you aren't allowed to live off campus and the apartments i have seen students live in are not desireable"
College Sophomore,2,im non-greek and don't see any reason to go greek. not many people seem to be involved in greek life
College Sophomore,2,Not too many options or variety. same thing all the time. Dining hall is very nice.
College Sophomore,2,It is not a very safe area. Not a lot of activities to do around the area.
College Sophomore,2,off campus dining is very far and not worth it .No student discounts
College Freshman,2,"Altoona is a large town but campus is completely out of the way. There is nothing in walking distance. To get to town you have to drive. There are many places to eat once you're in town, however if you aren't there isn't much."
College Sophomore,2,I am not into partying nor do I attend them. I have heard horrible stories leading most of them to be busted.
College Sophomore,2,It gets very cold and snowy in Altoona
College Sophomore,2,"If the financial aid counselor isn't fond of you - you will be denied scholarship/financial help. I've had to find alternate ways, twice."
College Sophomore,2,"I really hate the atmosphere here and I'm looking to transfer. I don't like the groups of people who go here or the party scene. The only redeeming character is that the academics are amazing. As a non-religious person, I have religion shoved down my throat constantly. Living off campus I live with people playing music until 1am during finals week and the constant smell of weed in the apartments."
College Sophomore,2,There aren't many food options close to campus
College Sophomore,2,The majority of students overuse alcohol and weed to an annoying amount. You can't even sit in your apartment without the smell of weed filling your livingroom/bathrooms. The closer you are to campus the more you'll hear students screaming walking down the street and stumbling down the road.
College Sophomore,2,The campus is in the middle of nowhere. There is nothing here.
College Sophomore,2,Most of the parties at the main places get busted.
College Sophomore,2,"Everyone is either a hillbilly or from an inner city school in the bronx, philly or D.C."
College Freshman,2,"International students have very minimal student aid, which i have heard is non existing."
College Freshman,2,"There are no strict actions towards alcohol or weed. More dangerous drugs might be caught but it is difficult to tell if a person is on it or is just naturally loud. 

On campus maybe a few activities are at a low key but majority have their bottles tucked in their closets. 

Weed is very very common and out of 10 friends, 7 do it."
College Freshman,2,There's pretty much no scholarship opportunities at Penn State.
College Freshman,2,"Campus police spend their days monitoring parking lots, trying to get as much money out of you as possible through parking violations."
College Sophomore,2,There is only one restaurant on campus which is Port Sky and I've heard it's not very good. I feel bad for the students that live on-campus because they are forced to get a meal plan which doesn't even get carried over into the next semester so I consider it a huge waste of money. I usually cook at my apartment or go out and get something to eat. 
College Freshman,2,"I live 15 minutes away from New York City, so I'm use to the excitement over there. "
College Freshman,2," You definitely need a car on my campus. My school is in a very rural area and my university supplies us with three shuttle buses that come ever hour or half an hour to off-campus housing, wal mart and sheetz."
College Freshman,2,It's a ghost town full of old people. I would never live there. University Park (45 minutes away) is a better town.
College Sophomore,2,"The altoona cops are very corrupt and they love handing out underages and blowing up small events to make it look like they are not in the wrong for their frequent overstepping of boundaries. They basically hate the college students and instead of taking care of the drug problem in the rundown town of altoona, they would rather go for easy targets (college kids) who have the money to pay the plethora of charges they love handing out. "
College Sophomore,2,"There is absolutely nothing to do in the town of altoona, it is a run down town full of old people on scooters. "
College Sophomore,2,They do have greek life but their houses are small with only a few people actually living in them.
College Sophomore,2,I am now going through a review process where they want to verify all my information but I have to wait until all the paper work gets sent to my house and then for my parents to go to my house and get the information and send it to me. It has become a hassle and it really is not that much aid.
College Sophomore,2,No one really goes to the sports events and they are not very entertaining to watch. The gym is a little small and lacking lots of things like a variety of classes would be nice.
College Junior,2,"Many students let drugs and alcohol affect their school work which is unacceptable, however if caught our police do take it very seriously. "
College Freshman,2,The athletics for Penn State Altoona are almost non existent. Student tend to only pay attention to Penn State University Park teams. A lot of students venture up to State College for many different sporting events and activites.
College Sophomore,2,"The only places to eat off campus are fast food chain restaurants.  I really don't enjoy such foods.  Luckily there is a grocery store just down the road from the campus, so home cooked meals are a viable option to those like myself who don't enjoy greasy fast food."
College Sophomore,2,There are no under 21 clubs at Penn State Altoona and in the town of Altoona. There are parties off-campus for underage students.
College Freshman,2,Greek life is pretty bare minimum at Penn State Altoona. There's about three Greek communities in total. They don't really rule the campus or make that big of an appearance. Pretty basic in general
College Sophomore,2,"Financial aid process for Penn State Altoona is very hard. It's confusing and it's difficult to keep up with all the work needed to get financial aid. I received a fair amount, but not nearly as much as I thought I would. I would recommend going to the office of student aid and talking to the workers there frequently so you can keep updated on your aid amount. Also, it's best to ask often how you can apply for more aid and have them personally help you out."
College Sophomore,2,"There's not much to do in altoona, but most people know that before they come here. Even sheets is like four or five blocks away from campus, but on that same block there's sheets, pizza hut, subway, a movie rental place, family dollar, and a laundromat."
College Sophomore,2,Not Enough Pages – The university only allows you 120 print pages per semester which is never enough! And if you want more you must pay for them
College Freshman,2,"Is Not Secure – I don't know about everyone else, but I feel secure there because I am around people, period. There is dangers, you hear of robbery and rape taking place more than twice a year. The only way to stay safe is to be around a lot of people. Even then, if you live on campus, good luck feeling completely safe. Drugs and alcohol are a big thing there. Marijuana circulates all over the place, so much, you will get exposed to it. Alcohol is not so easy to come by for obvious reasons, but everyone drinks pretty much. Parties are wild and police arrives too late all the time. This campus is only safe if you lock your door and never come out. The police is useless, they ignore people doing drugs out in the open. There is only ONE car and inside, a very heavy woman who will most likely have to shoot you if she is to catch up with you. 

Studying can be a pleasure like in any other campus, but security wise and safety wise, don't get your hopes up"
College Junior,2,Need for Better Coaches – Coaches need to pay better attention to their teams and their behavior and act as role models.
College Freshman,2,"I would say that I have never felt directly threatened but we definitely lack security on campus. There is always police and security at the off campus apartment where I live, but on campus, they are a rare sight. There are also only a handful of those emergency buttons to push if you were being attacked and they are placed at dumb locations. They are only at places where there is street lights and usually a lot of people but here are many places where its darker and less crowded where there are no emergency buttons in sight. Also, the bus system is faulty that takes us to our off campus apartment. Last semester I would get done class at about 8:00PM but i always missed the 8:00 bus. So i would wait at the stop for the 8:20 and it never showed. then i would have to wait until 8:40 but that is a long time to be standing out there waiting by myself at night to see if the bus is going to come."
College Freshman,2,"Its Ight – There are plenty of places to enough from. wait let me correct my self, there are no places to eat from especially if you dont have a car because the good places to eat are about 2 miles away in the other town on theor main road"
College Sophomore,2,"I do not participate in anything such as parties, bar/club scene. There are bars around but I don't know much about them being 18, there isn't much to do other than some school activities to do. I know that there are parties, and everyone who goes seems to enjoy themselves."
College Freshman,2,Port Sky Rap – i love port sky. i feel like could fly. when i eat their food i feel like a new guy. nasty stuff i never try. i feel like i would die. instead of eating white bread i eat rye.
College Sophomore,2,"At Penn State Altoona there is a very small amount of minorities that choose to attend. So you can say there are a lot of white people. However, there are so many multicultural groups that have been formed to shed light to the minority groups."
College Freshman,2,"theres nittany pointe which is where all the cops circulate in order to catch anyone who drinks as if they have nothing better to do, and then theres penn view which is pretty nice and penn view east was recently built and very nice. nittany pointe is a rip off. it's so expensive and doens't even include utilites. If you don't get penn view east you're basiclally paying way too much"
College Sophomore,2,"Dorms, Convenience and Cost – The dorms, depending on where you live, are either really convenient to the classes or really convenient to the cafe. Where I lived on campus was the low end of the spectrum with the bare essentials, but the cost for the place was too high for what it was. It felt like a broom closet instead of a room because it was two people with limited living space. However, it was conveniently located closest to the classrooms, so it wasn't that far of a walk. Whereas, the Cedar dorm rooms were the farthest from the classrooms, but it had heat and air conditioning."
College Freshman,1,It is ridiculous. The town is so poor they will fine you for any thing.
College Sophomore,1,They think they're the coolest people. They aren't. This is college. Not high school.
College Sophomore,1,rains until it snows and then it snows until it rains
College Sophomore,1,It depends on where you go but the larger student apartment complexes are loud and security rarely does much to resolve issues. They're close to campus though and definitely within walking distances. Landlords are either non-existent or unhelpful in resolving many issues. Most places off campus have adequate parking. I have had my car keyed in one of the parking lots however.
College Freshman,1,"Too much snow and exceptionally cold wind makes me stuck at home. A lot of times I have had to miss classes because of how cold it is outside. 

I miss the summer sun and warm weather more than I miss home made food. That is saying a lot, given I love homemade food too much"
College Sophomore,1,"It is basically in the middle of nowhere. State College is about 45 minutes away so students usually travel up there for the weekends to go to parties, football games, etc. There isn't much to do in Altoona especially if you don't have a car plus everything takes money. "
College Sophomore,1,I don't like my school at all. It's small and I've found it really hard to make friends because it's cliquey and just like high school. There also is nothing to do in the area. I definitely wouldn't recommend this school to a friend. I can't wait to get out and transfer up to University Park. 
College Freshman,1,"I don't want to graduate with debts, but the school is a little pricey, unfortunately, I had to take out a loan. "
College Sophomore,1,"The weather is usually all over the place. I could be cold and rainy one day, and then the next day it could be hot and sunny."
College Freshman,1,"The weather here is very interesting. It snows almost every day in the winter, and I love the snow, but it is always depressingly overcast here. We honestly only had two sunny days in February, and the rest were gray. We don't get any big snows, or good thunderstorms because of the mountain, but there is snow. The biggest thing is the lack of sun. And it's also cold in winter, if you don't like the cold. "
College Freshman,1,"People can't believe the dining when I tell them about it. Day in and day out the food is the exact same. It is all either terribly unhealthy or gross, or both. I have gotten raw chicken fingers, hair in my food, and snarly service. You have to pay for each individual item, and it's not a buffet. They even charge you if you take an extra pack of salad dressing, or any pack of cream cheese for you bagel when there is no bowl of it. On ""Parents weekend"" there was a pancake breakfast on the schedule that said ""we thought we could flip a few pancakes for the parents free of charge"", but it turned out to be the exact same breakfast as every other day, and they still charged me for it! Another thing is that it usually closes an hour or two before it is posted to. I walked in at 8pm on a saturday, when it is scheduled to close at 9:30, and asked for a cupcake, and the lady just said we're closed. So I got stuck eating chicken fingers and french fries for dinner, the same thing I had for brunch. The only thing nice about it is the older people that work there, but then most of the student workers stand there talking to their friends as you wait looking at the other people in line. What's sad is I'm a very optimistic person, and this is the best I have to say about the dining."
College Freshman,1,Drinking Is More Popular – Drinking and partying every weekend instead of hitting the books is what goes on. then there is drinking at athletic events that is what goes on outside at football games.
College Freshman,1,"greek like here at altoona is pathetic. the people in greek life think they are amazing and everyone else couldn't care less about them. they are annoying and obnoxious about it, the houses are gross and old."
College Sophomore,1,"Since I have to claim the income of everyone living in my home, my mother's boyfriend, who isn't helping me with college is included. He has a job that pays six figures and it completely annihilated my chances at being able to get money off tuition. So my tip to anyone who wants to recieve financial aid is, to make sure if there is someone living in your house that isn't part of your family, kick them out or move out... you will probably save more money on your college bills that way."
College Senior,1,"Fraternities are usually comprised of underclassmen, because most students transfer to University Park after their sophomore year. Parties are usually busted by police. Sororities serve no relevance; girls are overweight."
College Freshman,1,Terrible Experience – i know people who love it here but if you're coming from a larger town or urban setting you will hate it here. there is no diversity and most of the people here act like they're still in high school. there is also only one place to eat on campus which gets old fast and if you are a vegetarian or are trying to diet then good luck because all of your options are fried food or entrees that you don't even know how they are made and look disgusting. the only positive thing that came out of being here was that the classes are easier than my high school classes which made it really easy to get a good gpa. DON'T GO HERE!

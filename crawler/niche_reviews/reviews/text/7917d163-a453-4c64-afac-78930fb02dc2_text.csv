Our school motto is “not self but others” and that is what this school teaches us.It teaches us that we as students need to serve others above ourselves and that doing something for someone else is a greater reward than doing something for ourselves.
Sophomore,5,It Is hard to explain such a unique place to someone who has never had an experience like much of the students that attend here have. Ferrum college is one of the most tucked away colleges that is full of surprises upon a visit. There isn't much around the campus itself but what the campus has will blow your mind. when first entering the many 100+ acers that Ferrum has you will be greeted with the most beautiful views. the D3 school is full of student athletes who you    you can find on anyone of our sports facilities.
Freshman,5,I loved the campus and the staff. They were extremely nice and extremely helpful. The campus was also very beautiful and was the size of a campus that I was looking for.
Alum,5,"Ferrum was a great experience. I had many professors who are willing to help you get on the right track.  Everyone was very friendly and had a great atmosphere. If you needed help in a subject, they will help."
Freshman,5,I was here for four years and loved it. It was peaceful and I had the opportunity to learn all kinds of things. The professors are great and helpful when seeking out help.
Freshman,5,Ferrum College is an excellent environment  where  you can express and grow. The student lifestyle is unique from other universities. It is diffently a blessing to be a part of Ferrum College.
Sophomore,5,"Ferrum College is a excellent, small town school. It is simply & beautifully laid out and helps students feel less intimidated. They say great things come in small packages. Ferrum may be small, but it is packed full of great educators/education, people and activities. They offer a wide range of classes to meet the needs of your major/minor. The activities, including athletics, also comes in good varieties. Ferrum always makes sure that students are involved and included as much as possible. That also pertains to commuters as well. They do a great job of connecting everyone and making the experience of college warm & welcoming. Who wouldn't love great people and a beautiful campus. Ferrum College equips students with a great foundation for the future. From education to personal life, it sets them up for success."
Freshman,5,Ferrum is such an amazing school! The classes are small and everyone really gets to know each other on a personal level!
Sophomore,5,"Great environment, loving professors who actually care about their students. Friendly students and staff. Campus police is great and the athletics is great."
Freshman,5,"My experience at ferrum was great my freshman year. Everyone is friendly , as for school the classes are amazing and there are plenty of tutors and help all around campus at every time of the day."
Junior,5,Best place to get your degree. I love the family atmosphere and the small class sizes. The professors are wonderful.
Sophomore,5,"The teachers try to work with you, and the community is all around inclusive for just about everyone."
Junior,5,Ferrum College is a small setting college that provides a wide variety of one on one teacher/student education in efforts of having the best learning tools to enhance your career options.
Niche User,5,This college is probably the best college to take a tour around and everyone there is so amazingly nice.
College Freshman,5,"I'm still a new student so I cannot speak to the entire experience, but from what I have seen the faculty and staff truly care about us students and they take pride in working at Ferrum. To be honest I only chose Ferrum as a last resort, but I really wish I had visited before I decided because I would have fallen in love with the school from the first sight. The staff are really friendly and you get that very obvious southern vibe. Even the cafeteria staff was very friendly and introduced themselves and make you feel at home. The campus is considered small, but I would actually consider it a medium sized campus with a high school sized student body."
College Freshman,5,There is a doctors office right on campus. The cops can come in one phone call.
College Freshman,5,"I love Ferrum. It is small, so every teacher knows who you are. The location is very beautiful. There is stuff to do, but sometimes you do have to drive to get somewhere."
College Sophomore,5,My experience at Ferrum College is great the faculty and staff are willing to work with me and help me with anything. Ferrum gives a great variety of internships and helps me get out in the field I am majoring in.
College Sophomore,5,"I really love that the school isn't too big, and it isn't too small. You can walk around campus knowing everyone and still have the opportunity to meet new people. The size of the school also allows you to get on a first name basis with people and better understand their background and what they have been through in order to get to know them. Everyone has their own story and every one of them is different. It's nice having stuff in common but also having differences that will allow you to grow and flourish within the college community."
College Sophomore,5,The off campus housing is great! And it is very affordable.
College Sophomore,5,"Initially I wanted to go to Penn State, but my uncle shut that option down quick when they didn't offer a lot of grant money. So when I first visited Ferrum I hated it, I didn't want to be there! Once I actually started attending Ferrum and meeting people  started to appreciate my decision. It isn't a school that every city person can attend, but I love the small environment and friendly community. For professors to know me personally and speak when they see me is heart warming and I feel special every time. I love Ferrum and wouldn't transfer at all! It's the right school for me."
College Sophomore,5,"At my school we have a writing and math center where professors are to assist you with any questions you have. We always have the ARC, which is below the library. In the ARC there are on-call tutors there to help students as well. The one thing I really love about my school every student within my program has to do an internship our senior year. We don't have to take any classes, just go to our internship everyday to get experience and hours in our field. I love this idea because it better prepares us for what we're about to get into after we graduate. "
College Sophomore,5,I love my program! I am a Social Work major and we have many fun and experimental courses. 
College Junior,5,"it is very clear what the rules are and the punishment that comes with breaking those rules. Any action that is deemed illegal behind the college world is also illegal on campus, i.e. underaged drinking, therefor you get the punishment from the judicial system and from the school."
College Sophomore,5,"Though Franklin Co. is a small town, they have big heart and pride in their community and anyone who enters it. I can honestly say I have never felt so loved and welcome by complete strangers until I went to Ferrum. Here you're treated like your a brother, sister, cousin, you're basically family the second you enter into Franklin Co."
College Sophomore,5,"The sports at Ferrum are what helps to make the school. It isn't just a college enjoyed event, Ferrum sports are what help to connect the community to the college. It's always amazing to see the local ""grandpa"" of the community sitting and having fun with the local Frat boys. Our sports do more than just bring in money, they establish a core motto for our campus...community."
College Freshman,5,they have a lot of majors and they love supporting that.
College Freshman,5,Varsity sports here are very important.  After last year we are coming off a confrence championship for girls basketball and girls softball and this year in football we tied for conference champions.  Some of our sports teams have JV or Varsity Reserve who also get to play against other schools.
College Junior,5,"This school is very generous with it's scholarships. If you got a 3.4 GPA or better, you can get several thousand per semester, not counting FASFA. Ferrum actually searched for scholarships without me telling them to. No other school did that, in my experience."
College Freshman,5,I'm majoring in health sciences at Ferrum College.  Ferrum college offers so many opportunites in this major.  We actully get to work with a human cadavior and the professors in this major work with you on whatever you need and will be there for you through the end.
Recent Alumnus,5,The scenery is always a crowd pleaser.  Waking up to the mountains and seeing them is a calming atmosphere.
College Sophomore,5,"Varisty sports, Football, to be most accurate, are pretty big. Huge deal to campus life."
College Senior,5,A Safe Place – My safety has not been threaten since I've attended
College Freshman,5,"Ferrum is a very beautiful campus.  The faculty is really nice, and the way they run the school is by putting the students first.  It gives you the feeling of being at home and the joy of being away.  I visited many colleges, but Ferrum was the best of all.  "
College Freshman,5,Around here parking isn't bad at all and the campus is small so that you don't have to drive to class you can walk easily. You can keep your car in the dorm lots or the commuter lots depending on your status as commuter or resident. The fees are fair and policies are fair and the campus police are very good at their job and do good services.
College Freshman,5,Good Help – Financial aid was very helpful and smooth. Very friendly and helpful. I got a good scholarship based in academics.
College Freshman,5,Great Food for a Small Town – Good and friendly environment. Its a small town but a home like feel.
Sophomore,4,I like Ferrum College's diversity. I love being able to have a class with a variety of people from all across the world. I like that it's a private college which means smaller class sizes and more one on one with professors.
Senior,4,I am a current senior at Ferrum college and I have learned so many things while attending. The thing that makes my school so great is that they are all about the students !
Freshman,4,"My senior year I had a tragic incident, where my girlfriend died in a car accident.  The football coaches at Ferrum College called myself and my mother during this tough time.  Even though I was not a student there, they made me feel as if I were.  During football orientation they made me feel like everyone was family there .  
I would like to see more scholarships offered to freshman students."
Sophomore,4,"The school is extremely friendly. The student body is open and accepting to everyone, and the faculty will do everything they can to help you out, all you have to do is ask"
Sophomore,4,"It's a good college we just need more  off campus attractions and activities. I really like how the teachers really focus on your success and guide you properly. The food there is great and the people there are great people, they greet you everyday with a smile on their face."
Freshman,4,I love the campus and student life here. I love that I'm on the wrestling team here. Wish they had an Art History minor. I
Niche User,4,"The college advisor can to my school and was talking about the college and I liked it. He talked about tuition, freshman college life like living on campus having a car on camps and stuff like that. Then he talked about sports far as band they are  D3 school"
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at Ferrum College from the beginning to the end, honestly. It's a great campus and a supportive community, for the most part. Majority of the buildings on campus are very old, but it seems as though some of the housing buildings are the only true indication of the campus' age. Overall the campus is a safe place, but I would like to see better management of the school's more personal cases (such as Title IX cases) and how they protect the survivors after the dust settles. I would also like to suggest starting incoming freshmen out with advisors in their fields of study, if a major has been decided upon. It would make figuring out the requirements for their majors less confusing, than to be switched around so often and risking being able to graduate on time due to lack of credits required."
Freshman,4,Ferrum College provides a small school community in which it is easy to make connections. Small classes allow students to have a more personable experience with their proffessors.
Alum,4,"Very pricey due to being a private school, but everyone is nice and supportive and want you to graduate"
Sophomore,4,My overall experience at Ferrum College has been a great one! The campus is beautiful. The class sizes are small and the professors are willing to work one on one with you. It is truly amazing. The only bad thing about Ferrum College is the price.
Freshman,4,"Great college,everyone is very friendly and helpful.I would love to see more athletics and sororities.I would love to see a lot more activities to do.Being away from home and on weekends there is nothing to do.The professors are great.Overall Ferrum is great college."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Police Station is right across the street from the main campus, they will show up within seconds."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Ferrum is a great school for students who like the country and the small school feel.  My class sizes ranged from 5-25 depending on the class.  The professors I had were caring and helpful; they made a huge difference in my academic success.  My advice to new panthers would be- attend all the campus activities you can! They are filled with fun, and that's where you will meet your college career friends.  A lot of information is handed out during these activities, and thats how you will stay ahead of the game!"
Recent Alumnus,4,"My housing was fabulous freshmen through sophomore year, though I started in nicer housing due to my GPA in high school."
Recent Alumnus,4,"There are no words to describe how the professors impacted their students.  95% of my professors were the most approachable, knowledgeable, and caring professors I could have asked for.  I was part of the Health Sciences program, so I can't speak for the other disciplines, but I have heard many good things.  The only downside is the price of the private school."
College Freshman,4,"I love so much about Ferrum! Everyone seems so sweet, the campus is beyond beautiful and I know that the faculty and staff really cares. What you see on the internet and based on the websites you cannot tell how amazing the school is! If you are considering Ferrum, I really do urge you to visit, you will not be disappointed!"
College Freshman,4,They try their best to keep us safe and always keep us informed.
College Freshman,4,"I have to have PowerPoint slides, I can't do the oral notes. But other than that some professors go a little fast so you don't have time to write everything down."
College Freshman,4,"For the most part, our schools athletic teams are actually good. There's a great fan support at all games."
College Sophomore,4,There are many sports here on campus and all of them take themselves serisouly and work hard. Academics are just as important as athletics to the coaches. The school supports the teams all the way and the players are hardworking.
College Sophomore,4,I love the campus and the faculty! The teachers really get to know their students and assist them whenever they need the help. Its close to home and small but close knit.
College Freshman,4,We have internships and a lot of things you can do to help with your career field.
College Freshman,4,I love Ferrum. It's a great school.
Recent Alumnus,4,The place I lived was great
Recent Alumnus,4,It was a good place to go to
Recent Alumnus,4,If it wasn't for this school I wouldn't have made all the friend I have now being done with college .
College Sophomore,4,Campus police is always there to help when in need.
College Sophomore,4,The dorm I live in is one of the best and the staff do a great job keeping it clean and up to date.
College Sophomore,4,I am not in a sorority but I am able to attend and play in advents that they hold.
College Sophomore,4,Ferrum sports is one thing i love to watch. We have great staff and athletes that represent Ferrum well.
College Sophomore,4,The sports are very popular!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
College Sophomore,4,There are plenty of parties at Ferrum! But they are usually at the frat houses!
College Sophomore,4,It is fine and there are late night options also..
College Sophomore,4,They are very strict on enforcing the rules! And if you do something wrong then they will punish you!
College Sophomore,4,I think the cafe food is pretty good! Somethings are better than others but I do not mind going to the cafe!
College Sophomore,4,The process is easy but I would like to find another way to earn more money!
College Sophomore,4,The campus life is great! It allows you to interact with other students and to build friendships. Also living on campus puts you right in the middle of everything so it is easier to get to!
College Freshman,4,The brothers and sisters of the ferrum greek life are very close nit
College Sophomore,4,Professors have been pretty good so far. They seems to be fair
College Freshman,4,It was very easy !
College Freshman,4,The diversity on campus is great. It has people from all over the world. The campus church has the flags of the countries which the students are from.
College Freshman,4,Good food at appropriate times
College Freshman,4,Has a great academic resources department and a excellent thinking and learning center staff
College Sophomore,4,"Ferrum College Athletics are popular as most of the students that attend Ferrum are athletes. However, those who do not participate can still be active in intramural sports and from a student's perspective intramural sports are still very competitive and fun for all! With Ferrum being having a small number of students, athletics here is what brings the student population together. The atmosphere at atheletic events here at Ferrum represents the greatly spirited student population that make Ferrum College what it is."
College Sophomore,4,"Computers are available all over campus. In every level of the library there are computers and printers. Printing has become more fancy, we now only have to swipe our cards to print. Our network speed is okay, considering the fact that we're kind of in the middle of nowhere. I wouldn't say it's necessary to bring your own computer but it would help because when it's finals time the library gets jammed pack."
College Sophomore,4,"I would really like if some of the students on campus had more spirit, but overall the team performance and fan support is great! "
College Sophomore,4,"There weren't really any challenges or difficulties, we were interviewed and the interview determined whether or not you made it into your program. The most important criteria was to have the required GPA and some experience within your major. The application process was normal and unusually easy, but you had to be ready to elaborate on the responses in your interview. My only tip for admission would be to know your stuff! "
College Sophomore,4,"Campus crime is at an all time low with our campus being less than 5 minutes from a police station. We always have officers riding around the campus to ensure that everything is fine, and if they aren't on campus you can call and have them there immediately. "
College Freshman,4,The Academic resource center and the math/writing center are a huge help to students. We are encouraged to talk with the professor if we need something or need help. Academics at ferrum are great.
College Freshman,4,There are clubs and organizations for everyone based on the major they are interested in.
College Freshman,4,"There is a large diversity on campus. Ferrum is kind of a mixing pot of all sorts from different religions, ethnicities, economic backgrounds and political beliefs. you are free to be yourself"
College Freshman,4,Its great but frankly dangerous and not well controlled. There is a ton of underage drinking.
College Freshman,4,They are pretty awesome and great for school spirit
College Junior,4,"So long as you stay away from the very few people who like to think their way is the only way, it's okay. No physical violence, more debate and reasoning and trying to understand each other's point of view. "
College Junior,4,The people versus the academics. The students are dumb as rocks and the professors cater to their needs. The academic program is wonderful and graduation is an almost guarantee at that job.
College Junior,4,"So long as you can obey rules and don't mind chaos surrounding you it's okay. Some places are louder than others, the RAs tend to vary on caring as well."
College Junior,4,I love my major I am art major love doing it to.
College Junior,4,Well I haven't did one yet hope to do one tho.
College Junior,4,My school is pretty good on keeping control of this.
College Freshman,2,"Students pay average for regular 2 person dorms, yet most of the rooms aren't air conditioned. Make sure to bring some fans."
College Freshman,2,Most students do smoke marijuana or take adderall on a daily basis
College Freshman,2,There is always something going on whether it be a stabbing or gun shots or a sexual assualt
College Freshman,2,It used to be amazing but people nowadays would rather just hang out in the dorms and drink. Cops have been becoming more and more of an annoyance recently.
College Freshman,2,I stay in Bassett hall and there is so much rust in the bathroom and it just looks plain nasty.
College Senior,2,"There is only a new Deli and Dairy Queen are nearby , everything else is thirty minutes away. No discounts."
College Freshman,2,To far of a drive
College Freshman,2,There have been several issues with guns being on campus and students being sexually harassed or raped within the dorm rooms. The large amount of violence that has occurred compared to the number of students on campus is outrages. The only available health clinic is a not a nurses office and is only a clinic that has very limited hours of operation. This created issues when I recieved a concussion my first semester and was not able to get to the hospital or see a trained professional.
College Junior,2,Our teams suck. we know it. we still support them anyway. the girls teams are consistantly better than the guys
College Junior,2,"Nothing like being queer in a religious school. No one really minds, until you flirt with someone who's never been in that situation. The people that are open are accepted, for the most part. "
College Junior,2,"Smell of pot escapes from entire buildings, students walk around casually smoking. Beer bottles litter the parking lots in the mornings and after weekends."
College Junior,2,"Most Greek life doesn't have housing and it annoys them. As non Greek I think some of their activities are a bit excessive without giving anything back to the community, other than noise pollution and used food."
College Junior,2,"Unless you make it to the restricted times of meals the dining hall is closed and enjoy your cereal. The other places are open till 11, but nothing opens until 3 on weekends. STARVE"
College Junior,2,I feel they should get new places to eat.
College Junior,2,Unless you're willing to pay to go to frat houses (trollville) it's easier to have a few friends over. Parties get busted regularly.
College Freshman,2,"Ferrum has really pretty scenery, so if you appreciate the art of it then you will love it. The school is sort of in the middle of nowhere, so it doesn't really have anything to offer. On the bright side Roanoke, Radford, Virginia Tech and Winston-Salem aren't too far away so we often visit those places. It's basically what you make it. if you stay on campus you can look forward to parties in the panthers den on Thursdays, Trollville on Fridays, and OXE on Saturdays."
College Freshman,2,"Most of the time i have been here it was either freezing cold or it was snowing or raining. It sucks being on a mountain. Classes never get cancelled, compressed schedules happen sometimes."
College Freshman,2,"the first day the food is great. After that they don't seem to care anymore, its the same thing every week and most of the time it's not all that great. They have some meals that are pretty good though."
College Sophomore,2,"As a freshman, my dorm is ok. One of the older buildings on campus.  The newer dorms are great."
College Sophomore,2,they don't have a bunch of scholarship opportunities
Alum,1,Did not have online classes while at Ferrum College.  Can't comment on thre experiece with online classes since they were not offered when I attended.
Niche User,1,"This school is a foolish investment with no guarantee of success after graduation. Financially the college can't possibly survive for the long-term. Faculty are teaching-focused, which means they are not required to conduct research or do anything scholarly. Scholarship is a fundamental part of college-level teaching. For the cost, you're better off going to community college for two years and then transferring to one of Virginia's excellent (and affordable) public universities. Don't waste your time and money at Ferrum."
College Freshman,1,Ferrum will do everything to not let you. Greedy
College Freshman,1,Particularly in the older buildings.
College Freshman,1,The closet town is 20 minutes away and the only available dining options are fast food and two sit down restaurants.
College Freshman,1,The shuttle is only available on weekends and is always very cramped. Some students end up sitting on the floor for an hour drive and because there is only one shuttle it is always late.
College Junior,1,Small apartments that aren't reserved for college students. everything else is run by the school.
College Junior,1,This is always a problem each time I have to fill out financial aid hope soon that I won't have to worry about it.
College Freshman,1,"Ferrum College is a very isolated school, in actuality it's pretty much the town. The only restaurants off of campus and in a good range is Del Rios (mexican food), and Dairy Queen. EVERYTHING ELSE is in Roanoke, 30-40 minutes away from campus. The restaurants don't stay open at the average college midnight snack time (midnight - 1:00 am) yet they do hand us coupons, and give us discounts because we are their primary customers."
College Sophomore,1,There really is nothing to do on campus at night. You have to go into Rocky Mount or go into Roanoke to do something.
College Freshman,1,Our Greek life is a joke.  Its not very intersting and its quite stupid if you ask me.
College Junior,1,"The town of Ferrum is very small, and has very, very few restaurants. I wouldn't call any of them classy. You're better off sticking with the dining hall."
College Senior,1,"It is extremely difficult to obtain multiple scholarships. Every student that I have talked with has received one from the college that usually covers about half of the tuition. At first that sounds amazing, but tuition is twice as high as most other schools, so you end up having to pay about public school price in loans. When I ask about scholarships, the typical response is ""I suggest looking online for them"". Very little help is given for financial aid searches."
College Sophomore,1,Nightlife is the bane of an academic student's existence. A lot of people will stay up till 3 or 4 in the morning blaring music in the dorms and yelling. It's very annoying. There aren't any close clubs for 18-and-unders.
College Sophomore,1,"Hard to Find – Don't come to Ferrum looking for a good apartment that is close to the college. They are far between, and most are taken. The school might help find one for students, but it wouldn't be easy."
College Sophomore,1,"They Try to Compensate – The town is a good half hour drive to any large city, so there are not many activities to do outside of school if gas is expensive. There are festivals in our small town whenever there is a college event where parents will be visiting. There isn't much interaction otherwise."
College Sophomore,1,"Greeks Are Practically Non-Existent – There are a few fraternities and sororities on campus, but there is only one national fraternity on campus and it has great service but it's not the most desirable fraternity to be in. The campus lacks a variety for sororities and fraternities. As for the ones that we do have they participate in hazing and the national fraternity does hardly anything."
College Senior,1,The food on campus in the dinning hall is horrible. It never seems to improve even when we vote on the food. We don't have a variety of food on campus. I would go into town and get something to eat or buy groceries.

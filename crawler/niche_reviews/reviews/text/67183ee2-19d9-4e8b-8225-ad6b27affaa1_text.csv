Junior,5,"The unique curriculum design with dedicated faculty, diversity, fellowship, and leadership made the choice an easy one to make.  I am thankful that I chose to attend Ripon College!  I know my education will prepare me for what lies ahead.  And the skills both on the soccer field and off, I know I can transfer my leadership skills to a successful career after graduation!"
Junior,5,I thought it was going to be a difficult transition for everyone to make from residential to online learning.  The college faculty worked quickly to develop a strong plan to keep the curriculum moving along seamlessly.
Junior,5,"I absolutely love Ripon College. Although class offerings are limited, extracurricular and internship opportunities are amazing.  I have scored a four-year marketing internship and been able to participate in so many life-changing opportunities including an all-expense-paid trip to New York City with the Investment Club to learn about the New York Stock exchange and tour graduate schools. Ripon also has a unique self-design major program that has allowed me to design my own marketing major with the guidance of the Office of the Registrar. Additionally, the school has a very high graduate school acceptance rate and has produced the highest-earning alumni in Wisconsin so I feel confident moving forward after Ripon."
Alum,5,"Ripon College is all about the people.  The faculty care about their students and their success.  In fact, it's not just the faculty; all of the staff care about the students and are always there to help them.  Likewise, the students are friendly, and, although there are Greek groups and athletic teams, it doesn't feel cliquey, like high school was.  There is much more interaction among stereotypical groups because you get to know each other in a variety of different contexts.  

The academics are outstanding, in particular the natural sciences which have incredibly high placement rates to medical and graduate school.  The communication department has won best department in the nation awards.  Aof the faculty are excellent teachers.  

The curriculum is easy to figure out, and, after 5 courses, you focuse on classes in your major or whatever else you'd like.  The requirements are simply and straightforward so it's easy to graduate in 4 (or even 3, as some of my friends have) years."
Sophomore,5,Ripon College offers excellent resources for every student to be able to achieve high academic standings.
Niche User,5,"As a parent, I love the small and close knit feel of the college. I know that my son is safe and has close relationships with his professors and his peers. The clique, “everyone knows your name” is so true on this campus. The advisors really help the students to achieve their goals and graduating in 4 years is the norm at this school."
Sophomore,5,"Ripon College is a really great school to attend if you're planning on continuing your education after high school. It's a really small school which allows you to build relationships with your professors and meet lots of new people. The professors really push you to work hard and think critically about many topics. The college places a large emphasis on including innovation, critical thinking, writing, and a few other really important skills in their curriculum since these skills are so sought after in the job market. The coaching staff is also really good with getting the most out of their players and care a lot about the academics of the students. The coaches constantly check in on their players to be sure they are staying up to date with their coursework and getting help if they need it. There have not been very many unsafe incidents occur at Ripon College since I arrived if there have been any at all. The campus is really small as well so everything is within walking distance."
Senior,5,"You certainly get what you put in.  There are PLENTY of opportunities that most colleges don't have; the key is to reach out to advisors and professors to learn about said opportunities.  Network early.  As always, practice good self care.  I'm torn on the tuition- it is QUITE expensive, though I personally receive a lot of financial aid.  Plan accordingly.  Professors are *GREAT*, especially in the Psych Dept."
Freshman,5,"I love being at Ripon. The smaller size helps me develop relationships with professors, and I'm almost guaranteed to see someone I know in my classes. Everyone on campus is so helpful and wants to see us succeed."
Freshman,5,"Campus is beautiful and ideologically diverse. If you're one for critical thought in all areas of life, this is a good place for you. The students are friendly, the teachers are always happy to help, and the campus is very dedicated to hearing the voice of its students. Overall, its a very nice place to be. The only real downside is the food, which could definitely use some work, but the local eat-outs are some of the best I've encountered."
Freshman,5,"Everyone, from professors to workers and students, is very friendly and welcoming. Since it's a small college is more intimate and personal in classes and other activities. All professors are very understanding and want to help their students excel."
Niche User,5,I loved it. It is a wonderful campus. The community is small and close. There are only 850 students on campus.
Alum,5,"I graduated 1.5 years ago, I was accepted to Medical School (MD) right out of college, but as a back-up, I had applied to jobs during my senior year and received 2 high paying offers (greater than 55k + benefits) within 2 weeks. Ripon really prepared me for Medical School and the job market. What really makes Ripon stand out is in connecting students with opportunities to build one's resume in college so they become excellent applicants for post-grad education and in the job market.  You have to actively try to not become involved in research, campus jobs, internships, or other resume building activities, while being a student at Ripon. The fact that I and several of my classmates were accepted into Medical School right out of college is significant. This is becoming increasing difficult to build a sufficient resume to be a competitive applicant after just 4 years of college.  But Ripon is small enough to give you those opportunities to build your resume in just 4 years."
Freshman,5,"Friendly environment with professors that care about your academic ability and I'm able to continue to play the sport I love, which is soccer."
Alum,5,"Ripon was the perfect oasis for learning. I was able to complete 3 majors and certify to teach public school students. I do not know anywhere else I could learn so much for such a cost. Every time I return for alumni events, I feel like I am home again. This oasis is definitely worth a look."
Alum,5,"I had to take a year off looking for work after graduating, I had graduated in 2015. I have had so many interviews at this point in the last 2 months, for very good, high paying jobs that it is ridiculous. I had to turn some positions down in fact. After reviewing other reviewers complaints, I am convinced that some students must not be properly applying themselves; because I know that my degree has more than paid for itself at this point. Overall in comparison to the majority of other colleges in the region, Ripon is fantastic."
College Freshman,5,"We have many different areas to study whether it's in your room, the lounges on each of the floors, the library, the pub, outside, etc. You are pretty much able to study anywhere you'd like."
College Freshman,5,Class sizes are just right. You can have one on one time with your professor. Everyone can express their opinions.
College Freshman,5,This campus makes me feel safe. I do not have any doubts that that opinion of mine will change.
College Freshman,5,"Everyone talks to everyone on our floor. Everyone is friendly and funny. We always have ""floor parties"" where we just hang out in the hallway with several people and listen to music, talk, play games, etc."
College Freshman,5,"You have many options and many oppurtunities at this school. Everyone, both professors and other students, are very kind, friendly, and welcoming on campus."
College Junior,5,One of the few things I love about this school is how safe I feel. I have never once been concerned to walk alone outside at night. It is easy to get to know majority of the other students on campus so you feel safe with almost everyone.
College Sophomore,5,"I have never once felt unsafe on this campus. I don't know of anyone who has been assaulted (sexually or otherwise). Theft has been a problem some, but that is as bad as it ever is going to get."
College Freshman,5,"Part of the small school atmosphere is that you build close relationships with a majority of people on campus. My room mate and I never lock our dorm door, and we trust everyone who might walk into our room when we are out. Every party I have been to so far has been a friendly atmosphere and even when alcohol is involved people are respected and given space if they want it. Overall people on this campus comprise a big family, and a trustworthy one."
College Junior,5,"When I started looking at Colleges I knew I wanted a small liberal arts school, and that's what I got, and I love it more than I thought I would. Ripon might not be very diverse ethnically but we have a huge social variation, economically, politically, religiously, that make for great discussion in classes. Professors are all very personable and willing to get to know and asisst their students. Yeah, the food's pretty bad, and there's more drinking than I expected, but those are thing that can be avoided.  There's a distinct lack of peer pressure to get involved in the party scene, its open if you want it and no hard feelings if you don't. Greek life is the same way, there might be tension between the groups but if so independents are still accepted everywhere and aren't brought into it. I like that campus wide issues are talked about campus wide, that we are small enough to have a running dialogue about curriculum changes and such. We recently switched to gender neutral bathrooms and there was a huge discussion and debate over it. I liked that dialogue, I liked how easy it was to get news and get involved. Clubs are easy to form and join, and so casual, everyone's really accepting. My main complaint is the cost, its expensive. Yet I would never have chosen anywhere else."
College Junior,5,I love my Bio classes and have fun!
College Junior,5,Great individual interactions with professors.
College Junior,5,It is easy to declare any major and getting into the classes needed to complete that major is very easy.  The professors work very hard to help every student succeed.
College Junior,5,I love being at Ripon. There are many great people on and off campus; I love the environment/atmosphere too! I talk about my experiences at Ripon all the time.
College Freshman,5,"If you put the work in, you will get a lot out."
College Freshman,5,"The local atmosphere is amazing!! Many local businesses offer discounts to college students, and the community welcomes us with open arms. There are tons of cute coffee shops in the downtown area, but many places close early and have strange hours. A grocery store is within walking distance. Overall, the community and campus are very safe places. "
College Freshman,5,"Ripon is a very safe community. There is what is called ""The Ripon Bubble"". The explanation is nothing bad happens in Ripon. Security does not crack down on drinking as long as you are not being belligerent. The police are only the really ones who really crack down. Health services are awesome and free!"
College Senior,5,"I love the athletics at Ripon College. I am a cross country and track athlete, so I have a first-hand knowledge of the sports scene. The majority of students on campus are involved in sports, which is a great testament to the quality of the sports programs. At Ripon, it isn't always about how fast you can run or how far you can throw-it is about your passion for the sport, and you willingness to work hard to meet whatever goal you have set for yourself"
College Sophomore,5,The rooms are larger than most I've seen on any other campus and they tend to be well kept. event he smallest rooms are big and nice. The best options are the sweets for freshmen only and the senior apartments though. Also people are usually very respectful off one another.
College Sophomore,5,The atmosphere is fantastic. It's a small town and everyone is friendly. The local churches host a free dinner for the students in the fall and the students are always helping out in the community.
College Junior,5,There are so many different cultures present at ripon college. Meeting and talkign with them is some of the best parts of being at Ripon. They are always very friendly and polite and willing to talk with you about Ripon or where they are from
College Senior,5,"I am extremely satisfied with my quality of education at Ripon.  The professors are very well qualified and very accessible.  They know all of their students on a first name basis, and are always willing to help whether it be with academics, letters of recommendation, or just about anything.  Class size is usually very small, making the class intimate and ripe with fruitful discussions.  Because most students get to know faculty on a personal level, they often become are helpful in networking and getting a job out of school."
College Senior,5,"It is extremely easy to get into any major here at Ripon.  The advisers and professors here get to know you very well, and will do everything they can to help you.  I came to college undecided on a major, and the help I received from my academic advisers steered me in the right direction.  I am an English major, and all I had to do was declare the major.  There were no prerequisites of any sort."
College Sophomore,5,I love my Major! The communication department is one of the most fantastic departments here. They force you to think critically and indefinitely encourage help from other students. I am happy where I am.
College Sophomore,5,There are a TON of off campus restaurants around campus that will defiantly cater to most of your cravings.
College Sophomore,5,"Due to our residential campus status, the school tries to accommodate the needs of the students. Although, there are many rules in our handbook, the RA's and security are pretty cool about letting things go. But, you shouldn't take their niceness for granted!!"
College Sophomore,5,There is seldom crimes that happen on our campus.People are friendly and the community is the same. I never feel unsafe.
College Junior,5,"Ripon College has made incredible efforts over the past couple of years to improve the facilities on campus. Everything still has a very old style feel which I absolutely love. However, on the inside, everything is quite new! In 2008, they added senior apartments and updated Todd Wehr by adding classrooms and new technology. This past year, Lane Library, Pickard Commons, and the Pub all recieved renovations and updates. These include new furniture, paint, and carpeting, as well as aesthetically pleasing set-ups for working such as quiet nooks and table areas. Everything done this past year looks absolutely beautiful and really adds to the campus."
College Junior,5,"The campus is very small and quaint in a good way that provides students with endless support and opportunities from other students and faculty. You honestly won't be able to walk across campus (which is only about a 10 minute walk tops) without getting a smile, a hello, and a 'how are you' from another student or professor. People on campus have a genuine interest in helping you to grow and will take the extra steps to get you to where you need to be. Ripon College truly lives up to its motto ""More. Together.""."
College Senior,5,Greek Life is very involved on campus.  Yes there are parties but it is not by any means crazy.  Greek life as a whole is viewed positively.
College Freshman,5,"Ripon rarely has any drug issues. Never have I seen anyone pressured to do drugs or drink alcohol. Everybody respects each others choices. If you are caught underage drinking or using drugs, there are different fines you have to pay, and depending on the severity of the situation, you may be expelled."
College Senior,5,"I'm a History Major at Ripon College and am happy with my education.  The small classes and easy access of the professors make Ripon a school that is personal, but professional.  Every professor I've had in the History Department is enthusiastic and knowledgeable about their subject area. They are there for you if you need help or just a word of advice."
College Sophomore,5,"My New Home – Though this is only my second year at school, I love nearly every aspect of my school.  My school is such a community, where professors take their classes to their homes for dinner. Here, a chunk of the community, including myself, ran a half marathon together.  Here, people wave to the UPS man and befriend him. I am counting down the days to start all over again for the upcoming year, where my friends and I can watch Doctor Who and Who's Line Is It Anyway? after slurping on a Pub soda, with our mattresses crusty from a hill surf.  Let it begin!"
College Junior,5,This is definitely the major to go with! The classes are interesting and not a difficult workload.
College Freshman,5,"I have always felt safe at Ripon. The security guards are very nice and friendly and always willing to help you out, from rides around campus to helping a drunk students. They make your safety their priority, underage drinking or not."
College Senior,5,Printing on Campus – You can print papers for free at multiple locations!
College Junior,5,"At first, the Greeks are judged by newer students on Ripon's campus.  You know, the stereotypical stuff seen in movies.  But once the school year gets rolling, it's easy to see how important philanthropy is to the Greek Groups.  There are several activities raising money for wonderful causes, such as Prevent Child Abuse America."
College Junior,5,"I Chose Correctly – Ripon College has become a home to me.  The campus is small which can be a hindrance, but it gives many additional academic opportunities.  It is also a very safe campus which is important to me!  Everyone looks out for everyone else, and I am not afraid to walk by myself anywhere.  Ripon just feels comfortable and inviting."
College Senior,5,"I love this school. I'm a senior and I am honestly going to miss this place. The professors are amazing, the friends even better, the residence halls are great, and there are a lot of jobs available on campus."
College Sophomore,5,"Ripon is an expensive school to go to. But everyone I know is receiving some sort of financial aid. Ripon has made my education possible through grants, loans, and scholarships. When I have had financial aid trouble, they have been able to answer all my questions, and ease my worries."
College Senior,5,Ripon College has one of the best and most supportive community/staff/faculty I have ever seen in my life. It feels like home every time you are on campus and when you leave you feel like you are leaving a piece of you behind.
College Junior,5,"Winter Fun! It's Wisconsin, so the winters are cold...but we love every minute of it."
College Junior,5,Computers are available everywhere with good Internet access. Love it.
College Junior,5,"People in Ripon are always helping each other, smiling, and friendly."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Great Labs – There are a number of labs around campus that are avilable to students almost all the time.  Most of the labs do fill up during crunch time, but there are a number of wifi hot spots around campus as well."
Senior,4,I am currently taking one class online. The professor uploads the lecture slides and we have to watch them on our own. Then we have weekly assignments due and quizzes every other week.
Senior,4,I like the people at Ripon College. The class sizes are small so the professors know who you are after the first week.
Sophomore,4,"Personally I enjoy the way that the school runs and how the academic programs are (challenging but rewarding in completion). Though sometimes there may be internal conflicts with some academic portions of the school between students, overall people who go there like it, but there is a high demand in money to pay to keep going. I would personally like to continue my College career there. There are many great minds there and great friends who will work together to change what is needed to be changed on campus, and receiving this scholarship would allow me to help those trying to incite change within the school system."
Sophomore,4,"Overall, the campus is full of many friendly students as well as teachers. The environment is very welcoming and has something for everyone to enjoy."
Freshman,4,The thing I like about Ripon College is the location it is in one of those little towns in the movie where everyone is nice and looks out for each other. As far as food in the college it is just like any other college poor they try their best but can’t meet everyone needs. School life is very good all the students are here for a reason and will make life time of friends and relationships for how close everyone is on campus.
Freshman,4,"Ripon College is a great small, private institution. It has a lot to offer for anyone whether they were an average or great student in high school because they offer countless resources for students to use in order to succeed."
Freshman,4,"Ripon is a a great college if you like small towns. Everything is very close, walking distance. Also, the campus is small and is a good thing considering it is in Wisconsin and the maximum walking time you'll do is 10 mins or less. Which is good because it is not fun to walk out in the freezing cold for a long period of time. Another great thing about Ripon is that the class sizes are smaller, so the student can get a more one on one time with professors. This is best for students who would need a little more help understanding something. Plus having a smaller class size the student can get to know each other more and create friendships and connection. Ripon college is a great choice if you want a small, friendly community to live in for four years."
Sophomore,4,Ripon College's small campus allows for you and your teachers to have lots of one on one time. Your teachers are also like your friends and always what to help you out in any way they can!
Sophomore,4,I like how ripon is a close community.. The professors are very helpful and the campus is absolutely beautiful. The college needs to have a better selection of classes and more of a variety of different courses for students.
Sophomore,4,"Ripon College allows a unique experience that not many other colleges have. Classes and small and professors really get to personally know you. The new catalyst program has it's perks, but needs to changed in some ways to allow for more of a greater learning experience."
Sophomore,4,"As a sophomore, I have enjoyed Ripon College so far. I feel connected with my professors, since there are smaller class sizes. I enjoy the smallness of campus and the town itself, it makes me feel at home. The food options have gotten better. It's a campus that give you that ""at home"" feel."
Sophomore,4,"It's pretty good.
I have nothing really else to say. Professors are pretty good, but the food sucks and there's not much to do on or off campus. Dorm perpetually smells of weed."
Sophomore,4,"Ripon has always been my dream school, since I began to visit it for state forensic's tournament she in high school. That being said, it really did meet my expectations. All of the professors are wonderful, kind, and knowledgeable, and I really feel at home on the campus. I've made great friends, and am a part of Greek life. The only thing I would change is for more attention to be paid to the art building. They're spending  lot of money and time on the gym, when our theatre literally leaks and that's  what we're known for."
Alum,4,"I graduated in 1983 but have been back occasionally and generally keep up with what's going on at Ripon.  My experience was that students were pretty isolated in a small Midwestern town with a modest amount of activities but a very safe area and very conducive to athletics if a student was so inclined.  As undergraduates students had excellent access to faculty who not only held PHD's but we're also very interested in teaching and helping student succeed.  
Greek life powered the social events during the Fall semester but indepents were welcome at frat parties too and most people got along pretty well. 
I have to laugh at some of the special snowflake reviews.  Lots of institutions of higher learning now boast dorms and amenities I didn't see until I bought my own home.  What's important is the above average graduation rate and the quality of education available to students who put in the required effort."
College Sophomore,4,"Internships are available and facilitated through the professors. Other than that, whether or not a degree is worthwhile almost entirely depends on the student."
College Student,4,I'm not worried about feeling pressured to drink or do drugs. I know students respect each other and won't treat you any differently if you do not do what they do.
College Student,4,I have heard nothing but good things about the public safety on campus and I do not have any worries about being safe.
College Student,4,"After having a few overnights on campus, I stayed in a dorm that will be the same as the one I am staying in next year and I love them. They are very spacious in my opinion and because of that very easy to keep clean. They come with desks, dressers, and closets which I really liked. There are different ways to set up the beds to create more space, and I also like how there is a common area for everyone to sit together if they chose to do so."
College Student,4,"When I first was being recruited by coach Lauren (my now new basketball coach), I had a great impression of her right off the bat. She told me how close of a team they were, and all the players got along great. They take time to do things together in the community, and are willing to help each other in the classroom as well. I know that in their conference, they had a team with one of the highest overall GPA's, which I thought was very impressive and it makes me confident that I will be able to succeed in the classroom as well as on the court. I am confident that when it comes to the sports aspect of college, I have picked the right team."
College Student,4,"I am very confident in the school I chose because throughout my whole process of recruiting and meeting with advisers and coaches, I have had nothing negative to say. I am confident that I will succeed at the college I have chosen and after my first four years as well. I know that the college I have chosen is the right fit for me, and if I had to go through the whole process again, I am confident my decision would not change."
College Freshman,4,"It has been a blast, and a real learning experience. It is definitely hard, but worthwhile."
College Sophomore,4,We have security on campus that patrols during the evening hours. We also all signed up for RAVE alerts that get sent to our phone if something has happened. We can also call that number if we need help.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a great variety of courses available to students on campus. Professors are encouraging you to take courses you are interested in, not just those in your major. Classes are challenging but not impossible if you work hard."
College Sophomore,4,"Although a small space, the rooms are well maintained and are often updated to make students feel comfortable."
College Sophomore,4,The family atmosphere is what drew me to this specific school. That feeling has continued to help me through the good and the bad times associated with college life. The classes are difficult but nowhere near impossible and the professors are always willing to help.
College Junior,4,"I would not call Ripon an easy school, but its certainly not impossible. The workload for courses makes sense for the level of the course and increases appropriately. Some of the assigned reading gets a little ridiculous depending on the class and the professor so as long as you are conscious of those professors and classes and avoid taking like three of those at the same time there is no reason the workload shouldn't be manageable. Classes are generally interesting. even the required course that you just have to sit through are engaging. General requirements are flexible and easy to meet within the first year opening up your schedule to do anything you want with. I've never felt anything a teacher asked for a class was unreasonable (some of the more enthusiastic professors can be negotiated with) and neither have I ever felt a class was just filler that I didn't get anything out of."
College Junior,4,"Ripon is tiny and I love that. The biggest class I've been in was maybe 30 people and the professor still knew us all by name and could have personalized conversations with us. The smallest class I was part of was six people and it was awesome, the professor could really focus on us individually and you got to know your classmates on a level that made discussion that much more interesting. It really made a difference as to what people were willing to say in class and I think that openness added something you just can't get in a large class. I've never had a professor who didn't know my name and I've never had a professor I felt uncomfortable talking to out of class. Running into professors on the street or in the coffee shop may be weird but never awkward. Walking into a professor's office I never felt unwelcome or like I was keeping them from something important. Ripon professors make students feel like they genuinely care about an individual's success, beyond just their class."
College Sophomore,4,"I feel that Ripon College is a very safe campus. Security vehicles drive around at night and RA's patrol the dorm buildings. Overall, I feel safe on campus, but I make an effort not to put myself in potentially dangerous situations."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall, Ripon College is a great school for students, faculty, and staff. There is a large variety of classes and majors offered to students. Professors are welcoming and passionate about what they do . This welcoming atmosphere is aided by the small class sizes in a majority of classes. My largest class had around 50 people with my smallest being around 10. These small classes taught by professors and not teaching assistants allows for a better, more intimate learning experience. In every great college though there are some flaws. One of those are the dining options. Options are limited and all similar because they are all sponsored by the same company, Sodexo. Often times food quality is only mediocre and is commonly mislabeled. This can be tolerable at times, but potentially harmful to those with food allergies. Overall, Ripon is a great college with a wide variety of opportunities."
College Sophomore,4,Living on campus at Ripon College is a requirement and would not be a bad option if it was not required. The rooms are nice and quite large compared to other schools I have visited. Rooms are determined by a somewhat random room lottery. Students with high GPA's are rewarded with a higher number and place in the lottery. The availability of rooms is tolerable and there are multiple options for everyone including those who choose last in the lottery. The one down side is that laundry is no longer free. With the amount we pay for room and board laundry it feels like it should be included.
College Sophomore,4,"Ripon College is a great school that has lots of class options and extracurricular activities. A large majority of the professors are open and very easy to approach. The passion they show can be contagious even if you are not interested in that area of study. Ripon, being in a small town, has lots of community involvement. Additionally, you know many of the people on campus because of the small size. Ripon College is a small liberal arts college with lots of opportunities for students."
College Senior,4,"The majority of professors are very knowledgeable in their field of study. Many try and make their lectures and/or material interesting and try to engage students with some activities during class time. The professors have an ""open-door"" policy, which is very nice and helpful. If the professor is in their office a student (or anyone) can knock on their door and talk with the professor about anything, whether it's during the professor's office hours or not."
College Senior,4,"I really enjoy Ripon. It is a great fit for me; I have been given many opportunities to do things I wouldn't have been able to do if I hadn't chose to go to Ripon, such as studying abroad in St. Andrews, Scotland for a semester."
College Freshman,4,"There is a sufficient variety of classes offered, but many of the ones specific to certain majors, such as anatomy and physiology or physics, are only offered every other semester or every other year, which makes planning for graduation difficult. However, since the college has such a small population there is a good opportunity of you building relationships with your professors and getting extra help, especially if you contact them outside of class/ at office hours."
College Freshman,4,"A lot of the degrees from this school are great preparation for graduate school, such as my biology-chemistry major will prepare me for medical school after graduation should I be accepted. However, there is a lack of opportunity to obtain relative work/ volunteer experience due to the small town/ distance."
College Freshman,4,"Although fraternities on campus are known for throwing great parties they also have very close brotherhoods between members and their loyalty is taken very seriously. I would say fraternities are more laid back than their female counterparts, sororities, but sororities are more inter-related/ friendly with each other. Fraternities on campus typically have a lot of rivalry, and it is difficult to associate yourself with more than one."
College Freshman,4,"The first semester of college seems to be hard for everyone. At first, I came home every weekend of college. Now, I am happy that I have decided to stay. I have made great friends. The professors here are amazing. They know almost everyone by name because the school is so small. They are all very passionate about their jobs and topics of study so it is very easy to learn."
College Senior,4,The professors and opportunities are the best.
College Junior,4,It is what you make of it. I enjoy it. Opportunity
College Sophomore,4,So many people are very friendly. The small town feel is great!
College Freshman,4,It was thankfully easy to get and accept aid
College Freshman,4,"Since the school is such a small one, the administration is able to work on a more personal level with students than at larger schools. This helps result in a very rational administrative staff at Ripon. If you act like a civilized individual and go to class, you will have no problems with the administration."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The closeness I had to friends, classmates, and professors was great, but there were many times I wish that Ripon had more of the facilities and opportunities of a larger school."
Recent Alumnus,4,The biology program is great because of the professors that are really willing to go the extra mile to help you succeed if you meet them halfway and try your best.
Recent Alumnus,4,"As a biology major, there's a lot asked of you. I wish I was more on top of my work and worked harder. The material isn't difficult, but you need to be a good and hard-working student to do well; being smart isn't enough. 

Ripon could have a fantastic biology and hard science program if they had better technology, equipment, and facilities at their disposal. Driven students can reach out to advisers and pursue summer research programs at bigger universities, but these programs are very competitive and difficult to get into."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Generally speaking, if Ripon students try their best, do what they have to do for each class, and seek help from their professor, they will do well in a class."
College Junior,4,Very vigilant and methodical in safety policies
College Junior,4,High game attendance and great school spirit
College Junior,4,Great opportunities for me as a Bio major.
College Junior,4,"I am a Psychobiology major.  I have a very easy time getting into the classes I want, and if there is a class that would have some conflict my professors work with me to get me into that class.  I have loved being able to work in both the Psychology and Biology departments.  There are numerous opportunities for me to get internships, I have just not had the time to apply as I am also involved in many other activities on campus."
College Junior,4,The strictness that is on campus is put in place to maintain the well-ness of the students.  During final exam periods there are 24 hour quiet hours in all resident  building to help students study.
College Junior,4,There are many things that are offered for students to do. There usually isn't a time when there is nothing going on.
College Junior,4,Ripon is the birth place of the republican party; it's in a small town; the town's atmosphere is very nice and the people on and off campus are friendly.
College Junior,4,Get your FAFSA done and turned in ASAP; it helps a lot.
College Junior,4,The academics are good. There are a lot of things offered and if the school doesn't have a major that you like you can create your own.
College Junior,4,The academics are good. They have many options to choose from.
College Freshman,4,"I feel safe on campus, which is good because there are scary paths."
College Freshman,4,I think that there is plenty of diversity at the school.
College Freshman,4,"It is a small town, but I like it. There is enough here that you don't have to make a big trip to go and get anything."
College Freshman,4,Everything is within walking distance otherwise there is a cheap taxi.
Senior,2,"Lack of programs to offer. It is mostly science, business, athletes, arts, and English. Which I did not have a lot of chooses. 
It is in the middle of nowhere. It is sorrunded with corn fields. You have to drive 20 minutes to 30 minutes to go to malls and places that you wanna be at. The school have small downtown, but it is for the community. I grow up in the surburb. There is a lot of stuff I go to aNd places I want to visit. Plus it is a small school too. The students are mainly white and the diversity is low. Another factor  I do not like about the school is the diversity. When I went to school for kindergarten through 12 grade my classmates are mix. I like seeing different people and share different culture. Students that are miniroties sticks together and those are my mainly friends."
Senior,2,"I can tell you that if you are thinking of going to Ripon, think elsewhere. The college is outdated and it does not give students the tools to be successful in the real world. "
College Junior,2,"This school is simply not worth what they charge. Ripon gives out excellent financial aid but even with that it still cost more than a public school that has more classes and only slightly larger class sizes. Even other private schools are better. I think Ripon needs to focus less on extra curricular activities and making the upper campus look nice and give more focus to the education that is actually important. During tours they do not even take you to see the quad, which is dorms you will most likely have to live in at least once. The school is also very one sided politically there are clubs for both republican and democrats however it seems to me that your opinion is unwanted if it does not agree with the majority."
College Junior,2,"When I toured Ripon I didn't think there would be a lot of drugs, sure I assumed drinking and the more minor drugs were around somewhere, but I thought the drug scene would be easy to avoid if you weren't interested in it. That's not really the case. While I never felt pressured to join the drug scene I can't avoid it either. Its wet campus and so the drinking and drunk people are everywhere on the weekends and impossible to avoid if you walk around on a Friday night. There's a lot more tobacco smokers than I expected, though policy is smoking cannot bee done within 15 feet of the buildings. Hardly anyone actually follows that and I have had to yell at people multiple times to stop smoking under my dorm window. We have a prairie that is often used as the place to smoke weed, which is popular on campus. Since much of the student body is liberal that kind of makes sense but the presence can be annoying if you're not into that kind of thing. Heroine is supposedly also a problem on campus, though I haven't seen evidence of that myself."
College Junior,2,"I'm going into my senior year and I have heard all these wonderful things about career building services on campus, problem is that's all I hear. No details on what office handles those things or where I even look up where to go for information. Sure there's a lot of internship opportunities but they're very specific. They are almost all in the sciences (some social sciences) and very few are local. As someone with neither a car nor a lot of many to live independently elsewhere in the summer, a lot of these opportunities aren't feasible options. And as a Humanities student the opportunities that Ripon advertises aren't even in my desired field. If there's more resources and opportunities on campus they are not being made readily accessible to the average student."
College Freshman,2,Ripon College is a division 3 school and therefore they do not offer athletic scholarships and athletics are not as prestigious here as many of the other nearby universities.
College Freshman,2,Don't know too much about it
College Freshman,2,Too many parties causing too much damage to campus
College Freshman,2,Starbucks and the Terrace are the best options. The Pub is okay and the commons is the worst.... the food just isn't good. And the fruit is never fresh
College Freshman,2,"Currently the food rating on Niche for this school is a C. I'd say that's a mite too high. Perhaps a D+, and that's because they at least put in an effort. After a month of eating the same thing cooked the same way, everything starts to get bland."
College Freshman,2,I am the longest legacy at Ripon College and I have disliked almost my inter experience while attending. Within the first month of being there my adviser told me I should not even be attending college based on the fact I have to many complicating health problems that were still trying to be figured out and he restricted me from enrolling into some courses based off of my health problems without caring what I had to saw about it.
College Senior,2,"Sexual assault is far to common and it is far to hard to go after the perpetrators in a way that does not destroy your ability to stay on campus. I know of far to many assaults were nothing is done. Greek groups live in residence halls, not off campus, and they perpetuate rape culture.  Security is a joke they are not even deputized and when there are bomb threats they do not call the police."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Aesthetically, the architecture of Bartlett/Great Hall, West, Smith, and East are nice.  Everything else is horribly outdated."
Recent Alumnus,2,"While it's great to have the option to have each meal on the meal plan, it would be so much better if the food was good. The variety and options at the Commons are often very dismal (food not hot enough, lack of healthy options that are palatable, obviously having better food on days when guests are on campus, etc). The board/meal plan is very expensive and I never felt like I was getting my money's worth."
Recent Alumnus,2,"As a girl into guys that aren't frat dudes or sports bros, the pickings are slim. There are a handful of guys that are good looking and not jerks, so I'm glad I found a good one and had a steady boyfriend throughout almost all of my time at Ripon."
Recent Alumnus,2,"As can be expected of any small Wisconsin town, Ripon is almost always boring and quiet to a fault. Also, please don't be swayed by the idea of ""charming small town locals"". They're not charming, they're racist.

There seems to be a rift between the college students and the community. It doesn't help that students rarely venture outside of the Ripon bubble."
Recent Alumnus,2,"If you live in Scott or the senior apartments, the housing is pretty good--you have an elevator, which is great if you're physically disabled. However, every other building is not friendly towards people with disabilities who need accommodations. 

The apartments are also the only housing facilities with air conditioning. 

The quads are pretty unpleasant. Bathrooms are clean but could use updating to seem less like I'm in a horror movie. In the actual dorm rooms, the laminate tile floors, poor wall insulation make the idea of noise proofing a joke. When I lived in the quads, I could hear almost every word my next door neighbors would say. 

Johnson is almost hopelessly outdated. Much of the furniture is nearly decrepit and need replacing. 

The cinderblock walls present in almost every dorm give a feeling that's way too institutional."
College Freshman,2,Everyone just lives on campus! It's better!!
College Junior,2,"The food here is horrible, sodexo is a horrific company to be using."
College Junior,2,It's horribly expensive to bring your car to campus and getting a permit is a hassle.
College Junior,2,There are a few mom/pop type places but most tend to be fast food chains
College Junior,2,It's not provided here. They prefer you to live on campus.
College Junior,2,The staff take their jobs way to seriously and you get a violation too easily even if you are of age.
College Freshman,2,"Most people are from Wisconsin, have parents or relatives from Wisconsin, or are closely associated with the state. Not many people from far out decide to go to the college."
College Freshman,2,"It's practically in the middle of nowhere, and there's not much to do off campus besides throwing yourself into tons of activities and greek groups, who you know everyone already and that makes it kind of boring."
College Freshman,2,"Not really anyway to get anywhere, if you don't have a car you aren't going anywhere."
College Freshman,2,"It's extremely cold, but it's Wisconsin so that should be accepted."
College Freshman,2,"Very few dining locations are coupled with everything closing around 5pm. Thus it is very hard to eat off campus, whose food is horrible."
College Junior,2,"The campus dorms are mostly old, but not poorly maintained. The contrast to that are the senior apartments, which are new and great to live in. The atmosphere in the dorms is great though, since most students live on campus."
College Junior,2,"There are very few place to eat off-campus in Ripon, Wisconsin, if you don't have a car. Watson Street is relatively close to campus and has some cute/nice places to eat, but the town itself really lacks a variety of restaurants or student discounts, for that matter. There's a student discount at Culver's, but it's pretty far from campus, so if you don't have a car, don't plan on eating at Culver's regularly!"
College Junior,2,"Ripon College is a pretty small school in eastern central Wisconsin - so naturally there's not going to be a lot of diversity. We do have some international students, which is great, but there's not a lot of ethnic diversity on campus, which is frustrating to a lot of people. People tend to be pretty open and accepting on campus, but then again, I think it depends on who you talk to. We definitely have the typical, mullet-wearing jock from Hicksville, WI, who isn't tolerant of much outside the ""norm,"" but those people aren't the majority at Ripon."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is expensive and there isn't a lot of it. What little parking they have is poorly located. In general though Everything In Ripon is so close together it is ridiculous to even have a car unless you plan to drive home on weekends or go on trips outside of Ripon.
College Senior,2,"As I have stated before, everyone has their cliques they stick with and dont usually wonder outside of them. The girls to guys ratio is about average but most girls here are either weird or not very good looking."
College Senior,2,Since the campus is small and so is the town not much transportation is needed unless going outside of town to go shopping or what not. Most places are near by so walking is the best transportation. besides that there is a taxi service that is relatively cheap if you stay within Ripon or bring your car or bike up would be the other ways of getting around.
College Senior,2,There are a few restaurants and fast food restaurants in the town but most places close around 830 so thats a pain if your hungry later or dont have time to eat until late. The food at most places is ok nothing special.
College Senior,2,"Athletics here are important but arent very good. The coaching staff for the most part knows what they are doing but there are others who are just not fit to coach college sports. Also the facilities are crap. The weight room sucks, we have to share a football field with the local high school, its a mess. This place would be a lot better with better facilities and a little better coaching. Most coaches are dedicated but dont know how to coach college athletes."
College Sophomore,2,"The only mode of transportation apart from walking or trying to find someone with a car is the taxi service, and that can be quite expensive. There aren't many places to go around campus, so the only entertainment is found in cities at least 20 minutes away, which would not be worth the taxi charge."
College Freshman,2,"Very cold in winter, hot in summer.. typical wisconsin weather."
College Senior,2,Social strictness is almost non-existent.  And academically the policy is not very strict either.
College Sophomore,2,"Our Own White America – Even with diversity clubs and general acceptance of others, most people fit one role: white. While this is certainly not a bad thing, diversity, whether of race, religion, environment, or otherwise, can bring people closer together, through education and experience. Most people at my college are white, and this fact may seem startling to some people."
College Junior,1,"Ripon College as a whole cares about one thing, and that is profit. There are a few members of the staff that are caring and helpful but as a majority they are not. The school charges more than other private colleges and offers less. We no longer have free laundry or printing. And parking has always been expensive. In addition to that they do not offer many classes. Computer science and a large portion of the Math department have been cut, in my opinion that is unacceptable. Those classes are all very important and useful while less useful classes have been kept. You are not allowed to live off campus ever and that is because Ripon College wants your money. For what they charge for a double dorm room and a meal plan you could rent the nicest newest 2 bedroom apartment in the area and have money for groceries, I have looked into it. Overall I have regretted every minute of my two years here, and no I will not be returning."
College Freshman,1,At Ripon College you are required to live on campus all four years.
College Senior,1,"You cannot register for classes online like most other schools, this is just so maddening."
College Senior,1,Just terrible there is not real off campus housing unless you travel as I do.
College Senior,1,Sexual assault is far to common and they are not willing to fix the issue.
Recent Alumnus,1,"In order to live off-campus, you need to be married and/or have children; live at home within 20 miles (or some other distance); are a formerly deployed veteran; or petition to live off-campus. I know people who have petitioned and it's not the worst process, but it's a lot to go through in order to be allowed to live off campus by the school."
Recent Alumnus,1,"If you want to have a fun party scene on campus, you have to make it yourself. Hang out with your friends and drink, watch movies and TV, play games, whatever. The most fun parties I've ever been to are ones where it's just a few good friends and some mild mayhem.

Most of the ""party scene"" goes on at the frat dorms in Mapes and Brockway. It's safe to say that the night life depends on this scene. The people at these parties are mainly either a)frat boy hosts, b)sorority girls, c)freshmen (for the first semester. They turn into later a or b if they still want part of the Brockway scene), and d) wannabe hangers on. On busier nights, these ""parties"" basically consist of dorm rooms stuffed full of people and booze. The activities that go on in these rooms range from dancing to drinking games to talking/hanging out, and watching someone play video games. When the weather is warm it's absolutely sweaty and disgusting. When it's cold outside, it's somewhat less sweaty and disgusting."
Recent Alumnus,1,"There is a disproportionate sense of importance that a lot of people place on our athletic teams, considering that Ripon is a D3 school. It seems like no one really attends sporting events other than athletes' families who live close enough and maybe their boyfriend/girlfriend if they have one. Simply put, students who aren't in sports don't really care.

Unfortunately, school spending on the athletic department does not reflect the interests of the majority of students. Recently, a very large amount of money was decided to be used to completely renovate the athletic building. Granted, it is an older building and could use some updates, but it is saddening that Storzer was given an update before any of the academic buildings or student housing buildings. Not everyone plays sports or regularly uses Storzer, but nearly all students live on campus and attend class at upper campus (not Storzer and Rodman)."
Recent Alumnus,1,"No matter what the Greek groups at Ripon do in the name of philanthropy, they cannot undo all the harm they do to the college and its students. Greek groups contribute to extremely poor, dangerous, and terrible decisions. Sexual assault, hazing, alcohol poisoning, and damage to school property are often perpetrated by not only members of Greek groups but independent students that attend Greek parties and events. 

While no one will contest that destruction and bad decisions occur at colleges no matter what, Greek groups actively encourage these disastrous behaviors. 

On top of all of the damage to health, property, and well being that Greek groups contribute to, they also act in a blatantly exclusive, elitist/classist, and sexist manner. Exclusivity, elitism, classism, and sexism have no place at a place of higher learning like Ripon. Potential applicants are excluded from groups based on arbitrary personal qualities. The amount of money and attention that sororities and fraternities require are extremely detrimental to students that cannot afford the dues or can sacrifice the time for meetings and events that these groups require. The explicit separation of the sexes between social clubs is absolutely backwards and unbelievably archaic at an institution of learning and progression. 

In short, Greek groups at Ripon are a detriment to the quality of the learning environment for students. The objectionable membership qualities as well as the well being of Ripon students. I feel that my experience at Ripon would've been much more conducive to learning if so many other students weren't tied up in Greek organizations."
College Junior,1,"Students are generally required to live on campus all four years.  The only ways a student can live off of campus is if they have a spouse, a child or live with his/her parents."
College Junior,1,way too strict involving alcohol and substances
College Junior,1,The residential staff is too strict
College Freshman,1,"There is a scale that adds plus two to every girl, because there are so few pretty girls that if you don't add two to their scale you can't justify going out with them. Many guys have to lower their standards. The very few girls that are hot are extremely stuck up and usually only date football, baseball, or basketball players. So overall just a horrible college if you are looking for girls. If your looking for guys, lots of attractive single ones."
College Freshman,1,"Just terrible, Sodexo is the food provider and they are cheap. I eat sandwiches and cereal daily."
College Freshman,1,School does not encourage and usually refuses to let students live off-campus.
College Freshman,1,Repetitive and not that great.
College Senior,1,"Housing is terrible. The dorms are crap and they charge you an arm and a leg for them. Plus if one little tiny thing is wrong they will charge you for it. There arent really any places off campus you can get unless you split a house with 5 or 6 other people but you cant get off campus unless your a senior. AND worst of all, they dont allow greek organizations to have houses so fraternities and sororities all live in the dorms with other independants which is the dumbest thing ever."
College Senior,1,If there were a lower grade than an F I would choose that. Ripons campus dining is the worst thing ever. The food is worse than dog food. I would rather eat dirt than eat the food we are served at Ripon. I absolutely hate it. It makes you feel horrible and you have to use the bathroom atleast 6 times a day and it is not pretty. They do not know how to cook at all. I can make better food than they can and I suck at cooking.
College Senior,1,"The nightlife at Ripon usually isnt very good. There are never really any ""parties"" and when there are they are either hit or miss. During the time that i have been here there havent been many epic or crazy parties. Yeah everyone has their stories but for the most part campus is super boring and there are really only two bars that people go to. In my opinion, I would have more fun partying by myself than if I went out."
College Sophomore,1,"There are virtually no-off capus housing options, except for living with your parents or renting an old apartment."

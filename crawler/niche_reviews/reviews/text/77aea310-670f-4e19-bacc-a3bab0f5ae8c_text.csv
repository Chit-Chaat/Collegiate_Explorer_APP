College Freshman,5,I received a tremendous amount of help from faculty at the school. Counselors were very helpful and were able to explicitly explain the details of my financial aid package.
College Freshman,5,The financial aid process was easy to complete with my parents and I. The only tips I strongly suggest is apply for financial aid as soon as it is available. I was applying for the Daniel's scholarship and I applied for my FAFSA the week before the application was due and my financial aid didn't go through and I could have been a potential scholar winner for the Daniel's.
College Junior,5,A lot of different ethnicities and race. Great for students to interact with one another

We have wonderful training and workout facilities, including our own trainers, psychologists, and academic advisers. IM sports are pretty huge, too, because anyone can play. We have some pretty diverse ones. Since our campus is pretty small, everyone comes to games, and participates in athletic activities."
College Sophomore,5,I will be looking to start an internship upon graduation.  I do not know how difficult it will be to get or if they pay for it or not.
College Freshman,5,Adams State has aleays been a safe place for me and i have not once felt scared of something or someone. The only trouble is if you leave your bike unlocked it will probably go missing.
College Freshman,5,Parking on campus is usually never a problem. The parking is free when you register and if you don't have a parking permit the tickest costs $25. If you dont have a permit there are reserved parking spots for students or vistors who live off campus.
Freshman,4,The class homework was all online and it works well. Cant complain at all about how it works! Really great way to turn in assignments.
Freshman,4,The staff really cares about the students. They truly try to help students understand the material and do all they can to help people get a degree.

Freshman,4,"I love the small class sizes at Adams State University. Because of how small it is, there is a sense of community that I wouldn't imagine you'd find at a very large school. It is very easy to receive help from professors one-on-one."
Junior,4,"I like the people not only of Adams State, but all of the people of Alamosa. Being a small town really helped me to connect with a lot of different people. I also enjoy the athletics here, although we are not the best at every sport, all athletes support one another and keep striving to better themselves individually and as a team. The academics here are also challenging which is good because some universities you pay for a degree, but don't learn much. At Adams, there is always something you learn everyday while preparing you for your future career. I've been to three different universities in three years, and I can proudly say Adams State is the best all around with respect to diversity, student life, athletics, and academics. It gets cold in the city of Alamosa, but it's a small price to pay for what this town has to offer."
Freshman,4,"Adams State is a great university to continue your sports career; where most of the students are athletes. Friendly staff, students, and people in general."
Graduate Student,4,I am pursuing a masters in school counseling at Adams. This is an online program that is CACREP accredited and fits my lifestyle.
Niche User,4,Adams State University is an extremely well-balanced school that attracts students from around the world. The diversity is excellent and makes for a nice school. The professors are always willing to help considering the class sizes are small and there are not a lot of kids. I would definitely recommend Adams State University as a nice place to further one's education.
Freshman,4,"I like that everyone here is so nice, they will help you with anything you need. The things I would like to see change is the food."
Freshman,4,"Although I am only a first year student, I have enjoyed the community and campus life that comes with being an Adams State Student. I have made so many new friends and connections, and the professors are always willing to help students in and out of class time."
Niche User,4,"I currently do not take classes in the University of Adams State, but I have been taking concurrent enrollment classes with them since my junior year in high school. I am pretty pleased with the concurrent enrollment classes I've taken and currently taking. I've visited the campus multiple times since I only live about 35 miles from the campus. I've visited it during school field trips and during exams for my concurrent enrollment classes. I can say that most of what they have is pretty nice. A few of the buildings could be updated. Many of my friends attend college there and most of them seemed pretty pleased with their college experience."
Freshman,4,"Just got out of the military last May 2017 and going to college for the first time at this school has been going great. The teachers are very understanding of my obligations as being in the Army Reserves and they are always there if one needs help or is struggling in the class. They are very helpful and have a lot to offer, especially workshops for my major. I do hope that students here should take advantage of the services offered in this school, may it be for tutoring, workshops, resume-writing classes,work-study jobs, and they even help students in need of food."
Sophomore,4,"Adams State University is a forward-thinking and progressive institution placed in a family-friendly neighborhood. The people that inhabit Adams are very warm beings and the professors are truly helpful and compassionate. As an athlete, the school does a good job of taking good care of us but not placing us above the other students. Though based in a small town, Adams is a great institution for any student looking to further the progression of their dreams and goals for numerous reasons!"
Niche User,4,"Adams State University, is a big college in the San Luis Valley. Great place to go to college, friendly. The view is amazing, the education is very good, and professional. Great programs, housing is perfect. A lot of scholarships they offer, for different types of students."
Freshman,4,"I really enjoyed how they offered my major and that they offer high school students the opportunity to attend their school while doing high school classes. The campus isnt the best i seen but it consists of many things to do, such as, the rec center, indoor track, work study, and many other things that can help you become a better student and or athlete."
Freshman,4,"I do like that it is a smaller university. I like that I can actually feel like I can connect to the professor in some way. I prefer smaller classes. It's a pretty campus, and it was very convenient for me. However, in my opinion the university seems disorganized, both with the in person classes and the online classes. I took a history class that I thought was a GED but it wasn't, and didn't find that out until I was almost done with the class. So now I have a history credit that I probably won't need. It was hard getting a solid answer from the professors or the people working at the student union building. The professors I had were all good though. I didn't have one that I necessarily didn't like."
Junior,4,I believe the programs offered by adams state allow a student to reach their potential only if the student pursues their studies wholeheartedly. The School has a very open and friendly campus that allows people to grow to their fullest potential.
Niche User,4,"I really enjoyed attending their ""Discovery Day"". I felt welcome and it gave me a sense of what going to school there would be like. I applied and received a quick response, so I've been accepted!! The only part that has been difficult so far is being able to speak to someone by phone after calling their Student One Stop. I received a voice message the few times I've called during business hours."
Senior,4,I love there campus it gets cold especial in winter average summer high is 75-80 degrees but in winter it gets really cold. small class sizes and you get to know your professor if you want the work a lot with you and offer a lot of school scholar ships.
Sophomore,4,"Adams state University is very good for people who like small town environments. The professors make time to get to know you because of the small classroom settings and they are readily available when you need them. The winters are brutal in Alamosa, but having good,clean facilities make it easier to attend class. With such successful sports teams at Adams State University there is also a lot of team spirit that makes it enjoyable when attending games."
College Freshman,4,My overall experiences with the courses and professors at this school is great because I get along with all of my professors and I learn something new in my classes everyday. I also really like that the classes aren't very big this helps me get connected with the professor.
College Freshman,4,The value of a degree at this school is important and many different classes are offered to help you find out which is the best for you.
College Freshman,4,The security on campus is somewhat helpful but I really don't see much security in the day rather than I do at night or on the weekends.
Recent Alumnus,4,So far it is good
Recent Alumnus,4,Everyone seems very friendly and helpful. The classes are convenient.
College Sophomore,4,"someone of my courses i really did struggle with because it was classes that I've never knew existed or i was not familiar with. however, professors do their best to make it enjoyable and they are always their to help in anyway possible. so its only as hard or as easy as you make it."
College Sophomore,4,the housing area is really great for me because of which dorms i picked. they allow you to meet friends and conntect with those whom you are living with and the RA's  are always there to help.
College Sophomore,4,"the athletics at my school are important to the athletes and the supporters , its what keeps people entertained and it shows our   school spirit"
Recent Alumnus,4,I like it there because you do learn a lot.
College Freshman,4,I wish we had more internship opportunities at the college and maybe even a shadowing job where we can get hours working with people around the community that are doing what we plan to do in the future.
College Freshman,4,I feel safe when I am walking from the library back to my room after being in the library late at night studying. I never feel uncomfortable or not safe. I have no problem walking to anywhere on campus because I never feel unsafe.
College Freshman,4,I would choose my school all over again because I fell in love with the campus on my recruitment trip and I do not regret choosing there after being there for a year. I love the people and the community. I can not wait to go back to school in August because I have made a life there and I can not wait to get back to it.
College Freshman,4,Cross Counrty team is amazing
College Junior,4,We have a taxi service and there are like 6 bars.

College Junior,4,"The campus is beautiful, my professors are awesome, and I enjoy being on campus."
College Freshman,4,"Living in the dorms this year was nice. I enjoyed the responsibility that came along with living here as well, all part of growing up and becoming an adult. It was also nice being invited to the activities and being close to them, being in the lobby, they were a great way to get to know more people and be with good company doing something other than partying on a Friday night!"
College Freshman,4,Adams State University is perfect if your not looking to go to a big university.  I love that all of my professors know me by my first name and the campus is easy to maneuver and there is still many clubs to get involved with and also many games and activities to get involved with as well!
Recent Alumnus,4,I am looking forward to the career I will have after ASU I will take advantage of our career center and other attributes to insure I have a career in the field I want after I graduate.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I have been happy with my professors and courses so far, as an art major it is a good school for an affordable price."
Recent Alumnus,4,Its good if that is what you are going to school for and the events are fun
Recent Alumnus,4,I have made a lot of new friends and become close with my professors.
College Sophomore,4,"So far, from an academic standpoint, I love ASU.  The professors care about their subjects, and they are usually very clear teachers in my experience.  The school also has a very strong sense of community; most everyone knows everyone which can be taken as both good and bad.  However, the San Luis Valley is a wasteland.  If you like to make quick runs to Chipotle or go grab a new pair of jeans from the mall, DO NOT move here.  The best we have is Wal Mart unless you want to drive 2 hours to Pueblo.  The only cool thing to do within range are the national parks.  Overall, I have enjoyed my time here.  The academics are awesome.  However, I wish there was more to do."
College Freshman,4,"Adams State has awesome facilities for every sport. We have a weight room for athletes that could compete with any weight room in the country! Football has a knew stadium, there is a new pool, we have a pressurized bubble for track athletes to simulate competing at different altitudes. Sports are very important on campus and the school administrators recognize that."
College Freshman,4,Once I made some friends and got used to the landscape I have really enjoyed my time at Adams State. The class sizes are generally small and the professors usually know all of their students by name and that is important to me.
College Junior,4,"I love the campus, the professors, and the experience I have received from Adams State University."
College Sophomore,4,Everything closes early. It is all fast food chain restaurants. I only know of two places that offer student discounts and that's El Super Taco and Arby's
College Sophomore,4,"It is what you make it. If you know the people who will be at the party, you will have a good time. It isn't all about drinking, it is about getting out of the dorms, unwinding from a long week, and hanging out with collegiate friends."
College Sophomore,4,It is what you make it! Living on campus provides a great way to make friends and connections with your community.
College Freshman,4,Most of the teams are average. The Cross Country and Track and Field programs are phenomenal.
Recent Alumnus,4,"It is not really a hassle to get the aid, but you need to apply early if you want to get any scholarships and should look for outside sources as the school's scholarships are very limited."
Sophomore,2,"Online courses at Adams State University are quite frankly a joke. Each week the instructor posts a 5-10 minute video explaining what is due, from there it is a self-taught program. I am in the Clinical Mental Health Counseling program and each week we are expected to read 80-100 pages of the textbook, plus 2-3 articles sent out as old PDF scans, watch a youtube video  that's anywhere from 5 minutes to 2 hours long, then participate in a discussion. Multiply this times the number of classes you're taking. THERE ARE NO VIDEO LECTURES PROVIDED. I am a visual learner and do not learn well from reading textbooks. Also, there is no standard format for using Blackboard, some instructors post extra assignments (not in the syllabus) in the Announcements or Discussion section instead of the Learning Modules, so many of us have missed assignments. If I didn't need the Master's degree to become licensed, I'd be better off watching free lectures online. Can't believe I'm paying for this."

College Freshman,2,Adams has a pretty serious sexual assault problem.
College Sophomore,2,"My tuition pays for updates like the REX stadium, the weight room and field house in Plachy Hall but, as a regular student, I'm not allowed to use any of those facilities- it is only open to athletes."
College Sophomore,2,"The caf is not the best place to eat. Of course it is eatable, there is not variety. I can't eat a salad or rice and vegetables for every meal just because I want to eat healthy. The flexi dollars is a good invention but I think we should get reimbursed what we don't use."
College Freshman,2,There are scholarships for the people in the valley. However I am out of state and there are hardly any for me! Its stupid!!
College Freshman,2,there is no police protection so late night events are unregulated
College Freshman,2,very limited selection and short hours
College Freshman,2,The Campus Police are not very good at their job. Most policemen are very unfriendly to most students. They do not make me fell safe whatsoever.
College Freshman,2,"Living on campus is pretty bad. There is no rule enforcement whatsoever. The Resident Assistant's (RA) do not enforce hardly any rules and the Housing department,that is in charge of the RA's, does not necessarily enforce the duties on the RA;s"
College Freshman,2,education here isn't the greatest
College Freshman,2,"one or two good places, besides that there's nothing"
College Freshman,2,One good party a month if that
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is no where nearby off campus that is really affordable unless you want to live with numerous roommates. I'm not particularly fond of living with tons of other people, so then the option is to live further away and that can be a big problem with traffic. Also if you have pets it is extremely hard to find an affordable place to live."
College Junior,2,Note nought healthy options. Small portions and cooked poorly
College Student,2,They act like they do not want me to attend.   Very SLOW to get back to you with feed back or answers.  My rep keeps saying that they have a lot of students.
College Student,2,"have been waiting since Nov of 20013 to find out, that's over 6 mos."
College Student,2,over priced housing and very little of it
College Student,2,The staff is overwhelmed with too much work
College Student,2,Call every other day to make sure they do not forget you. You need to PUSH them to get any thing accomplished.
College Junior,2,"Adams State University does not provide any transportation. Although all the classes are close in walking range, the only transportation is if the students have a car."
College Junior,2,"Finding off-campus housing is almost impossible, and if you are lucky enough to find something it is most likely overpriced."
College Junior,2,It is my belief that the Financial Aid department needs more staff. It is always overwhelmed.
College Junior,2,"Convenience is not the issue, since everything is relatively within walking distance of campus. However, the variety is awful, and I hear students complaining daily about needing new options."
College Freshman,2,You need a car or a friend with a car if you want to get anywhere in Alamosa. As a general rule it is too cold and too far to walk anywhere. And there are not enough quality sidewalks
College Freshman,2,"Sorry to say, but you really have to have a car to get around in Alamosa. Its not a big city that you can get public transportation. Theres only one cab here."
College Junior,2,I didn't have to pay in the summer 
College Senior,2,"If you like cold and wind most of the school year then this is a great place for you. Otherwise research other schools. Although, the outdoor activities are almost endless, the cold and wind can sometimes be discouraging."
College Sophomore,2,I honestly have never herd of any kind of transportation for students other than athletes.
College Junior,2,"It is extremely cold from about October through until about March. If you like the cold it's not too bad. Also, it is very windy here in the valley. There aren't many days when the wind isn't blowing especially come spring."
College Freshman,2,The campus police are out all day writing tickets for the most ludicrous of infractions and the most convenient parking lots are visitor lots
College Freshman,2,"It snows a lot and the temperature reaches the negatives more often than usual. Classes are far away, so when it gets cold it is extremely hard to walk to class and stay warm."
College Freshman,2,No transportation unless we have our own car or if someone is will to drive us.
College Sophomore,2,The adventure program offers rides to their events.
College Sophomore,2,Not great. Few options. No place to get a great burger.
College Freshman,2,Not Everything Is Good – from the meals i have had. most of the food is good. but there are just some meals that are not good at all. you can have things made to your like but the pre-prepared is not always the best.
College Junior,2,Wireless Service Not Reliable – Wireless service not reliable in the dorms.  Lab computers are good and plentiful.
College Junior,2,Its hard to find parking  in most places. Its hard to park close where you class is . Sometimes you get lucky .
College Junior,2,We have eight fast food places and  few  good restaurants they are  far from campus and some are expensive
College Freshman,2,Small Town School – the campus is getting a new make over and hopefully it doesnt affect tuition but builds a better learning atmosphere :)
Graduate Student,1,I was in the online Clinical mental health program and it was honestly a joke. There were some nice teachers but I learned next to nothing and the intensives were not helpful at all and down right unprofessional I felt I was being attacked as a person. Give this one a pass.
Graduate Student,1,"Unprofessional, harsh, not much welcome to outsiders and many bad professors. If you are not a local from colorado I would stay away."
Junior,1,"Adams has nothing to do and gets very cold and lonely once winter hits. Quality of academics varies based off of professors and major. Small school of 3,000 so small class sizes are a plus."
Alum,1,"I’m sorry to say that I was enrolled in and graduated from the Adams State University CRM MA program. My time spent in this program was nothing but a nightmare. The professors didn’t respond to emails or phone calls, they didn’t submit grades on time, and the course content was laughable. This entire program was a joke. The professors admitted that they didn’t have time to read the dissertations they were signing off on, and while serving on thesis committees they sometimes delayed scheduling student defenses for months on end. If you are thinking about enrolling in this program, DON’T! If you do, you will not be paying to further your education, you will be paying for a worthless piece of paper that you will have to fight to get. You will constantly be begging the professors to do their jobs. This degree WILL look like an academic blackeye on your resume."
College Freshman,1,no one is in it
Recent Alumnus,1,"We do not have any at Adams State, I do not know any Greek students."
Recent Alumnus,1,Forcing me to answers these questions is dumb considering we don't have this at Adam's state
College Sophomore,1,"I absolutely hate the athletic programs at this school.  Firstly, if you want to see a team win, do not even bother with our sports unless its the running teams.  Secondly, all the athletic facilitates are for athletes only.  Everyone else is pushed into the Rex and it is overcrowded and frustrating.  Thirdly, athletes are heavily favored by certain professors at this school.  If you plan to go into any HPPE (majors such as exercise science, sport psychology, and coaching) plan on consistently being taken advantage of (if you are smart) by lazy athletes not willing to do the work.  Also, prepare for the professors not to care that athletes never show up to class, and give them an A anyways.  The favoritism here is so strong, it is sickening."
College Freshman,1,we don't have Greek life that i'm aware of.
College Freshman,1,The food in the cafe is terrible. The only good time of the day is breakfast because the make omletes to your liking. Every other meal though is disgusting. There are never great options for lunch and dinner and the food tastes horrid. I am always sick from the food.
College Freshman,1,"don't come here, were in alamosa in the middle of nowhere i can't wait to leave"
College Student,1,I applied the first time in 11/ 2013 and NEVER was contacted by to college.  It took a years of e-mails and they still were not very helpful but they are slow.
College Junior,1,This town is perfect if you love the outdoors and really hate shopping.
College Junior,1,The campus is small enough we don't need campus transportation.
College Freshman,1,"We have no Greek life, so I guess you could say the Greek life is bad?"
College Freshman,1,"There are no transportation options that I know of, but the town is so small its walking distance basically anywhere in town."
College Freshman,1,Alamosa is a small town and McDonalds is the only 24 hour restaurant.
College Junior,1,It is practically impossible to get financial aid if you are not a minority group. The school makes those who are not usually considered minorities the actual minority by hardly helping them.
College Freshman,1,"At Adams State College now a university the campus has a very diverse student bosy. Since the school is made up of mostly athletes students are accepted the same. We do have kids from different countries so relgion, political beliefs have a wide range."
College Junior,1,It Okay but It Could Be Better – Adams State University  is good for students that don't have any disabilities . I have a learning disability and they have anyone that is qualified to help me with my dyslexia. It makes it really hard to pass the harder courses with decent grades. They should teach professors to recognize the students who are trying and might have a possible learning disability. They should  make it fair for all the kids because its not their fault that students might have a potential problem and get discouraged because they are putting in the effort and not making the grades

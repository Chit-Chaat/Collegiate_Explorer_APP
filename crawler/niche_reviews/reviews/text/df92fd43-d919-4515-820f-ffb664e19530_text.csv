Junior,5,I like being able to take classes online at my own pace. It makes my life a lot easier with balancing a full time job and full time schooling. I am someone who really needs the flexibility so I am thankful that this university provides that
Senior,5,"With everyone basically being forced into online learning this past year, the professors adapted very well and were very understanding with many things."
Junior,5,"All of my classes have been online with Wilmington University. Canvas is your one-stop shop for knowledge related to all classes within the semester. Class syllabus, assignments due, discussion boards, group chats, announcements from professors, professor contact information, etc. are all available under each class tab. Professors quickly respond to questions via email and make connections with students in order to help them succeed. My professors checked in with me often during COVID-19, which showed how much they cared. Although this was my first year taking online courses, I could not have asked for a better experience!"
Junior,5,"Excellent resources available at your fingertips via Wilmington University websites. Utilizes Canvas which helps tremendously with online classes, clear lay out of what is expected. Advisors are informative and caring. Most of my credits were transferred from another college, easy process. Overall five-star university."
Freshman,5,"Wilmington University is a great experience! I have just now finished my first year here and I loved every minute of it. I was on the cheerleading team and atmosphere was so fun. All of the professors at Wilmington University are so genuine and will help you succeed in your classes. If you go to them after class or email them they are always there to help you out! I am returning here for the fall semester and cheering again and also continuing my education. I got good grades both semester and my GPA is a 3.93. Even after all classes got moved to online, and some were harder than others I still tried really hard. First semester I made Dean's List with the help of my professors! They all truly care about your studies and pushing you to only become better! I love this school and I am happy that I get to go here next year."

Alum,5,"As a mother who works full time, Wilmu was the best choice for me to obtain my post bachelors paralegal certificate. Every professor in the legal studies department was top notch, and I feel truly lucky that I had a great experience. Hard work pays off. Wilmu is incredibly affordable. I received a better education here than I did when I attended University of Delaware for my B.A. and Masters."
Freshman,5,I am still just starting out at Wilmu but so far my experience has been phenomenal! Everyone is so helpful and they really care about your success. I never thought going back to school after many years  would be as easy as they made it!

Alum,5,I really enjoyed my time at Wilmington University. The Psychology program was challenging and engaging.
Junior,5,"When I started my classes at Wilmington university I had to take some time off from classes due to a knee surgery.

The professors want to see you do well in their class and take their job personal which I amazing."
Senior,5,I love the opportunity to take accelerated courses so that I can finish my degree in a timely fashion.

Their block scheduling is also very helpful, it allows me to take online classes one at a time."
Senior,5,Great place to study. My classes are online and I love it. tuition was about the same as all the other local colleges and universities in the area.  Teachers are great and very helpful.  you are never in the dark about anything as they are always available.
Graduate Student,5,"I love attending WilmU.  The academics are generally one day a week classes and it allows you all week to study, as well as work.  The campuses that they have up and down the state are awesome.  I really feel like a student, not like just a number like many feel at other schools."

Senior,5,"Wilmington University is a great school; however, it is a private school so it is a little pricey. All of there classes can be taken online. The staff is very helpful and willing to help."
Junior,5,"Great school! Instructors are very helpful and professional. You basically get out of it what you put into it. If you want to be successful in your career you have to put in the work, time and effort. The bookstore prices however are outrageous. I think that for struggling college students the prices for books and school supplies should be a little more reasonable."
Freshman,5,The professors are very understandable. Wilmington  University has mentoring for those who struggle in any subject as well.
Senior,5,The school worked very efficiently to ensure my transfer would go through as fast a possible. It took one day. The classes are broken down into three sectors. 15 weeks and 2 blocks of 8 weeks each. Everyone I have talked to has worked out well and I am enjoying my time at Wilmington U.
Alum,5,I had a great experience for my university.  I was able to navigate various areas of my degree with my the assistance of my adviser.
Senior,5,I am taking my classes online through Wilmington University. There is a awesome opportunity to take classes on there adjunct campus near me. I can go to classes in Glassboro or Vineland. I did a lot of research about getting my bachelors degree in Nursing and Wilmington University made the most sense when it came to cost and location and the online flexability.
Junior,5,"So flexible with schedule and family. I am able to work full time, raise my daughter by myself and go to school."
Freshman,5,"Wilmington University is a phenomenal school to start to earn your degree to get to your career of your dreams. I was a on-campus student for a semester, but turn to online, so I can help out my family at home. During on-campus, the food was excellent and the staff were very nice. My teachers were very helpful when I was stuck on an assignment. I really donâ€™t have anything to comment that needs to change because everything, for me, was an tremendous experience. Now, being online is a very convinent way to have me being at home for the family and I can take my time to complete my homework for the week, in which can help me still study for my degree."
Niche User,5,What I like about Wilmington University is that the class schedule is very flexible with your work hours.

Senior,5,"Wilmington University is great for students who want to go back to school or continue their education, but feel as though they do not have the time. I cannot stress enough how flexible their scheduling for classes are. As an added plus, you can receive a bachelor degree in as little as one year with the ""block"" and ""modular"" class option. I personally chose the online route, and it was very helpful for me with keeping a full-time."
Graduate Student,5,I am very excited that I chose to be a part of Wilmington University's Higher Education Ed.D program! The school offers a great mix of professional development and intellectual nourishment.
Junior,5,"My experience at Wilmington University has been amazing. I am an undergraduate in the College of Technology. The staff is extremely helpful and friendly, they genuinely care about their students' success. There are abundant resources from the computer labs, to the library, and online resources. The courses are affordable, tailored to fit in any schedule, and actually helpful! I have never taken a class at Wilmington that I haven't used in further studies or work. They also have a wonderful co-op program that helps you get hands-on experience while getting class credit AND getting paid."
College Sophomore,5,class rooms are max 25 students they are very easy going and easy to learn
College Junior,5,Very Safe college to attend.

College Sophomore,5,I have had a great experience at my school.  The teachers are so knowledgeable and always there for the students.  The extracurricular activities are fun as well as being a service to the community.  The campus is beautiful and the layout is very accessible to the students.  It being at the beach doesn't hurt either.
College Senior,5,they do open houses pretty often and they give you free registration. it's so easy to fill out and they are really nice and helpful
College Senior,5,"this school isn't expensive, so i was skeptical about what i would get. the teachers are so nice and professional and really help you out even for things outside of class like the GRE tests. This school watched out for you and interacts with you. i really feel like i'm not just another tuition check."
College Junior,5,The faculty is amazing and the rolling enrollment is a major plus!
College Junior,5,I love my major and the fact that it is all online.

The other staff, such as the academic advisors are so helpful and help to relieve a lot of stress. I have recommended Wilmington University so several people and will continue to do so."
Freshman,4,Iâ€™ve taken a few classes online and had good experiences. Online learning is not a strength of mine but my professors were always very helpful.
Junior,4,Offers both in person and online classes for those with busy schedules as well as scholarship opportunities
Senior,4,I have very much enjoyed my time at Wilmu so far. My only request would be that they offer more classes during the day. I travel from New Jersey and only had a few options for day classes.
Sophomore,4,"I love Wilmington University. Very kind and helpful staff. I have never been to a school where the staff was so active and caring about their studentâ€™s especially at a time like this as the corona virus has affected many students learning. Although I struggle with some online classes, the professors always answer with any questions and at a reasonable time"
Sophomore,4,"Regarding my online experience, I have struggled with computer applications and am not well with online classes. However, when I started all my classes online because of covid-19 my teachers have all been understanding of what is going on and has kept contact with us. I have gotten straight Aâ€™s for spring 2020 because of the direct messaging and emails with amazing timing of my professors."
Sophomore,4,"I transferred to Wilmington University from Grand Canyon University. I'm so glad I did. It is cheaper, closer to home and it seems like it is more flexible. The work is easy, yet challenging. Financial aid is great. They answer every question I have had."
Junior,4,"Wilmington University offers a diverse experience where professors actually work in the industries that are associated with the degree programs that are offered. It is affordable and flexible, while offering the same advantages in a job market that one might expect from a state university."
Freshman,4,"Great school and resources for students.  Some classes were too packed for my liking.  I rather be part of a smaller, intimate setting."
Senior,4,"I was a midyear transfer at Wilmington University and I love it. I currently play collegiate volleyball for the school and I am easily able to go to practices, have a job and go to classes because the school offers a lot of online courses. The only thing that I would change is the fact that there is no on-campus housing."
Freshman,4,"I like that I get to live off campus my freshman year and there are no restrictions with having a car on campus as a freshman.  The school is small and the majors lead to good internships.  The atheltic department makes sure that student athletes register on-time and receive extra help from advisors to pick the right classes and stay on track with graduation requirements.
I don't like that the school does not offer a lot of money for scholarships."
Senior,4,I have had an overall great experience so far at WilmU. Professors have been extremely helpful and expect a lot from students. Their block scheduling and online courses have allowed me to work full time and be a full time student.
Graduate Student,4,I do online school for my post-grad. The system is easy to use. There has been no contact with any advisors since enrolling though so you must check to make sure you are on track
Freshman,4,I enjoy the flexible schedules and being able to work part time while also attending school. I dislike the grading system and how itâ€™s different with other colleges.
Sophomore,4,"I love this college. love the professors, and the peers really want to learn too! Security could be better. I get nervous walking myself to my car at night, some classes run until 10:30 at night and that's scary to walk across numerous parking lots alone with Noone else to watch your back."
Sophomore,4,"As a transfer student from UMUC, I have enjoyed my experience with WilmU thus far. WilmU offers many different ways to take classes including in-person, online, hybrid, and recently developed web-cam participation. Though I have had a couple of professors that I would not typically prefer, all of my classwork has been challenging and rewarding. I have taken all of my classes online so far, but I may attend an in-person class in the near future. Even with taking classes online, there is ample opportunity to participate in on-campus events and meet other students. So far, every class I have been in has required a video introduction, which has allowed me to connect with my classmates. There are several different clubs, groups, and sports teams. WilmU really wants you to be a part of the college experience, even if you are a distance learner. I have always been under the impression that my intellectual success is a priority to them. I feel like I am more than a number."
Sophomore,4,My experience has been pretty good.I pay my own way though school so when I'm there I'm focused. The teachers. have been helpful and they work with me on very often.
Junior,4,"I really like the availability they had for classes and the lack of stress from taking online classes.  The counselors were fantastic about answering my questions and concerns, not to mention, they responded quickly."
Junior,4,"They go out of their way to help students be safe, even online students. They offer safety courses like defensive driver courses online and they made it mandatory to watch the sexual assault and careful with alcohol levels video. They staff and teachers all care about students and do their best to help them be successful in their classes."
Junior,4,"The professors seem to care a lot, although some of them are unorganized. The main campus itself is intimate. It also has a 99% acceptance rate, so if you don't get into UD, WilmU is an excellent alternative."
Senior,4,I am currently an senior at WilmU and I love it! I transferred over from a 2 year college and I couldnâ€™t have picked any other school! The professors and classes are awesome.
Sophomore,4,Over all Wilmington University is a very good college. The professors are extremely helpful and really give you the time you need to complete assignments. Overall it is a good place to get into the mindset of getting stuff done!
Graduate Student,4,So far my experience has been excellent.  I love the flexibility of their block scheduling which allows me to take multiple classes without separate from one another.  The professors use their real-life work experiences when teaching the class instead of just teaching from a book.
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at Wilmington and I have to say that I really like it. The classes are small so you definitely get the one on one attention from the professors. I am also on the volleyball team and I have to say that they athletics here are very excited and its definitely worth coming out to games. The academics are not very difficult but I still feel like I'm getting something out of each class. There is not a cafeteria per say, but there is an Italian Kitchen and the food is very good. The overall area of New Castle is not the prettiest, however there are many things to do.  I am proud to say that I go to Wilmington"
Freshman,4,"Love the food and many professors!  English classes are famously bad, though.  Great tech college, all-in-all.  Definitely good for the price!  Just watch out for a few English profs."
Junior,4,"Wilmington University is a great school! I attend 100% online, but I am always able to get in contact with an advisor for help and assistance. The courses are flexible and is scheduled in block format (7 week courses). Although I am only taking one course at a time, Wilmington University (WilmU) motivates me to continue to further my education. I love this school and it has so much to offer to my education."
Alum,4,Great school for working adults. Their online degrees are well organized and courses are relevant to the field of study. I just completed my Bachelor's in Behavioral Science all while maintaining a career and family.
Graduate Student,4,"The staff's commitment to education is awesome!  The tuition is very reasonable; however, I would love to see more scholarship opportunities in the future."
Freshman,4,So far my experience here has been pretty good. All of my teachers have been supportive and I have had no issues. I have been learning a lot and am looking forward to my next classes.
Junior,4,"I transferred to WilmU back in 2014. I fell in love with the school immediately. The professors were very supportive and strive to help every student reach their best possibilities. I love the fact that I could go to my full time job in the morning, and go to school full time in the afternoons due to the block classes they provide. If I could change one thing about WilmU, it would be the athletic department. I would love to go to a football game and cheer for my school lol..."
Junior,4,"The college has a very good learning environment with the computer labs, teachers, and fellow students are very nice!"
Alum,4,"As a senior at Wilmington University, I've had a good experience especially during the process of being awarded financial aid. My professor as professional and are fair when it comes to grades."
Junior,4,"Overall experience is good if you are a student  looking to further your education while you are working.   They offer flexible course options, online, fusion, 15 week & 7 week classes."
Sophomore,4,Wilmington University caters to international students as well as working students. I like the fact that I can schedule classes around my schedule.
Sophomore,4,"Wilmu is a great school, depending on which teachers you get. 30-45% of the teachers really care about your education, and if you use your degree after graduation. Those handful of teachers make it worth while. The food is ""meh"" and overpriced. Not much to do on campus."
Graduate Student,4,Professors take an interest in student success and help them succeed.  Smaller class sizes make for more intimate learning.
College Sophomore,4,career office is the best they help with every need u have
College Sophomore,4,there are security blue lights everywhere and officers
College Sophomore,4,i love how my school makes me feel welcomed and its easy to talk to all staff and students. I would choose my school all over again because it is affordable and felxible with work and curricular activities. It a unique school because it has a little bit of all age groups.
College Junior,4,I enjoy watching the sports events.
College Junior,4,The classes are perfect size; not too big where teachers wouldn't be able to assist each student! There are many different programs to choose from and you have amazing advisors to lead you down the right way.
College Junior,4,"School so far has been good especially transferring to a new university! The transition has been good and I am now satisfy with the school that I am in. The teachers are amazing & helpful and the tuition isn't too bad compared to other universities. I changed my major to business because of the great program my school has. Overall, I look forward to my remaining two years at Wilmington University"
College Senior,4,All the staff and educators at Wilmington University are friendly and helpful when it comes to the success of the students.
College Sophomore,4,So far I am very impressed
College Student,4,I feel completely safe while attending Wilmington University. I have never seen or heard of suspicious activity. It is very clean and has security guards on campus during all hours of operation. It is very safe and I don't feel threatened at all.
College Student,4,I am currently majoring in Psychology at Wilmington University and love every second of it. I love everything about behavioral science and the world of the mind and behaviors. The quality is great and I have learned more then I thought I ever would have.
College Student,4,"I have had so many smart and fun professors at wilmington University. I have had all different kinds of professors from doctors, mbas, msws, and so many more. They are willing to work with you and really show that Wilmington has a very positive outlook and it shows with their professors. I love this school and have not had one bad professor yet."
College Student,4,The teams and players are like families. Everyone gets along very well and along with the coaches. Wilmington has great recognition for success in their sports and they take high pride and dedication to do so!
College Student,4,I would have to say i love that Wilmington University has online and in class courses that is flexible. I have had some of the nicest professors and they have a great staff of employees there.
College Junior,4,Wilmington University is great and affordable
College Senior,4,"Although I haven't had the best experience at my school, I can honestly say that I have learned a lot through the work in my classes. I have liked all my professors and have learned a lot from them and from my fellow classmates which is ultimately what matters."
College Senior,4,I have found that making connections with professors is the best way to ensure a future job and career.
College Senior,4,"I feel completely safe when attending class on campus. Everything is well lit, and there is always a presence of security."
College Sophomore,4,"My overall experience at my school so far is great. The professors and other staff I've encountered thus far are both friendly and helpful. They're always willing to help whenever and wherever they can. The professors encourage their students to express their opinions/ideas about certain topics we discuss together as a class. If I had to do it all over again, I would most definitely choose this school again. The atmosphere of the college is welcoming, and I appreciate that."
College Senior,4,I'm very much enjoying my time at WilmU!
College Junior,4,"I like online courses and the professors are very helpful and some professors make you fill out a self-expectation form, which gives you an idea of how you expect yourself to do in your courses. Professors are very helpful and interactive even online. I love it."
College Senior,4,"everything is close together because it's kind of a small area. the food on campus is bad, but there is enough diversity off campus to change things up a bit. there a few restaurants that I've heard of from the other students here that have really hit the spot."
College Senior,4,"parties aren't my thing but when there is a get together, it's usually fun and everyone is pretty friendly"
College Senior,4,"they have some good teams, but the school spirit is a little lacking from the other students."
College Sophomore,4,I transferred from Delaware Technical Community College and plan to stay at Wilmington University.  The staff is so through and very customer service orientated.
Graduate Student,2,An in person class was made available online and the lecturers were soo clueless about what they were doing
Graduate Student,2,"If you are looking to just get a certificate at a low cost this is for you but if you really want to learn and gain some knowledge trust me this is the last place to go. Lecturers are sometimes clueless about what they teach and just enjoy reading of power points. You will be teaching yourself in entirety, the campus is nice but the faculties are just full of prejudice and lack any cultural competence in the performance of their duties. Most of my colleagues liked it because of the low tuition and regretted committing to it at the expense of quality. Not to say there are a few good lecturers but the majority are just persons hired/given a job upon graduating from the institution."
Senior,2,"I dropped a class on the final day of the deadline. With 4 classes left to obtain my BS, they charged me for the class. Now, Iâ€™m unable to continue because itâ€™s not in my budget to pay the debt, which has also affected my credit score. Iâ€™ve lost so many promotional and career opportunities. When I do finish, I wonâ€™t continue on with them for my Masters."
College Junior,2,I don't know if there is housing. I don't think so.
College Senior,2,I'm getting stressed over everything and I try too hard for little results
College Junior,2,Not much Greek Life on campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Wilmington, Delaware is this country's seventh least friendliest city. Enough said."
College Junior,2,ITS RIGHT OUTSIDE THE GHETTO
College Junior,2,There are limited greek life on campus. I dont even know who or what type of greek they are.
College Freshman,2,"I recently started school. I am a college freshmen and I enrolled during the Spring semester. This particular Winter we have been hit super hard up North by the snow. The parking at my school is terrible. There is an alright amount of parking spaces before most people have to be in class (around 9:00/9:30 but at our peak times... parking is terrible. To make things worse when it snows and we are stuck having class, we have to park around the corner by the church and sometimes even in the elementary school parking lot and get bussed over! The weather has definitely been having a negative impact on my college experience."
College Sophomore,2,"Chain shopping, very little out door activities and no culture"
College Sophomore,2,Very little variety. Mostly chain and fast food with limited healthy options
Recent Alumnus,2,I have not attended a single game throughout my college years.  I focus on my own academics.  I have seen the stadium full at different times and I have seen advertisement for students to come out and support.  
Recent Alumnus,2,Parking could be a potential problem based on the day and time of class.
College Sophomore,2,All students have access to a free computer if it is necessary during class. However these computers are pretty basic and stone age.
College Junior,2,"There isn't really much of a life for parties out here. There are only two to three dances a year at the university and regular campus activities, but no greek sororities or fraternaties."
College Junior,2,there isnt much night life for students under the age of 21. every once in a while in athlete will throw a get together but thats rare
College Sophomore,2,It is a small college.  I don't really pay much attention to sports.
College Junior,2,"The food in Wilmington University is very good. However, the prices are outrageous. They got to keep in mind that we have also have other expenses like books, tuition, course bills and etc. Some students are struggling parents that have even more responsibilities. I do believe they need to reduce prices on the food at least since the school is already expensive as it is."
College Junior,2,Parking for night students is very annoying. There is a lot of traffic and hard to find good parking at night. It take some time 20 mins just to find parking. The traffic leave campus is very crazy.
Graduate Student,1,"The graduate school of IST is truly horrible. You can learn by reading articles more than at this college. The instructors are not knowledgeable and have no integrity as human beings.  They live from your money, but they like to degrade and demean you. The basis for grading is if they like you or not. Immature and low-level individuals. Do not waste your life and your money here. Not only you get nothing academically, but you will also have trauma for the rest of the life from the way they treat you."
Graduate Student,1,If I can give less than one star I would.  The quality of the instructors and classes are extremely low.  You feel like you are in kindergarten trying to soothe your instructors to avoid them giving you bad grades. They use this college as their playground to satisfy their emotional needs.
Graduate Student,1,"I have no idea who the induviduals are who are leading my classes and grading my work. I want to know what their work history is, if they're not full time faculty. I want to know what makes them qualified to review and grade my work."
Graduate Student,1,"You get what you pay for. This university is made up almost entirely of ad-junct ""professors,"" and in my experience at WilmU, people who have no business leading a class (especially graduate level classes). They are not dynamic or creative, just people who distribute pre-packaged coursework for a paycheck. I entirely regret pursuing a degree here."
Senior,1,"I have been to 4 schools total and this was by far the worst school overall. The professors I must say are wonderful.  However, financial aid was horrendous. EACH & EVERY semester I was in (including summers), I had a financial aid issue. They said everything on my end was perfect.  So why do I have balances to be paid or cannot apply to future semesters? Why does it take 4.5 weeks to get issues resolved? Currently, my financial aid has not been resolved. I had called every day for the past 4 weeks and even when I was overseas and had to pay that extra bill just to reach this terrible service of a school. I still cannot apply for my next semester. When you call this school,  youâ€™ll stay on the line for the longest possible time. I am talking at least 35 minutes. For financial aid, I was on the line waiting for 1hr and 27minutes. I gave up and opted for a call-back which I did not receive until two days later. Hire people to do their job because clearly, they arenâ€™t."
Sophomore,1,"The lack of housing at this school is the biggest downfall. I came here expecting to live with other students at a small townhouse, huge mistake. It is an extreme hassle to come and live here if you do not know a group of people to live with that are not complete idiots. Now on to academics, I personally feel as though I am wasting my time and money here because I have not learned a single thing that I didn't already know in high school. If you're just looking to get a degree and not learn in the process, this is the school for you!"
College Junior,1,"The classroom instructors don't show up on time and are usually unprepared. They don't provide any information beyond what the book has. They have a hard time relating the topics to real life.

The on-line instructors have not provided any useful instruction.  I learn more from using Google than from the instructor's presentations."
College Junior,1,I don't see any career opportunities from the university.
College Junior,1,"I'm a non-traditional student using the university's on-line and remote classroom classes.

The classroom instructors don't show up on time and are usually unprepared.  They don't provide any information beyond what the book covers.  They have a hard time relating the topics to real-life situations.

The on-line instructors have not provide any useful instruction.  I learn more from using Google than from the the instructor's presentations.  The assignments are extremely overwhelming. An average week consists of 3 chapters to read, 5 page papers and quizzes. The labs require at least 14 hours a week to complete. It's very difficult for a working adult to keep current."
College Sophomore,1,The employee that requested my paperwork was rude and not informed on military aid. It took me several months to prove that I was active duty and an independent student.
College Sophomore,1,Wilmington is new to the university rating.
College Sophomore,1,"There is information available, if you know where to look."
College Senior,1,I know this school has been growing rather quickly but there are a lot of issues with finding parking during the semester. Sometimes you have to park very far from the class buildings and this is very unsafe if you attend night classes. Also if we have bad weather the park lot situation gets even more of an inconvenience. 
College Sophomore,1,"In the state of Delaware, the weather is either too hot or too cold."
College Junior,1,Our school is very well diverse and everyone is very friendly and open.
College Freshman,1,I do not like this school whatsoever. The only time I am on campus is to come to school and learn.
College Senior,1,"Not Any Restaraunts on Campus â€“ Wilmington university is a fairly small campus, and therefore has no major dining components.  Many students that attend Wilmington university are involved in online classes and do not need dining halls."
College Freshman,1,New Castle â€“ New Castle is a very small town with nonething to do. There are no dorms so social life can be a little dry. The school tries to do bring socil life to campus and that works a little bit.
College Junior,1,"Wilmu Night Life â€“ Night classes, sporting events, and student life events...thats pretty much it."
College Junior,1,"There are not as many computers on campus as what I believe should be there. We need more computers that have access to basic programs such as microsoft word, internet explorer, or computers that will just print class materials. I complete all of my work on my personal laptop and then I just print from school."

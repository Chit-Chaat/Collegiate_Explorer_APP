Senior,5,"Though these times have shown difficulty in adjustment for everyone involved, the college has done nothing but try to provide its best solutions and accommodations to its student body. Teachers are super understanding of student’s needs and situations and its easy to compromise if necessary. The fellow students help each other as well with adjustment and classwork. The SGA are a group of devoted and intelligent individuals that do their best to extend themselves to the student body during these times. Even if that means extending beyond the duties of the positions they’re holding."
Senior,5,"My time at the illustrious and tenacious Tougaloo College has been nothing shy of amazing. Don’t get me wrong, it hasn’t always been glitter and cupcakes. However, every school has it faults. At Tougaloo College the faults are immensely overshadowed by the unmatchable grace and honor that comes with being an eaglet. We soar high and aim higher. The staff and faculty provide a sense of belonging that could be impossible to receive at another college/university. The students on campus are family and we treat each other with respect and act as if we’ve known each other our whole lives. No place is 100% perfect but the atmosphere at Tougaloo is sure to leave a lasting impression on those who are to experience the campus. Tougaloo College was my first choice and I’m super glad that I chose to attend one of the best HBCUs in the country. We aren’t just a school or a campus of friendly people; we’re a family."
Freshman,5,The atmosphere is so warm and family orientated.  The academics are excellent.   The success rate of the students are very high.
Junior,5,"Tougaloo College is one of the oldest HBCU’s in Mississippi. It is very high on education and because it is so small, the professor and student relationship is at an all time high. Everyone knows everyone which makes the student life very fun and seems like you are never alone on campus. Athletics is very important to us as we highly support our student athletes and professors are very understanding of the away games. I feel very at home at the college and I would try my hardest to convince someone to attend."
Junior,5,I love Tougaloo. It’s like a big family. Everybody knows everybody. The class sizes are small so it’s better to learn in a small environment.
Sophomore,5,"Tougaloo is a great HBCU to attend. While at Tougaloo I've learned a great deal of history, I feel I wouldn't have learned at any other college.  In social aspects, Tougaloo is great for networking."
Alum,5,Tougaloo is a small HBCU with a rich history!  This is a private institution with a family feel.  The teachers care about the students and work to prepare them for the next level in their lives as they leave the nest of the Eagle Queen.  This is an experience of a lifetime!
Sophomore,5,"Tougaloo College is such an outstanding school with many perks. The academic system that they have established here sets high standards that requie the students to earn everything that they are given.

College Junior,5,"The girls and guys at Tougaloo College are the type of future lawyers, doctors, mentors, educators, athletes and ministers that society longs for today."
College Freshman,5,We have it all in Mississippi.
College Junior,5,The nightlife at my school has students that are 20+. Everybody on our campus really goes to the clubs off campus.  But when we have parties they are a site to see and of course they are free.
College Junior,5,As an Psychology major I wasn't so sure about it at first and started to change my mind about it and go to business.  But as I begin to start my psychology classes I begin to learn a lot of new things about it that I didn't know before about psychology. Even though I am still attending these classes I am still learning more and more everyday about my major.  My career goals are to find a job in my field as soon as I finish school.
College Freshman,5,They're designated places for everyone to park even those who are commuter students
College Sophomore,5,The food is good and you have a select of food types served at each meal time.
College Sophomore,5,"Tougaloo is only business. There are events and extra curricular to get involve in, but it's to help you become more successful. There aren't any distractions set up for the students for instance, clubs, bars, banks, and other places are located on or near any other campus which can become easy access."
College Freshman,5,"Jackson has a lot to offer. There are multiple malls and shopping centers. There are also movie theaters and plenty of restaurants. There is always something going on so you will never get bored, whether it is on or off campus. Jackson also has an amazing Art Museum. The Art classes take a trip each semester. It's great! The major football games are pretty awesome as well."
College Freshman,5,The majors at Tougaloo are the careers that are the top jobs today.
Recent Alumnus,5,Very good teachers. I feel like I received a quality education from Tougaloo College.
College Freshman,5,Being a mass communication major at Tougaloo College is excellent. The professors are hands on with their teaching.
College Freshman,5,"As a music education major, i am proud to say the faculty consistently assures us we will be more than prepared to face the world. Many students have come from all over the United States as well as other countries to be a part of our music department. Even knowing what i know now, i would still choose Tougaloo College as my school of choice. My career goal is to teach in all levels of school. I plan to get my doctorate in music education, with an emphasis in piano and voice and later music theory. i am not concerned wtih getting a job."
College Junior,5,"Need for Speed – On the Tougaloo campus, having a car is needed. Although the campus has everything you need except restaurants, they have an eating area , social events , and your daily needs in the bookstore. The parking rules are enforced well because at no time are you allowed to park on campus for a long period of time without a
Campus decal. If you do decide to disregard and disobey the parking rules it can result in a ticket and fine costs. Also, toeing could result if no action is taken from the violation. There are many parking spaces accessible to the students and however parking recklessly or in handicap spaces may result in ticketing so watch out and follow the rules of the campus roads"
College Junior,5,"Diversity at Tougaloo College is at a high percentage. This school year there are students who are from different countries who speak different languages and I believe that if a college is diverse, then you can easily learn about different cultures and languages around the world. I believe that diverse students can general enhance student values and cultural differences."
College Senior,5,Dining Options – Restaurants in the Ridgeland-Jackson area are plentiful.  The area have numerous options for diners to select.  One of my favorite place to dine is Cozumel for Mexican cuisine.  The food is delicious and very affordable.  I also like Biaggi's to dine with family and friends.  The food is excellent.  Diners will receive healthy portion of food.  One cannot go wrong in selecting a place to eat in the area.
College Sophomore,5,"Awesome Major – At Tougaloo College, the Natural Science Division is by far the best department on campus. The department produces 50% of Mississippi's doctors and lawyers. It is an awesome department and has worldwide recognition for the students it produces as well as its students academic achievement. I am well satisfied with my decision to declare Chemistry as my major."
College Senior,5,"Everyone Wants to Be Greek – Greek life at Tougaloo College would make eight of the nine Pan-Hellenic Greek organizations represented very proud.  Each group strives to uphold the principles of the organization, and do their best to reach out, and try to include non-Greeks in community service activites, and services for the overall greater good of the community."
College Senior,5,"Mississippi mainly has a hot climate, and it does not rain much either, and because the campus is very small, it rarely effects classes.  Even in the winter months, the temperature does not drop very low, and it does not get as cold as it does in the northern states."
College Senior,5,"It is relatively easy to get into the Mass Communication department. However, everything is hands on and you learn a lot because the teachers take time out to help each student one on one. I love my department"
College Junior,5,Very Family-Like – Everything about Tougaloo College will make you feel like they have been your family all along.
College Freshman,5,It is good to be involved in any program at this prestige college.
Sophomore,4,I’m still a student at this college. The school is small and for people that doesn’t like a huge campus. The campus is historical as well as it’s infrastructures. There are great professors in the Mathematics and Computer Science department. The college is good overall but could be better and more welcoming to students of different cultural backgrounds.
Junior,4,I love the love that each of the sorority have for each other. The classrooms are nice and clean. The advisors are good helpers. The food on the campus is great. What I would like to change is the care they have for the dorms. They're not really up to date or clean in the inside.
Junior,4,"The food is not that great but the professors make up that. They are supportive and wants students to achieve and excel, putting in work while being readily available if a student needs extra help with comprehension."
Sophomore,4,"Tougaloo College is a well honorable school. It's an HBCU ( Historical Black College or University). The staff at Tougaloo College care about the work space of their student, to make sure we all have healthy, bright and long lasting futures and careers."
Sophomore,4,"Tougaloo has a lot to offer academically.  I was very impressed during the summer science program I attended in 2017.  My greatest accomplishment was my ability to be the student during the summer science program to receive the overall student achievement. Not only was I surprised, I was absolutely elated. I value the academic challenge Toygaloo offers.  Tougaloo is a private historic kept secret and many people are not aware of the opportunity that this great HBC can offer.  The alumni association is also very encouraging and supportive in more ways than one, but I also have to say the campus can use a more modern updated look.  Tougaloo has been around a long time and mostly all funds come from private donors, with that in mind I understand that the funds are used for people like me to be funded for college books, housing and etc and that can be very costly.  If I could change just one thing I would surely hope this would be the one thing that could possibly be changed."
Sophomore,4,Tougaloo is a wonderful school! You get to know your professors and they work with you to make sure you are successful in everything you do.
Junior,4,"My overall experience at Tougaloo College was an intriguing and eye-opening for me. Not only did I meet new people but I had whole new experiances that will help my life. For me as a black male student, I learned as I learned. This means that while I was learning about, I was also learning who I am as a African American Male in America."
Freshman,4,"Well even though I didn't start yet, I knew from the first time I went that it was the school for me. I felt comfortable it's a good environment everyone's nice and the it's a small college so teachers are able it help you individually."
Freshman,4,Academic is really great but things to do is very hard especially when you come from a very far state and you don't know nobody.
College Junior,4,"If anything that I like about this school, it is the education. Class sizes are normally small, which is a great thing for most students. Also there are helpful professors, strict at times, but it is worth it."
College Freshman,4,I love our school spirit.
College Freshman,4,"Tougaloo College was the best choice I've ever made. Once you come, there's no leaving!"
College Sophomore,4,Everyone is nice and does a very great job being leaders.
College Sophomore,4,It is a great school. It has its differences but it's great.
College Sophomore,4,"Tougaloo Collage has been great is one of the best college. I have been to an attended the atmosphere and loving home environment that they give you is great, but the main reason I chose this college is because is known for some of the best doctors in the world and that something that I want to be especially after hearing about some the great things and history that is behind this college."
College Freshman,4,Tougaloo does not have the best parties you just have to hang with the right crowd to have a good time.
College Sophomore,4,"Well I'm not greek, but the Greeks that I know do not treat me in an inferior way, and most of them act the same as everyone else. Greek did not make them, they made Greek!"
College Sophomore,4,"I think it's great, because it has security up and out at all times of night, watching us to make sure we are safe, and that all policies are being upheld."
College Sophomore,4,"It's usually pretty good. There is music, basketball, dancing, and good company."
College Sophomore,4,Campus Security do routine checks hourly
College Sophomore,4,"cost is reasonable, no student discounts"
College Sophomore,4,If you do not study you will face many challenges in low grades. I advise to read every day for at least two hours
College Junior,4,they get you in and show support
College Freshman,4,"The cost is always fairly average, so you would never have to worry about breaking bank and spending money you dont have"
College Freshman,4,I enjoy the local clubs in the area
College Junior,4,Fondren district (about 10 min from campus) has great little eateries!
College Junior,4,You have to always keep an open mind for whatever may happen.
College Junior,4,Tougaloo provides an excellent academic experience which thoroughly prepares you for as an adult.
College Sophomore,4,"The financial aid process is extremely hectic, but once the storm settles, things usually goes smoothly."
College Junior,4,"I do not go to bars/clubs much anymore, but the city lights are contagious here in Jackson. There is a large shopping mall and cinema theater near-by so that is a huge plus."
College Junior,4,"We have a great basketball and vollyball team. Our cross country team is on the rise and our tennis and baseball teams are both in need of a campus wide ""spirit boost."" Overall, they are all great teams who exhibit great chemistry on the court and field."
College Junior,4,"My overall experience here at Tougaloo College has been a very humble and memorable one. Tougaloo is like a big family made up of a variety of people from different walks of life who desire to reach a common goal in life. The college experience thus far has been fairly benificial to me and it has been a non-stop learning experience. A few things that make Tougaloo College a unique institution of higher learning is the way our school sticks together no matter what in order to help uplift the community in some of the most generous ways. We make sure families have gifts, food and places to enjoy their holidays during Christmas and Thanksgiving time and we also help at risk young adults and troubled youth, through mentorship, realize that life is what you make it and any decision they make will have a consequence. If I had to choose another institution of higher learning I would choose the prestige Tougaloo College a thousand times. I adore my alma mater!"
College Freshman,4,Congressmwn and senators in MS love interns.
College Freshman,4,I do not go to clubs or bars. Everyone keeps going out to them so i guess they are good.
College Senior,4,"Local atmosphere at Tougaloo is pretty relaxed, it's a small campus and quiet when compared to others. It has a safe sort of feel to it."
College Senior,4,"It's pretty decent southern weather at tougaloo, It never gets too cold and we hardly see hide or hair of snowfall. It can be a bit unbearable in the early fall, but there are buildings close by that have the AC running."
College Senior,4,"It's a very small campus, and everyone is close knit, it can sometimes be a bit behind the times, but it has had this quaint, sort of homey feel to it. The first year dorms are nothing to write home about but afterwards, when you can move into the upperclassmen dorms it's pretty nice. There are a lot of open spaces and nice country air that make you want to take your books outside and study there."
College Junior,4,The process of me getting into my program was relatively easy to me while at school.  I say this because all I had to do was declare my major and talk to a couple of the people that was over the psychology department then I was in.  The difficulties and challenges that I had encountered while getting into this course was the work.  As I begin to attend my psychology classes I noticed that psychology deals with a lot of thinking and work with the mind.
College Junior,4,"As and Psychology major, I want to have a field of a  psychologist (something like a therapist) to get in others heads and help them with their problems.  I do plan to have an internship.  I would want an internship to learn different things about the different kinds of psychologist out there in the world and what they are about. I would also want an internship because I would like to know if this is my place."
College Junior,4,Tougaloo College's campus life is very traditional. It is a HBCU college that is well organized. Here you will get well acquainted with the staff as well as students. It is a walking campus that is near Northpark Mall and tasteful restaurants. The college provides full attention seekers who are destined for success. Joining a fraternity or sorority is a must. There is always something entertaining going on at Tougaloo College.
Freshman,2,"Tougaloo has been an okay experience, a lot problems and conflicts with much of it. It's very antiquated and could use some help coming up to date."
College Junior,2,"As a transfer, my first semester here was horrible. Most times it seemed as if I had to go all around the world for simple or single piece of information. No one informs anyone about anything! Also when seeking help, the personality in the business offices are pure ugly and full of rudeness! This is ""suppose"" to be a HBCU, we are suppose to help each other, and not treat each other with attitude. As the ""prestigious"" HBCU it proclaims to be, Tougaloo is in dire need of great help to make it great again! On the other hand, the education here is great because you will truly learn!!"
College Freshman,2,Bathrooms And Residence Need To Be More Clean
College Freshman,2,Tougaloo has students living here that are 23 and up. That should say enough for you.
College Freshman,2,"Taco Bell, Chickfila, Whataburger, Wendys, Logans, Red Lobster, Olive Garden, McDonalds, Burger KIng. Couple options but you will get tired of the same stuff for sure."
College Freshman,2,"If you're trying to party every night, you need to go to another school or be prepared to make your own fun/parties at Tougaloo."
College Freshman,2,I hate living on campus. Things are stolen from me on a monthly basis. I have no wifi in my room and it takes me less than a hop to get to my room door from mine and my roommates bed...you can figure out how spacious it is from there. Freshmen girls have it so bad
College Sophomore,2,In the beginning of this semester it seemed as though the financial aid department just wanted to point the finger instead of truly trying to help the students. Although I'm not all-knowing of whose role is to do what in that department majority of students only found help with two of the faculty in that area.
College Freshman,2,They need more up to date security
College Freshman,2,The drug usage on the campus would be a coping mechanism. Due to there not being enough leadership in the SGA.
College Freshman,2,"The computers at my school are slow, broken, missing keyboards or mouses, or severely damaged. The printers are always out of ink which sets the student back from turning in mandatory assignments that will heavily benefit our graded. Or the printers are never stocked with paper, which is worse than no having ink. The WiFi has to be the worst part because in certain areas of the school you wont  even be able to connect to the schools WiFi. When you get to this school you must have your own personal laptop because you never know how the computers here are going to be."
College Junior,2,Oit is horrible on campus
College Junior,2,The weather changes 3 or 4 times a day!!!
College Junior,2,"Drugs are pretty accessable on campus, but if you do not use them no one looks at you differently. Some understand that their usage is by choice, nothing is forced."
College Freshman,2,Registration is a strain. The workers are so mean and rude.
College Freshman,2,The campus is in need of rennovations.
College Freshman,2,Usually if one doesnt have a ride they ask another student with a car.
College Junior,2,The dorms are rather small and needs major updating!
College Junior,2,"There is some parking available on campus, but it could still use more."
College Junior,2,"Off-campus housing is offered in close distance my school, but it is not affordable for most students."
Recent Alumnus,1,The Greek life is based only on popularity here
Recent Alumnus,1,I don't like this school and no I would not do it over again
College Sophomore,1,The dorms are very nasty.
College Freshman,1,We have the worst campus security. They are worrying about catchings guys in girls rooms and vice versa when there are people living here illegally who arent even enrolled. People come up here just to steal. How did yall let them on campus?
College Sophomore,1,The worst living area but the newer upper class dorms are better.
College Junior,1,The computers labs at Tougaloo College are not good at all. First they close to early and majority of  the computers in the labs are not working or their is no printing paper. Also the labs are usually over crowed durning midterms and finals. Most peoplehavetheir own computers and WIFI and if you do not I strongly suggest you do.
College Junior,1,"There are no off campus housing selections that are operated by the school. Around the school, the cost of living is pretty expensive but there are pockets of areas that are close in the area that are reasonable."
College Sophomore,1,"I, myself, have never felt unsafe but seem things have happened to me before such as vandalism of my car. One day when i was living on campus evryone tires in the dorm parking lot had got poked or slashed. Also, when we leave for certain breaks rooms would have been broken into and the school didn't really help with that. To me the security guards are more concerned with giving out tickets for parking instead of making sure things are safe around us."
College Sophomore,1,Not Many Options – There are no other options to choose from other than the cafeteria at Tougaloo College. The is sometimes unpleasant and begins to get old after so long. I would suggest that the college builds some other on campus eating sites.
College Junior,1,"There Really Isn't Anything Available – Although there isn't anything on campas, there are plenty of places  eat close by."
College Freshman,1,Our campus unfortunately is primarly black. I would love to see more international students at our school. We as a people need to learn to communicate with other ethnic groups.
College Sophomore,1,Parking here at Tougaloo is  ridiculous. Our parking lots are filled with pot holes that causes people cars to mess up. Our security cameras outside are horrible. People tires get slice without anyone knowing because of the cameras not working.  Our parking lot needs to be expanded. We rarely have parking spots because the parking lot is so small and most  of it is damaged.
College Sophomore,1,"At Tougaloo college transportation is not offered for around campus use,local, or long-distant transportation"
College Freshman,1,I feel as if we should have college apartments on our campus or atleast around it. Our dorm rooms for freshmens could be a whole lot better. Its like living in a jungle.
College Freshman,1,"Could Be Alot Better – The computers at our school could use some upgrades. It be hard to log on the internet sometimes. The computers freezes up a lot. If you dont save your work, you are in big trouble."

Freshman,5,"I am a freshman in my first semester at Stevens and I love it more than I could have imagined. Stevens is home to wonderful administration, faculty, and a welcoming community. Months before we even arrived on campus the student body was actively engaging with one another. 

Now that we are on campus, we are following well-developed COVID restrictions such as weekly COVID testing. These measures go a long way to boost student safety while allowing us to follow a hybrid model."
Junior,5,"I was enrolled in all the on-campus classes. 
 
However, Transition to online learning during the quarantine went very smoothly. They kept up very well with any covid19 patients and were quick on delivering any new updates on the current situation, including the issues of voting for the new grading system. 

All of my professors reflected this situation into the course curriculum right away. They made adjustments to the weight of the exams, lab reports, and assignments, etc so that majority of students agree on what they learn and required to accomplish for the rest of the semester. 

Zoom premium service was provided so I did not have any problem with working on 3-4 different group projects, and presentations in the month of the semester. 

The optional P/F system was very reasonable and definitely helped students to be adjusted to the new learning system."

Freshman,5,Stevens Institute of Technology not only has a amazing academics Steven also has a great environment for students to learn and grow through their time at Stevens and you meet amazing people who help you through that process
Alum,5,"They set all students up for success. Great education and a great location. The internships and coops offered are invigorating, and the ROI is through the roof."
Freshman,5,"Being a girl at Stevens, it's very apparent that the 70:30 ratio exists, which could be very intimidating to some. However, I am very glad that I chose Stevens to study Quantitative Finance."
Freshman,5,Very rigorous coursework but great location and awesome student body. There's also a great theater/performing arts program that really helps balance the STEM work.
Freshman,5,Such an amazing school for those interested in engineering and computer science. Don't hesitate to apply.
Junior,5,"The course work is very rough and heavy, but this challenge is what helps the students find jobs right after college. Some of the professors are the nicest people you will ever meet and understand how hard the courses are sometimes.  The sports teams here are great and the athletic department has great facilities for the athletes and the non athletes. The food is not the best, but hoboken has so many great food places in great walking distance from the campus. The labs for all the majors are great and in good conditions for the students taking these courses."
Niche User,5,Stevens is a great school that really helps you gain experience in the real world. It also has a great view of the city and has been transforming its campus by building new housing units and classroom. The college is truly a university on the rise and is one of the best STEM schools in the tri-state area. A lot of my family  members all enjoyed their years at Stevens and have no regrets going to the school as they got high paying jobs with great companies in the city.
Niche User,5,"Stevens is located in Hoboken, New Jersey. The school is pretty small but it is subject to the beautiful city of Hoboken with New York City directly across. Stevens students have endless opportunities due to the fabulous location and great education."
Freshman,5,Stevens has  made the incoming students experience a fun and warm welcome to the school. Everyone is upbeat and full of personality. The school has a high job placement rate and the professors are willing to help you.
Sophomore,5,This school offers an enriching educational experience in a beautiful setting. Its close proximity to Manhattan means that students are able to easily make connections with some of the most influential companies in the world.
Freshman,5,Stevens Institute of Technology is providing me with a degree where I will be a top candidate in my field of study.
Graduate Student,5,I started going to Stevens as an international graduate student. I am habitual to Indian food so I wasn't expecting the campus dining hall food to be so good and have a vast variety. Plus their Washington Wednesday part is great for students to be able to use their meal swipes off campus.
Graduate Student,5,"Stevens allowed me to spread my wings.  In Junior year I joined a fraternity, and the brothers were great.  I was able to be recruited right out of college, with a great offer. The professors were there to always help out. I was also able to obtain, online my Masters Degree in Systems Engineering."
Alum,5,"Even though we graduated during a recession, my friends and I all landed high paying engineering, computer science, and business jobs. The co-op program is amazing and finishing with real work experience puts you ahead, as well as the campus recruiting. I had better internships and experiences than friends who went to NYU and were basically pointed to Monster.com and told good luck. The campus is fun if you get involved in clubs, but it is a smaller school so you have to be willing to get out there or go to the city. I made life long friends and we all keep in touch and have 6 figure salaries; it's a school focused on ROI for your career in STEM."
Freshman,5,The campus is absolutely gorgeous and the class load is bearable. Teachers and students are very friendly and welcoming. Campus location provides easy access to New York City and the cute town of Hoboken.
Sophomore,5,"Stevens Institute of Technology gives students the tools they need to succeed. They allows students to interact amongst all types of students by bringing them together in a warm, friendly community. The teachers are dedicated to bringing the best out of students, and the students are dedicated to bringing out the best in each other."
Sophomore,5,Stevens Institute of Technology is an incredibly small school with an even more incredibly helpful staff of professors. Most professors encourage students to give them feedback throughout the course and will try different ways of teaching something if necessary.
Junior,5,"Stevens is a great school. Since it is small, there are so many opportunities to succeed and thrive."
Freshman,5,Small campus with a great surrounding area. Very good academics and return on investment. Great college and pretty good diversity.
Freshman,5,"Stevens offers many opportunities to students, including co-ops and internships. If you are proactive, you can receive many academic benefits. Jobs or graduate school are nearly always guaranteed after graduation. The only thing I would say they can improve on is diversifying the student population."
Niche User,5,Being apart of Stevens Institute of Technology truly represents the essence of innovation.  There are endless possibilities and connections made at this campus.  The social life and academics are the key aspects of this university and the growing changes really engages student life.
Niche User,5,"Stevens Institute of Technology is a great place to work, study and hang out.  The campus vibes are unmatched and the views you cant beat!"
Niche User,5,I love being apart of Stevens Institute of Technology community.  The dynamic on campus is always changing and is exciting to be apart of such a growing and innovative campus.
Niche User,5,One of the best colleges in the country.  It provides you with the access to many highly skilled individuals.  Everything from student life to academics to the food on campus is rated A+++
Works Here,5,Stevens atmosphere is incomparable to any other college I have been to.  There is great support staff for students and a world of options.
Senior,5,"I've been here for 5 years, love most things here. Most of the staff really care about the students. The school is located on the top of a hill in a city so you can relax but also be close to so many different food options."
Works Here,5,Overall amazing campus with unbelievable views and experiences.  Being such close proximity to new york city there are endless opportunities.
Niche User,5,"One of the most beautiful colleges in the world. The vibrant city just waiting on the other side of the water. An excellent college for anyone wishing that be employed right after graduation. Great campus, great people."
Alum,5,I chose SIT over Vanderbilt and don't regret it a bit. Best place to study with huge ROI. The programs are good and the campus is huge advantage for Stevens. The locations serves purpose for SIT on many levels; ambience and exposure to name a few.
Niche User,5,"Stevens is an amazing campus, it is my dream college! There is nothing to dislike about the school, everyone is very friendly. Besides the competitive students  to have the best of the best of their education is is an amazing school to attend and to graduate from."
Alum,5,You definitely get what you pay for.  The school aims to get you well educated and career ready.  It has Greek life but the focus remains on pushing you to do your best.
Freshman,5,"I've had an amazing experience at Stevens. I've enjoyed the small school environment tremendously. I know a lot of other students around campus, which makes it nice to walk to to classes with other people. The classes are intense; I spent a lot of my time studying. But I know it's worth it because Stevens is very career-oriented, and I know I'm almost guaranteed a job after college because of my preparation."
Sophomore,5,Fantastic school with fantastic views.  Getting a top-notch education!  My major is finance and I was lucky to get an internship as a Freshman....it will really help my resume as I gained first hand experience working in the business departments of a major medical center.
Freshman,5,"Stevens Institue of Technology is really a College that is constantly striving for improvement in every sector. New things are constantly happening and building. The atmosphere among the students in fantastic and everyone is involved in some way. Finding friends is simple, even for people who don't like to put themselves out there. The party life is as good as it gets. Academics is difficult, you always have to work hard for the grade you want, but there are so many tools the school provides you to help. The administration is somewhat disorganized and that is the biggest improvement that could be made about the school."
Freshman,5,"I love the campus and campus location.  Stevens is close to NYC and Hoboken has lots of great eating places.  The staff and students are all there make everyone feel welcome.  There is help for academics, joining the many clubs, finding your way around and help learning the system at Stevens.  The professors are available and willing to help.  Students just need to approach the professors.  The staff is friendly and is always available.  The campus feels safe and the Stevens police are always there looking out for the safety of students.  The engineering classes are difficult, but the are plenty of study groups.  You have to work hard, but it is worth it.  "
College Freshman,5,Graduates from Stevens do amazing things and they make the highest salaries in the nation.
College Freshman,5,Very helpful when you need them. Because of the small class sizes they can really help you on a personal level.
College Freshman,5,Very safe campus. Police drive around here no stop. If there is a problem they are there in 2 minutes.
College Freshman,5,"The Greek life is pretty prominent here. It's about 1,000 students and they try to welcome you and make you feel included. The process of getting in isn't as bad as it is in other schools."
College Freshman,5,There are a lot of students who participate in sports. Also there are a lot of different club sports that you can choose from making the experience at Stevens more enjoyable.
College Freshman,5,Fantastic career placement and alumni network. This school is the only one I looked at that made me feel confident in finding a job after school.
College Sophomore,5,My major has had 100% employment within 6 months of graduation for the past 5 years.
College Freshman,5,"While there are downsides, such as professors that can be difficult to understand due to language barriers, the overall experience has been amazing. The average professor is highly invested in my success, and every student is working incredibly hard to achieve their goals. This motivates everyone around them, creating a culture of hard work for success."
College Freshman,5,I learnt a lot in this school and made friends for life.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I've never felt unsafe on campus. Since it is so small, the cops know most of us by name and can be anywhere in a heartbeat"
Recent Alumnus,5,Being in a sorority has given me so much connection and opportunities on campus that I otherwise would not have had.
College Sophomore,5,all i can say the school is great
College Sophomore,5,have not experienced yet but will do this fall
College Sophomore,5,I will be starting the school this Fall but so far I had good things.
College Junior,5,"While the co-op office has had some issues lately, the appeal of going through the process and gaining experience with Stevens' help has no diminished. The co-op program is well worth the process and I have been very happy with the companies that I have been set up with."
College Junior,5,"I couldn't be happier. The courses are interesting and while they are challenging, the professors take the time to make sure you understand the material if you show that you care. There is a great diversity among the students who attend; ranging from the typical socialites to the laid back kids who drink and play video games while devouring a pizza on a Friday night."
College Junior,5,"Security on campus is perfect. The campus police station is thirty seconds away and the captain, Magi, is always so helpful. On late nights if he is driving around checking up on everybody leaving the parties, he will offer rides to those who live on the other side of town. I came out of a meeting at 4 am on night and the officers on campus had no issues with driving me back to my apartment so that I didn't walk home alone."
College Junior,5,"Greek life is known for their parties; however, because our campus is so small, the majority of the social events on campus are hosted by Greek life so many will join the fraternities or sororities to stay involved on campus."
College Junior,5,I have chosen a great school and I could not be happier. Hoboken offers a great environment to relax after classes and I thoroughly enjoy visiting my professors during office hours since they take the time to sit down and make sure I understand the material.
College Freshman,5,"Stevens police is there in less than 1 minute no matter the case. The resources are all there and are underutilized. Do not feel guilty about reaching out, they enjoy helping students."
Recent Alumnus,5,The school is in Hoboken
Recent Alumnus,5,There's 100 bars in a square mile
Freshman,4,"With any institution there are expected hiccups, and don't get me wrong, Stevens has had plenty of hiccups, but overall Stevens has had a great online experience. Most teachers and TA's are well equipped to handle ""Zoom University"" and many of my classes benefit from having an engaging curriculum and staff!"
Senior,4,"Stevens is great for students in STEM. The main focus is engineering, but it is also good for science majors in terms of research experience and small classes. The research and internship opportunities help students build a strong resume."
Junior,4,"In my opinion, Stevens did a great job handling the transition from in-person to online courses. It was easy to keep up with my coursework. However, like any online learning, it wasn't as effective as in-person learning."
Junior,4,"This school offers rigorous academics and an overall great college campus and environment. The reason I chose to attend Stevens is due to the tight-knit and accommodating academic environment, the campus lifestyle, and promising return on investment percentages."
Graduate Student,4,"Stevens is well-known for its challenging curriculum but also for pushing its students to be the best engineers, scientists, musicians, and businesspeople possible. I felt very supported by my peers and professors and there are plenty of ways to enjoy your time outside of school work. There are several clubs and organizations to be a part of, as well as NYC right across the river. It's really the perfect place to be for school."
Freshman,4,Stevens is a shool with very good academics and nice student life that can allow for a range of personalities
Freshman,4,"What I would like to see change at Stevens is the level of diversity. Stevens has a lot to offer, between the many clubs, sports teams, and academics. It's a matter of WHO these opportunities are being offered to. We are so close to Manhattan, a hot-spot of different cultures coming together. We are right across the Hudson and we shouldn't be so different. Unfortunately, a huge portion of Stevens students come here with an excellent high school education that only privilege granted them."
Freshman,4,"Stevens is an amazing school, it is home to some of the smartest people I know but it doesn't feel like you're surrounded by nerds. The professors are amazing and very open to helping students and are good at communicating. This applies to pretty much all of the staff, one thing that shocked me was how willing they are to help. No matter what department you go into you will always leave with a clear answer to your question. The education is great, the people are amazing, the location is perfect, the one thing that takes them down from 5 stars to 4 is the dining hall. The food isn't that great, it is not bad but it can definitely be better. Another thing is the construction, Stevens has a small campus so it can be seen from all ends of it. A bit of an eyesore but not really that big of a deal, the view of New York City is still amazing."
Niche User,4,"I visited Stevens and hope to enroll in the following year. When I visited I was blown away with everything they had to offer. The fact that the school is so close to NYC yet still provides students with that small campus feel was great and in addition, their connections to global and local businesses mean that a Co-op or internship in NYC is possible. I was also thoroughly impressed with the safety on the campus and how clean their campus was. Overall I was really impressed by the school."
Freshman,4,I can only recommend Stevens for engineering students especially if you plan to take advantage of the co-op program or Accelerated Master's Program. They get the most funding and have more programs available to them.
Graduate Student,4,"Still starting my first semester in Stevens Institute as a part time grad student, and so far learning a lot in my first couple classes. Wish there were more opportunities for part time students in student life activities."
Niche User,4,I loved the atmosphere and the campus is really nice. All the students I met were welcoming and everything they were saying was very genuine. I hope to be attending as I attended the summer program they have.
Freshman,4,"I am currently a freshman at Stevens and there's currently a lot of construction going around. It can be annoying at times, but at least they are trying to improve the school."
Freshman,4,"An amazing school that offers a well-rounded experience with innovative academics, entertaining student life, and a plethora of opportunities waiting to be discovered right across the Hudson River."
Sophomore,4,I love the location and the vibe on campus however the food situation is not the best. There are not many places to go on campus to get food.
Freshman,4,"I really like the location of the college and the unique programs that the school provides. I am currently taking Quantitative Finance and I absolutely love it. The perfect mix of computer science, mathematics, and finance all in one major makes Quantitative Finance such a desirable major. The only concerns I have with the college is the constant construction around the campus. It is very noisy, but they are building a new building to add more residential dorms, which is essential. Also, the cost of attending the university is little too high compared to other nearby colleges, but otherwise it is definitely worth it."
Freshman,4,"Stevens is a nice, small school that feels comfortable.  Everyone I have met are friendly and kind.  It is a great environment for learning and growing as a student."
Niche User,4,average sized and homey campus. Beautiful view of NYC. Small variety of majors but very high academic status.
Freshman,4,Having a great time so far.  I love it but i wish we would stop hiding the problems and instead just work with the students willing to put in the work to fix them.
Junior,4,"Stevens has very good academic programs. Most of the professors are very knowledgeable in their fields and do a good job teaching. However, some of the professors are there to do research and have no interest in teaching, yet are forced to teach a class anyway. You end up learning next to nothing in these classes because the professor could not care less, which is particularly concerning as some of these classes are really important for your major. God help you if you end up with Mukund Iyengar."
Sophomore,4,The campus is very small and home-like. The professors here are very well in their own respective fields as well. They want you to succeed.
Sophomore,4,"Extremely expensive but flexible major and has room to maximize your education and network, can make the most out of your major while doing your undegrad here"
Freshman,4,"it's a chill college, fun place to grind for a bright future. of course, there are certain issues with this little community, such as the constantly ""under maintenance"" gate, and unstable food quality. but if looking for a college that is fun and also very academic, this is the place to go"
Freshman,4,Stevens is the perfect match for you if you are looking for a well-paying career after investing in it. Do NOT let the price tag scare you!
Senior,4,"Great engineering curriculum. Very rigorous, but being determined is the key. Form study groups or reach out to professors for help. Stevens gives its engineering majors a flavor of every branch of engineering before they go out into the workforce. Take advantage of every opportunity the school has to offer for help - tutoring center, office hours, or a study group with friends. It will be worth it once you have a highly coveted ""Bachelor of Engineering"" Degree!"
Sophomore,4,"Everybody is so kind and i’ve made several forever friends. There’s something for everyone, and my major is 100% placement. Some of the freshmen teachers really aren’t the best, but the deans and academic apartment are willing to work with you. I feel like i’m learning a lot and am in a positive environment."
Senior,4,"While a little pricey, its location and connection to many companies will certainly benefit anyone that puts a little effort into it. Academically, the coursework is fairly light and professors are more than willing to curve grades to your favor if you put your best effort and reach out to them. The area also gives student access to many activities in their free time, all within a 5 mile radius."
Sophomore,4,"Being right across the water from NYC is the perfect location for a college student. You can take the path train for a day trip to the city or explore what hoboken has to offer. 
All the professors are very nice and passionate about what they are teaching. Stevens is constantly expanding and improving to try and better campus life.
The campus itself is beautiful all year around from the view to the landscaping.
There are many different clubs and organization to join that all have many celebrations and events that usually involve free food.
Overall Stevens is a great school for anyone looking into the tech side of many majors."
Junior,4,"Stevens Institute of Technology is a great place to get a good education and return on investment. However, it is not without its faults. Currently, Stevens is undergoing a change in which the school wants to misplace a lot of programs it has previously offered, ones that benefited students greatly. There are always those professors that are notorious among students for being a good professor or a terrible one. While some professors are definitely hard than some others, Stevens ensures that students are prepared for after graduation through the education that is provided."
Sophomore,4,Very difficult school but students are provided with a wide variety of resources to help them out. Professors are very helpful and willing to work with students. There is also a tutoring center and various test reviews.
Graduate Student,4,Stevens is an amazing school. The infrastructure is awesome. The professors are great. I think the fees are exorbitant because of the view.  But still its worth it. The environment is stress-free and the campus is really cute. The campus food is awesome. I eat here every day. It never gets boring !!!
Graduate Student,4,The most I like is the Campus location. It has the best infrastructure anyone can offer. The professors are average. The courses are decent. I think the quality of the courses can be improved. The Career centre is helpful. I think the college should start more bootcamps to groom the students to the real world problem solving and application. I believe that Stevens can be one of the best institutes based on the proximity to Manhattan and also based on the infrastructure it provides.
Junior,4,"Stevens has an excellent academic program and an extensive co-op program that offers students many resources to succeed, both while at school and after graduation. However, there is not much diversity."
Freshman,4,"I liked that I was able to access many different resources. I disliked that there is no diversity and for some classes there is no lecture. For example, for chemistry, I feel like there is only a recitation period which does not really help to understand the material."
Freshman,4,"The vibes of the school are amazing. Everyone on campus is here to learn and do their best. The views all over campus are unparalleled. The view of the Hudson River and NYC is beautiful. The air is refreshing and the teachers know what they are teaching and are willing to help. The one unfortunate thing about the school would be the dining hall food. Its very repetitive and all around not the best, but the proximity to the city of Hoboken makes up for it. There are so many great places to eat and places to visit. I couldn't see myself anywhere else."
Junior,4,Stevens offers challenging course work that prepares individuals for the workforce upon graduation. However the professor can be harsh and not understand the students complaints or concerns. Some teachers have very poor English and are therefore hard to understand. Most teachers have teaching assistants that can help the students better understand the course work. The school has a great location that allows students to experience many different things. Because of this the students can never be bored because there are always activities and events happening.
Sophomore,4,"Stevens is a great school on the Hudson River in Hoboken, NJ. Although known for engineering, Stevens has an excellent Business School and a variety of other fields of Study. Overall, a great school, and return on investment is upstanding."
Freshman,4,"My experience with Stevens is amazing. All the professors and facilities are great. The campus is the right size for me to fit in the community. As an engineering major, there is a lot of work, but it is worth it."
Sophomore,4,"Classes are definitely difficult. But the career center is fantastic, and I'm looking forward to graduating in 2 years."
Sophomore,4,Stevens has a very academic-focused nature but still provides opportunities for students to express themselves through clubs.
Sophomore,4,"I was able to get an internship my first year here because of all of the preparation Stevens gave me in terms of resume reviews, practice interviews, and technical questions.  Food stinks, dorms are dorms, education is great, Hoboken is amazing, and the campus is beautiful"
Junior,4,Offers strong academics and great professors.  The co-op program is a great way to gain experience.  The campus is beautiful and Hoboken is very fun.  Close proximity to New York City  is good for internship and co-ops opportunities. Stevens students are welcoming and kind.
Sophomore,4,"The part I love most about Stevens is the community. It is a fairly small college, so you tend to see the same faces everyday. The classes may be difficult, but there is always someone there to help. There are countless free review sessions and tutoring opportunities, primarily run by other students. The school itself also offers various extracurricular activities that can be purely social, academic, or a mix of both. The classes can be challenging, but I think Stevens courses are extremely well designed for preparing you for real world engineering. Stevens also has a fantastic career center since it is a co-op school. The only downside about Stevens is that the financial aide department is not very helpful or generous, which can be detrimental considering the high cost of tuition. Despite that, I would still highly recommend Stevens considering its financial aide office is not the only source you would have when it comes to needing financial assistance."
Sophomore,4,"It is a great school located in an awesome city with one of the greatest views of any campus in the country. Although it is known for engineering,  the business school recently reported that 100% of its graduating students either received a full time job or decided to pursue a masters degree.  Stevens also has a great athletics program. One drawback is that the school employs people who were very successful in real world jobs as their professors,  but sometimes they have difficulty teaching and connecting with the students."
College Freshman,4,The school is quite small so it's cozy but because of the small size you get a lot of personalized attention. The school has great connections and that's why it's placement rate 6 months after graduation is so amazing at 95%!!
College Freshman,4,The classes are rigorous and the professors challenge each student to be the best they can. They also help plan and solidify students' futures.
College Sophomore,4,"Hard work while you're here pays off when you get a job, which you almost are guaranteed to after you graduate. All high-paying fields."
College Sophomore,4,Lots of cops. They don't do all that much but they definitely act as a deterrent to would-be crims.
College Sophomore,4,"Not many girls, but it is a great school if you're technically minded and looking to make bank after you graduate."
College Freshman,4,"The student athlete experience here has been amazing for me. A huge emphasis is placed on academics, which always come first, allowing each athlete to find their unique balance. Facilities are generally sub par compared to other schools, but are always sufficient for my needs. With regards to attending games for other sports, there is a huge amount of school spirit that makes it very fun."
College Sophomore,4,Safety at Stevens is pretty well emphasized as I feel safe walking at any part of the campus at any time to be honest. Hoboken is a relatively good neighborhood and the campus has its own police department which regularly patrols the area. Stevens also makes sure to stress the importance of reporting sexual assault among all of its students and encourages students to consult with counsellors if needed.
College Sophomore,4,"Stevens is great because it gives students opportunities to work on actual engineering applications and projects in the first few semesters rather than exclusively focusing on prerequisites. However, I believe that the professors and TAs have room for improvement when it comes to teaching methods and/or in-depth communication with students on a more individual basis."
College Senior,4,"Campus police are always around and always available to call, they tend to keep the campus safe and people that do not belong out"
College Senior,4,Greek life is very easy to get involved in and has great benefits but you do not feel required to join greek life if you do not want to
Recent Alumnus,4,"If I had to choose a college again (which I am), I would choose Stevens all over again."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great education and available majors and classes. If students are not Co-op, they get pushed to the side with career development"
College Sophomore,4,I actually really like this school and think it offers a lot of help and resources necessary for success. You have to take initiative to get extra help and study after hours.
College Sophomore,4,Stevens tries it's very best to be a safe campus but they can't do much for things that never show face to the public. It's still very important to be cautious and be with people you feel comfortable with.
College Sophomore,4,"I'm not a part of greek life, but after seeing it in person after one year, I definitely want to rush next year."
College Sophomore,4,I actually really like this school and firmly believe that success will find you if you try your best.
Junior,2,"Most professors don't take into account the current situation and assign more exams and other assignments. Most of my classes have changed their midterms to do 4 small exams before the final, which means 4 exams for every course, meaning 20 exams in total. There is not enough time to study for that and do all of the assignments they assign on top of the usual ones, which are already too much. Stevens is known for having students with many mental health issues due to the stress they impose, and they are making things even harder online."
Senior,2,I am a senior and wanted to warn others from attending Stevens. Many of the good professors have left in the past few years and replaced by many inexperienced new professors. The dorm situation is horrible. After freshman year most are forced off campus and the shuttles are unreliable. Stevens also brags about their grads’ starting salaries but this is totally exaggerated. Many grads I know either could not find jobs in their majors or had really low starting salaries. This worries me a lot. So please do your research carefully. My advice is to find another option.
Sophomore,2,"Overall, the classes & academics at Stevens are great, however the housing and student life are absolutely absurd. It is not worth the time and money spent to have an experience that is far below other campuses. Please try to commute or do not go through SLH if possible (even though that will hinder your ability to be active on campus, but at that point its better than spending the amount of money you would spend). Additionally, the school is absolutely horrible with housing for studying abroad. There are no real options for when you return, so yet again better off going through your own resources and not through stevens."
Senior,2,Great campus/area but ultimately academics matters the most. Most professors can't speak proper english and some even repeat material in different classes. Business students suffer the most because most recruiters want students with tech backgrounds. Business and Technology students get better jobs than Quantitative Finance students even though the workload is SIGNIFICANTLY different. This school is overrated.
College Sophomore,2,Pierce dining hall is not great.  There is decent variety but the quality is poor and the food gets old really fast.
College Junior,2,"Forced meal plan for on campus residents. Food is not good. other options are not included in the plan and are expensive, but have better quality food."
College Junior,2,"There aren't enough places to live for the amount of students, so rates are going up even in off campus housing where rates of the building haven't changed. The rooms are small, and have pests. communal areas are non-existent or disgusting."
College Sophomore,2,"The teachers don't care, but the co-op office is really good for work experience."
College Sophomore,2,Registering for classes is only easy if you're lucky. You have to take a lot of classes here and depending on your major you may get very few to no electives.
College Freshman,2,"Coming from San Francisco, wow. This was one of the biggest adjustments I've had to make. Shocked at how many Conservative Christians there are, who seem so stubborn and unwilling to explore beyond their comfort zone. I am white, but still consider myself very much an outsider here (Jewish and democrat). Having said that, political affiliation does not affect how people see you on campus, nor are many people very outspoken about it. Maybe that's why I didn't notice it until after I came here."
College Freshman,2,The school doesn't really put much effort into facilities for students.
College Freshman,2,"There's only one dining hall on campus, so it fills up fast and it gets old fast. Most of the time they have bad food. If you're a vegetarian or you like variety in your food, you won't like it."
College Freshman,2,"There's not really any athletic spirit. Most of the fans in the stands are parents. No one really pays attention to any of the sports here, though. The athletes are pretty good, for a D3 school Stevens does pretty good in some sports."
College Freshman,2,"For the price you pay, you don't get much. The only thing you really get is a nice view of the city, if your dorm is near the city. The dorms are pretty small and they're all corridor style (except CPA, which are designed triples with a private bathroom). In some upperclassmen dorms you'll have a private bathroom but they're all corridor style dorms (which can be good or bad depending on what you want). People try to move off campus or to leased housing as soon as possible if they can. For what dorming costs though, you're not getting much."
College Freshman,2,"If you want a typical college experience, then look somewhere else. If you want a large campus, lots of clubs, an environment with a lot of school spirit, this isn't the place to go. If you want to have fun, chances are you won't like it here. If you want an active student body or if you want a lot of diversity, this is the last place you want to go. If you want  guaranteed good results from your education, then this is the place to go. It may not be the most fun or the best college around, but it seems like everyone who goes here has a good career lined up right after they graduate. Generally, you can expect a job offer and I haven't heard of anyone having a hard time finding a job after graduation. Some people have jobs guaranteed before they graduate."
College Freshman,2,"The gym is open to everyone, but has only enough room for 50 people. Lines are often."
College Freshman,2,"The Ratio... That's all I have to say. It is about 30% girls and 70% guys, and almost all of the girls have boyfriends."
College Sophomore,2,"A lot of athletes attend Stevens, however; it is difficult to get many of the non-athlete students involved in athletics. This includes fan support, school spirit, and athletic facilities mostly. Games are not attended by many students. Some sporting events are easier to fill with fans than others, but it is still not as exciting as it should be. A school's athletics should give students school spirit. They should want to go out, be social, and support their teams. However, it is hard to do that here, and not many events are organized to get these students involved. Furthermore, the athletic facilities for non-athlete students are horrendous. They are overcrowded and do not give non-athlete students a great chance to be athletic and get into shape. It is extremely hard for students who used to be athletes, and still want to keep that athletic lifestyle to do so."
College Junior,2,"Typical techie bunch with techie personalities. 
Guy to Girl Ratio: 7 : 3
Guys: The odds and good but the goods are odd."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Good luck on this one. Every man for himself. Only plus side is that you can get a discounted rate as a commuter, and you can get guest passes when friends come to visit."
Senior,1,"DO NOT GO TO THIS TERRIBLE SCHOOL!!!! They will extort you for every single last dollar with hidden fees and a steadily rising tuition in exchange for disgusting dorms, a mediocre education, and a miserable student experience. Absolutely disgusting pigs."
Sophomore,1,"I made a huge mistake going to Stevens. Although I did make some good friends here, I think the professors and school administrative staff need to improve tremendously. I feel that I did not receive a good education here and mostly learned on my own. The tuition and costs of living in Hoboken is too much for what you get here. I would avoid Stevens. It is not worth the money. If you have a better or cheaper option, definitely reconsider. I know several other
 students who also feel the same and regret going here."
Freshman,1,"Stay Away! My experiences with the financial aid office, the administration and even my advisor have been an absolute nightmare. I will not return next year and have wasted a year of my life. No one cares about you once you accept and pay. They treat you like a number and as if they are doing you a favor just to talk to you. Do Not come here!"
Freshman,1,The professors here are terrible. My high school teachers were a thousand times better. Stay away. The campus is basically a construction site. The administration is so unhelpful. Looking to transfer already after one semester.
Freshman,1,Horrible school. Biggest mistake. Administration does not care about the students once they have your money.
Senior,1,"Campus location is the only good thing about Stevens. Administration is awful and the education is not good here. Really regret going here even with the nice scholarship. Plus, be careful. The campus is undergoing massive construction the next few years; so it will be very noisy and messy."
Works Here,1,Worst school for AI.  Professors and staff openly say AI research should be stopped and cognitive reasoning 'would end the world' and 'hope it never happens.'  If interested in AI research and innovation stay away from this openly AI hostile school.  Treat people poorly.  Contacted new AI department never heard back and now working elsewhere.
Senior,1,"I found Stevens people to be mean.  Many professors are cruel and bash people.  Hoboken is a 3rd rate 1 square mile pittance with a very high crime rate.  No one has ever heard of Stevens, to give such a glowing rating to such an unknown school with such questionable quality is wrong. Do schools pay to get such good reviews?  Most professors are assistant or less and most at the school are so severe or strict students will not be prepared for a good job or for life. Life is not about cheap bantering, bad attitude and undesirable personal competition.  It's about being the best you can and working well with others.  Stevens just pushes bad New Jersey fake above it all attitude which if attendees aren't careful may set them up for a very undesirable life and career."

Sophomore,1,"Stevens is more of a workforce training experience than a college experience. If you're eager to take classes designed to lower your GPA so they have an excuse to take away your scholarship money, Stevens is the right school for you. They have a fantastic ""return on investment"" because they make sure you won't take any fun or interesting classes and everything they ever teach your is geared toward getting a job that'll make your hate your life. On the bright side they teach you how to deal with hating your life from an early age. Socially, the school is dead. Unless you're willing to deal with the extensive red tape and secrets of the fraternities in order to have some semblance of a social life with the other people who think they're smarter than everyone else because they managed to join a clique, you'll be stuck in your prison cell of a dorm.  After my experience I'd advise anyone considering this school to go somewhere else."
College Senior,1,"On campus housing is only open to underclassmen and a few upperclassmen, but not a good choice due to lack of upkeep and lack of space. The housing selection process is really bad and the lottery is not done the way the say it is. They also do not have enough housing for everyone but continue to guarantee housing to draw people to the school for the money"
College Freshman,1,"If you're not 21, you won't have a good time. Frats host nearly all the parties and they're all pretty bad. You'll have to join a frat in order to party here, and the really bad ratio makes a lot of parties sausage fests. You'll need a fake in order to have any fun drinking in the dorms. If you're 21 and have a lot of money to spend, then you'll have a great time. Hoboken is full of bars. Until then, you'll be pretty bored and probably end up going to visit other colleges (NYU or Rutgers) if you want to have fun."
College Freshman,1,"The transportation is nonexsistant. I have been here for a year now and the only shuttle I have ever seen takes athletes on and off campus. That being said, we really don't need campus transportation because everything is in walking distance."
College Junior,1,"If You're Not a Commuter Don't Bring Your Car – Parking in Hoboken is an absolute nightmare if you can't afford a dedicated space in a lot. Don't even bother having a car if you are living in the dorms, everything you could need is within walking distance from campus anyways."
College Junior,1,"Parking is awful on campus. There are several small lots, but there is rarely space, especially if there is an event that parents are attending."
College Junior,1,"Each year the aid goes down drastically. They give a lot of aid to freshman to attract more freshman, but in the end its lowered."

Graduate Student,5,"Delaware State like college or university is supposed to be was an exposure to the world. The professors are there to assist and the classes are moderately sized. The campus is situated off of I-13 and is accessible to Virginia, New York, Pennsylvania  Washington D.C. to name a few. The entire experience is one for the ages.

Junior,5,Delaware State University is the only Historically Black College or University in the state of Delaware. I am currently a nursing major and I love how I am being trained as a professional. I feel like the school takes a lot of time in planning the best possible way a student can succeed in their major. The school is very clean and it provides a therapeutic environment to learn. I am a proud hornet and I would recommend anyone to attend the school. I think all students if they apply themselves will be successful in their studies and careers.
Freshman,5,"I’m an upcoming freshman. I’ve visited multiple times. I’ve been on tours, open houses, events on campus and my entire family attended DSU and I absolutely love it ! I had so much fun and connected with others they were extremely welcoming, I feel at home when I’m at Delaware State University. DSU has truly been my dream school.

When I became a student there, it was like I was fulfilling a dream. The staff was so nice and the students were very welcoming to me. I liked where I lived at the time, everything was just cool. The food could be a little better, but the food contract is up now, so we’ll be getting a new food company this upcoming year. The education is great, the professors are awesome. My campus is just beautiful. There are so many times where I’m caught stopping just to take a picture of something that just seems so beautiful. I love how safe my campus is, as well. Whenever my college hosts parties, there are public safety officials at every single door. Public Safety is also at every event we have, as well as circulating the campus 24/7."

My school encourage students to uplift each other. The organizations on campus allows students to be who they are and to also meet new people and feed off each other energy. Delaware State also encourage students to dress professional on certain days. This gives students a chance to prepare for their careers. If I was given an chance to choose a different school, I would not take it."
College Freshman,5,I have only stayed in my dorm for 2 days for orientation
College Freshman,5,As an incoming Freshmen I can only discuss what i have been told.
College Sophomore,5,There are a few majors that have guaranteed job opportunities after graduation which is amazing.  There are hundreds of internships that students do to get them ready for the real world.  As long as students talk to their academic advisors the world is in the palm of their hands.
College Sophomore,5,"As I previously stated, Delaware State is the best school out there.  Courses are very interactive, professors are always willing to help, and there are so many classes to take.  The class sizes are relatively small, and you actually get to connect with your professor."
College Sophomore,5,"The Greek life at Delaware State is amazing.  We have most of the divine nine besides two fraternities, but other than that, DSU is all about the Greeks.  The Greeks are always hosting events, or having shows.  There is hardly any envy on non-Greeks.  The school supports Greek life to the highest caliber."
College Sophomore,5,"Delaware State University is the best school, and the perfect school for me.  I am so glad that I decided to look into HBCUs. I grew up in a predominately white neighborhood, and I as an African American wanted to know what it felt like to be around intelligent black greatness.  That is exactly was Delaware State University has given to me.  There are over a hundred clubs and organizations that are free and open for anyone to join in.  The school is medium sized, so get to see familiar faces, but then again you get to see and meet new people everyday.  My school is the greatest in my eyes.  I love my HBCU."
College Freshman,5,Greek life is amazing! It's always fun when the Greeks have events!
College Junior,5,I really enjoy watching and participating in school sporting events.
College Junior,5,"The Professors are very supportive.  I was going through a difficult time in my life and one of my professor stood by me even if i need to a shoulder to cry on or even just a hug, Dr. Rin was more than just my professor, she was my friend."
College Freshman,5,"I love DSU, life changing experience."
College Freshman,5,Sports are what makes college so special it takes your mind off of books. It gives a chance to show ur love for the school community and really bond
College Freshman,5,i love my HBCU no matter how much they charge us..
College Freshman,5,The Greeks are the life of all the campus events. They show what being a brother/sister really means.
College Freshman,5,Students are able to call the center at any time if they feel they or any of the studentsare in danger the school has support centers for students who need people to talk to such as mentors. Campus police are always available which ensures the students that they are safe.
Junior,4,Great university the experience is amazing! The school campus is beautiful. There's a plenty of activities for students to participate in.
Senior,4,"I will be starting my online classes on the 24th of August, I don’t really know how there online classes work but it should be pretty easy."
Junior,4,"I only took online courses during the pandemic. Yet, I am registered for an actual online course in the Fall."
Junior,4,"Delaware State, isn’t too big or too small. The school fits me in so many ways and i absolutely love going here."
Niche User,4,I really liked going over to Delaware State because of the very nice people and the campus was very beautiful. Nice people.
Niche User,4,I took some of my classes online and the service was spectacular. Professors were laid back and were very nice. Definitely would take more classes online.
Freshman,4,"Have not taken online classes as of yet, but there will be some classes done online. I am attending DSU soon, but I have been on campus before and know a few people who have attended the school already."
Senior,4,"Overall, Delaware State University has been a great experience for me.  Most of the professors are great and really care about their students.  The only things that bother me are the lack of student events as well as the not so good food in the dining halls."
Senior,4,"I have taken a few online courses at Delaware State University.  Overall, the professors teaching online courses are very helpful and prompt with email responses.  I have not had a bad experience with online courses."
Freshman,4,"My experience at Delaware State University is one I will continue to cherish. I am fortunate enough to be on the women's soccer team and have that relationship with so many amazing woman and coaches. It gives a feeling of family, while being away from my own family. Not to mention how personable everyone at this university is. You will always find someone who is willing to help you out with whatever it is that you need. I am very glad I chose to attend Delaware State University."
Junior,4,"Delaware State University is the home of the hornet. I transferred into this wild, active and lively HBCU. The school is positive. Many organizations around campus help promote awareness and keep activities going so that students will be able to be active. Basketball games are always the place to be. Do not miss a Thursday wing night at the cafeteria. The Dj's, dancers and frats will have you forgetting where you are.  This campus is a community that lifts one another. This is my home. Hornets forever."
Freshman,4,Delaware State University is such a good college academic wise. They invest deeply into student success and wants to provide all the resources for students to be successful. But there needs to be some improvement in campus food. the cafe food is not good enough for as much the tuition is. The school freshmen dorms needs improvement also.
Freshman,4,I love the engaging atmosphere at DSU. It really allows people to become involved in any way possible.
Sophomore,4,"The school is great. However, washing clothes, reading books/need for class, printing should be free. I t is bad enough I have to pay to eat, sleep and learn. The food should be good and have more healthier options that students are going to actually eat."
Niche User,4,I love the community around this area. It’s surrounded by a lot of delicious food choices and the Dover mall. It’s very supportive in all sports and community activities. A lovely place to be!!
Freshman,4,Teacher very helpful. Classmate was also helpful and nice. Changes would be more organized and faster in admissions building.
Freshman,4,"My experience at Delaware State University has been amazing although I am a freshman , being at Delaware State University has really taught me a lot in the little time that I have been there."
Freshman,4,Delaware State takes interest in their students and seeks to make sure that they graduate in four years or less. You may have to work a bit to bring everything together but it is worth investing in.
Sophomore,4,"After completing my freshman year at Delaware State University I have learned a lot of things whether that just be about school or my overall self. Being in college is a totally different world and is one of the greatest experiences one will ever endure, based off my short experience I learned to be more independent and that there are other people like me who want to something with their lives."
Junior,4,"I am happy to say that I am a Delaware State University Hornet. The community is very welcoming and even though this school is an HBCU, the student body is very diverse."
Sophomore,4,I like how the administrators are all about the students. I plan to strive for greatness with the help of my professors.
Freshman,4,I'm getting ready to attend Delaware State University and this review is based on the things I've heard thus far as well as the things I've noticed. They take time to put the needs of the students first.
Freshman,4,"Delaware State University in my opinion is a very good school it's ranked 12th  best HBCU in the nation. It's a small school compared to other universities, but that is beneficial because the students gets hands experience with professors. Just like any other school it is what you make of it. To have fun at DSU you have to be active in the student activities. One thing I would change is the financial aid, you have to be on top of it to get things done with your financial aid. Overall it is a good school with a great student body and faculty."
Junior,4,"It is an HBCU, with a lot of campus organizations and activities for students. Although it is not as diverse as neighboring universities I couldn’t have chose a better school to attend to achieve a higher education. Once you get involved on campus you will be able to see past some of the slight issues that face every college or university. Professors are extremely helpful, they also are willing to work one on one. The classroom sizes allow that personal connection to ensure that every student who intends on passing to pass and make a new connection."
Sophomore,4,"My freshmen year was full of fun memories. The academics are great and professor, truly are about your success. The games are always fun and students, are active. Every week there is something going on in the dining halls. Every Thursday is wing night, and every Tuesday either discounts are given at the POD or serving something special in the dining halls."
Junior,4,"My experience at Delaware State University has been amazing. The student life on campus is very active and family-like. The college offers many programs and has dozens of organizations. However, the university could improve its food and housing facilities."
Sophomore,4,I like the clubs that are there for the students. The clubs offer scholarships and opportunities within the persons major. I also like the culture. I would like to see a change in the response to certain things. Like if there is a broke toilet it won’t be fixed for another month. I would also like to see the clubs more promoted by the school. Most students won’t even know an event is happening unless someone comes up to you and promotes it. Sometimes these events don’t get a big turnout. Also more funding into the arts.
Freshman,4,"The experience of college is what you make it. The food here though, it’s not that great. We do have a chick fil a on campus though which is good. But the food here is not good compared to what we pay for meal plans. The vibe of the student body is getting better. Also, pay your housing deposit early so you can live where you really want. Besides that the campus is really fun and just a great environment to be in. Dover doesn’t really have a lot going on around it. I suggest taking a tour so you can see what it’s like here to see if it is the right school for you before just coming though."
Junior,4,"As everyone knows, college is what you make of it. If you’re looking to get involved in clubs and organizations, dsu is the place for you."
Niche User,4,When I was on a college tour I really enjoyed myself. The environment was amazing and I'd definitely recommend it to anybody that plans on attending it.
Junior,4,I enjoyed my experience at DSU. People are very friendly and fun to speak to. The University is very diverse which allows learning about cultures and people from so many places. I would like to see even more diversity but it is a great start.
Junior,4,The atmosphere is wonderful. Everyone is friendly and very helpful. The only thing I would change is the food. The food can be better and have more variety.
Junior,4,There are things that need improvement such as the food and some of the organization in certain departments is not the best. Student employment needs some work because many students do not qualify or have trouble getting a pay rate that is sustainable for living. Pay can also be challenging because some students have not been paid on time or their pay has been shorted due to errors made in the payroll department. Overall the campus needs improvements so that students and the school can have more funding for expansion.
Graduate Student,4,Delaware State University was not how I expected.  With all of the money that was put into that school the dorms were not up to date and the department I was in which was textile and apparel was not taking very seriously.
Junior,4,"My first semester at Delaware State University was very quite different. Given the fact that I was a out of state transfer student I was very excited in experiencing a HBCU. The students are from all over the United States, all majoring in different studies. I made plenty of friends my first semester. For my major (Business Management), Delaware State offered a lot of courses for me to take as well as many internships to help me prepare for my career. There were times where we had to dress professionally as if we were about to go to a interview for some of my courses. The food at Delaware State was good on some days. I can definitely say I was apart of the ""freshman 15"". There was always something going on at Delaware State. There were times where all the students would be in the student center or MLK as we call it socializing and interacting with one another. I am glad I made the conscience decision to attend Delaware State."
Senior,4,There are some professors that will do everything in their power to help you. You must keep on people in certain fields in order to get some problems resolved.
Niche User,4,"When I first visited the college to find the right one for me after high school, I said to myself, ""this college is too large for me"". But when I heard that it had the best agriculture program closer to where I live, it got me thinking maybe I will like this college. My high school agriculture teacher graduated there for her degree and that's how I came to Delaware State University."
Junior,4,"At Delaware State University, I like how unified the campus is. It has a family like feel to it, which I think is important because it makes you feel comfortable. What could be improved is the campus itself. We have a lot of pot holes, issues in dormitory halls and education buildings. More attention needs to be paid to small details like these because they play a big role in how students experience college."
Sophomore,4,"Delaware State is a great University that is full of life. All the students know how to come together and have fun. It has a comfortable environment and teachers that are dedicated to helping you learn and achieve great things. However, all schools have their downsides. One of the most common issues with Delaware state is the hard time most students have with the administration office."
Senior,4,There are some housing issues that could be fixed. I love that we are so diverse and we can all come together and have a great time at a party or some type of school event.
Niche User,4,The faulty and staff are really nice but some facillities need to be changed they are getting too old.
Junior,4,My experience at Delaware State University has changed me into a educated woman. This experience overall has definitely built a stronger me from handling my own responsibilities to running an organization on campus Delaware State University's college of business has granted me the connections with many different business corporations in aspects of internships and scholarships. A lot of different programs to help build your resume such as STOMP and SAP.
Sophomore,4,I really like Delaware State. Initially it was not a school I wanted to go to but that quickly changed my first semester attending. One thing this university does is make you feel like you are in a big family. There very good with encouraging school spirit and they help remind all the students how united we are as a student body. They offer many resources so you can have the best chance at excelling in your classes.
Freshman,4,"I like how the class sizes are small and professors are able to connect with each student individually. The campus population is small, so everyone knows almost everybody."
Sophomore,4,"I love my HBCU! The atmosphere  on this campus is conducive for learning and instilling pride in not only yourself, but also  your culture. I enjoy going to school everyday and feel like the professors take pride in their jobs and actually care about teacher and more importantly making sure their students are truly learning. This is an excellent school and if I could do it all over again I would choose Delaware State University every time."
Freshman,4,So far I have no complaints with Delaware State University. I think the issues may arise from the student body and not the school as a whole.
Junior,4,i like that there are online classes that can be taken during the summer and that most of the teachers are very accomodating.
Freshman,4,What I like about Delaware State was the family vibe it had and how I was able to get along with the students and teachers the only thing I didn't enjoy was the food
Freshman,4,I feel at home while at Delaware State. It is a family environment with professors and other students that just want the most out of your education.
Sophomore,4,I haven't graduated yet but being in the military they stay on top of me and make sure I'm always squared away. It's like your second family.
Sophomore,4,I have attended Delaware State for three semesters so far I have had a great experience. I attended Delaware tech for one semester and can easily distinguish the differences which makes me more appreciative to attending Delaware State . The teachers are actually here for you to succeed . The school offers a lot of opportunity for leadership roles and a great student life. They offer free tutoring almost every day for any subject so if your behind it helps and you also get rewarded for going .
Junior,4,"Delaware State University is a HBCU. I believe that I needed an HBCU because I needed the emotional support from moving away from home. I got a lot of support, I've learned to love being african-american and being a woman. Delaware State has helped me with my confidence."
Freshman,4,"Attending Delaware State University you get to really know your fellow student body. DSU is very student ran with over seers to make sure everything is conducted swiftly and efficiently. My current major is electrical engineering which is a math bases major. The school provides free tutors to help out with any subject a student could have problems in. Professors are able and will to help out a student willing to learn. The only change I would want to see is better food options in the cafe. Other then that, I am proud to be a Delaware State Hornet."
Sophomore,4,My experience so far at Delaware State University has been a very interesting experience that I really enjoyed. At DSU I met a lot of different people that I became friends with. Something I would change is the campus cafe could have better food and I want the party scene can be better.
Freshman,4,"I am a freshman and I enjoy my experience here so far. The love the the academic opportunities that are given to me here and I'm most pleased with the staff. One thing I believe that can change is the easy accessibility to non-students onto campus. There have been many instances where I've heard the campus has been penalized for the irresponsible actions of other people. Instead of punishing students, campus police should be more strict about who comes on campus."
College Freshman,4,Teachers are friendly. They will help me when I have a problem.
College Freshman,4,We have a great wellness center on campus.
College Freshman,4,"I am just an incoming Freshmen. I have been on a college tour and orientation.

I met some of my Professors and I was very excited about attending Delaware State University. They me 

if I had the passion to work hard I will do fine."
College Freshman,4,The reason i enjoyed my high school was because of my teachers who helped me through all my tuff stages of learning and helped improved my test taking skills and work effort.
College Sophomore,4,The courses are similar for the entire campus in some aspects but every course is different depending the major of a student. The class sizes are average and the professors accommodate the needs of the students the best that they can.
Junior,2,As a psych major they only have research based psychologist so its not the best for anyone who wants to do clinical psychology. student life is very dry because clubs and orgs are not prevalent on the campus. It is about what you make it but it is very difficult to thrive there
Niche User,2,"While taking online classes at Delaware State University and living in Hawaii at the same time, the online classes were extremely hard especially if I am 6 hours behind of East Coast time. The communication between the students and the professors are extremely inconsistent and trying to contact the professors was such a hard time for me. It took a whole week for one of my professors to finally get back to me on an assignment."
Alum,2,My criminal justice professors were amazing.  They are also in your corner if you actually do the work and they will write you great recommendations.
Junior,2,"I have attended three schools prior to attending DSU, including Delaware Tech, and have an associate’s from another community college in PA with a 4.0. Let me just say, DSU has some issues that were never even close to present at the other schools.
Pros: Easy networking and opportunities. Easy 4.0.
Biggest issue: administration. They will terrify you with their incompetence. I have had heart attacks from them on many occasions. Wouldn't be surprised if a ""surprise"" issue delays my graduation. 
Classes are easy- a double edged sword. Easy 4.0 but many students and professors unorganized and too easygoing. Good luck getting a schedule of events for your classes.
Health center has no nurse or healthcare (even flu shots..) on campus. Awful. Student healthcare website says ""go to student health center."" Uh, sure... They refer you out for care. Should at least be a nurse for crying out loud.
Facilities dangerous and full of mold. Desperate need of new buildings. Enter at your own risk."
Junior,2,"This school has great diversity, but the staff is not helpful. Financial aid is slow with everything and is ran by student workers. Professors are not bad, but they are not the greatest; help with learning is not offered for everyone. Housing process is ridiculous and rooms are torn apart and filled with black mold."
Sophomore,2,"I am a sophomore here at Delaware State and I would say that the out-of-state tuition is not worth coming here. The administration is very disorganized and unprofessional. To add with that, the food places never have it together; you can never get exactly what you pay for."
Freshman,2,"I am a born and raised New Yorker. The environment is unwelcoming, and the administration is completely disorganized. The course work is great preparation, but you better quality education within your state. It is not worth the extra cost of out-of-state tuition. Good luck!"
Junior,2,"This school has the WORST administration that I have ever seen. The application process was easy, but I was given out-of-state tuition even though I was supposed to have in-state. The application for scholarships was closed off to me because the financial aid office never created an account for me, and when I emailed the office and talked to them in person, they said they would contact me soon and they never did, so I could not apply for scholarships. I petitioned some of my transfer credits and had them approved as actual course, but they are still wrong on my transcript. The smart boards often didn't connect, there was no working air or heat in the building that my classes were held, and we had almost no lab equipment. Some professors gave off the vibe that they really did not care about your education, taught straight off PowerPoint slides and gave exams that were more in-depth than the material that was taught, which was discouraging for someone who wants to actually learn."
College Senior,2,It happens and students are pretty slick with sneaking drugs and alcohol
College Senior,2,I wish security took their job a little more seriously.
College Freshman,2,The sporting teams records are not all the best. I enjoy going to games because of the school spirit that we have.
College Freshman,2,Several crimes have occurred on campus already in my first semester.
College Senior,2,"Very unorganized and not a great ""learning"" school."
College Junior,2,The men's teams are horrible at the moment. They are not winning any games. Literally. The female teams don't get the support they deserve. School spirit is poor.
College Sophomore,2,GREEK LIFE ON CAMPUS SUCKS THERE ARE NO QUES NO ALPHAS AND ALL THE KAPPAS JUST GRADUATED
College Freshman,2,I hate going there. I swear these people dont know what their doing
College Freshman,2,They don't give any money to out of state students unless they are athletes or in the band.
College Freshman,2,"I don't know about any other campus housing yet because I was a freshman but Harriet tubman Hall is where I stayed at , the rooms were small as shoe boxes with no air conditioner in the summer and barely any heat in the winter."
College Freshman,2,Some of the dining places that most students crave close at about 11 o'clock at night. Most students get hungry after that time so they have to settle for places like McDonalds or Wawa which many really don't want.
College Freshman,2,The financial aid process was pretty bad because it was like the people who worked for financial aid didn't do their jobs fast enough and it was like they didn't care that we were receiving any aid from the school. It's like the people would have to take matters into their own hands and figure out how they were going to get financial aid themselves.
College Sophomore,2,My tips for getting financial aid would be to apply as soon as it becomes available.
College Junior,2,"I found my apartment complex alone with no help. I feel as though the actual university does not have a lot of ""off campus housing"" affliated with acutal complexes and I dont think that is fair. I feel as though there should be Apartment Complexes affiliated with DSU where its free to everyone yet students get a huge or somewhat of a discount. 


The yards is not ""off campus"" to me. Its still a part of DSU . They need more ""off campus"" apartment choices."
College Junior,2,I feel as though no one educates students on anything about financial aid. Ive been trying to recieve the Federal SEOG grant since I first arrived at this school as well as so many other grants/scholarships I know I am eligible for due to being enrolled in a different University prior. I recieved a lot more financial assistance at a out of state university rather than the one I am a actual resident of.
College Junior,2,"Ive had horrible experiences with the food on campus. I only stayed on campus for a year for me to discover I had to move off campus. It is way to expensive and the service is no where near worth the money charged. 

I've actually had a horribe encounter at Conrad, being served raw chicken on Tues/Thurs .."
College Freshman,2,we forever in trouble. they must relax with the strictness
College Sophomore,2,Del states organization skills are very bad
College Freshman,2,there is no housing we hardly see the greeks um yea i wish it was better
Recent Alumnus,2,Don't walk anywhere alone at night. There was a recent shooting on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,Focus on relationships instead of classes.
Recent Alumnus,2,off-campus housing is far from campus facilities.
College Sophomore,2,The food is not all that great and the meal plan itself cost a lot. It's cheaper just not to get the meal plan at all since your not getting a five star restaurant dining experience.
College Sophomore,2,"Most of everyone I know are drinking, and a lot of people even smoke! The accessibility is too easy."
College Sophomore,2,"Not really options to choose from, unless you have a car and plan on driving."
College Sophomore,2,"There is a variety of okay programs and activities at DSU, but there isn't much other activities since the campus is small and therefore, does not offer much."
College Sophomore,2,"It's near highways, so there isn't much scenery, but everything is located and not that difficult to get to."
College Freshman,2,Not the best but its ok
College Sophomore,2,The wifi connection could be way better.
College Sophomore,2,Delaware weather has been very unpredictable.
College Sophomore,2,We need more food choices.
College Sophomore,2,School shuttle needs more stops to the different shopping area in dover.
College Sophomore,2,"I am not sure. Because I eat way healthier than my friends. I am not a fast food person. So for people who would not mind fast food its rather well. On the other hand, if you are more like a health freak like myself you have very few options."
College Student,2,"If it's healthy there is no seasoning, or if it's seasoned it's not healthy."
College Student,2,"Some buildings don't have wifi, and sometimes wifi is down. But most of the homework is online."
College Sophomore,2,There is not much to do in Delaware.
College Sophomore,2,Greek life is very present on my campus most Greeks are friend and down to earth but some are very cliquey as well. There is no special treatment that i am aware of
College Sophomore,2,"Very inconsiderate, makes a lot of mistakes, bad communication inside office and to students. I feel they need to speak through out the office more, they need to be more friendly, and admit when mistakes are made on their behalf."
College Sophomore,2,"The computers on campus are okay, but would make it better would be upgrading the wifi on campus because it is very slow or often does not work at all."
College Sophomore,2,Well other than Homecoming there is no nightlife on campus. The campus doesn't even provide transportation for off campus events . There is no places to go eat or hang out after 12 am on a weekend.
College Freshman,2,I  am not the type to feed into peer pressure but the amount of drugs that you see is bad.
College Freshman,2,"the spots are so limited it is very hard, harder than it should be. if you don not get in you have to change majors."
College Freshman,2,The housing process could go a lot smoother. Feels like running in cirlces.
College Freshman,2,This campus rarely has things To do that's why students come up with the ideas there self
College Student,2,I don't qualify for financial aid process. 
College Freshman,2,"There has been a lot of robberies lately, I guess because the holidays are near."
College Senior,2,"Dover is not a college town. There really are no clubs or bars. If your looking for that, you will have to drive a minimum hour to Newark, Philly, or Baltimore. Everyone always says there is nothing to do but eat and mess around. Sad but true, for most."
College Senior,2,"When I lived on campus for 1 semester I regularly used the campus bus. It is confusing and they make the schedule hard to access. Also, once when dropped off at KMart they did not return to pick me up. So I had to walk, about 20 minutes, back to campus alone!"
College Senior,2,"Del State has many students from urban areas such as NY, Philly, Jersey, Baltimore, DC, etc, so they come with those urban personalities and attitudes. I found it unbearable. Half the men sell or do drugs, half the girls want to fight and be sluts. If your classy or quiet, they will probably dislike and tease you. They did it to me. So if you are not hood, avoid your peers at all costs! Definitely do not date them, Del State guys and girls have a reputation for carrying STDs...."
College Sophomore,2,"Most of the dorms don't have air conditioning. It's not great, but it also isn't too bad."
College Junior,2,i do think they should more dealing with modern technology and the medical field
College Junior,2,when it is cold it is cold and when the weather breaks it breaks
Freshman,1,"The admission and students life are non-functioning. Being an international students athlete the school are not good at helping one feel home and safe. The gives out fees for being international. There is little activity on the campus. The only dorm that are nice is the new one they built, additionally the fire alarm goes of at least one time a week when you live in one of the older dorms, which means getting out of bed 2 in the middle of the night on a school day."
Niche User,1,Almost got stabbed during my visit to this school. DO NOT APPLY! My lawyers will be contacting this school shortly
College Senior,1,My overall experience is okay. The teachers are excellent and knowlegeable. I appreciate the courses offered. I really do learn alot.
College Sophomore,1,I LIVED IN TUBMAN MY FRESHMAN YEAR IT WAS THE WORST PLACE TO LIVE IN
College Sophomore,1,"For the amount of money we (my parents) are dishing out on a meal plan, it's really trifling. The Café closes early leaving Conrad the only dining facility to be opened. Grilleworks is usually my go to place when Conrad has no options and when I do not want to use my flex. At times however, the grill at grilleworks has had problems leaving me to use my flex dollars. Flex dollars are great but I wish they could either roll over or we could get like $200 because it easily runs out when all other places do not satifiy me. I wish that Conrad would serve more fruit, I love fresh fruit."
College Junior,1,Administration is very incompetent and most of them should be fired. They are also very strict n people. You can't do anything fun without risking getting a judicial.
College Junior,1,The admins are extremely incompetent save for one or two. You need to keep on top of them and check over everything because they are so EXTREMELY unreliable.
Recent Alumnus,1,No Greek housing available; however there are plots
Recent Alumnus,1,Commitment to purging students is primary focus.
Recent Alumnus,1,Students prevailing due to remarkable teachers.
Recent Alumnus,1,very hard to study in the library. (distractions)
Recent Alumnus,1,Teachers respect and need for students.
College Sophomore,1,financial aid rewards do not help at all
College Junior,1,"Everything is so far that you would have to have a car to get to it. Also, there are not many places that are open late and provide student discounts."
College Freshman,1,Delaware Weather always changes and is never consistant
College Freshman,1,Off campus dining is not accessible if you do not have transportation
College Freshman,1,On campus food is horrible
College Student,1,The bus does not run on Sundays!
College Student,1,If you don't have a car your stuck with walking or taking the shuttle to the few places that it runs.
College Student,1,"I hAve lost 20 pounds by living on this campus, your better off cooking for yourself."
College Freshman,1,"Probably the worst department here, seems like you have to go from place to place just to get one thing done and then start all the way over for what you originally came for."
College Sophomore,1,"Campus food is disgusting , period ! I usually choose to eat off campus. There are a lot of choices off campus that are very close. "
College Student,1,It is freezing over there
College Junior,1,"They find time for you when they are ready to deal with you. It's horrible, they don't care."
College Junior,1,"Dover, Delaware has no real nightlife from my experience.  Females generally get into bars for free. Drinks are average price.  From my knowledge of the area, getting to the bars is not a hassle."
College Senior,1,"Delaware State has the worst Financial Aid department in the world! They audit me every year, mess with your aid, play games, lie, ignore emails, ignore calls, only have one teller, list goes on and on. They give HBCUs a bad name. The unprofessionalism is appalling. The ya re money hungry and will mess you up any way possible. EVERY summer I have had to go to their office at least 5-10 times. They are always backed up, and never know whAts going on. To make matters worse they all have stank attitudes. They all cackle like hyenas, roll their eyes, and do anything to aggravate you further. 

Your day will be ruined..."
College Senior,1,"The biology major, specializes in giving you too much homework. It almost feels like high school, with the babying and taking attendance. I personally, have taken too many extra classes. Because my advisor was incompetent/didn't care. The chair is a hard nose, and obviously wants students to stay as many extra years as possible. The classes are very inconvenient. They are scheduled early and late at night, and often back to back. "
College Senior,1,"We have armed robberies, break ins, assaults, drug dealers, etc. just yesterday a girl was punched and robbed by to MEN. this is normal though. Robberies happen at least twice a semester, especially in the Courtyard Apts. Most people on the campus are thiefs, but some are nice enough to return your phone if you left it. 

But it is not a safe campus at all. Just this past summer, someone tried to break into my car, and damaged the window motor. Campus police were busy I guess."
College Senior,1,"For a university they dropped the ball on wifi. You can barely connect to wifi in some classes, and in others there is none. You will definitely need a laptop and printer. They charge to print in most majors and labs. Computer labs are dirty, old, and embarrassing. The chairs are sometimes torn, there is graffiti on desks, the labs are often crowded. Shameful."
College Senior,1,"It was the worst literally. Everything that could go wrong did. There is no pre med major, so your stuck taking pointless science classes, that have no real world application. The biology department pushes graduate school from day 1 and ignores those who want to enter the medical field. They have an agenda, for everyone to get a PHd, which I still don't understand to this day.

Everything is half-a$& and no one really cares. The only ones who are taken seriously are the 4.0 students. It's really sad that they do not fire all the incompetent, old, crotchety, bitter professors and deans, and instead hire someone who can get students where they want to go."
College Senior,1,"In the Biology dept you receive zero I little help with anything. In fact they will most likely hurt you, by asking you to take MORE classes they FORGOT to register you for. Help with internships is a complete joke. Not only is there no help, but you will more than likely not get any, if your gap is below 3.2. You will graduate with a worthless degree and no direction, unless you are their favorite. 

Choose another major."
College Senior,1,"When I was a freshman, at night you could smell the weed in the air around dorms. Just yesterday two classmates sitting on my sides, we're talking about buying and selling drugs.  Drugs are everywhere, and so is alcohol. "
College Senior,1,"I lived on campus 1 semester, in Jenkins hall. Worst 3 months ever! It is a 5-10 minute walk from everything. The floors are concrete. The beds are torn up and disgusting. The bathrooms are beyond me. You will never know dirty until you use a Jenkins bathroom..... The janitors are a little too friendly for me. Sometimes you want to just go to your room, without people bugging you. The head of Jenkins, was mean to me. She thought I needed to have counseling with her.....

The other dorms are just as bad. Thats why I commuted after that experience."
College Senior,1,"Parking at Del State is miserable. They want $70 a year. Also most parking lots for science majors are too far. And each year as more students drive, it gets to be to crowded. Also, walking across streets from  Lot 1 and a few other lots, is a complete nightmare. Drivers do not stop, but simply speed up. Hornet pride my butt.

"
College Senior,1,"Horrible experience. Biology department makes it extremely hard to graduate and get experience. Incompetent professors, little pre med help, everyone plays favorites, classes are only offered at one time, you will be in class Monday-Friday,  they will schedule 8am and 4pm classes in the same day, certain races of students are treated more respectfully. Please reconsider this school....you will waste lots of time and money. Unprofessionalism and stereotypical behavior at its finest!"
College Sophomore,1,I believe our campus security is horrible there was an armed robbery in my building freshman year. I got emails every other week about robberies I do not feel safe on campus at all I always walk in groups at night and carry my own pepper spray.
College Sophomore,1,Our campus shuttle goes to about 6 places it is kinda of frustrating because if it could drive about 5 or 10 mins south there would be such a wider variety of places to choose from.
College Junior,1,it appears that here at delaware state university it is hard as hell to get a scholarship.  my gpa going into my first year was 2.74 and i did not get the scholarship for being a resident of the state.  i went on to get a 3.76 gpa and when my mom asked about academic scholarships they acted like she had spit in there face.  they do not tell you what scholarships are available and if and when if you get them.  they make you fill out all this paperwork for every thing but don't inform you of nothing
Recent Alumnus,1,Delaware state has cameras but somehow the security are never there when there is an issue only after
Recent Alumnus,1,there was always an issue with financial aid at my school there was a time when they purged me due to the age of my father stating that he seemed to old??? being that my parents are older I had to bring in his birth certificate just to prove it which I thought was unbelievable and degrading
College Junior,1,"The most interesting thing about the night life at my school is Dover Downs, which is located across the street from school. But that would only be fun for those who are 21 and older"
College Sophomore,1,The campus it self is a little to strict. It is not understood that we are college students and we are grown. At time you may feel like you are treated like a criminal with public safety. As a whole the school needs to loosen up.
College Sophomore,1,"There truly is no convenient place to park because if you don't have a parking pass for that designated place then mostly likely when you get back to your car there will be a ticket, and they don't run cheap."
College Sophomore,1,"Other than the fact that there is now a Chickfila and Subway on campus the food is still horrible. Also the fact that we have to use our flex to dine at Chickfila and Subway defeats the purpose of it even being there. Its not apart of our equivalency meal plan so basically we have to pay out of pocket when we run out of flex. That's not even a huge problem because in the long run those two places will get old and the hype of having them on campus will no longer matter. The real issue is the food that is given to us on our meal plan. Supposedly we got a new vendor, but it seems exactly the same to me. The meals were just as non- nutritious as last year. The only place that I can say that has truly improved is Conrads dining hall, but who wants to walk all the way to the other side of the campus just to get there."
College Freshman,1,"Too expensive, you can only park in one area, and police ticket you just for fun."
College Freshman,1,"The Resident Advisiors are the worst. we cant have any visitation after a certain hour and we cant have outside friends sleep over and they have to pay a fee We cant play music in our dorms, or be in other resident halls It is just easier to listen to them and not get introuble"
College Freshman,1,"The financial aid & student account office freaking SUCKS ! they are no help what so ever! All they do is give you the run around, and have attitudes. If you plan on going here make sure all your stuff is in order or you will defiantly have some problems ! Everything is so disorganized and if i knew before what i know now i would have never attended dsu -.-"
College Freshman,1,I HATE THE PARKING SYSTEM! You are forced to pay $70 permit. They are already taking enough of our money. Students who are eligible to have a car on campus should be able to park for free.
College Freshman,1,"My parents were asked to bring down information regarding our financial situation.  My father has been employed since 2009, and my mother had to close her business due to the economy.  I received the least amount of financial aid.  my mother to date is still trying to get more aid for me so I can stay in school.  After my aide, my parents were still expected to pay a 10,000 balance for the year."
College Junior,1,Their Athletics suck because they lose most games they play if not all and they have not considered male soccer as part of the sporting program which i find very ridiculous.
College Junior,1,No Way – Its awful. No place to park at all. very difficult.
College Sophomore,1,Parking passes mean nothing. Anybody parks anywhere
Recent Alumnus,1,"Constant Problems – Every year, something goes wrong with billing or scheduling.  The school always seems to put holds on accounts right before grades are released for imaginary charges.  They then take forever to remove them.  Also, campus living is limited.  They have limited options for choices of food, especially healthy ones.  The on campus housing has a lot to be desired."
College Junior,1,"There are only a few good professors and I can count them on one hand. The good ones have already left. 1. Dr. Drew-Literature, 2. Dr. Jones-English/speech 3. Atif-Mathematics. That is it. I'm not exaggerating."
College Junior,1,"Poor Poor Poor – If you are a science major, turn the other way!! There are only a select few students that have opportunities. Students have to fight to get recommendations. Only a few students are focused on. NO STUDY GROUPS. NO PRE-MED ADVISERS. Not good enough."
College Junior,1,Tech on Campus – Some of the computer labs are good such as those in the EH or BoA building. But the wifi access in buildings outside of the boa is poor at best. Student center has intermittent wifi access.
College Freshman,1,"Computer Reliability – The computers in the library are decent, but when it comes to me using my own laptop in my dorm, the internet moves slow. And some days, the internet doesn't even work."
College Sophomore,1,the buses for transportation need to be expanded and he number of places it takes you should be expanded as well
College Sophomore,1,Campus Crime – a few people have been robbed on campus which makes it very uncomfortable to walk the campus alone
College Sophomore,1,"Theres Nothing in Dover – There are not many different things to do in Dover, or Delaware in general. Delware is a boring place to be and Dover is extremely boring because it is the country. Delaware State is located across from the Dover Mall and students often go there to shop although the store qualities are not that great. DSU trys to have different events to keep the students involved and having fun."

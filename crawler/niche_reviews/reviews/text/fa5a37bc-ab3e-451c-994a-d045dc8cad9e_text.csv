Junior,5,Evergreen is a hands-on learning experience usually but with everything going on in 2020 we as a learning community have had to make numerous changes to our learning environment rapidly. We have done our best and learned with each other as we went and found ways to fix problems that arise and have helped each other throughout this process. It was hard at times but we learn fast and work as a community to find innovative solutions to problems we stumble upon.
Junior,5,The Evergreen State College has a wonderful atmosphere and caring staff that try to help at every step of your journey. I have had a wonderful time coming into my own throughout my time so far at the school and there is so much ability to learn new and interesting things. I have found that the campus is pushing for a better and more tolerant future which I am very proud to be a part of.
Alum,5,"I transferred into TESC as a junior. It was my fifth school and the one where I finally found my intellectual home. The thematic multidisciplinary learning worked very well for me then and has continued to inform my learning in throughout my personal and professional life. I appreciated the academic independence offered by the flexible registration options and being welcomed as an intelligent adult capable of making good decisions about my education. The faculty challenged us as well as each other to think both broadly and deeply. We learned to engage actively in thoughtful discussion, to research deeply, to write comprehensively, and to reach out to share our understandings and to listen to those of others. As a woman of color, I appreciated the community and support I received from the Third World and other social justice student organizations."
Alum,5,I did not take any classes online but I imagine that The Evergreen State College would use it's outside the box approach to education to find ways to address the needs of its students in this educational realm.
Senior,5,"This school showed me that i really could do anything, its not a you vs me kinda school its a everyone together kinda school. Which is alot less stressful, Ive done both and appreciate this way much more."
Senior,5,"Its been tough, but the professor are very understanding about everything. They have been struggling just as much as the students so theyve been a little more lenient on most things."
Sophomore,5,"My father attended Evergreen back nearly 30 years ago. At that time he was a refugee from Morocco, which sounds strange, since Morocco is and was an ali of the USA. Though he barely spoke English at the time, he was an excellent student and though he has earned 2 masters and a PHD since his time here, he still sees Evergreen as his best college experience.  So, I transferred here last year from Harvard, and I hope to follow in his foot steps at Evergreen. I believe that the progressive mindset of the faculty and students will give me the best environment to complete my undergraduate studies in computer science.  So, I will continue on and do my best to succeed at Evergreen."
Sophomore,5,"My classes for fall and winter quarters were face-2-face. However due to the cronavirus,  spring quarter classes were online.... though I continued to live on campus."
Alum,5,"What a wonderful experience! If you would like to take control of your education, be afforded the opportunity for a rich environment with incredible communication between students and faculty - look no further!

The only change I would love to see would be to limit the amount of the preposterous outrage culture that seems to be eating the school."
Junior,5,"Evergreen is an amazing school, although it is not for everyone. If you are looking to be truly educated and to really learn, not just to prepare for the workforce and get a degree, this is the place for you."
Alum,5,"Evergreen's grading system of written evaluations and no letter grades- allowed me to find my passion working in the arts and education. This school is for the curious and passionate student. The sports teams are very fun and I encourage people to see if they can ""walk on"" to the college teams, the coaches are top notch and the campus is breathtaking in the heart of the pacific northwest rainforest."
Niche User,5,"When I visited campus, everyone there was incredibly nice and helpful. Students were eager to answer my questions and show me what I wanted to see. I was able to get a professional tour as well as a student lead tour, which showed me the things that students actually prefer to see rather than what the higher-ups thought was cool for prospective students"
Freshman,5,"I enjoy going to school at Evergreen because my professors have been willing to offer their help when anyone asks for it, and are genuinely interested in seeing their students succeed in their class. There are resources available on campus for almost any need you may have, and if what you need isn't available on campus, one of the staff will be able to direct you to nearby resources."
Alum,5,"Evergreen is truly unlike any other school. ""You get out what you put into it"" is what you often hear and it is absolutely true. If you are willing to put the work in and apply yourself, you will walk away with a unique, interdisciplinary education and a greater understanding of yourself and the world around you. If you occasionally show up for classes and don't do the work, well, you'll probably still have a good time, but that's not what you're here for. Also, I can't say this enough, take advantage of the beautiful Evergreen woods. I became myself in those woods and owe so much to Evergreen in general. Go here. You won't regret it."
Sophomore,5,Located in an amazing location! Beach and rainforest between the Olympic Mountains and Mount Rainier.  Amazing and dedicated professors.
Junior,5,"I love the atmosphere at Evergreen. Everyone is very accepting and the school offers programs that make you think differently. It's very alternative, you can;t fail any class and they don't have majors and minors.  I also enjoy the college recreation center and can appreciate that they let the community use the center as well."
Sophomore,5,"Evergreen is such a great place to learn interdisciplinary skills and knowledge, and to bond with your teachers and classmates. It's far from a traditional school in the way the programs are set up and how faculty work together to create and teach interesting and creative classes every year. Faculty are happy to work with you closely or from a distance, whichever one you're comfortable with. I have yet to meet a faculty member that did not care about my success, my health, and equity on campus. Everyone that is here wants to be here. Classmates make you feel supported in and out of the classroom."
Alum,5,"Evergreen State College is a regionally accredited 4-year college that follows a Montessori style education plan. Tucked away in a state protected forest, the campus is surrounded by ancient evergreens and unbothered wildlife. The environment is progressive, captivating, and breathtaking. They will literally bend over backward to make their students succeed. Did I mention that its one of the most affordable institutions in the nation?"
Sophomore,5,"At Evergreen, I really feel that I'm learning what I need to and what I want to at the same time. I'm impressed at how how program materials compliment each other in a way that makes my learning have substance."
Freshman,5,"I have spent almost two full quarters at Evergreen, coming from a private catholic school I love the individuality Evergreen has. There truly is something for everyone here. The professors are amazing and genuinely care about their student's success and their progress. If any students have problems or special needs in the classroom professors are ready to accommodate their students. The interdisciplinary learning style that is used here has taught me to problem solve like I never have before."
Niche User,5,Evergreen has positive vibes. Also It is very inclusive.  My experience at Evergreen has always had me feeling empowered. Evergreen has a way of connecting all types of people in academics and hobbies. The teachers at Evergreen have a huge heart for all there students.
Sophomore,5,"Evergreen allows individuals to have the freedom to design their own education and build independence. My only judgement I wish it provided more programs and classes. However, It’s interdisciplinary learning system allows students to learn in depth. But you have to work for it. Instructors and faculty work hard to help you achieve your goals. People here are passionate, diverse, and yes, eccentric. One sterotype about this college is that it’s just a punch dumb hippies and stoners. Yes there are the occasional drum circles in the hallways and the friendly neighborhood stoner named Kyle or Elijah or Shaggy but otherwise there are a lot less than I had expected. If you’re the kind of person who likes to challenge yourself and broaden your knowledge then Evergreen is the place for you. Especially if your interested in topics such as environmental science, visual arts, and social justice. I had my doubts at first about this college but I was pleasantly surprised and you will be too."
Freshman,5,"The staff and teachers make an effort to connect with students like I've never experienced anywhere else. The education style is alternative, hands-on, and experience/discussion based. Perfect for students with different educational backgrounds and needs. Freedom to intersect interests and majors with the opportunity for independent study boundlessly expands the educational experience.  Not to mention the campus is beyond stunning with over 700 acres of undeveloped land, including beaches and forests."
Freshman,5,"This school comes with a few caveats but if you're disciplined and motivated, you can truly gain some skills needed in today's workforce not emphasized in more conventional universities. You'll learn to work in a team, be flexible, and I believe this liberal arts institution is one of the few that actually teaches you ""how to think"" as liberal art universities are known to do. 

It may not be a perfect fit for everyone, but give this weird place real consideration."
Freshman,5,"Evergreen is a non-traditional school that provides students application-based degrees. It's uniqueness allows students to flourish rather than worrying about traditional college ideals. Also, it's set in a forest and is one of the most eco-friendly universities in the region!"
College Sophomore,5,I can't say enough good things about my school!
College Sophomore,5,"This college is the best place to learn, explore and make friends. I can't say enough nice things about it!"
College Senior,5,"I feel very safe. We have lots of programs to keep us safe. Our admin is very good about preparing us, and I have never felt safer on another campus."
College Sophomore,5,"I""m not sure how to explain it but by the looks of it there alot."
College Sophomore,5,"The course was very challenging because I didn't know anything about what was taught but I pulled through thanks to the students and the professors there walking me through it every step of the way. The class style was very different than anything I ever seen. We just jumped right into the notes and started answering questions, I would take so much notes it would be like 4 pages of it. The class size was very big that most of the room would be filled up but as the Quarter passed it got smaller and people could move around more than usual."
College Sophomore,5,I haven't been in for health and and safety things but I know they are good.
College Sophomore,5,"I like the housing campus,it's not too loud it's not too quiet. The dorms are very nice and it's a lot of fun meeting the people around them. The cost are very high but affordable, you'll have to get a job on campus or off campus to pay it off if you want to live there or  get financial aid. everyone is very social to eachother it brings life into the dorms and the campus."
College Student,5,The diversity is wonderful - I read the academic catalogs religiously. I am always excited about future classes.
College Student,5,"Definitely the best, it doesn't exist! I am not a fan."
College Freshman,5,People are really free to express themselves on campus. This leads to some really awesome and genuine connections.
College Sophomore,5,"Being a transfer, the process was quick and painless. I really was pleasantly suprised with evergreens admissions."
College Sophomore,5,Academics at evergreen are great.
College Sophomore,5,Evergreen can be very lenient when t comes to students taking a stand on subjects they believe in.
College Student,5,Love getting to know people
College Freshman,5,There are so many places to eat off campus...pretty much everything you could want!
College Freshman,5,The facilities are great--I have everything I need here from the gym (I love going to the sauna!) to the expansive woods where you can just explore.
College Freshman,5,I LOVE Olympia!! The atmosphere is great and everyone is friendly. There are so many things to to outdoors in Olympia and in the National Parks surrounding the area. Downtown is fantastic with lots of dining and shopping options (lots of thrift stores and coffee shops).
College Freshman,5,No Greek life! We love it!!!!!!
College Freshman,5,"The school does not have intercollegiate sports The founders of the school believed that the school should be without the corrupting influence of FOOTBALL, and all the ethics woes that come with it. We have intramural sports, instead, and it is wonderful."
College Junior,5,Evergreen program are interdisciplinary and I love the way learning about the same concepts from different angles helps me integrate the knowledge more fully. I chose Evergreen because of the interdisciplinary programing.
Recent Alumnus,5,Evergreen prides itself on being LGBT friendly and encourages people of all ethnicities to attend.
Recent Alumnus,5,Olympia is right on the sound. Its gorgeous. You can see the Olympics across the sound on a good day. They are only a short drive away. The scenery around Evergreen is beautiful its right in the middle of a forest. If you like the outdoors its a great place. There isn't a whole lot to do in Olympia itself. Don't expect much of a nightlife beyond the handful of bars in the downtown area.
College Junior,5,"There are so many things to do here at Evergreen. We are in the middle of everything we are in between Seattle and Portland. The possibilities become endless because there are so many things to do, but if you want to stay in town their are plenty of things that will keep you busy. We are close to the mall only a short bus ride away. We are also very close to downtown with a plethora or shops to intrigue you. Olympia is sort of a college town and most of the coffee shops and restaurants close later in the evening so you can be out late studying or hanging out with friends."
College Freshman,5,"I wouldn't trade interdisciplinary education for anything, it's seriously the most interesting and fulfilling way to learn. One of my friends that went to a state school complained to me that it felt ""just like high school"" academically. I don't feel that way here at all. Real learning is taking place. It's pretty easy to register for classes and you'll likely get the program you want as long as you sign up right when it opens. The workload for my program is pretty moderate, it can get to be a lot, but it's not overwhelming."
College Senior,5,I am not aware of fraternities and sororities on the Evergreen campus actually. As far as Greek and non-Greek that type of thing isn't an issue here.
College Senior,5,I was helped by the folks in financial aid whenever I asked. They were awesome
College Junior,5,"I attend the Tacoma Campus and its very diverse....which is one reason I love it so much. Black, White, Asian, Islander, Hispanic, Old, Young.....none of this matters. We are all students who have come to learn. Everyone is treated equal there is no ""better than"" at this campus."
College Sophomore,5,The faculty are amazing and I have been very satisfied with my program choice.
College Sophomore,5,The interdisciplinary approach and context for learning practical and conceptual concepts is superb.
Recent Alumnus,5,Having a car meanings I can go anywhere without I want. I don't have to worry about transportation
College Senior,5,Programs don't have an application process but there might be some prerequisites.
College Junior,5,"There is an essential tradeoff at Evergreen: quality for consistency. Professors are not bond by academic departments and are encouraged to create multidisciplinary programs which foster rigorous and memorable academic experiences cultivate creative and critical thinking in students. Students are also given a huge amount of freedom to shape their academic path including setting up long periods of independent study and some have even designed and taught full accredited programs themselves. The way it works is this: if you have passion, curiosity, and some grit, you can excel at Evergreen in ways you simply cannot do at other schools."
College Freshman,5,"Everything about Evergreen is unique to Evergreen, except that it is an institution just like all other institutions. "
College Freshman,5,"Fantastic program, gender and race issues broken down and the complexities examined. Learning about how systematic oppression is still a foundation of our society. "
College Senior,5,"Public transportation is free as long as you're attending a class, and you can get to just about anywhere in town "
Senior,4,"Evergreen is an amazing school for the natural sciences, but don't expect to get much real experience out of the the humanities side.  I started as a humanities/writing student and switched to the natural sciences after so many disappointing classes and underwhelming professors.

Arts/philosophy/psychology/humanities studies are loosely structured and fluffy, and sometimes a quarter is literally just going on a road trip. The sciences are amazing though, and Evergreen has so many incredible resources like labs and a huge forest living laboratory. The science professors engage students and keep things grounded in reality, and always try to engage students in undergraduate research and planning for their career after evergreen. 5/5 in this field, don't underestimate the sciences here!"
Freshman,4,"The community at Evergreen is wonderful! I've found it’s an amazing environment for LGBTQ+ folks, and have never felt more comfortable being 100% out and proud.

I tend to disagree with the way that Administration does certain things, especially advertising. Evergreen has a unique way of doing things that's not for everyone. When it works for you it REALLY works. Evergreen’s very student-driven. The flexibility means that for self directed/driven folks it can be VERY enjoyable and personally fulfilling! 

Academically speaking, other than the larger 16 credit interdisciplinary programs there are a lot of unique options! These include Evening and Weekend classes, Independent Learning Contracts, Student Originated Studies, Study Abroad programs, and earning credits for Internships! Evergreen is a medley of options and opportunities, and while it can come across as chaotic and a bit confusing, once you get into the groove of it you can really, REALLY go places."
Junior,4,"The Evergreen State College has been a phenomenal place to learn at; from the people you meet to the structure of the classes this college is focused on educating you in a manner that reflects life. Both faculty and students are constantly learning and a group of people who can help you with your classwork are constantly just a stones throw away. Students are encouraged to work with each other outside of the classroom to deepen their understanding of their subjects of study and there is a strong writing resource center to help students with putting their thoughts on paper. The most beneficial part of this college is the seminar class format, at Evergreen seminars aren't just for graduate programs, students are taught to use this format to develop their ideas and learn how to constructively discuss texts and other subjects to deepen both their and others' understanding of a topic."
Junior,4,There’s always open communication between students and everyone has been extremely friendly. The classes actually help you to critically think and the hands on aspect of classes help you better retain the information so you feel better prepared for a real life career.
Graduate Student,4,The Evergreen State College is an incredibly unique learning environment that combines a diverse array of backgrounds and views with interdisciplinary instruction and real world applications.
Senior,4,"I love this school and the professors I've worked with. Evergreen is an interdisciplinary school that prepares you for a more real-world experience: you don't do philosphy for an hour then go to a psychology class, you do it altogether and really grasp why these subjexts intermingle. The campus is beautiful and there are many friendly students to talk to. If the cafeteria were better and housing a bit more affordable, it'd have been an EASY 5 stars!"
Sophomore,4,My favorate part of Evergreen is the diversity that the campus holds. The majority of the student body is on the LGBTQ+ spectrum and every day you can learn something new about a culture and have your viewes shapped by the diverse atmosphere. It is a very good place to go if you are trying to better understand other cultures and challenge yourself.
Junior,4,"The Evergreen State College is a controversial institution in the state of Washington. Its past is stained by social calamity. This college offers more opportunity than I ever thought a college could. You build your own curriculum & study what you want to. There are no grades which is realistic to the professional workforce. There are teacher-student evaluation meetings at the end of each quarter where it’s discussed whether or not full course credit was earned and why. These provide more insight into the quality of your work than grades do. Collaboration and critical thinking is a big part of every class offered. This prepares students for succeeding at the work they do post-graduation. The school has a variety of unique studies. However, enrollment is down resulting in budget cuts causing less teachers & less extra curricular opportunities. You shouldn't listen to the bad things said about it.  You should check it out for yourself in person. You'll see it's a great place."
Alum,4,"My overall experience with The Evergreen State College is positive, mostly as a result of meeting my significant other of 9 years. I transferred to Evergreen in 2009 after attending community college for 2 years. I entered Evergreen undecided on which area of focus I wanted to pursue, and I concluded my undergraduate degree this way too. What I learned from my undergrad years is that what you get out of going to school has much more to do with you than it does with school. I entered Evergreen with a great deal of expectation surrounding what college was supposed to do for me. After spending 2 years of my life among Evergreeners, and all the connotations that come with that, I realized that it's me who's got to have my back and make something of my investment of time. Drink the kombucha, dance to the beat of your own drum, your choices are yours to live with. It is my sincere hope that the events surrounding Evergreen's 2017 day of absence will be a teachable moment for us all."
Alum,4,"Evergreen is also a school with more ambition than it can afford. While it welcomes intelligent and radical-minded students, provides space for progressive discussion and growth, and preaches a collaborative learning environment, the institution is fundamentally still a state school. It simply cannot whole-heartedly practice what it preaches. Evergreen is also NOT the university for students still in the process of ""trying out"" college. The buy-in for the school's academics is high: students do not have to fight to maintain a high GPA because they are not graded.Students that need consistent structure and thrive on accountability through grades will fall apart at Evergreen. It is NOT the school for students accustomed to traditional academic structure. If you can fight through the new environment and new structure, manage your expectations for radicalism, and commit to be accountable for your own academic performance and pathway, then you will love Evergreen."
Senior,4,"The Evergreen State College is a different kind of academic setting that, for those who apply themselves, allows for broader learning opportunities then most formal colleges. Evergreens programs are usually interdisciplinary meaning you would learn, and be accredited for, a few subjects in one course or program. This creates well rounded graduates who succeed in post graduate schools and in the workforce."
Sophomore,4,The Evergreen State College is a college with a beautiful campus and kind-hearted people who are always willing to help.
Junior,4,"I'very onlyou just started a few weeks ago, but it's a good school. Everyone is friendly and try to be as helpful as they can, and there are a ton of way's you can get help if you need it. We also have a ton of scheduledays event's that are free for students that sound fun."
Alum,4,"Amazing experience, received many tools for my future here.  Professors, however, can sometimes be hit or miss -do your research before picking a program."
Senior,4,"The one reason why I gave Evergreen State College a four star is because of the independence to design my major. I get to craft my own curriculum while exploring myself and with others. However, if you read through other parts of the review, I note there are a ton of students that are snobby, entitled, and lacks social skills, or somewhat came from the hippies or postmodernist background. it is because of these reasons that the school has started to went downhill ever since the protest from last year, with the administration's people-pleasing attitudes. They started to fund the diversity and inclusion department when such money should go to study abroad, STEM, and the humanities. When it comes to the professors and students, I found there are two divided camps: the first ones are the serious minded who sets high expectations and give. The other camp is the social justice warrior with lousy identity politics with no common sense and show signs of mental disorders."
Freshman,4,"A lot of the stuff that goes on in the college is blown out of proportion because it is a tight knit comunity where everyone knows everyone.
The campus police is the largest problem. It lacks adiquat training and is extremely over funded which gives them a god complex."
Sophomore,4,"So far Evergreen State College has been pretty good to me. At first I had to adjust to the people there due to the fact that they were ""different"". 
I respect the fact that Evergreen accepts people for who they really are and for the most part the accept movements to for example the ""Black lives matters"" banners that are shown around campus."
Freshman,4,"Incredible amount of opportunities for students to explore interests inside and out of the classroom and community. Beware those who are not self driven, because so much independence is expected of students."
Freshman,4,"I have enjoyed the atmosphere and students in general. Some of my professors have being amazing and some have been just okay, but I feel the focus is mostly on the love of learning, and the small class size is an added bonus."
Alum,4,"At The Evergreen State College I experienced both challenging and inspiring professors in the department of health sciences. My schedules often involved both lecture and labs, with hours available for group collaboration and research. Classes were well-rounded in theme and introduced clever integration between other departments. While obtaining my degree, Evergreen allowed me to explore other interests, while relating it to my field of study."
Freshman,4,"The Evergreen State College boasts an all-inclusive environment, difference in academics, and a community-based way of learning. As a trans, disabled, queer socialist student, I can assuredly say that this school is hypocritical in this arena. It's difficult to be anything other than a cisgender, hetersexual, white, liberal at this college. While there is a notable difference in academics, it's not exactly notably good or bad. Since you take one course (usually) per quarter, they expect your life to revolve around academics. Professors here are not as understanding as you'd like them to be. This all being said, it is (unfortunately) the most understanding and progressive 4-year in the Pacific Northwest. I am enjoying my time aside from the obvious blunders I've outlined here. And, of course, I have white privilege and cannot speak on the non-white experience at Evergreen."
Freshman,4,"I love it here, all students and faculty are kind, understanding, and reasonable. Everyone really wants to get along."
Senior,4,"The best thing about Evergreen State College is the fact that whatever you want to learn there is room to learn it. I love their teaching methods, and their different subjects that challenges us to critically analyze the world that we live in a well as learn how to civilly engage in our communities and environment. I especially love my Native Indigenous studies which is captivating and alluring to us being human and what it means to be human. We also engage in a lot of subjects that looks at the balance or lack their of when pertaining to societies discourses. The crafts and tools that we learn is incomparable in contrast to regular ""banking system"" colleges as well as the public school teaching methods. I love the woods and I love the fact that I can commune with nature and man in a wide setting."
College Sophomore,4,There is a lot of strong awareness about sexual assault
College Sophomore,4,I love the diversity of the classes offered and how friendly it is to all abilities and body styles.
College Junior,4,"While it is legal in Washington State to smoke weed, it is still illegal to smoke on Campus. The school is very serious about that. If the law catches you, well then you just got caught. I don't see why some people can't wait till they get home to do these activities."
College Junior,4,"Whatever course you choose just know that you will deal with social justice, discrimination, feminism, education, as well as other fun topics like Drawing, science, history, pottery etc. You really have the power to choose your class so long as you choose it on time. the professors are no nonsense, but they are a lot of fun too if you put aside your judgement. Also professors want to make sure that you do your best so they will always have a critique for you to improve. Don't be scared of the process."
College Junior,4,"I am not a sports fan, but I have seen a couple of games. They are very passionate about soccer. They have basketball, but I don't know the teams playing. the school spirit is high... I hear them all the time in the afternoons when they do have a game season, or other schools attend. The facility itself is awesome. Probably not like Harvard or Stanford or any of the well to do colleges, but it's the best I have seen. All equipment are in working order, swimming pool, Sauna, showers, locker rooms, and individual dressing room for privacy. Other features include Rock climbing, fencing classes, dance classes, Aerobic classes, track and field, weight room, tennis outside and indoor just to name a few. I am still exploring, there is always something surprising to see."
College Junior,4,"From my time being a student at the Evergreen State College, I have had the privilege to get to know each faculty. They are very passionate, and  humble about their teaching methods. Each student is taught at an individual level so that it will not be awkward if a student feels left behind. They are patient, and address each student's needs after class is over, which makes learning even more enjoyable. I enjoy coming to class all the time, taking in each new discovery as a sponge takes in water. Yes there are times that subjects that are still hard to address in our society at large can get under students skins, but in our school that talks constantly about social justice, they make sure we as students are safe to express our thoughts, but also make sure that we respect the opinion of others who think differently than we  do. I appreciate that. I was told this school was just for hippies and weed heads, but that is not true. People of all diversity and religion attend here, and I know for a fact I don't think I would venture to another college after this. I am thoroughly pleased with the efforts of all faculty to educate us on social justice. If we want to fight for change, it is best to start in a classroom."
College Senior,4,I really like Evergreen! Happy with my unique undergrad experience!
College Senior,4,"If you are trying to get a job in the PNW, people know about Evergreen and getting a job with the degree isn't difficult."
College Senior,4,Pretty spacious. Better if you have roommates that don't smell like hippy- be cautious about that.
College Senior,4,"I love Evergreen for the most part. My learning is engaging and I feel like I have far more control over my education in comparison to my friends at other schools. Our student body feels very strongly about social issues, which is important to me. I could definitely do without the borderline cultiness of some of the hippies I've encountered. ""You are a spec of dust in the Universe."" ""I'm so thankful for the sun rising and shining on me each day."" I'm not kidding. Actual quotes. Be prepared for that."
College Sophomore,4,I've grown a lot as an academic student and as a person going to Evergreen. It has helped me find my passion.
College Junior,4,"Evergreen is a great place to earn an education. It is easier than most places here to realize that you get out of the experience what you put in. If you are willing to push yourself and really invest yourself, you get a lot out of it. The interdisciplinary nature of the classes make each experience well rounded and deep."
College Sophomore,4,"At Evergrewn, you definitely learn skills to articulate your abilities and passion much more clearly than you would with a grade-based education. Your personal participation, engagement, and the content of your learning shape your individual evaluation, which gives you a framework with which to begin a dialogue with prospective employers. You are invited to prove yourself through your actions, rather than a piece of paper, which is truly the beauty of a nontraditional education."
College Freshman,4,"There are always hiring for RAD services, as well in the restaurants on campus. Evergreen is known for having a high percentage of it's students getting into their fields right out of college."
College Junior,4,"I rarely worry for my safety on campus, but every once in a while we get those emails from the school detailing attempted sexual assaults that happened, so it's always in the back of my mind."
College Junior,4,"Most of my professors have been great, though there are two who I feel weren't particularly accommodating or understanding of their students."
College Student,4,"I've been to a few parties. The word that comes to mind is responsibility. People clean up after themselves, have designated drivers or places to sleep, etc. No one destroys property, shouts profanity, disturbs the neighbors intentionally, etc."
College Student,4,"There are many jobs available on campus. However, the diversity in job opportunity is bland and off putting."
College Student,4,"I'm only a Freshman and taken two classes. But the teachers I've met were wonderful, reasonably accommodating, and taught their material with a passion that really encouraged a thriving learning environment not just within myself but others. However, I've met many teachers who also seem they're not especially enthusiastic about being at Evergreen."
College Student,4,The Evergreen State College is a public university that does not function like a traditional university. This difference in teaching method helps brilliant students who don't fit well into mainstream society's standardized testing get the education they need the way they can understand it. The college also offers many opportunities for students to explore their passions and pursuits.
College Junior,4,The range of options for programs in different areas of study are fairly diverse.  Registration is fairly stressful and not unlike trying to get concert tickets first.  The workload is pretty intense but if you keep up on it its manageable.
College Junior,4,"Evergreen is an accepting environment for all diversity of religion, sexual orientation or ethnicity and race."
College Junior,4,Drugs aren't really available or an issue.
College Sophomore,4,Multiple internships and work study opportunities exist to support students in following their passions.
College Sophomore,4,Truly an interesting and absorbing school. You get to experience collaborative learning and such  a manner that ties multiple subjects together in an objective and truly interesting way to understand the complex issues affecting the world today.
College Sophomore,4,Great place to choose what you want to learn.
College Freshman,4,"I can only speak to living in the dorms. The only large complaint I have is there is only one kitchen to share between four dorm buildings, which makes it busy at times. The dorms offer sufficient space and clean bathrooms and living areas. I have never felt unsafe living in the dorms and the majority of the RA's are kind and helpful. There was a problem with flooding in A building but nothing life threatening. Overall the dorms provide a good environment but not somewhere I will live in the future."
College Junior,4,I feel that I have learned a lot in my time at evergreen. Sometimes it is difficult to get classes you want but you always learn a lot.
College Sophomore,4,the gym needs a renovation but its open to all students and there is a pool.
College Sophomore,4,"Evergreen is a great place if you take advantage of academic advising and career development to help you navigate a path that will end with you having what it takes to succeed in your desired field, or else you can get through, earning lots of credit without really having all it takes. The self written academic statements (required) are a great tool as well."
College Student,4,"It looks great to me, from an outside perspective! I have never lived on campus."
College Junior,4,My first professor was awesome. He loves his field and his class.  My second professor is a bit scatter brained but seems to genuinely care.
College Junior,4,We have a huge variety of internships and networking opportunities. Come hit up career advising!
College Junior,4,Campus housing is adequate and clean. Rules are enforced.
College Junior,4,School spirit runs high and loud here. Sports are valued.
College Junior,4,"I love my college's open and welcoming environment, beautiful campus and intriguing classes."
College Junior,4,"You have to be extremely self- motivated to succeed at Evergreen. The faculty are great and really put time into designing programs and expect students to have the same passion as they do. If you plan on skipping class and zoning out in lectures, this is not the school for you. If you can handle independence and are honest with your abilities then this is a good fit."
Graduate Student,2,"Generally friendly students and faculty, with learning tools and exploring new interests and skills being easy access and highly encouraged. Class set up as 16 credit programs where you can study 4 subjects brought together with an over arching theme, combined with the fact you're with the same group of 40-50 students create a interesting and personable experience with learning. However, classes are not set up to help students build advance skills nor prepare them for real world careers, politically ideologies lean center left to extreme left, which makes it troublesome when having in class debates, and the administration and staff don't exactly seem to care for the success of the students."
College Freshman,2,I've heard of police racially profiling people in Olympia and around evergreen to several of my friends.
College Student,2,"As a minority, it's always a red flag when a school presents itself as liberal because that attracts two kinds of people - die hard liberals and ""kill all liberals"" kind of people. What ends up happening is all these white people fight about racial issues and never let minorities speak. All these straight and cis people are fighting about gender and sexuality while the minorities aren't given a turn to speak. Etc. etc."
College Student,2,"It's very easy to access drugs and alcohol here. However, I feel like the culture does not pressure you nor do they condone hard drugs. Still, many people here shouldn't be taking drugs due to medical and mental ailments."
College Junior,2,The party scene is pretty lame.  The campus puts on events around holidays but not much else.
College Freshman,2,"There are not many opportunities to take advantage of in the area of internships and jobs, especially in the discipline of social sciences (I can't talk to other disciplines). There are some, but they fill up quickly. Olympia is a smaller city without a large need for new workers or student help in the area of psychology and social science. I haven't searched too extensively, but that is my impression and what I have heard."
College Junior,2,Mostly hippies with poor social skills.
College Junior,2,"Housing for freshmen is so so, not that great. I would opt for living in the apartments where youll have more privacy and freedom."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no real fan support or pride for Evergreen sports. We rarely hear about the Sports teams here in Evergreen. The Athletic facility needs renovations in their sauna rooms, weight rooms, and cardio room."
College Sophomore,2,"Rules regarding drugs use are very lax and then rarely enforced. Drinking is allowed in some on campus housing, which makes it difficult to regulate who is drinking. Weed is very prolific. My RA seems very disinterested in us, even allowing students to babysit dogs in their rooms."
College Freshman,2,Almost no one goes to games...it's really like athletics hardly exist on campus.
College Freshman,2,It feels like Evergreen doesn't care about providing good food for students and many of their options are damaging to student health and not very well prepared. The greenery is the worst offender - some days having terrible service and a dirty environment that would warrant a health inspection.
College Freshman,2,"They keep a tight hold on the activities budget and student's are encouraged to ""make nice"" with the administration for better outcomes. 

The campus police do not build relationships with students and are very racist."
College Freshman,2,"Gross, dude! Mold, hippies, and no toilet paper. This is for children, not serious students."
College Freshman,2,We need more processes in place to protect students. We need to build trust with the administration so that people feel safe coming forward with allegations.
College Junior,2,I have celiac disease and finding safe gluten free foods in Olympia is very challenging.
College Sophomore,2,White is a common sight here. Diversity is low.
College Sophomore,2,Without prior housing living on campus is best.
Recent Alumnus,2,it great to a greek life on campus
Recent Alumnus,2,serving the same food every week
College Freshman,2,Its Evergreen what do you expect? LOTS of weed.
College Freshman,2,barely any good food at night time. 
College Freshman,2,There are barely any cute guys here. 
College Freshman,2,Not a lot of diversity. 
College Freshman,2,So quiet there is barely any activities. 
College Freshman,2,A lot of people on campus consume drugs. 
College Junior,2,"Driving at night in the rain and fog, as far as I have to go is really hard.
"
College Senior,2,"They have stuff for them, but only one teacher for animation, therefore only one course of animation a quarter. I learned a lot in my first set of classes, then I found out that they don't teach you more in later classes, just expect you to do better. And they don't offer any internships for this"
College Senior,2,"There's no program with this school, no pre reqs so you can jump right into a class that's geared towards your career. The school has a high acceptance rate but also a high drop out. Most important criteria for admission would probably make sure when you submit your letter, that it has been proof read."
College Sophomore,2,This isn't a small town in the midwest (the worst) but it IS a small city in the northwest. 
College Sophomore,2,"I'm 23k in debt my sophomore year, get it?"
College Freshman,2,Evergreen is known for its reputation in the amount of marijuana being used on and off campus. There is no pressure to do the drugs but it definitely evident that many students participate in the activities. Drinking is not as notoriously used but may be commonly seen on some weekends.
College Freshman,2,"During your Freshman year at Evergreen you are required to have a meal plan. There are several meal plan options that allow you to have one or more paid for meals a day(depending on the meal plan option you choose). The meal plan is used mainly in the Greenery (TESC's version of a cafeteria). Generally, the food is hit or miss. Some days the Greenery is bursting with options and choices; while on other days you can find yourself eating a $9 bowl of cereal because nothing else looks edible."
College Junior,2,"The professors are relatively top-notch for a state school, most are well-credentialed and a lot are decently published even if they're almost all EXTREMELY biased and aren't afraid to let their biases show through their lectures and course materials.  But the academic format at Evergreen, especially the fact that it's intensively seminar-based and less assignment-oriented, is absolutely horrendous."
College Freshman,2,"If you like to party this is not the school to go to. There are a few cool punk shows or local artist playing in Downtown, but no ragers here. The parties here at Evergreen are usually chill out with friends and listen to some tunes while getting intoxicated or high. Nothing too extreme though it's more chill than other universities."
College Senior,2,Coffee shops and food are usually very expensive; especially for students who are on a budget and do not have appropriate cooking facilities. Best  option is to save money by buying groceries out of campus.
College Sophomore,2,"Fin Aid Very Frustrating – I have had a large process trying to get my FAFSA adjsuted after some steep medical expenses have affected my EFC. School took the money that I made on scholarships out of my fin aid package, very frustrating."
College Junior,2,"Campus isn't a far walk.  Very dark at night, which is somewhat nice if you're into nature.  There's trails to go on and definitely drugs if that's you're thing.  Apartment style rooms are small, as expected.  Older ones that haven't been remodeled tend to smell musty at first.  Lots of burnholes in furniture/rugs.  Dents/miscoloration in walls.  Beds are pretty standard.  There's definitely people partying out every night, usually hanging in smoking areas.  People are usually friendly."
College Sophomore,2,"Expect Rain and Clouds – Anyone who knows anything about Olympia, and Washington in general, will probably mention rain in the first sentence about it. However, as long as you're expecting it, it's pretty easy to get used to. There are many cozy indoor spots to take refuge in, and the busses run like clockwork, so you don't usually wind up waiting in the rain."
College Sophomore,2,"There are a few great thrift shops to find interesting items, there are a few shopping plazas and a mall with Wet Seal, Best Buy, Target, Borders, and other stores. Places outside of the 41 and 48 bus lines can be difficult to get to without a car.
Downtown id full of interesting little stores, cafes and restaurants with excellent food.
A lot of Evergreen grads live in Olympia or they have friends that attend there, but some residents do not like Evergreen students for various reasons. In general, everyone is friendly but can be weird if you are a person of color."
Alum,1,My experience at this college was not what I was expecting. The leadership is non existent and I felt that the hypocrisy was overwhelming at times.
Graduate Student,1,Go here only if you’re prepared to be with a bunch of hypocrites who want to appear open-minded in the way they talk but are in actuality the smallest/narrow minded people you’ll ever meet.  Once you go in to the working world you’ll realize what a joke these people are!!!
Junior,1,"This school operates like a cult. Sexuality, race and political ideologies manifest in a strange negative light at this school. For an undergraduate program that boasts graduate level seminars, this institution hosted a lot of drama. Classes often felt like therapy sessions and faculty were unsupported by college trustees and the administration. Evergreen says it is a left wing school but it operates as if you live in a right wing dictatorship. It is not a same campus or climate for open-minded people who are empathetic. Campus is a very insular place and the college administration have a long history of corruption and lies. The school is increasingly under funded and after public scandals has been de-funded even more. The college has a rampant issue with sexual assault and allowing reported predators onto campus. This is also not a safe campus/community for people of color or anyone who is Jewish."
Sophomore,1,I wouldn’t waste your time here. I am a military spouse; was promised I’d have a easy time transferring. They lied. Not one other college will take any of the science classes I took here. Over a year wasted for my degree.
Senior,1,"A complete joke of a school. I started attending in fall of 2016, and since them have had to deal with extreme amounts of harassment, vandalism to personal property (my car), being wrongfully fired from an on-campus job because of rumors spread by colleagues and staff. Have been treated incredibly unfairly, and I hope nobody else ever has to deal with being a student at this school. Not a safe place to be any size shape or color. This school is extremely racist to everyone. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND. Save yourself some time, go to a real school."
Freshman,1,"I came to Evergreen to visit a beautiful part of the country. The area is incredible. There is so much to do outdoors from hiking to rock climbing. I use public transportation to go to Seattle and Portland on the weekends easily. Owning a car is unnecessary in Olympia. However, my experience with the school is terrible. The faculty and admissions never seem organized and the the quality of education is clearly not a priority at Evergreen. Other than get a masters in teaching, I'm not sure what one does with a degree from Evergreen. The students themselves fulfill a certain stereotype of stoner hippies that rarely go to class and couldn't care less about their academic success which is probably to be expected from a school that doesn't award grades."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Should be shut down and have its endowment transferred to a real state school (UW,WSU,CWU,WWU,EWU)"
College Junior,1,I do not like this school and I wish that I would have taken the time to put more effort in finding another school to go to.
College Junior,1,We do not have a Athletics at the Tacoma campus.
College Student,1,Our Greek life is terrible because it doesn't exist.
College Junior,1,The worst teachers I've ever had.
College Junior,1,We dont have a greek system. It would be a good idea to make one that way there are more activities for students. Personally I find frats and sororities convenient because they provide relationship with other students and alumns.
College Junior,1,Plenty of alcohol and not enough weed smoking.
College Junior,1,No parties that I know of.
College Junior,1,There arent any parties at evergreen. I still cant believe there wasnt a halloween party I feel like a year of my life was lost to nothingness. Theres never anything going on that I know of.
College Junior,1,The gym stinks and the rock climbing wall is meh.
College Junior,1,I myself vomited in the cafeteria after trying to eat brown rice and lasagna. I tried unsuccessfully to get a meal plan exemption. Ever since I have never considered going near the greenery.
College Junior,1,They are poor. I myself am a transfer student and can tell the programs at Evergreen arent well designed. To be honest I feel like registering at evergreen is the worst mistake because undergraduates wont pick up the skills they need. Teachers hand out a syllabus but never make corrections to better their students. The hardest thing here will be sitting in a classroom for three hours and listening to a teacher say things that dont even make sense. My former college payed more attention to students progress and Ill be transfering out of my first quarter at evergreen.
College Junior,1,Generally the services offered to students at this school are fake or dont work.
College Junior,1,I didnt like my classes or my teachers. Professors only care about themselves at this school. Id have to give Evergreen a a bad rating.
College Junior,1,"Evergreen is terrible. Courses are very limited and classes are very bad. 40% of freshmen leave college before their first quarter. A class lasts 3 hours but is uninformative, professors are bad lecturers. The cafeteria is the flimsiest Ive seen but serves food 100% inedible. Students dont have the accomodations to cook and most Start Looking anorexic. Student facilities are old and dont offer much. Weight room is tiny and breaking down, pool is full of old people and kids. Campus is boring, there is nothing to do but people smoke outside the apartments. However there is a significant transgender population. Olympia is pleasant but Evergreen is not worth it. Young people that have stayed here look ruined. It is saddening Maybe they could salvage themseles had they left early when they discovered what Evergreen is."
College Junior,1,"It is difficult to encapsulate why I hate evergreen. Maybe it is because of the hypocrisy--the trendy, liberal school who does nothing for their students. Teachers are often apathetic or view their class as their therapy, opening up about their entire life stories. With the no grading system it is incredibly difficult to receive an objective evaluation. In the end one of my professors told me that they just did not like me as a person. There are very few accommodations to make life bearable for dorm students. Vital facilities, like a bathroom fan/vent, were left broken for an entire quarter. One time my heat broke in the middle of a cold snap and was not fixed for three days. I did not realize that the issue was the heat and thought I was dying."
College Sophomore,1,"I rarely eat on campus, as there is so little vegetarian food and it is extremely expensive."
College Freshman,1,Evergreen does not care about athletics. The gyms are terrible and the only sports they play are soccer and basketball and only every now and then. There is no school spirit.
College Freshman,1,Party scene is not great unless you either want to get high or do hard drugs with people you know nothing about.
College Sophomore,1,Seeing as there is no Greek life here I can't really rate it. What I can say is that this school is even better because it doesn't have a stupid green system.
College Student,1,There is no greek life
College Junior,1,"Campus food is, largely, no better quality than you'd find at a McDonalds. I know because I've worked behind the scenes and read ingredient labels.

Additionally, for students with severe medical needs such as celiac disease, there are NO safe meals to purchase because campus dining will not prepare allergen safe foods in a separate areas."
College Junior,1,Its only the worst because it doesn't exist. That's the only thing missing. I wish there was a Greek life so I could have that experience
College Sophomore,1,They mean nothing to my school
Recent Alumnus,1,Summer and fall are wonderful. Once the winter comes there is never sunlight and it rains all the time. It is extremely depressing.
Recent Alumnus,1,Evergreen is good for students who are very motivated and know exactly what they want to study. Others will just get lost and will graduate without learning a thing. 
College Senior,1,"If you're white, straight, male and or do not have a kid, you will have the most difficult time finding a financial aid you can apply for"
College Senior,1,Most people go to this school just to do drugs an be in the drug culture. I'm not familiar with the culture so i'm not sure about peer pressure
College Senior,1,"They don't have many, if any at all. They have local job postings but typically none in my career focus. With external internships, you still have to pay the full tuition price, including any fees that goes to paying for a new building or activities, even though you yourself are not going to be on campus to utilize them. The process for setting up the forms to get credits from an internship is a long and painful process and almost not worth doing at all"
College Senior,1,"This is a non traditional school. Classes are set up to combine topics into one course. So in a 16 credit course, the class would cover 4 credits in science, 4 credits in art, 4 in writing and 4 in some other. The course would have an overall theme or theory that you'll study and work around. And instead of have 4 classes and 4 different teachers, you now have 1 class and 2-3 teachers for the whole week. Nice set up, however, each course is unique and only happens once. So for me who wants to study animation and sees only one class offering this study, it'll be hard to get into because everyone else wants it as well. And when the class is full before my registration date, I'm SOL. I can't afford to take other courses that don't even come close to my career goals and this one course I want will not show up again ever. There is no prioritizing classes for those of that chosen career studies. On top of all that, the staff is partly the student body, who are mostly lazy pot smokers and seem to push responsibility to the side. The other staff are no better, website is confusing to the point they made their own blog just to help navigate it. In the class room, you have to be careful with what you say, if you say you disagree with someone, it could turn into a hate crime. The students may claim Coexistence, but if you have religion, especially if you're Christian or Jewish, then they automatically hate you. One Jewish student left the school because she was discriminated against, and another student was verbally accused of raping a girl (no police chargers were ever filed against this guy) and a group of students nearly lynched the guy for it. It's like going to school with a bunch spoiled 5 year olds who don't bathe"
College Senior,1,"If you're vegan or vegetarian, there are lots of options for you. If you love meat or need that protein in your diet (like me), you have little choices. That being said, all the food they serve is poor in taste and are overpriced. The meal plans are bad as well. As a freshman, you are required to get one, they give you a certain amount of meals to use for the quarter. The amount they give is horrible, if you were to have two meals a day on this plan, you'll run out before the end of the quarter. Not very good if you don't have a job or parents backing you up."
College Sophomore,1,No one knows the teams exist
College Freshman,1,"The drug scene at TESC is huge. There is a plethora of students who use drugs and can get almost any kind of drug that you want. However, peer pressure isn't very high. A majority of students who use drugs will offer them to you as a gesture of friendship, but will not pressure you into taking drugs if you do not want them. Drugs on TESC are not allowed, but it's not one of the rules that are strongly enforced. Most of the time students who are caught will end up with a warning and nothing more."
College Junior,1,"the Greenery is the only food outlet that isn't ludicrously crowded to the point of being unusable nearly all the time, but it's RIDICULOUSLY expensive.  the burrito place is good if a little overpriced, but it's basically impossible to ever go there without waiting in line for an eon.  The Flaming Eggplant is delicious but vastly overpriced."

Senior,5,"I am a senior and Ilisagvik College has been such an amazing experience for me. I had a hard time choosing schools but once I decided to attend here my life really changed for the better. Graduating soon, I will use my learned skillset as an electrician and my tribal connections have never been stronger. Highly recommend for all tribal members as it is a great education and I could not imagine going anywhere else. Go Vikings!"
Freshman,5,Ilisagvik Tribal College is a really amazing college. It a places to learn new things and the people are very welcoming.
Sophomore,5,The staff and board of trustees instill much cultural and western knowledge that interject the diverse atmosphere the community holds which is all beneficial to the openness towards a diverse group of people.
Freshman,5,"I have been taking online courses with Ilisagvik college for two years now. I do have to say that it has been a very enjoyable experience. Every time I have questions, the faculty is quick to respond. The professors are fantastic. Distant learning is a challenge with any college or University, the help I have received from this college is inmeasurable compared to the other school I tried online with. I have been talking to our high school seniors here where I live about looking at Ilisagvik College. I would advise all new students to look into Ilisagvik College. It's small and it's an adventure."
Freshman,5,"The people here are so kind, patient, and helpful. I've had staff email me just to ask if I need help with classes. I get reminders of scholarship deadlines and of new scholarships. If I were asked what college someone should go o or check it, it would definitely be Ilisagvik."
Niche User,5,"Illisagvik college has been a wonderful place to get an education through. They take pride in their students and want to help their students succeed. 
I attend a program through Illisagvik, not on campus, and they have made an effort in getting to know our class and helping us in everyway possible. The staff has traveled to visit us, we have Skype, and have communicated through teleconference.
Illisagvik college is a smaller school but because it is, we have created a friendship with the staff. They work side by side with us on any challenges we have. They really take their time so we understand and achieve excellence. 
Without Illisagvik college I wouldn't be where I am today. 
The stars that are rated a 1, do not apply to me because I do not live in Barrow, Ak.
Thank you Illisagvik!"
College Junior,4,"most teachers understand if a student is a little late to class because of the van runs, but if a student cant physically come to class the school has set up teleconferences for all classes or live video feeds for students to participate in classes."
College Junior,4,it is nice that the college has a van/shuttle for the dorm students to be able to get to class and to town when need be. i like that our college tries to incorporate the Inupiaq culture in the school and the activities we do. the staff is friendly and warm and willing to work with a student or help them if need be
College Junior,2,"there are computers and printers to use when necessary, but the internet speed, wireless or hard wire both are terrible, it is partly because the campus is so far away from town, but it takes forever to load a page for online classes"

College Senior,5,"I have not heard of any crime, violent or otherwise, on our campus."
College Senior,5,"I am glad that I chose Athens State University. If I had it to do over again, I would still attend Athens State University"
College Sophomore,5,I have nothing but good experiences while at Athens State. The teacher have been totally understanding and ready to work with me when I needed assistance. This alone speaks volumes to me.
College Freshman,5,Accounting major is very detailed oriented and challenging. It is helpful for those pursing a career in the field and furthering their advancement in the field.
College Senior,5,I feel incredibly safe on campus. There is a security guard that regularly does rounds of the campus. Also the school is situated across the street from the city's police department. I have never seen or  heard of anyone being assaulted on campus. I have never seen or heard of anyone's property being stolen or tampered with.
Recent Alumnus,5,"ASU will not tolerate anything that is related to drugs and alcohol, which is wonderful.  There is a police station right beside the school, so that kind of behavior is very miniscule.  Other than that, there are no strict school policies that affect students' academic or social lives."
Recent Alumnus,5,Majoring in Computer Science has been great so far.  The faculty is very quick to help students with their needs.
Recent Alumnus,5,"Athens State offers a broad selection of majors, which is always a wonderful thing for students who are not quite sure what they want to pursue a career in."
College Junior,5,"I have not had an internship yet, but I heard it was the best."
College Junior,5,I love my program. I have been going to college on and off for a long time. I have never actually enjoyed what I was learning until now. With working a full time job and going to school full time it is a lot at times but as long as you stay on top of your assignments its not to bad. The teachers are by far the best I have ever had.
College Junior,5,I do not need or have not heard of the off-campus housing. I live in Huntsville.
College Senior,5,"The admissions process is great, and the school is wonderful."
College Senior,5,I was simply able to enter. : )
College Senior,5,Elementary Education and the Educational Technology minor are fantastic! Athens is the best education school in North Alabama in my opinion. The teachers vary and are wonderful instructors. The material is relevant and interesting. Field experience and internship processes are easy to understand and complete.
College Senior,5,You must live off campus at this University.
College Junior,5,Financial aid is readily available.
College Junior,5,"I love everything about my program of study. I have had extremely helpful teachers every semester, and I have not had any problems with anyone thus far. I do have concerns about graduating and being stuck without a job for awhile because education is a hard field to find a job in, and my planned graduation date is Fall of 2015. Finding a job in the middle of the school year is even harder. I pray that it will not be as difficult to find a job as I think."
College Junior,5,The College of Education is one of the best in the state!
College Junior,5,"Love my teachers, classmates, and classes!!"
Recent Alumnus,5,This is a 2 year finishing college and most of the students here are more mature and older. Drugs are not an issue at Athens State.
College Sophomore,5,"I am very excited about the program that I am in. I have always wanted to be a teacher. I have not changed my mind since day one. M career goals are first to become a teacher. I hope to start out in the Special Education program, then when the good Lord calls me away from that program I plan on teaching any grade in elementary. Whichever grade I am needed at.When it comes to finding a job in the field that I am going into I am not concerned at all. I feel that if God has called me into this field for a reason and that is to teach, I feel that He will provide me with a teaching job where He wants me to go I will go where He sends me!"
College Sophomore,5,The work is tuff but the teachers are great. They are the best at teaching
College Sophomore,5,I park at my house
Recent Alumnus,5,Athens State wants everyone to feel comfortable being who they are.
Recent Alumnus,5,I have never had an issue with Athens State University.  There are many computer labs that are open to all the students and faculty. 
Recent Alumnus,5,The education is great.  ASU is big on technology and making each students marketable as soon as they graduate. 
College Junior,5,"I love my major. I wouldn't change it for anything different. I want to make a difference in children's lives one day so its a rewarding thing for me, to be apart of it all. "
College Junior,5,I have had no trouble using the computers on campus
College Junior,5,I have had no experience as I am a distance learner
College Junior,5,I have had no experience with any of the above. 
College Junior,5,I have enjoyed every aspect of being a student here
College Junior,5,Best out of the 4 schools I have attended. 
College Senior,5,"There is no need for off campus parking, there are more than enough spots on campus, and all are close to where you need to be."
College Senior,5,"Weather hasn't affected my campus experience at all, I haven't missed school due to weather."
College Junior,5,The school is great about treating everyone equal!
College Junior,5,The academics are a wonderful start to what truly lies ahead.
College Senior,5,I have never seen or been offered drugs or alcohol at my school.
Recent Alumnus,5,There is security on campus. There are open labs for students in every other building which comes with both pros and cons. As the person in the lab might not be the student on campus. But not heard of crimes on campus.
Recent Alumnus,5,"All the faculty members, staffs, professors and the scholarship department are very helpful and guide you to achievement."
College Sophomore,5,"Behavioral Science is my major. I plan to find a job as a social worker, with the hopes that the pay scale is enough to cover my student loans and support my family."
Senior,4,"It was an overall good experience. It would be nice if the Student Success Coaches would tell you beforehand about possible prerequisite courses before changing majors. The online classes are good, the price is higher than the tuition on campus though."
Senior,4,The online courses are easily accessible. They use Honorlock to proctor the exams. There are some issues with that program like the inability to access the built-in camera in your laptop. The professors are quick to answer any questions that may arise during the term. The overall course layout is great for people who live far from the campus.
Sophomore,4,"Overall, not a bad school. I do mostly online, but I like the school when I visit. It's affordable as well, which is a plus. Other schools close to me with the same degree is twice the price."
Junior,4,"I love the fact that the instructors care about you as an individual.  I have only started this semester but am truly enjoying my classes and teachers.

I did have some issues with financial aid which caused some delays in my classes.  I was unable to receive my books for several weeks. This issue has been resolved and I am continuing on."
Senior,4,"Athens State University's English department fosters a safe learning environment while inspiring creativity and innovation in cultivating writing. The faculty and staff are extremely helpful in advising, financial aid opportunity, and career expectations. For the best education for the price, go to ASU."
Junior,4,"I really enjoy Athens State University. It is a beautiful, quite campus with excellent teachers. Most classes are taught online which is something I'm not entirely a huge fan of. I am an ""old school"" learner and enjoy sitting in a classroom. I will say, however, some classes are nice online. I am a transfer student from a larger school and I do like how small and personal Athens State is. Not to mention they have an EXCELLENT Human Resources Management program."
College Senior,4,"I have thoroughly enjoyed most of my classes taken. My professors often have had experience in their field of teaching and are typically quick to answer any questions I may have. My online classes have mostly been well organized, and they have not offered any surprises mid-semester."
College Senior,4,I would choose this school again because the online program gave me the flexibility I needed to begin my dream career at a yound age while finishing up a degree. I didn't have to put my dream on hold in order to finish school.
College Senior,4,"The teachers and faculty at Athens State University have been kind and helpful from the very start.  I have no doubt that their hard work, dedication, and commitment helped play a integral role in my success as a student at ASU."
College Senior,4,I am very fortunate and thankful for my Education at Athens State University. The professors take time to make sure each student is learning and understanding the material. On several occasions my professors have pulled me aside to ensure that I understood the material. The small class sizes and one on one learning provided by the professors has made Athens State the great school that it is.
College Sophomore,4,I have not been placed in any scary situations since I've been at Athens State University. I've felt very safe since being here.
College Sophomore,4,I had no trouble applying for Athens State. My tour guide even took the time to approve my admission when she found out I had all the requirements necessary to be a transfer student at Athens.
College Sophomore,4,The campus is small but has a plethora of history. The buildings are historic and comfy on the inside. Athens state also has one of the oldest trees in Alabama. The class sizes are small and the teachers are approachable. Everyone I've met so far has been friendly and helpful. I feel like I have a good amount of support to help me finish my Bachelor's degree.
College Junior,4,A great school with a great staff
College Junior,4,The school is small and everybody  there is welling to help one another when they can. The Professor are there for you when you needed that extra push to move forward in life. I have much respect for the this university. I would love to finish out my degree there at all means.
Recent Alumnus,4,Several organizations are available for social interactions
Recent Alumnus,4,There are several different selections for majors and minors.
College Freshman,4,I have not had to apply for financial aid. The process for reviewing and applying for scholarships has been great.
College Sophomore,4,I enjoy it so far. Not all of my professors are helpful.
College Senior,4,"There are many family owned restaurants that have been here for many years. One such place is Dub's burgers. If you want a large, greasy burger this is the place for you. There are also several famous BBQ places such as Lawlers, Southern Hickory, and 306 BBQ. Also if you are feeling in the fish mood, there is of course the Catfish Cabin."
College Senior,4,You are usually matched to an internship that closely follows your major. In the internship you are given a specific project to work on. I got paid quite well in mine for my level of experience. The time commitment was not bad. Continuously I was told that school came first and they would plan my work schedule around my class schedule. Athens has a career center on campus that is very good. They have a list of internships and co-ops that you can apply from that correlates with your major.
College Senior,4,"The process was fairly easy. When I transferred I told them what I wanted my major to be and they reviewed my transcripts and approved my major choice. I didn't have any problems getting in. The most unusual thing about Athens is that you have to be a transfer student, they are not a four year college. You have to have at least 64 credits to even be accepted."
College Senior,4,"Really good, homemade food. The only problem is it is very slow."
College Senior,4,The Fiddlers Convention is a spectacular event! Fiddlers from all over the state come out and showcase their talent. Great vendors and plenty of delicious food are also found at this event.
College Senior,4,The Off-Campus Dining consists of a wide variety of chain restaurants and fast food as well as local diners
College Senior,4,The Financial Aid department at Athens State is well organized and highly effective in assisting students. The main thing for students is to make sure you have all of your information to the financial aid office on time.
College Sophomore,4,"The campus is relatively small, so most of us feel comfortable and secure without added security but patrol cars and security procedures are very prevalent on campus, nonetheless. Campus crime is not an issue and if it were, we would be notified of any incidents immediately."
Recent Alumnus,4,"If you like small, country towns, then Athens State is a great college to go to.  If you live for the social scene, then Athens State is not for you.  There are hardly any shopping centers and absolutely no nightlife attractions.  However, Athens is a very safe city."
College Junior,4,"Athens is a small community. Cost of living is great and there is enough to do on the weekends if you like the outdoors. If you are more of a party animal, and like a big city, then Nashville is not to far away."
College Junior,4,Every Teacher I have had at Athens State University has been great. I have learned a lot from each one and I enjoy taking their classes.
College Junior,4,I saw that there are many organizations for jobs and internships which are all very exciting to a new student like myself.
College Junior,4,Overall very happy with my decision to chose Athens State University. I have been to another university that was not helpful and set me up for failure but her i feel important and feel like i have another cheerleader routing me on for success.
College Junior,4,Very happy with the atmosphere its very friendly and inviting.
College Junior,4,I can not say just how helpful and amazing the staff has been through my transfer process. I know that i will be able to succeed with this university because they are here to help.
College Senior,4,They are strict where they need to be and lenient enough where it doesn't negatively affect students.
College Senior,4,"I live in an apartment complex near campus, and it's wonderful. Close to campus, affordable, and great landlady."
College Senior,4,"Great atmosphere. College town, but great Southern charm."
College Senior,4,There definitely is a lot of diversity on campus.
College Senior,4,"I love my program. I love to learn, but if I had to do things over again, I'd try the business degrees as opposed to the religious degree. I've become very interested in learning to manage finances lately. I do have concerns finding a job in the religious field, since it seems to be mostly missionary work/traveling, and I am unable to travel."
College Senior,4,I feel like there's quite a bit of diversity on campus as far as religion/ethnicity/and socio-economic background is concerned.
College Senior,4,The distance learning is great. The workloads are reasonable. The professors are knowledgeable and friendly. The variations of degrees offered are exceptional.
College Senior,4,"Beautiful area, very welcoming people."
College Senior,4,"The staff in particular are very friendly. They are very helpful and polite with any problem I have, and genuinely want to resolve issues. They care about their students and it shows."
College Senior,4,It's close by to lots of attractions.
College Senior,4,Athens has plenty of labs and the library also has computers. The internet is relatively fast.
College Senior,4,"The school has a great honor policy. They strictly enforce it. Parking is also enforced, but warnings are given."
College Senior,4,"The parking spots are color coded. Parking decals cost $10, but you only have to receive one unless lost. Once you get on campus it is very easy just to walk around unless raining."
College Senior,4,"This small university actually offers a wide variety of majors. Admission is an easy process, and the advisers are top notch. The hardest thing about this university is that many classes are only offered certain semesters. This can put off graduation if a scheduling mistake is made."
College Senior,4,"Athens is a great area, but considered ""small town"". Not for everyone, but I love it."
College Junior,4,Not a party school and they keep it that way.
College Junior,4,"Typical Alabama weather.  Hot and humid, but beautiful."
College Junior,4,Plenty of local diners and Applebee's is just a short drive away.
College Sophomore,4,"Financial Aid went really well for me this year, all of the forms were taken care of promptly and I received my aid without any problems."
College Junior,4,I've seen no issues with drugs or alcohol on campus.
College Junior,4,The over computer availability is impressive at ASU.
College Junior,4,"There is a very diverse group of students, as well as teachers."
College Junior,4,"Best education program in the state, by far!"
College Junior,4,I have enjoyed attending Athens State very much!
Recent Alumnus,4,"Great small town atmosphere, but close to Huntsville with 3 malls to shop and great selection for dining."
Recent Alumnus,4,had a small issue with financial aid (one of my own making) but the financial aid office was great in helping me straightening it out.
College Senior,2,"There's only one ""cafeteria"" on campus and it is used by a local restaurant. The prices aren't great, and the menu isn't great."
College Junior,2,There's plenty of parking available.
College Junior,2,No Sunday alcohol sales and not a party school at all.
College Junior,2,"There is not much of a nightlife in Athens, AL."
Recent Alumnus,2,no Greek live on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is no real sports activities on campus. There is some intramural activities, mostly Frisbee golf."
College Junior,2,Athens is a small town
College Senior,2,"This University is not really geared towards campus life. As said before, most students commute."
College Senior,2,"The student population is made up of younger and older people. Some career changers, and some returning for certification. 
I have found that a lot of the students are lacking in intelligence, and are very ""country"". Their grammar is atrocious, and I am amazed that some of them made it into a teacher education program."
College Senior,2,"There is no true cafeteria, dining hall. There is a small coffee shop that sells sandwiches, and maybe brownies and such..."
College Sophomore,2,"I do not like their wireless acess for your phone.  You can not do anything but go to their site which is not why I joined the access point.  But they do give you like 250 free pages to start with, with printing."
College Junior,2,The off-campus housing near Athens State is available but most are to expensive for a college student and they must settle for a place that is more run down and landlords don't exactly care about your complaints. The apartments near Athens State are conveniently located to the campus and to other needs within town. The main problem is having to find an apartment that is affordable and on short notice. Most places are normally full and want to charge you a ridiculous price to live their.
College Junior,2,Athletics are not a big deal. Athens is mainly a transfer school.
College Senior,2,"Local night life is almost non-existent. clubs for over and under 21 are available in Huntsville, but it is about 20 to 25 miles"
College Senior,2,"Small parking area compared to other colleges near by. When we have everyone on campus it's hard to find a parking place. It's safety is very questionable, needs more lighting."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Not Much Variety – The food was very southern. There wasn't much to eat on the campus itself besides the few vending machines and the coffee/smoothie place that you never could keep up with the hours. It seemed as if when you really wanted it, it would be closed. Around campus were lots of barbque restraunts."
College Senior,2,"Only a Privately-Owned Car – My school does not have public transportation. You must have your own car. However, there are plenty of parking spots are available. It is very convenience."
College Senior,2,"Average Dining Options – When heading down the highway to the university campus, there are several fast-food restaraunts along the highway to eat at.  McDonald's and Jack's are two examples of drive-through restaraunts that are very near the university.  Pizza Hut and Zaxby's are a couple of restaraunts that you can go and dine-in near the university.  The best restaraunt that I have eaten at near the university was a quaint little Mexican restaurant among the other buildings in the Downtown area of Athens.  Honestly, do not remember the name of the restaraunt, but it was very good and is very easy to find when driving down the main street of Athens."
College Sophomore,2,"Focused on Studies – I work and go to school full-time.  I do not have time for drinking, partying, etc."
College Sophomore,2,No Football Team – I wish Athens State had a football team since the state of Alabama is a big football state.
College Junior,1,We don't have campus housing.
College Junior,1,We don't have Greek Life.
College Junior,1,We don't have an athletic department.
College Senior,1,We do not have campus housing
College Senior,1,We do not have Greek life/ fraternity or sorority on campus.
College Senior,1,"To the best of my knowledge, Athens State University does not have any sports teams."
College Senior,1,Hard to find any information about financial aid. The financial aide staff is not very helpful.
Recent Alumnus,1,"Once again, Athens is a very quiet town with no nightlife attractions.  Therefore, students remain more committed and dedicated to their work."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Unfortunately, Athens State does not offer off-campus housing connected to the campus."
College Junior,1,"I do not believe that Athens State has sports. Well not that I am interested in. That would be football, basketball, or baseball."
College Junior,1,In no way is this an athletic school.
Recent Alumnus,1,no real night life in Athens. You would have to travel to Huntsville or Florence for any real nightlife.
College Junior,1,This is not a college town.
Recent Alumnus,1,Athens State is a professional school. I do not know any students that are party that attend there.
College Senior,1,no campus transportation and really no public transportation
Recent Alumnus,1,"Not Pleased – The internship is average compared with other schools. We had some extra training that other colleges didn't and it didn't help with finding a job, so I guess it was a waste of gas, time, and money. The professors and advisors do not help with getting you a job. Basically, it's a who knows who politics game."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Definitely Not – I would have went to UAB and studied in their 5th year masters program. I'm very concerned with finding a job. It's very concerning that you can go to school, make good grades, get an Education degree, and still not get a job. I applied for 40 jobs."
College Junior,1,Fin Aid – The financial aid process sucks no matter where you go to school. The government has made the entire process so complicated that it makes everyday people who can't pay for college with mama and daddy's cash just want to give up and quit all together.
College Senior,1,"There isn't much of a ""campus dining"" at ASU. The campus dining area is mainly a coffee shop. There are plenty of restaurants around campus to grab something to eat."
College Junior,1,Athens has no greek life. Which I wish was differnt. I would have rushed if we would have had greek representation on campus.

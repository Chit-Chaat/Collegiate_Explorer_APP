Freshman,5,I didn't take any online class but I attended virtual college section and they were  good at organise everything and I did not see any mistake. It was very helpful to me.
Freshman,5,I really like ODU because I feel like everybody is friendly and teachers are try to help you everytime.
Junior,5,"This semester has been very different compared with previous semesters I have navigated through, but I have to say it has been a good change.  Currently all of my class are in person, however, I have the option to zoom into class from home any time I choose.  During the first few weeks of school I went in every day of class and attended the in-person lecture, however, one of my family members became ill. Afterwards, it led me to make the decision to zoom into class from home to take more COVID safety precautions and limit my interactions with others."
Freshman,5,"Old Dominion is a great university, everyone who works here is super friendly. The teachers are great, lots of places on campus to eat and hang out."
Alum,5,"My experience with Old Dominion was a very positive one. The environment is focused in inclusion and not simply diversity for diversity's sake. Decisions are made with the students for the interest of the student body with representation through SGA and other mediums. It is very easy to get involved with clubs and organizations. This is done by the office of Leadership and Student Involvement.  In terms of housing, various learning communities have been formed. These are designed to bring learning to the residence halls as well. Communities such as these range from housing centered on teachers to LGBTQIA interests. These are especially critical for first generation college students as it allows for a student to easily find a niche to gravitate to if they so choose. Greek life is also great here, the school and Greek councils have strict guidelines on conduct and explicitly prohibit hazing. The police on campus make an informed effort to become involved in the community."
Niche User,5,"I have not taken any classes online so far, I am currently in the process of applying to this school."
Niche User,5,Old Dominion has done an excellent job with staying in contact with me during the COVID Crisis.  They have reached out to me multiple times to help finish up my application
Freshman,5,"I have enjoyed the professors and the demeanor of the other students. I have found the classes to be engaging and interesting. I don't hag out much with the party crowd, but based on the amount of noise they make around the campus, they seem to be very pleased with themselves."
Alum,5,I did most of my classes online! They were so great and the teachers were amazing! They helped you with anything and I felt they were always willing to help. I definitely recommend ODU online.
Alum,5,I loved ODU! I was there for three years and received my Bachelors degree in Psychology! I loved all my classes and their professors!
Junior,5,"My online experience has been fantastic! My professors reached out numerous times before the start of class to ensure we fully understood what the fall semester looks like. The professors ensured I received their syllabus and materials list that are necessary to be successful in their classes. I really appreciated them reaching out early because that allowed me to strategically plan the next four months.  My professors did a great job providing multiple ways to contact them through email, phone, in-person, zoom, and on blackboard."
Junior,5,I just got here and I already feel like I'm at home. I met tons of new friendly people and even toured around the campus. It's a comfortable environment for me to be around and explore even more new things. I met my teachers and they are so nice and very welcoming. They are also tentative and they make me feel confident about the school year. I really love it here and I would highly recommend applying here for school.
Sophomore,5,"Old Dominion University is an amazing university with lots of student involvement and opportunities for the students. Old Dominion is a very diverse school, which is one of the many things I love about it. There are opportunities for anyone and everyone who goes there no matter your skin color, gender, religion, etc. The university also has many ways to get involved outside of the academic life."
Freshman,5,I am currently taking classes online and my professors are great. They send emails to me and are actually trying to get to know their students as of right now.
Sophomore,5,"I love it at Old Dominion! Everyone is so nice and willing to become your friend and help you out with anything. I love the diversity at the school considering I am multiracial myself.  They have a lot of activities on campus to get involved, learn new things, meet new people, and have fun."
Sophomore,5,"Because of COVID, we had to do online learning. All of the professors have put in so much of their time and effort to make sure that we are still being able to learn and understand. They have been amazing and super helpful!"
Sophomore,5,Old Dominion University feels like my second home. The amount of friends and connections I have made on campus is amazing. The professors are super helpful and keep the students engaged at all times !
Freshman,5,"As an incoming freshamn, ODU is committed to making sure that students and faculty are safe during this pandemic, a portion of my classes are located online with flexible schedules. I am completely honored to be attending a university that cares about their students."
Freshman,5,"Old Dominion is located in part of a vibrant portion of Norfolk where the culture really comes alive. As an MSI (minority serving institute), Old Dominion has never failed to include diversity from the courses to special events held on campus. I truly am proud to be attending such a prestigious university."
Sophomore,5,"I have transferred for the Fall 2020 term to Old Dominion Online. COVID19 has impacted my journey to keep continuing to further my studies at Radford University. Since the switch, I have encountered multiple advisors. They all have been a great help with the switch. I was skeptical about the journey, but the university has been very accommodating to my needs!"
Sophomore,5,"I have not taken any courses yet with ODU, but I will this Fall. Dealing with my advisors through the online experience, via ZOOM, email, phone call, has been exceptional. The university really understands how to communicate with their students online!"
Junior,5,"I love the overall feel of the campus, students and staff. Everyone is so kind and actually cares about how you are doing both in and out of the classroom. I have made so many friends that I hope to keep with me throughout all of life's challenges. The professors are both professional and like-able, making them easy to relate to and talk with. Each program is different and adds a unique flavor to campus life."
Junior,5,"After moving online due to quarantine, my professors did a wonderful job of transitioning to an online teaching platform. It was easy to email professors with questions and they were incredibly understanding. Submissions were easy and assignments were never to difficult to figure out on my own."
Sophomore,5,Old Dominion University is pretty fantastic. On campus there are so many activities held and plenty of student organizations that provide a way to meet people and find more about yourself and your interests while simultaneously getting an education that as a first year was challenging but ultimatly excited to go ever further with ODU's curriculum.
Sophomore,5,"My online experience at ODU has been a transition since covid hit, fortunately all of my professor made it as easy as a transition as they could."
Senior,5,"Since COVID-19 my classes have been online. The professors have been very helpful in the transit to online classes. I think online classes are a little challenging because of the COVID-19. I am in the dental hygiene program and it is very hard to finish my clinic requirements via internet. I think the teachers have done a good job in lectures on zoom, by providing a overview of material that we would have received in class. I like that online class can be flexible when it comes to working students. ODU have made it easy for me to finish some of my required classes for dental hygiene. I know some of my course work is campus based but as of right now I feel confident that my classes are delivered to me in a professional matter just like in real time such as in class. I like that if I miss an important part of lecture the teachers are willing to zoom to help me understand the concept better.I feel that with all the COVID-19, ODU has been a great help with understanding students concerns."
Senior,5,"I like that ODU has online course for students who must have clinic classes. ODU has made it possible for health sciences to complete some of their course work via zoom lectures and test. I think that COVID-19 has made it harder for students to adapt to full online learning, but ODU teachers has made the transition better. I believe that when the university in open, many students will be well rounded when it comes to online learning. I feel that ODU has the best interest at heart when it come to student Safety. I enjoy  all my classes and have learned a lot throughout this summer semester. The best part of online learning is having the freedom to take your time on some assignments and can comprehend the material much better with record zoom lectures that the teacher have provided for a learning experience.The best part of being part of ODU is that this school has the students best interest in mind when it came to COVID-19. outbreak and not sending student back too soon, safety first."
Freshman,5,"Old Dominion University has an amazing website in which the search tools maximize the amount of information that an incoming, future, or potential student can learn from. Also other tools such as the tuition calculator also provide a sense of transparency from the University."
Junior,5,"Very good school to attend for the four years, as well as summer term! The professors and staff always have best interest for the students!"
Alum,5,I had to take several on line classes at ODU and I never had a bad experience.  The classes were easy to follow and the instructors were more than helpful.  The instructors offered plenty of availability to answer any questions or concerns.
Alum,5,ODU was a fantastic University.  It offers excellent majors and has access to many on campus and off campus facilities.  The faculty and staff there are dedicated to helping the students succeed.  I was highly impressed with ODU and would recommend it to anyone considering attending a university in the HR area.
Niche User,5,The college old dominion university is really being very understanding with my transferring to there.
Niche User,5,I have not yet taken any online classes with old dominion but i have heard that it is not as challenging as most schools and they try to listen to each and every student they emphasize the use of email to communicate back and forth with their students.
Graduate Student,5,Just starting this fall for graduate school. Just graduated from Lock Haven University of Pennsylvania with my BSN and they are great!  That is where I graduated with my ASN in 2006.
Graduate Student,5,So far the experience has been fine.  Just starting the process of entering graduate school and impressed that they make you get a background check and drug screen prior to enrolling. I feel it shows their integrity.
Junior,5,"I have so far only taken 1 online class with ODU, and at first, I found it to be pretty difficult but near the middle of the semester, the professor could tell I was struggling so we set up an in-person meeting and she was very helpful and she help walk me through her online course. After our meeting, I finally got the hang of the online course."
Junior,5,"Old Dominion University is an amazing school, it allows students to be more involved not just within the school but also outside of the campus. ODU offers students all the help that they need so that the student can feel confident and comfortable with college life."
Senior,5,"I took one online class my first semester at ODU and absolutely loved it. I was trying to get into a class that was already full, and through emailing the professor she was kind enough to complete an override for me. This allowed me to jumpstart the completion of my minor and put me ahead for classes that I needed to complete. When COVID-19 hit everything was switched to online and I think the process went very smooth. My professors did a great job of finding ways to still provide help and make the new reality of online school as smooth and stress-free as possible."
Senior,5,The professors are amazing and it's the most affordable 4 year university for me. I would like to see more diversity on campus.
Senior,5,"Due to the pandemic all of my summer classes have been online.  We were instructed to work through Zoom and it has been a success.  However, I am in the Cytotechnology program and my job revolves around looking at cells through a microscope.  There are resources online, however, it is not the same and that is the most difficult part of having classes online."
Freshman,5,The University is excellent on communicating with students during the coronavirus. They mainly used the app called Zoom in order to help students set up everyone's classes. I am going to be a freshman this call semester and the faculty and advisors do an amazing job helping upcoming students this year. Most of my classes will be online this school year and two of them will be on campus. I can also email my professors if I have a question about their class.
Freshman,5,I enjoy being on Old Dominion University's campus. The area is beautiful and very satisfying than the other colleges that I had picked.
Freshman,5,"Since we were hit with the pandemic, all classes we moved to online for safety. Professors made sure we knew exactly what my class needed and when it was due, they answered any questions/emails in a timely manner."
Sophomore,5,"Due to COVID-19, Students were faced with taking classes online. I have never enjoyed online classes but I seemed to do very well during the Spring 2020 semester. Going into the Fall 2020 Semester, Some students will remain having some of their classes online due to the pandemic."
Sophomore,5,"I love ODU. Old Dominion University has wonderful professors that are passionate to teach students. ODU has lots of school spirit and many on campus activities. Students are always involved with new clubs and activities around campus every day. The campus ambassadors and staff are very helpful all throughout the year. Mrs. Ruby always welcomes students with a sweet smile and wonderful attitude at the Broderick Dining Hall. I love my school, GO MONARCHS!"
Senior,5,I love Old Dominion University. It offers a diverse learning experience as well as having the best professors imaginable. I commute to campus from Virginia Beach and if I had to change anything it would be to add more parking and more campus lightning for night students
Senior,5,"Since COVID-19 began, my professors did a wonderful job adjusting us to a new way of learning that was not ideal for anyone. I have had a great online experience with ODU."
Alum,5,My online experience for some of my online classes were really good. The work was not too discouraging and it really made me think. Through the online classes it felt as if I was in the classroom because I was able to communicate with students and teachers on a regular basis. By being able to do that it really made my online class experience a good one.
Alum,5,"ODU is a university that has changed me for the better. The student life made me realize the type of woman I am and how I can achieve heights I never thought I could reach. Even though many students have no experience in the professional career field ODU provides many opportunities for students or alumna like myself. Not only has ODU provided me with career opportunities, the teachers that I have been able to have were helpful and they encouraged their students when they could. 
ODU can also be known as a party school or have a good party seen and it doesn't but it is not all about that. Through the party seen I was able to make true long lasting friends that were just as encouraging of my future and my future career. Through these people I have realized that friends are needed and not everything can be done by myself, it has opened and changed me as an individual."
Senior,5,I had a great experience at ODU. ODU have a beautiful campus with at lot of activities for there students; also a large number of neighborhoods that have local traditions and schedule events.
Senior,5,"I had a hard time with online class, and needed to be in a classroom setting.They require more time than on campus classes. They cause you to procrastinate more and require good time management skills."
Junior,5,"I have a great experience so far, and plan on attending grad school as well here, I also love how all the faculty members, and students are supportive to get their goals done. It is a great university for education and fun time and it is also great if you near by, so you can be with your family."
Junior,5,"I did not have much classes online but, the ones that I took I had a great time doing them. It helped me focus with work and family as supposed to driving to campus and spend three hours there and come back. I would certainly recommend it if you can take them."
Sophomore,5,"At Old Dominion University I feel safe, at home, and in an overall better place. The environment at my school is friendly and welcoming. The students enrolled there all are working towards the common goal of a degree and want to help each other to get there. I have yet to meet an unkind, or unwelcoming person. Old Dominion has a stigma of not being safe because in the past there have been some violent action occurring around the school, but on the campus, I have never felt safer. With ODU PD constantly roaming and the emergency lights posted around campus you don't have to worry about what you would do if you ever did feel unsafe. That being said, I have had no need to use these safety precautions because of how kind everyone at the school is. The community life is great, and there is a place for everyone so that no one ever feels alone. The teachers are available almost anytime you need, so failing is extremely difficult. This school is the best place to further education."
Sophomore,5,I really liked ODU as a whole. A lot of more professors were amazing. and don't get me started on the food.
Senior,5,The online classes a diverse. The school noticed that online classes we're becoming more popular so they added new classes each semester.
Senior,5,ODU is efficient. The admissions and financial aid department run relatively smooth. The campus is clean and we'll kept. And so far I have liked all of my teachers except for one.
Junior,5,Online classes are very fun. It makes you determined to get up and do your work. It is also very time efficient.
Junior,5,ODU is an amazing University. The people are very welcoming and nice. I highly recommend it for anybody who plans on applying.
Senior,5,It has been nothing short of amazing. The harder classes are made easy with professor support. The Dean always provides information and updates when a crisis hits. I have enjoyed the online courses. It is really the professor who have made it easy with weekly updates and reminders.
Junior,4,This school has an amazing program for veterans returning to college life.  They understand the specific needs and concerns of veterans and are very capable in providing a solution.
Junior,4,"Wonderful school overall.  I can not attest much to campus, dorms or the party scene since I transferred to ODU later in life, however they have a very successful military transfer program."
Freshman,4,"Overall, I like ODU. I'm online this semester, but the professors have been understanding to an extent on issues that have come up this semester and my advisor has been helpful in terms of getting me set for the Spring Semester, answering any questions on housing, dining and other activities. If I had one complaint, it would be the lack of email traffic among the professors as some of mine never answer or respond slowly, which is understandable but as it's online this semester it doesn't make much sense. I'm excited to go on campus next semester so hopefully there will be more to see."
Freshman,4,"I'm taking all of my courses online, and varying on the professor they've either utilized all the online platforms to offer or they are doing the bare minimum. It's not much work, and half of the battle is just showing up to classes and have your camera on. Some count on attendance and how much you talk in class, which is annoying if you hate talking. Other's guilt trip you for not turning your camera on but that happens across the board in most schools during this time anyways. I'm taking only half of my classes online next semester, so I do hope it gets better."
Junior,4,The institution did a very good job transferring all the courses to the Zoom format. The teachers quickly adapted and found excellent ways to teach the same content digitally
Junior,4,the school has lots of great facilities like the huge library and the gymnasium. the school has a very diverse campus which is awesome
Junior,4,"As a transfer student coming from a near-by community college, they made the transition very smooth by offering excellent counseling services as well as creating multiple zoom information sessions for individuals like me to feel more at ease.  The campus is overall very friendly and offers a wide variety of clubs and activities to stay active with the monarch community."
Alum,4,I took a few courses online here and the professors were very helpful in virtual instruction. Everything was laid out in detail ahead of time so that the students wouldn't be blindsided/ working ahead was also encouraged.
Junior,4,"I am currently enrolled in my first semester at ODU. So far, everything has been going great and I'm very happy to be here. The only thing that I think needs improvement is the financial aid and finance offices. I am waiting on my state's two year transfer grant to apply to my account and the finance office didn't work with me very much. I felt forced to enroll in a payment plan, which cost me far more money than I feel comfortable with. I work two jobs and still struggle to make ends meet, so I'm not very happy with how that issue has been handled thus far. Otherwise, my experience here has been very pleasant!"
Freshman,4,Haven't had any bad experiences so far. Only problem has been financial aid and the VA representatives.
Freshman,4,I am taking 2 online classes. One of them has been going good so far and I have been able to learn the same if I were in a classroom. My other class is a different story.
Freshman,4,I never took online classes with ODU. I have heard that their online presence is tolerable. Their online presence is primarily military.
Sophomore,4,"Old Dominion University transferred to online very well last semester, teachers were understanding and willing to help in anyway possible. This semester seems to be very different and more strict for the online learning, we shall see where it goes."
Junior,4,"ODU is a fantastic school. It is ranked internationally as one of the best public 4 year universities, and I loved being there. Professors for the most part are engaging and willing to help students learn to the best of their ability."
Junior,4,"Online classes are different in general, but with Old Dominion, professors were understanding of different circumstances and situations therefore provided their classes with the most so that they could succeed."
Sophomore,4,"Last semester (Summer) was my first time taking online courses ! The professors are a bit more understanding, they communicate with you and give you a little more room to breathe. The flexibility is incomparable. I like online courses alot. The only downfall is actually waiting for reply’s regarding everything."
Sophomore,4,When I was a little girl I have always dreamed to be an old dominion monarch. I loved what the school stood for and I always knew that it would be my future college . I like the professionalism of the school and the beauty of campus. There are some teachers who are really passionate about students which helps give me the push that I need to succeed. I am proud to be a monarch.
Freshman,4,"So far the experience has been good, I have yet to meet all of the staff bu ti know they treat me very well. I hope to get to know them better and talk about my need for more scholarships."
Sophomore,4,I am a transfer student from a community college. This is my first semester at ODU. So I am not quite sure how I feel about the universty yet. I can say they've been extremely helpful with the process of applying and helping me with my transfer credits.
Sophomore,4,"As I stated above, I am not quite sure yet because this is my first semester. I am taking all of my classes online. So far they have been extremely helpful navitagting the online world for me. I would definitely recommand ODU to my friends and family."
Sophomore,4,"I was a new experience that I am able to now say I got to experience.  It was pretty hard having to switch from living on campus to online, but I am still getting used to it. It will definitely take some getting used to."
Sophomore,4,So far I have not taken any online courses but with that said; The online teaching tools the school uses such as MathLab and choice others for many different classes offer extra help and direction.
Sophomore,4,I love the clubs and staff at ODU but I would like to see the financial aid to change. I and others have had problems with that throughout the semester including myself.
Freshman,4,Great and helpful staff that know how to fix issues if any in your application. I had to fix an error in my application and it took about five minutes total to correct with the very well rounded and nice people working there.
Freshman,4,I have just started at Old Dominion and so far the University has been very helpful with the transitioning process. The only issue I've had has been with making sure my financial aid information is updated on their end.
Freshman,4,ODU has been very good at responding to the COVID-19 situation and online meetings through zoom are held frequently to help us student prepare for college this fall.
Freshman,4,"Though I would rather learn in person, learning online was very easy for me. Many classes already include online textbooks (which you do not need to purchase) and i had no problems communicating with teachers."
Freshman,4,Old Dominion University is a great college to attend. They have many majors and minors to choose from. The staff are really friendly and helpful. Old Dominion is very diverse and you can meet new people and make new friends.
Junior,4,"I’ve only taken a few online courses with ODU, and all of them have been great. They take into account where students might be and are lenient with work schedules, etc."
Junior,4,What I enjoy the most is that Old Dominion University is a military friendly University. The counselors and professors are very willing to work with you and your life obstacles. The course are in depth and you learn a lot. I wish there were more course allowed for distance learners that attend ODU.
Junior,4,"Currently enrolled and doing very wall so far. Teachers are willing to adjust and help when needed. Course are long enough to not feel overwhelmed. They do go in depth and work load is not too much to manage, while having a 60+ hour work week."
Sophomore,4,A good college for an okay price. It can be hard to meet new people unless you put yourself in a position to meet them.
Junior,4,"ODU is a great school. It's a wonderful, inclusive campus. It has modern, state of the art facilities that are available to students. There are many housing and dining options on and off campus. ODU looks out. for their students. They are quick in decision making when regarding hurricanes, storms, threats, and even viruses. They take the safety of students very seriously."
Senior,4,"The main thing that I love about ODU is the diversity. Being able to walk around campus and not only see other students that look like me but also professors, was and still is a big plus. I transferred from TCC and began taking classes at ODU as junior and I have no regrets. The process of applying and getting accepted was very quick and I had no trouble at all. I am not as involved as my peers but I do think that ODU offers a lot of opportunities for students to get involved, whether this is through special events, clubs, and even jobs."
Junior,4,"Online courses can be very easy and to the point, depending on the professor. Some professors need improvement on communication when it comes to these online courses and better instruction."
Senior,4,"I have only taken classes online because of the recent pandemic My professors, however, have been very adaptable and accommodating."
Sophomore,4,EDUCATORS ARE CARING AND WILLING TO ASSIST. CAMPUS IS DIVERSE AND FRIENDLY. HOUSING IS WELL KEPT AND NEEDS ARE ADDRESSED IMMEDIATELY
Sophomore,4,TRANSITIONING TO ON-LINE CLASSES WAS SMOOTH AND EASY. PROFESSORS WERE WILLING TO HELP WITH TRANSITION
Junior,4,My Experience with taking online classes with ODU has been a good one. All the professors I have taken a class under did an amazing job to make sure we are all up to date and that we have a good understanding of what it is we are learning throughout the semester.
Junior,4,"My experience with Old Dominion's campus so far has been a good one. ODU always has free events students can go to to have fun and get free items and food, they also have a bunch of amazing resources for students too! ODU has the writing center, testing centers, educational accessibility, and they even have a bunch of study rooms spread out around campus for students to use."
Senior,4,"Overall I have had an amazing experience with ODU.  However, there are a few professors that do not care for shaping the minds of the future and only care about their paycheck.  I also believe that ODU is mishandling money and putting it toward artificial things, such as, trying to make the campus look fancier and getting new furniture for the deans office etc.  The money should be put towards enhancing education by giving programs a higher budget for example."
Senior,4,"Though my time with this school was short, due to being a transfer student, it left a lasting mark. The grounds were always well maintained, and there never was a shortage of squirrels scurrying around. Regardless of this, I was always a bit frightened to walk alone at night due to the lack of consistent lighting."
Senior,4,"The online classes seemed to be a bit unorganized and the professors didn't seem to be fond of answering emails. Regardless, I have been impressed with the vast amount of classes that are available. This has made it incredible convenient to work and attend college."
Junior,4,I am not familiar with Old Dominion through and through because I only attend online courses. The online courses are not hard to manage as long as you keep track of what's due. It's very much the same as in-person courses. I have been to campus a few times and they are always improving on a building or adding something else for the student body to enjoy. I don't think there is a lot of diversity there. It is a predominately white institution.  They have many food options and an amazing library. The library is very flexible with allowing books to be downloaded on multiple devices. The library databases are very thorough and so full of useful knowledge. Their databases go back to the beginning of the 20th  century.
Junior,4,I do take online courses and it's manageable. They provide us with tutorials to make sure we understand. There is also an activity stream within Canvas that reminds you of what assignments are due. This is very helpful for those of us working full time who can't keep up with the syllabus.
Freshman,4,"My experience overall was great. I made so many new friends and knew many people because it was a local school. The campus atmosphere was secure, I was comfortable anywhere I went."
Junior,4,The in person classes are very well taught and the Professors are amazing. There are those professors who teach only online and you're basically just reading material about the topic that you could find online. If you have the chance take in person classes (I'm a Computer Science Major).
Sophomore,4,"I just became a sophomore in college, but i had a amazing time in my freshman year of college. All of the professors i had so far have been kind and they will help you. ODU is very lively when it comes to events, especially sport events. I can't really say anything about the dorms too much. Since i never lived in them in freshman year. However, i did get to see them. They look nice. ODU is a good college that is a cheaper option and just a college overall."
Sophomore,4,"Since classes have moved online due to the virus, teachers have adjusted well for the most part. All of my professors, except for one, have done well at continuing the class and being available for help. There is always going to be one teacher who just doesn't work well with technology but it wasn't her fault that the university shut down so I don't blame her for having trouble. The majority of my friends can agree that the online classes have continued to benefit out education"
Junior,4,Old Dominion University is a great school. There is something here for everyone. The advisors here are very compassionate and will help you with anything you need. The professors are also very nice and will help students with anything they may need.
Junior,4,"I have taken many online classes here at ODU, and they are great classes. Each professor takes the time to explain exactly what they want the students to do. Everything is outlined in the syllabus, and most of them will send out weekly emails stating all the assignments due that week. The professors also are companionate and help students whenever they can."
Freshman,4,Odu was jus as I expected very diverse and exiting everyday with a lot of activities for students to do.
Junior,4,Old Dominion is the perfect school for those students looking to engage in a large campus atmosphere.
Junior,4,I enjoy the tightly packed campus and modern architecture used for the buildings. A smaller campus makes travelling to class easier and makes learning the campus easier as well.
Freshman,4,"They have been very helpful in many cases so far. There have been some clerical issues, but I am sure that comes with any large university experience. I just have to stay on top of everything and not just count on something like the FASFA process to work."
Freshman,4,"I came from Hudson County New Jersey which is fifteen minutes away from New York City. To say I experienced culture shock when I first arrived at ODU is an understatement. Everything was different; this included the personalities of Virginians, the high school preparation, the weather, the shower water, and definitely the way/pace of life. It was a hard and long adjustment, but I survived and I have come to love it. There are always activities to participate in, a variety of clubs/organizations to join, and a billion ways to get involved on campus and in student life. From what I experienced, the professors aren't too difficult or hard to reach. They offer help and resources when needed and help you do your best at all times."
Freshman,4,I haven't gone but will attend this fall. I am hoping it will be a wonderful experience just as i think it will be.
Senior,4,"If you take the time to research clubs, organizations, and majors, you will love ODU. I was involved with church life, choir, rugby, criminal justice, and more. The campus itself is beautiful and aesthetically pleasing. I had a few professors that made my major more than worth it and helped me with so much. All the dorms are fairly new and are ALL suite style, so you don't have to worry about sharing a bathroom with more than 3 people. The campus is very diverse and you will get to meet so many cool people. I wasn't a huge fan of my academic adviser, and I struggled with clear communication with the financial aid office. But other than that, I loved ODU. Despite what people say about it being ratchet and scary, the campus itself always felt safe to me. Once off campus as you get further into community housing, is where it could get a little scary. However, that can be said about anywhere."
Freshman,4,"The off campus dorms honestly look like prisons so improving them would be nice, but overall it’s alright"
Senior,4,"ODU has a very diverse population with an incredible range of student organizations to attend. It is very military friendly, and the community is welcoming. There is a wide range of majors, though some of the programs are lacking in course offerings due to loss of faculty."
Freshman,2,I'm a freshman and my experience so far online is not that good. I ask for help i either get late responses or none at all. I'm hoping that when I move on campus it’ll change.
Senior,2,"I was an online student and I can tell you that the quality of in-person and online is definitely not equal. The computer science instructors are allowed to really phone it in and in some cases do no work at all. Morris, for example, completely no-showed for a summer semester and gave everyone an A. The school thinks this is fine. Elmesalami, Grove, and Wang are the other worst offenders when it comes to this. When you take classes in other departments, like Math or Statistics, it's a completely different experience and you learn a lot. But DO NOT go to ODU for computer science because it's pretty much a degree mill. They even pass students who do no work at all. It's truly unacceptable."
Sophomore,2,The academic advisors do not care about the students at all. I like the activities committees and organizations come up with though. You will have fun if you get involved. I just wish their workers cared more.
Junior,2,"I've given ODU two stars due to their staff over at administration, financial aid, and housing. The professors do care about the material. Their online and on-campus classes are excellent.  However, the administration is an absolute nightmare and it's extremely unacceptable how they operate. I wasted almost two whole years trying to finish my second degree with them.

As an off-campus student, if for any reason your situation is worse and you need housing, you're better off finding housing with a friend or family member.  You will still be charged $250 to be put on a waiting list as freshmen take higher priority than a person fleeing from domestic violence. Furthermore, Financial Aid offices refused to have reviewed my aid award even after I sent them requested documentation. I also notified them weeks before classes started that my FASFA account was being updated. They treat transfer students with over 30 credits terribly."
Senior,2,"Old Dominion University is great but they lack in providing a stable education. Many of the students transfer out after one semester which is sad. Need to do a better job inspiring students to stay and finish with ODU. Also, they should hire more tutors for all subjects."
Junior,2,"Old Dominion University overall i believe is a great university, FOR SOME. I however did not have the greatest experience. What initially attracted me to the school was its diversity, as well as beach access. If you are looking for elements such as one one time with professors, smaller class sizes available, or even TRUTHFUL guidance from you advisor, then this is not the school for you. There are far more students that the professors and administration can handle. I was a first generation college student who was self supported for the most part and am throughly disappointed in the lack of guidance and resources I believe I needed to reach my goals while attending this university. Not to mention the fact this is open campus. Over my three years here we have have numerous shootings, missing students, and constant break-ins each and every semester and I feel nothing has been done to amp up security for the students. Besides text and email campus alerts.."
College Senior,2,ODU is always on the news about someone being robbed or held at gunpoint. Its ridiculous.
College Senior,2,"Too expensive for average students. All campus housing option need updating besides the quad. If you don't get the quad, you are out of luck."
College Sophomore,2,last year i smelled weed in my dorm house every day. was never pressured into using.
College Sophomore,2,"It's pretty bad, there are typically robberies once a day"
College Sophomore,2,Not many places to hangout on campus.
College Junior,2,"It's not the actual campus that isn't safe, it's the location of it. Norfolk is not a good area, the neighborhoods are filled with students and locals, and the locals make ODU seem like the worst when it comes to safety. ODUPD could do a little better as well. They never respond to anymajor crime on time EVER."
College Sophomore,2,"I've definitely seen better. As long as you stay within the campus perimeter, you should be safe. Make sure the ODU police is around when you travel around at night. And make sure to call Safe Ride if you feel uncomfortable walking that dark street. All by yourself."
College Sophomore,2,Lots of shootings around campus. Scary to go out walking alone.
College Junior,2,some of the  crime  in the neighborhoods are near the campus.
College Junior,2,Way too expensive. Not worth it.
College Freshman,2,Several of my professors both fall semester and spring semester were unengaged and distant.  I would try and go to office hours and meetings for extra help but the professors would show no interest in helping me with my questions.
College Freshman,2,"The dorms in the quad are the cleanest and best dorms at ODU however it is nearly impossible to get housing here after freshman year, these dorms are also very expensive."
College Senior,2,"Horrible area for this school, the community is filled with crime. Parties happen all the time and students are really at risk for sexual assault."
College Senior,2,"There is alot of Greek organizations on campus, but the people in them are not the best. Sexual assault and drug/aclohol use are two things the Greek organizations are known for."
College Freshman,2,It's Norfolk. You're likely fine ON campus but once you get off i'd ask locals where they think is unsafe by street.
Recent Alumnus,2,We have had some problems at the back of campus.  Makes me not want to go to certain areas at night.
College Freshman,2,I have always had troubles with housing. A new system needs to be put into place.
College Freshman,2,The frats were very inappropritate when it came to freshman move in day.
College Freshman,2,The outside area of the campus is dangerous. Possibly reestablishing the borders of the campus and somehow separating the community would helpo.
College Senior,2,Never heard anything about sororities or rush week
College Senior,2,"Advisors dont know anything, and it is so hard to get a clear answer on anything here. There is no communication between the schools departments leading to many issues with my schedule and transcript. Another issue is that it is so hard to get into mandatory art classes, because there are only one or two offered at a time for 500+ students. Odu is also incredibly expensive tuition and supply wise especially in art courses."
College Junior,2,"I've taken 6 classes so far. 4 were to go towards my degree and 2 were just for my own learning curiosity. The main problem is that I'm taking all these courses online, which is a good idea in theory. However, in my experience the online classes where you can view the class live and interact with the teachers are the best. I've only taken 2 of those and in both classes I passed with flying colors. The other 4 classes I've taken have mixed results. In general a pure online class where you don't interact with the teacher is terrible for someone like me. When I don't understand the material and I go to ask the teachers something, the majority of the time they'll just point me back to the material and tell me to re-read it. Well that really don't help me if I didn't understand it the first time reading it chances are I won't the second time. So I end up doing poorly on the parts I don't understand and that would not happen in a classroom setting. If I don't understand something during a live class I can say hey I don't understand that, and they'll take the time during the class to explain it, if I still don't understand it they'll stay after the class is over to walk me through it. My review is based solely on their online classes I have never taken a class at the college because it is too far away for me to drive everyday."
College Freshman,2,A lot of Greek life has created tension on campus.
Recent Alumnus,2,I transferred in and never really felt like I belonged.
College Sophomore,2,"Old Dominion University is unfortunately the best school choice for me. Although there are many schools in Virginia, none of them would satisfy me and fulfill my ideal college experience. When deciding where to go, there were only three schools that have criminal justice as a major that I was interested in. Old Dominion University(ODU), George Mason University (GMU), and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). By process of elimination, Old Dominion University was more qualified than my other choices. VCU location being in the middle of the city was too open, and does not give a college campus atmosphere. GMU is very close to home to myself, and I would hate to dorm there because it would simply be a waste of money, compared to commuting. Therefore, ODU provided me with a somewhat closed campus, where I would be able to start new. However, I have found that my main issue with ODU is that it lacks a certain kind of diversity. Culture-wise, ODU is one of the most diverse campuses in Virginia, but in the social aspect, one must give in to peer pressure in order to not go crazy. I am aware that drinking, partying, and drugs are very common in all colleges. However,from visiting other colleges I noticed that at ODU, it is almost impossible to socialize in any other way. Also, the faculty and staff overlook all students' concerns about what is needed in the school. With a school full of commuters, parking is very hard to find. Many students complain to those in charge and they respond by tearing down another parking facility. The cost of tuition is too high for our troubles to be swept under the rug like so, and I cannot even lie and say that I enjoy the school that I go to."
College Junior,2,Parking is the worst part of it. Students pay $306 to park per year and no where to park due to the over-sale of passes
Recent Alumnus,2,"When trying to admit to the school, I made calls and talking to different people within the same area got different answers in guidance. People have to get on accord, and that comes through training and supervisory provisions. Start early as you can and actually go to the campus if possible to get face time with the people whom are giving you answers!"
College Student,2,ate one time in cafeterria
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid office personally needs to hire better employees they are very rude majority of the time and don't really try to help that much. They should offer more scholarship opportunities for second and third year students as they can see Old Dominion is very expensive and some students don't get a lot of help with federal aid.
College Sophomore,2,"The on-campus food is not too good. On occasion the Cafe 1201 will have decent food and Legends food is pretty good all the time  but overall its sub-par. There needs to be more food options on campus and the quality should be better the only things that are somewhat satisfactory in the Web are Starbucks, Chick-fil-a and Subway. The menus have a pretty decent variety but the quality of food needs to be better, we spend hundreds of dollars for this food and it doesn't even taste that good either the prices need to get lower or the food needs to be better."
College Sophomore,2,College kids just dont take care of things and most of the houses suffer damage and never get fixed
College Sophomore,2,The safety of the campus has always been lacking because of the surrounding neighborhoods by the campus.
College Sophomore,2,"I normally don't go to parties but, like a lot of people, I drink and hang out with my friends."
College Sophomore,2,"At ODU the school is more concerned with incoming freshman and the football team to pay any attention to the students and their housing already on campus.  I called many times over the past summer and finally received my housing a week and a half prior to fall semester of 2014.  Odu also placed me in Powhatan, campus apartments that are old and run down.  I got placed with random roommates even though some of my friends and I requested each other.  They replaced some upper classmen dorms so they could reserve space for more freshman.  Therefore, if you apply very early and get lucky, then you should be fine and may even love housing. For the other 80%...Have fun."
College Junior,2,"I honestly can't stand the food here sometimes. Yes, Cafe 1201 has it's good day but most are bad. The options within the cafe are the same everyday, plus if you plan to eat healthy the only option you have is a salad. Some of the other options of campus food are okay, but it would be nice to see something different."
College Freshman,2,It's terrible and hard to obtain.
College Freshman,2,The dining halls are terrible. The food is low quality and the dishes and cooking area are rarely clean.
College Senior,2,You'll have to hound the office with multiple e-mails and phone calls to get an answer about anything.
College Sophomore,2,"Apply Apply Apply for Financial Aid! FASFA.ed.gov. The first year that I came to Old Dominion University, my tuition was covered by financial aid. Due to the failing of one class, it messed up my financial aid and they only gave me half of what I was receiving the year before. It sucks to know that you have to pay out of pocket in order to continue your education. I don't have the money right now and neither does my parents. It was my fault for failing the class and now I have to put the burden on my parents. This is why I am applying for scholarships, to continue my education and get a degree. Apply for scholarships also, you may not win but its worth a try. If you really want to continue your education, you will not give up."
College Sophomore,2,"ODU PD would rather bust parties where everything is going fine than patrolling the streets surrounding the campus where crime actually does occur. It's almost as if they've lost a sense of duty- they focus more on harassing college students than simply protecting the. The Night Life at ODU has significantly diminished during my tenure here. The student houses on campus used to be nice spots to party in Fall 2013 but now you can hardly find a party going on there, and if you do the cops are most certainly on the way to shut it down. Night Life was once one of our strong suits in a recreational perspective now it is almost non-existent."
College Sophomore,2,"Ok, so there are the nice, somewhat pricey dorms that you need a group of friends and a blessing from God to get into. Those are dorms, and they are pretty nice. Drywall, carpeting, etc.

Then there are the Apartments, the Inn, and Freshman dorms. THOSE are composed of whitewashed cinder blocks and some dry-walling. 

I like my old, somewhat run-down apartment. It's cheaper than dorms, and you get full amenities. However, it's cold here, and it's cold inside the apartment too. They are OLD.

 Freshmen get priority, sophomores slightly less so. Juniors and Seniors, (not kidding) according to a HOUSING ADMINISTRATOR, are ""usually not given priority unless they are homesteading or if the university has room."" 

We will not have room for a while. Housing is one of the bigger problems (parking being the other), and neither are getting better anytime soon. (They are demo'-ing some of the lots and dorms, in fact, to make room for new buildings and stadiums. No room for outward expansion, so they just go. Supposed to reappear somewhere else in 10+ years. Haha.)"
College Freshman,2,ODU is known for having diversity on and off campus and the trend continues with the surrounding cuisine. Around the block is a family owned Caribbean restaurant that is absolutely mouth-watering.  The area isn't without it's local Mc'adees either.
College Freshman,2,"The local neighborhoods are awful, often crime prevents a night out with the police breaking up any gathering that that had to do with the nightly reported crime. The city of Norfolk can be moderately exciting, if you plan on shopping at the mall or seeing a movie."
College Freshman,2,"The environment of my dorm is not what I'm looking for. Too many slackers, not enough friendly people. Too far from campus for my liking."
College Sophomore,2,The main thing that the administration is really focused on is attendance and the honor code.
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid department at Old Dominion University is garbage.  They are just as confused as the students and parents who ask question.   They are not very helpful.  I was highly encouraged to pay $10,000 of my tuition out of pocket."
College Junior,2,"I think I qualify for most of the scholarships my college offers but I do not receive any money from my institution and it is very stressful. I need $10,000 of financial aid but for them to even give me $1,000 would help!"
College Sophomore,2,The crime on campus usually happens because locals can't get into parties.
College Sophomore,2,The housing process is terrible. The campus needs more dorm to house more students.
College Sophomore,2,The surrendering area has a lot of crime. The locals also cause trouble on campus sometimes.
College Sophomore,2,I feel as if the campus should be gated.
College Freshman,2,"It is not a safe city so the campus is not very safe either. Alerts sent out to ""help"" us go out a few days after the crimes have occurred so it doesn't do anything to help caution anything."
College Freshman,2,I did not receive any type of financial aid whatsoever
College Freshman,2,"The campus itself is safe, however the surrounding area is not which is a problem because all the parties happen in these areas. Students are strongly advised to walk in groups or take the safe ride service provided by the university."
Freshman,1,"As mentioned before, online classes or classes in general aren’t as good or beneficial  to the professors."
Senior,1,"DON'T GO HERE. ODU does not care about you and will not help you. Literally any other college would be a better option. I have to pay almost $500 every semester just in bogus fees for things nobody uses. Even worse, ODU is now using ""IncludED Packages"" for courses. These are scams created by textbook companies to force students to pay for additional course material THAT WE DON'T NEED AND DON'T USE. Some corrupt ODU official probably gets a kickback from these too. I can't figure out another reason why ODU would team up with Pearson to force these extra costs on students.

If you have any sort of financial difficulty, not only will ODU not help you, they will actively add on additional fees and send you to collections. Which adds more fees and hurts your credit score."
College Freshman,1,Living in Whitehurst is the worst I have ever done.
College Freshman,1,The security of the campus is extremely low and very poor.  The ODU police are only concerned with tickets regarding headlights or other simple vehicle concerns.
College Freshman,1,"The Greek life at ODU has no positive impact on the community, the Greek life is only social and party based."
College Freshman,1,"I didn't get any email about if I got the job or didn't, they never called me in. Plus, it was hard to find job around campus which, it shouldn't be. But it is."
College Senior,1,No housing at all. When I transferred I was unable to get housing at all.
College Freshman,1,"Crime is horrible, but it just might be the area. Anyone can walk into any building. Their are drugs, shootings, and other killing everywhere on and near campus. There were so many my first semester I almost had to transfer schools. Odu is to much money to be spending if you might one day be in the wrong place at the wrong time AT SCHOOL and have a chance of someone robbing/potentially killing you. It's ridiculous."
College Senior,1,Theres no where to go around here! Except Delvecs but thats about it.
College Senior,1,I have had about 7 teachers who just want to hang out with the students instead of teach to relive their glory days. Im paying to be taught not for you to hang out with captive friends.
College Senior,1,Never been to the student health center but I am still getting charged 77-80 bucks a semester for it.
College Senior,1,"Overall Im really disspointed by Old Dominion. I feel like I am paying to do all the work my advisors and financial aid advisors are supposed to be helping with. In my 3 years at this school I have been told I would graduate on time, then told I need 20 more credit hours for my major after being told on multiple occasions I would be able to walk in the srping. I have also had to go around this school on numerous occasions becuase no one could tell me what classes would transfer from TCC to Odu, and I needed to find out because I thought I was graduating this Spring, and I needed a cpass that there were only two time slots for 15 people each. I had been told to enroll in classes at TCC only to be told on a fee different occasions after the cut off date for a refund that those classes may not really transfer. (Asl and Screenprint.)  I have also on two occasions been told I was getting grants only to be signed up for two student loans. If there was any way to get a refund from this school I would do it in a heart beat because I really dont feel like anything that Ive been through here deserves to continue getting tunding."
College Senior,1,"Tried to find internships for this semester upcoming while I am in school, and my advisor sent me New York internships, knowing full well I had to be at ODU for the classes I was taking. I ended up finding my own internship only to be told that since it was nonprofit I wouldnt get the credit hours, and qfter fighting throught that then told that instead of the 4 credits the registrar told me I would gete, I would actually get 3."
College Sophomore,1,They are strict about things they will get paid for (ex. parking)
College Sophomore,1,They are rude and not helpful at all. They do not care if you are not able to afford school they just assume that you can.
College Sophomore,1,"Gresham Main and East and Rogers Main and East buildings are the worst, but they are the most social of the freshman dorms."
College Freshman,1,"I applied for financial aid and after months of waiting I finally got an email saying that I could accept my award. I followed up that same day and accepted my award. A few weeks later, when I'm already moved in and what not I get an email saying that my award for financial aid is going to expire within 30 days. I called my mom and sent her the email so that we could figure out what was going on. Before she could go through the system and figure out why it's telling me to accept my award again I get another email (20 minutes after the first one) saying that my award has expired. I went through all of the trouble with filing the FAFSA just for my award to expire way before I had a chance to figure out what went wrong the first time."
College Sophomore,1,Living on campus is horrible.  Students have no privacy of any kind.  One of the dorms is an old hotel building.  The campus is run down.  After you pay your $200 housing fee you are still not guaranteed housing.  One student had to sleep in his friends care on campus before housing could find living quarters for him.  It made news.
College Sophomore,1,"There are robberies, rapes, attacks, and every once in a while a death on campus.  ODU is not all that safe."
College Freshman,1,It is not very safe.
College Freshman,1,Financial aid here is a nightmare.
College Freshman,1,"Norfolk is a city, so as expected, there are very poor parts. It is not comforting to me at all that there are shootings that happen so close to campus. The crime rate is very high here and students go out at their own risk."
College Junior,1,"Just know that on-campus dining is horrible. If you have to eat at the Cafeteria, Legends (in Whitehurst) is the best one. Not much variety and the overall taste of the food is the best. Flex points will be your best friend so do not use them all up in one month! Flex points can be used at any food place in the Webb and at Cane's on monarch way."
College Junior,1,Financial aid is horrible. They will give you trouble from the moment you get to ODU until your last year. Prepare yourself.
College Freshman,1,bipolar weather makes everyone sick
College Freshman,1,We have constant shootings and robberies.
College Freshman,1,Lots of shootings. Crack neighborhoods.
College Freshman,1,It is for the snobby and pretentious. Only for privileged.
College Freshman,1,Dorms are aggravating and way too expensive. The guest policies are ridiculous.
College Sophomore,1,"Parking is the worst. Actually, you don't want me to get started on how much I hate ODU and City of Norfolk Parking. It's outrageously ridiculous, and unfair to the students."
College Sophomore,1,"No parking spaces and too many commuters. Parking passes and location don't go well together and their too expensive even though you still have to walk far to get from your parking area to the residence hall. It sucks, I would rather park on the streets than buy a parking pass."
College Freshman,1,Allow more financial aid for full time students.
Recent Alumnus,1,It is nearly impossible to find aesthetically pleasing places to hang out.
College Junior,1,There are so many potholes its ridiculous and when it sprinkles the city floods.  They need to have better roads too.
College Junior,1,My first year of college financial aid had put in my wrong birth date year so when connecting with my school the information didnt match up and i didnt receive aid until the end of that semester. Every year since then the requirements for tax information as far as deadlines was always a hassle because my parents dont receive their information until after the deadline. So just about every year we have to pay out of pocket this semester alone we had to pay my full tuition out of pocket.
College Senior,1,"Long story short, if you are concerned about safety, Old Dominion University is not the place for you.  Word of an incident gets around through students quicker than police.  If you call the police they rarely show up.  If there is a shooting or robbery your chances of hearing about it are slim to none through our safety alert texts, and if you do its usually about 10 hours later.  "
College Freshman,1,"The shuttles only run on the weekends. Being a college student it is expensive to pay $3 everyday to go somewhere else. Wal Mart, the mall and other stores are at least 30 minutes away from campus, I have to wait until the weekends to go to buy groceries or run other errands. "
College Freshman,1,"It is very cold. Since I do not have enough money to buy coats, it has been very cold weeks for me"
Recent Alumnus,1,Norfolk is at sea level. Flooding causes schools to shut down and you are never sure of the weather forecast is always inaccurate.
Recent Alumnus,1,"At night, many students have been assaulted since ODU is on an open public campus in the middle of Norfolk. "
College Senior,1,"Parking is one of the worst aspects about attending Old Dominion University.Being that more that 75% of the population are commuters, parking is hard to come by here at ODU and sometime can be very  inconvenient for students."
College Senior,1,"They have made some new areas available at the school for students to live. But, the area surrounding the school is not considered particuarily safe and many, like myself, choose to live off campus and drive to class."
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking is horrible!  Must get there early to secure a space (commuter).  Needs more commuter parking.
College Senior,1,There are not options for vegans. There are limited options for vegetarians. The food is also not worth the price we pay for the meal plan.
College Junior,1,"parking can be a nightmare. make sure you have a parking pass though, because getting ticketed once is just enough money to buy a permit, not cheap."
College Sophomore,1,"At Old Dominion alcohol is easily acquired by anyone who wants it. You can't walk to far without smelling marijuana, especially near the beaches. Prescription drugs are openly sold and taken. Hallucinogens aren't as relevant ,but are definitely available. I didn't give us an F because the drug activity is constantly talked about in the school newspaper ,it isn't ignored."
College Senior,1,"The diversity on campus is abundance. However, all of the students on campus seem segragated. They are all in clicks. Diversity is accepted. However, each diversity/religion group sticks with its own. It is sad."
College Sophomore,1,Not really safe. There has been reports of burglary and thefts.
College Freshman,1,"The parking is very pitiful.  Because of low space, freshman are not allowed to have their vehicles.  For those that do, it is very hard finding a parking space and they often times get tickets.  The cost of parking is expensive as well."
Recent Alumnus,1,The parking at ODU is not good. The closed down a huge parking lot to build another building which means there is really no parking. Many people will park on side streets but those have a limit of 2 hours. I saw that many people did get parking tickets because they were not back to there spot in time.
College Junior,1,"Alcohol visibility is very high. The use of drugs besides marijuana are not seen often publicly but the other drugs are around. People are just much more open with the former, I have been walking to class plenty of times and caught a whiff as someone walked by openly smoking. Both of these activities are much more prevalent and commonly seen on the weekends but that's also when Norfolk/ODU police are patrolling the hardest."
College Senior,1,"Parking on campus is horrible.  They tore up the parking lot in front of the library.  In addition, all the close parking lots have been changed to staff parking only.  There are very few spots for ODU students to park."
College Junior,1,It is always a hassle to get financial aid at ODU. The staff at the financial aid office is not really helpful. You really have to get someone internally who knows what they're talking about and lucky I found that helpful staff member. I still haven't received enough aid to cover everything. The fact that financial aid/fafsa looks at gross pay is pretty annoying. Net pay should be looked at instead. After taxes and whatnot my mom does not make enough to cover myself and another child for college. Her EFC should be lower than the one she was given. Sucks!
College Sophomore,1,"There's SO MANY staff parking lots, there's even staff spots in the commuter lots! There's already way too many commuters, trying to find a parking spot is absolutely awful, especially when you look over and see that most the staff lots are empty. It makes no sense! The students outnumber the staff, and yet, we get 1/3 the amount of spaces they do. We pay to not be able to park. It's absolute nonsense. "
College Junior,1,SO DANGEROUS! There are campus muggings all the the time and break-ins in closeby apartments.
College Junior,1,"They have some in the library but it's always packed and so hard to get one, and it costs to print."
College Junior,1,"The parking passes are so extremely expensive and the distance much better than if I just find a spot in the closeby neighborhoods. But the neighborhoods are so dangerous, it's frightening to walk to class, but I just can't afford a parking pass. My car has even been broken into. It's awful."
College Junior,1,"Oh my gosh, it's absolutely awful. We are in the tidewater area, so the campus floods so incredibly easily and we have to wear boots and everything to cover us otherwise we'll be soaked. Our classes will be cancelled even because it rains so hard. Barely anyone comes to class when it's that bad out and if they don't cancel the class."
College Freshman,1,"There is barely any snow here but it rains all the time and when it rains, it pours. There is also alot of wind and in the winter it gets extremely cold. Having a rain jacket, sturdy umbrella and rain boots is definitely a must at ODU."
College Freshman,1,"There are some groups of friends that don't drink or smoke, but for the most part there aren't many people at ODU that don't regularly drink. There is a alot of drug usage at ODU but its not mandatory and you won't feel pressured to participate."

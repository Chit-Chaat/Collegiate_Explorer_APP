Niche User,5,"I can't wait to go there! I get to meet a lot of new classmates and teachers, plus people who work in big companies such as Pixar, Warner Bros, Sony, and so much more."
Alum,5,The professors are top notch.  Their wisdom combined with the hands on nature of the classes prepared me really well for a career in the media industry.  I loved taking classes in philosophy and business.  Both helped form my mind and informed my storytelling.  I'm really grateful for my education here!
Alum,5,"I graduated back in 2015, with a Bachelor of Science Communication Media degree with an emphasis in the New Evangelization. The New Evangelization program is one of the best programs offered at JP Catholic University.During my time here, I received an extensive amount of Theology, Philosophy, and Biblical studies, all while learning the practical skills of media, marketing, and business, If you are passionate about your Catholic faith and are passionate about creating beautiful art via modern technology than this is the school for YOU! Here, you will get the best of both worlds!"
Niche User,5,"I fell in love with JP Catholic. All the professors seem to be very passionate about what they enjoy. I like how the class sizes are very small; The Professors get to have more time to focus on you if you need the help. The apartments are  very nice in my opinion. It is literally only one building, but the college is planning on expanding very soon, which is great. I don't really have anything to complain about it at the moment."
Graduate Student,5,"John Paul the Great is a Catholic University in Escondido. I was very surprised that there was a local Catholic university that has majors in business, theology, and the performing arts. It has a good mix and balance of people. Teachers are excellent. Students are friendly."
Freshman,5,"The experience here is fantastic. The professors car about all aspects of your life, and are very kind. The small aspect of the school makes the student life very enjoyable considering everyone knows everyone. The only thing I would consider changing would be the inner visitation rules."
Freshman,5,"When asked about the Catholic identity of the school, I have to say it is fantastic! Mass is offered frequently. Adoration is available frequently. The students are all supportive of the practice of the Faith and I always feel like there is someone available if I need to talk."
Freshman,5,"The culture, student body, and teachers are all great. The few bad things I've heard are mild in comparison to other Universities. The teachers are fair and if you take your education seriously they appreciate the effort. JPCatholic may be a film school with other good options, but it's first and foremost a Catholic University. If you're interested in media and serious about the Catholic faith there is no better place to go. However, Escondido area is not to be underestimated. It's objectively unsafe for students to wander around town at night alone. However, if you follow all the rules and guidelines of JPCatholic and practice general safety you should be fine. Cheap food and job opportunities are available and JPCatholic offers additional help and consultation for employment. Aside from normal stresses of living and a lot of homework, the school has been nothing but good to me so far and I'm optimistic about the future."
College Sophomore,5,"The average student has only five classes per quarter, which is easily manageable. The professors are learned, excellent, and genuinely care about each student's well-being. Students are welcomed to audit other classes as well and there are many opportunities for study groups for each class. Registration is very simple due to the general class schedules already being created- there is no rush."
College Sophomore,5,Drugs and alcohol are not present at this school.
College Sophomore,5,"Course quality is excellent and the professors know each student by name and genuinely care for their well-being. Class sizes are small, allowing each student to ask as many questions as they need to to fully grasp the content."
College Sophomore,5,The apartments are very nice and everyone loves it
College Sophomore,5,Our Greek life is active. Most of the school joins
College Sophomore,5,"This school is a perfect fit for me and most every student here. Being Catholic, they are authentic and passionate about the theology classes and program. Also, the film program is very prominent and the classes really teach the students about every aspect of film, whether they knew about it beforehand or not. The professors have all played a major part in the film industry (Chris Riley, screenwriter, Gina Fricchione, screen actor, and Lee Eskey, stage actor to name a few), allowing them to present the students with very useful, insightful information about how to succeed in the industry. They also assign many projects for students to collaborate with each other on to put together a short film in a limited amount of time. This teaches them what the industry calls for and how to work with one another. In addition, the student life is very active. There are events being constantly hosted at the school or in the common room. There are many opportunities for social events and for studying in groups. I wouldn't change my college choice for the world because this school really welcomes each student and makes them feel at home as well as building their skills in their desired majors."
College Senior,5,Student housing is at a nearby apartment complex with the choice of living in an apartment or town home. Either way there are up to 5 students in each apartment/townhome.
College Senior,5,"A small campus that strives to impact culture for Christ, JPCU is in the heart of Escondido, CA."
College Junior,5,JPCatholic has such a friendly environment.
College Sophomore,5,"So many friendly, delicious places to choose from!"
College Sophomore,5,"Parties at JPCU don't include drinking and drugs, and they're full of appropriate, fun, amazing people. They happen pretty much anywhere you want to have them- dances, Praise and Worship, intramural football at school, or study groups, movie nights, pool parties, hanging out in the Perch common area. Anytime you want."
College Sophomore,5,"Since JPCU doesn't have a set meal plan (which saves us about $1000 a quarter) each student buys and cooks their own food (or bands together with their roomies). This means we each get to eat what we like best and what is best for our bodies. There are plenty of stores around, and if some night you don't feel like cooking there are a plethora of food establishments within easy walking distance."
Alum,4,"My experience at JPCatholic was fantastic. The core curriculum is strong, teaching you about life and why we are here while providing a strong basis in ethics. Their business cores give you enough that you can supplement with a good side job in a business related field if you are not majoring in business. Their main focus is media. They are superb in that regard. Their media professors are some of the best.

In regards to areas of improvement, the school is about ten years old and their are a few things that could be smoothed on from the administrative side of the arena. They keep making adjustments so I anticipate that to be solved soon.

I found it appealing, one aspect is that students are in a dorm that is an apartment complex, you have the ability to cook your own meals. There were times where scheduling made this difficult, but it was a good learning curve.

Thank you and hope this helps. Happy searching."
Sophomore,4,"First year has been really good, learned a lot during school and outside of class. People there are very nice and the staff are nice as well. Classes are interesting and projects that are done for film are very informative and provide good experience for when you work on film sets. There are ways to improve communication between staff and students but other then that the school is a great place to develop one’s self."
Alum,4,"I really enjoyed my time at JP Catholic. I especially enjoyed how many of the classes related to real life experiences. As a business major, I found the classes to be more about teaching students real-world situations they will encounter vs. teaching out of a textbook for a test. I also found that as a student you have much more direct exposure to faculty than you would at many other Universities. I felt many of the instructors were more mentors than professors. This class structure, mixed with great peers and supportive teachers makes for a valuable college experience."
Freshman,4,Great community and atmosphere. No food or transportation resources. Very nice apartments/living areas.
Alum,4,"Loved almost all of my professors. They were fantastic as people and excellent as professors. Naturally you'll have a mediocre one every now and then. I majored in film production, and the classes/professors taught me film theory, practical production skills, and industry terms and methodology. You can only learn so much before actually working on a feature film set, and I feel like I got a great start at JPCU. This university is also authentically Catholic. Not every student is Catholic, but that's fine; we welcomed them. The theology and philosophy courses were both intellectual and practical."
Sophomore,4,"John Paul the Great Catholic University is an excellent, but highly specified, school.  It caters to a very small demographic, i.e.: Catholics interested in media.  I attend their film production program.  The best things about their film production program are the professors and the hands-on experience with filmmaking provided and encouraged.  All of the professors have worked in Hollywood and have credits to their name.  Honestly, the professors are probably the best thing about the school in general, even apart from the film program.  The school is low on bureaucratic red tape, which is a relief.

The school's weakest points are its somewhat incompetent administration, a confusing and irrational set of rules, and a growing emphasis on liberal arts subjects.  Certain forces within the school are trying to move in a more academic, less media-driven direction, which is harming the school's ability to be taken seriously as a film school."
College Freshman,4,Professors are really excited about what they teach. They do the best they can to pass on their knowledge to the students.
College Freshman,4,Greek Life is not really a thing at JP Catholic. Instead of fraternities or sororities there are households which take the place of fraternities or sororities. Each household has a specific interest and in order to join one a student must intend with that household which is not that hard.
College Sophomore,4,"Besides most of the student body being Catholic, other diversity is very present."
College Senior,4,"We do not have Greek Life, we do however have households which is similar to the Greek Life. Households are separated by gender and require incoming students to intern for one quarter before officially being a member of a household. Households meet at least once a week, attend mass together, participate in prayer and at least one community service project a quarter."
College Junior,4,"My university is growing and changing very fast. I am glad that I am able to be a part of that founding process. I love that our campus is right downtown and split between different buildings. It really forces us into the community instead of just sitting in our dorms and staying ""on campus."" We interact with people who don't go to the school all the time."
College Junior,4,"Living on campus is pretty interesting. Our dorms are basically town homes and apartments which are much nicer than I expected dorm life to be like.  The campus itself, consists of three buildings which is also interesting but also makes it easy to navigate around the school."
College Sophomore,4,"Overall the students really appreciate the campus strictness. It keeps us free from most of the problems that harass the typical college campus, and we're proud of it!"
College Sophomore,4,"The school does a very good job of helping its students. They are small so they can't take care of all your expenses, but they are very generous with what they have. Over 90% of students receive significant financial aid."
College Sophomore,4,"Other then the typical ""No cross gender visitation in apartments"" and ""no underage drinking or drugs"" policy that is common to Catholic schools, i would not rate JP Catholic as strict. Located in the middle of active Escondido not far from many beaches and a mere 30 miles from LA, there is no shortage of opportunely for entertainment as soon as you leave the small campus."
College Sophomore,4,"Being such a small University, you get to know all 200 students relatively quickly. Both guys and girls are open and friendly, and there are few signs of snotty cliques. There are predominately more guys than girls, which is both a blessing an cure, depending on which gender you prefer."
Sophomore,2,"Administration tends to favor the film students over the business, humanities, and theology. Many of the professors are unfortunately teaching the wrong department. Many of the classes weren’t challenging except philosophy, but as many new alumnus and upperclassmen say, “JP Catholic degrees are only good for working at JP Catholic.” If you choose to live in the apartments, the sensors in fire alarms caused them to go off randomly in the middle of the night and the property management has yet to do any permanent repairs. Another thing about living at the Latitude 33 apartment complex is many homeless people from the nearby homeless shelter( a block away) wander into the complex and try to break into the apartments. I had a friend who had his $1300 Sony camera, bike, and shoes stolen. And if you park your car in the apartment garage beware that many people have had their cars broken into for as little as a flashlight or backpack"
Alum,1,"Honestly, I feel like it was a waste of time and money. The only good parts of the education were the philosophy and theology, but since their theology professor has left and now one of the alumni is teaching the theology (and he only has an MA, which he got at JP Catholic), I can only recommend the philosophy professor.

The administration is abysmal. They say they are a Catholic University, but often they act worse than a state college. When WASC came to accredit the school, they stated that there was too much nepotism. That says it all."
Alum,1,"I would highly recommend you find an alternative to this university, there are a lot of places that offer the same experiences in a better location with a better price. I don’t think this school will even be around for the next 5 years."

Freshman,5,"Overall, this school is pretty well and since during this pandemic I've been taking care of the factly to know what's going to be happening and the measures they've taken to make sure every student is safe during the pandemic."
Freshman,5,My learning experience is pretty very well and I've met tons of adults and students that are like me as well and want to pursue the same courses as me.
Freshman,5,"I have been working at UAT (University of Advancing Technology) full-time for less than a year

Pros

UAT is my home away from home, my family, and my biggest support system. This is a job that I actually enjoy going to every day. We work hard but have fun while doing so. I honestly couldn't imagine being anywhere else.

Cons

Location isn't ideal, but oh well."

Freshman,5,"Because of the pandemic, all classes are virtual, but the school has handled it wonderfully and the learning hasn't missed a beat! The teachers are super friendly and helpful as well!"
Freshman,5,I love learning here! The staff and faculty are very friendly and helpful and the campus is very well designed for tech enthusiasts.
Freshman,5,"The school has an amazing atmosphere with lots of tech and resources that students can use in class. The students are very much alike and kind considering it's a tech college. The classes are very relevant to current times and are made to be as if you were in the industry you're going into. The teachers all have industry backgrounds which make them more qualified to teach us students about our field we want to enter with knowledge on how to help us succeed. With all of this access, the price of college isn't as bad as others around the area like ASU of U of A which makes it easier to afford and attend."
Niche User,5,I love this college! They have such a wide variety of majors to take in the tech field and they will help you get a job once you graduate.
Freshman,5,The school has amazing instructors who are devoted to your education. I highly suggest the school to anyone looking for flexible online classes!
Sophomore,5,"So far, in my experience of UAT. I find that the professors are quite knowledgeable, and usually fair when grading your work. The office staff that works for UAT, are all friendly and wish to see you succeed."
Niche User,5,"I'm actually just now attending them, but overall, the communication and curriculum is absolutely excellent for my needs. I honestly wish I could be on the campus itself, but I'm attending them online."
Niche User,5,Going to college there soon is 3 months! I've been stayed there before overnight and they showed us around campus and what life is like there. It's amazing and I plan to stay there for 4 years.
Sophomore,5,I love this school and everything about it. It feels like home here and the faculty truly care about the students.
Freshman,5,This college is amazing!! The campus is beautiful and the teachers are knowledgeable and helpful. They have so many reasons to be called the best.
Sophomore,5,I love how this school is focused on technology. I can truly focus on getting the type of education I truly want.
Niche User,5,"I am giving an excellent rating, because I have not enrolled just yet, but the advisors and admissions teams are excellent people so far."
Freshman,5,"its amazing the people are so nice and the professors are so helpful, if you are a tech nerd like me you will love this school!"
Sophomore,5,"This is a great school for introverts to have a better social life. This is a really geeky school where video games, fandom, and technology all run free. They school has many events where you can come out and meet your fellow peers and make friends. They also have plenty of clubs, the coolest of which being Nerf Wars club. Where students run around the main corridor for two to three hours shooting at each other with foam darts. Overall its a great place to further your education as well as make some friends."
Niche User,5,I will be going to University of Advancing Technology in 2018 fall. I've been to UAT to visit the campus and all the staff members are very polite and nice. And the students themselves were very helpful in my tour. I meet a wide range of the staff and they helped me and my mom  understand what was going to be happening in my stay at UAT for the next upcoming years. i am very excited to study and experience everything UAT has to offer.
Freshman,5,"I am an online student currently attending this university. The professors are very helpful and respond quickly. The online programs have many different people in it. Some of the students have just finished high school, and some have already been in an industry for many years and are looking to earn another degree. Regardless of how you start out, the classes feel accessible to everyone, and anyone can learn knowledge in the courses. The professors are very knowledgeable on the subject matters that they teach. The subject matters seems up-to-date, which is a necessity as this school primarily has technology based majors and technology can change fairly quickly. I would highly recommend this university for anyone interested in working in a technology field."
Junior,5,"I'm a current online student of UAT, and at just over half-way done with my bachelor's degree in Game Design, I can honestly say that I have been having the time of my life. The classes are challenging without being burdensome, the instructors are knowledgeable, and adjust to my schedule and needs to the best of their ability. This really is the epitome of Geek-U. I would gladly recommend UAT to anyone looking to get into any tech field, but especially to those young men and women who are looking to get into game design, art and animation, or programming."
Freshman,5,"So far my experience at UAT has been wonderful. All the staff and even the higher level students are all very willing to help the newer students both with functioning as a on campus student and in the academia portion of life on campus. There's groups to fit everybody's taste and if there isn't a club it can be very easy to make one. The school is a bastion for technologyand anyone who is nerdy enough for their fields of study are well taken care of with everything they need to succeed. The campus itself is open 24/7 so if you need to get something done late at night or super early in the morning; you have full access to the facilities you need. The dorms are well kept. They take safety very seriously here as well, being such a small campus of 300 students and centered in the middle of the Phoenix/Tempe metropolis; and have security around the clock to male everyone feel safe."
Freshman,5,"You get out what you put in. If you put in 100%+ than you'll have a great time.  The university has quite a few perks, such as up-to-date technology in regards to Information Technology, Cinematography, Art and Animation to name a few. Along with the tech there are a plethora of classes to take en tandem with primary courses."
Freshman,5,"I'm currently a freshmen (online student) majoring in game art and animation, in my second course now. I can say without a doubt that I absolutely love UAT! First of all, the admissions process went fairly smooth, and any issues were quickly taken care of.  UAT staff was very helpful with understanding financial  information as well. I learned so much from my classes so far, not only that, but they're fun too. I don't think I can name one bad experience so far, even a small one. It also continues to offer help to alumni after they get their degree, so definitely worth the money."
Junior,5,"This is a very niche school. It's expensive, but has all of the resources I need and provides the perfect learning environment for what I'm training for."
Freshman,5,This is a very Tech-oriented school with teachers who will respond and answer questions. I'm glad I chose this school
Junior,5,"This school is amazing. I am glad that I have decided to apply here and I got accepted here at this school. I love how everything is accessible 24/7, I like there is small class sizes where the instructors know us by name.  I also love how there live events here from around the world that comes to our school and the engage us to go out and enjoy and part take into this events. I have truly learned a lot in this school and I am still learning a lot."
College Junior,5,Everything is really flexible. If you have some type of emergency your teachers will be understanding and can push back due dates for your homework. It is also easy to drop and add classes if you need to.
College Junior,5,I know that if you graduate here you can come back and take other classes for free. This is a major incentive to graduate even if you end up not wanting to do what your degree is in because you can take classes for other degrees. I also said earlier there is an office to help you find places that are hiring.
College Junior,5,Everything here varies from class to class except for the value of the class. Some of the more specialized classes that specifically deal with your major usually have less people in them than the general ed classes which is a good thing because that means the teacher can give more attention to the individual students than they could with a big class. The courses and professors are all amazing.
College Junior,5,"With the Game Design major it makes you feel like you are on a real developer team. You have to deal with bugs and time constraints when working on projects just like how it works in real life. The teachers have all been a part of various game companies before so they know what they are talking about. It is a lot of work, but really fun. You have to hold yourself accountable and make sure you get your work done or else you can get very behind in the course."
College Sophomore,5,One of the best experiences so far.
College Sophomore,5,Get's in touch with your creativity.
College Sophomore,5,Cyber Security is an up and coming new field that this world needs more people involved in.  I am excited to be part of that world.
College Sophomore,5,Looking forward to attending University of Advanced Technology.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I had to take a medical leave of absence that started a week after classes started in a semester, and they were flexible and refunded my tuition and let me choose when to return.  I was extremely impressed with the flexibility of the administrative staff for accommodating my health issues."
Recent Alumnus,5,"UAT uses a unique virtual classroom system where you can attend live classes remotely via webcam and contribute through chat and webcam all within the same interface as your assignments, readings, syllabi, etc.  It's all very accessible and is by far the most user-friendly, all-inclusive online college system I've used."
Recent Alumnus,5,"There are only a handful of graduate students so it is nice that we are all in the same classes together and I get to know my teachers really well.  There isn't a huge variety of coursework at the graduate level, but it is all very high-level and the instruction is superbly competent."
Recent Alumnus,5,There are substantial career opportunities for UAT graduates because they are trained in such cutting-edge techniques and sciences.  There is also a moderate amount of help from the school in arranging job fairs and so forth to match students with job offers.
Recent Alumnus,5,"The professors are brilliant and interested in helping their students succeed, so every class is filled with technology-assisted, intense learning, and I love every second of it.  I like how much of the work is done online without it feeling at all like an online class.  I live just a few miles from school and often attend class in person, but sometimes I choose to attend from home and the online features of the Canvas system make it a flawless experience.  I can't recommend this school highly enough."
Recent Alumnus,5,"UAT has completely outperformed my expectations.  Every day I leave class more motivated and fascinated than when I entered.  The professors are absolutely top-notch and are many are worldwide experts in their field.  That said, they are also approachable and friendly.  I am so delighted that I chose to get my Master's here, it is the best decision I could have made for myself."
College Sophomore,5,"This school has a variety of options and the teachers are super accommadating! It does have a lot of work going into the classes depending on your major, but it is all worth it! I've made some great friends and have a friendship with some of my teachers. The environment of UAT is calm and amazing for such a small school. I highly recommend it!"
College Student,5,"The process of accruing finances for college/university is, by its nature, excruciating. However, UAT's financial aid department has been very helpful in answering questions and pointing me in the right directions to get things done, and to begin working on scholarship funding. As with my other experiences with UAT, it has been enjoyable and very productive."
College Student,5,"Once more, I haven't actually begun school yet. That won't be until next February. However, I have done a great deal of research, and the admin at UAT have been very forthcoming with answers when I wish to know more about a particular class, its requirements, purpose, and expectations. I do know that UAT does a focused, one class at a time approach, which is the very style of learning I work best with."
College Student,5,"The registration process was extremely simple. Rob Walker helped me to understand any particulars I wasn't entirely sure of, and encouraged me to step out and be bold in what I presented. The whole process was completed over the course of about an hour, and I had an acceptance within a week. I paid my retainer fee, and began the process of getting funding around as UAT waited patiently for my transcripts. Taken in whole, it was an entirely enjoyable experience."
College Student,5,"I'm going to be studying online, so I cannot rate actual on campus resources. However, the admin that I have worked with have been most helpful, and quick to answer any and all questions I have had regarding classes, enrollment, computer requirements, and most anything else I wasn't certain of in the process of enrollment. I would definitely recommend UAT, just based on my current experience, and moving forward."
College Sophomore,5,"UAT has such a friendly atmosphere in my opinion. When we came for a visit over spring break, during my senior year of high school, they were in a meeting, also called in-service. There was a student ambassadors sitting at the front desk that gave us a tour of the school and we met one of the administrators. We had a great talk about the school with her and she answered all of our questions. One of the classes that caught my attention was the Japanese Language classes, and the administrator we were talking to when and got the Japanese Language Professor and we got to meet him. I originallt was going to a different university, but after seeing UAT I was hooked. I did visit the other college a couple of days later but they couldn't compare to UAT."
College Sophomore,5,"The professors are super friendly. They want to help the students as much as possible and provide valuable feedback for them. The variety of courses for the General Education could be better, but as far as degree specific they cover a range of topics! The class sizes are pretty small compared to a normal university."
College Sophomore,5,"UAT is a wonderful college. It is filled with friendly and helpful people. The faculty, staff, and professors are happy to help the students and each other. You also see people smiling and having fun. The campus is small so you get to know a lot of people. Unlikely bigger colleges, the professors know your name and they talk to you outside of class about non-class related topics. Everyone here genuinely cares about education and helping the student find jobs afterwards as well."
College Sophomore,5,It is a little harder for the Game Designers to find job because there is a lot of us. The Career Services people are very friendly and helpful and answer your e-mails or phone calls in a timely manner. They also call students to do a check up on them mid-semester in order to figure out if they are doing okay or if they need help. Once registration opens I usually send and e-mail asking they if they have and recommendations for classes and they got back to me the same day! The alumni network is amazing. Alumni are always coming back to the school to talk to the students and to help out. They do presentations and tell about their time during school and how they got into the industry and what they have been doing since.
College Sophomore,5,There is a great collection of degrees one can study.
College Sophomore,5,There is a great amount of knowledge at your disposal. The most difficult choice you have to make is how to spend your time.
College Sophomore,5,I would recommend this institute to anyone seeking a technology or media degree.
College Sophomore,5,They have excellent job placement opportunities or a cumulative array of Masters programs for those seeking a more masterful degree.
College Sophomore,5,It is quite easy to balance work and school.
College Sophomore,5,The sheer amount of character at this school forms a culture of its own wherein anyone from any background can feel welcomed.
College Sophomore,5,This establishment is one of the few places that offer Video Game design/programming. The employment rate for this field is high and the instructors are very reputable.
College Freshman,5,So far I had a great experience at my school all the staff are friendly along with all my classmates. I couldn't really say what makes my school unique without a bit of research on other schools. And if I could start over I would pick this college again because it was my dream college since 8 or so.
College Freshman,5,I rate my experience so far was a great one I met all my classmate they're all super friendly along with my professor. The workload is quite easy to handle when your not distracted and focused on getting it done.
College Freshman,5,The intranet works flawlessly for me I have not had a single problem yet nor do I think I ever will. Due to it being a technology based school I'm sure the IT there take pride in making sure things run smoothly for us.
Alum,4,"The best years of my life, so far, had to be at the U.A.T., never have I been surrounded by people that shared my interests, and here I could fit in with people that pursed a similar degree for a platform I loved: video games. However, I would have some experience going in, or complete devotion to your classes, because there can be a lot to take in from the start, and you can be quickly lost if you slack. I'd recommend having money and scholarship saved up prior to attending this school so you can enjoy your time there and learn as attended with distraction. The attendees and teachers are down to earth, and it feels very personal like a family compared to a basic community college. Here you are treated as an adult."
Junior,4,"What I like about University of Advancing Technology is the communication among the professors, financial advisors, and the other departments; its fast and they are also willing to help. However, sometimes I have trouble receiving recent grades and the short while that I received none of my credits."
Freshman,4,"This is such a great school for those seeking a degree in the technological field.  UAT makes sure that they help their students in every way possible, even after graduation.  You can go back and audit classes, get help on your resume, and even get help in earning a job.  A wonderful place filled with wonderful opportunities and community."
Junior,4,"Though the portal is not the best, the professors are. This place is more of a fun get together that teaching you things that you need to know. With the amazing professors by your side and a good head on your shoulder, you can get by in this college with flying colors."
Freshman,4,The professors are always on campus to lend a hand if needed. Most of the work is done on an application called canvas so there is little to no paperwork except for notes done in class. The place maybe small but at least it's calm and the people here are really nice to talk to.
Junior,4,"This school is not made for those of the faint of heart not those that don't know exactly what you want in a career. This University doesn't lead you one way or another with picking a field, but expects you to know what field you want and then prepares you for the industry. Very heavy with online content and projects, UAT puts a lot of focus into projects, setting up a professional portfolio, creating innovative projects, and achieving an internship before graduation."
Freshman,4,"This school is great for a tech related career. They have some unique degrees like video game programming, artificial intelligence & robotics. They also have lots of resources to help you build projects related to your degree like 3D printers, robotics lab, and a test bed network environment for hacking. Also you will have the option of taking 3 semesters a year instead of just 2, allowing you to finish your degree faster."
Niche User,4,"(I am currently a senior in high school; however, I am currently enrolled for the fall of 2017 and have toured the campus.) Only 450-500 students are on campus. The professors have actual experience in the field they are teaching and care about the students' education. If you are considering going into technology, I suggest you look into UAT. They have several clubs that the students can participate in. The on-campus cafe is good and reasonable. The dorms have a theater room, game room, two pool tables, one ping pong table, three vending machines, a kitchen, a laundry room, a fitness room, a quiet room on each floor, and there is a grilling area outside. All of these are free to use (except the laundry room; if I remember correctly it is only 25 cents per load) if you are a student who lives in the dorms. Everyone I spoke with was really nice and willing to answer any questions I had.
Check them out: www.uat.edu"
Junior,4,The online program is really nice with 5 week classes and only one-two at a time to focus on. They also provide career services and the prifessors have worked in the industry they are teaching in.
College Junior,4,I can verify that alumni work has been very successful. There have been students who have worked on very famous projects such as the movie Avatar. Their is an office to help you look for internships or places that are hiring nearby. There isn't any reason you shouldn't be able to find something while going here.
College Junior,4,"I love going to school here. The teachers are all friendly and helpful and I learn something new everyday. The homework and projects rely more on you than what you were taught which makes sure you know what you are doing. Most of the students are friendly and we all share in geek culture. I recommend University of Advancing Technology to anyone interested in the movie, game, or robotics industry."
College Sophomore,4,It's a great school for nerds and geeks like me.
College Sophomore,4,Everybody has been extremely helpful and responsive
Recent Alumnus,4,Your graduate advisor will help you sometimes with facilitating networking connections but honestly at the graduate level UAT is kind of lacking in the department of matching students with career opportunities.
College Sophomore,4,I have not attended this school for very long but it has been a good experience so far. Many of the people and staff are friendly and can help me when I have issues with a class or need to take extra time to complete stuff.
College Junior,4,The school for me is just amazing.  I am learning so much with each passing week of each semester.
College Sophomore,4,"There is a range of classes and times. The only class that has been ""in the way"" was a production class. For the specific class you met the two normal days, but then on Fridays you would have to meet from 11:30 in the morning and work until 7 at night."
College Sophomore,4,"There is a diversity as far as ethnics, religion, and politics. There is a huge different with gender though. It is a majority male population at UAT, then there are the females, and we have a transgender community as well! As far as I can tell everyone is pretty accepting. There is also ""cave trolls,"" or people who tend to stay in their room, unless the have class or need to get food."
College Sophomore,4,"I'm really enjoying being in the Game Design degree. There are a lot of friendly people to help you. The workload can get hefty but it is all in good practice. If it wasn't for the professors basing their classes and assignment off of what the industry was really like, then we as students would not be ready for it."
College Sophomore,4,"I've had a great time here! The people are nice, the professors know your name, and some are good friends. The professors genuinely care about the student's education and success! Some of which are from the industry and came to teach upcoming students how it really is out there."
College Freshman,4,"I love the classes they are challenging but usually not too challenging, except that programming class."
College Sophomore,4,The education is around the same cost as most state universities.
College Sophomore,4,Pretty happy so far. Planning on moving out of the dorms into my own place.
College Freshman,4,"Some classes are very easy while others are extremely difficult due to the certain amount of self-teaching that has to go on for you to excel. Professors and other students are very responsive and most of the time, there is no problem grouping up on a project."
College Freshman,4,Many people that come to this school have the same interests and like to do alot of the same things which help us communicate with each other in a clearer way.
College Freshman,4,Everyone is very helpful and attentive with any questions I may have.
College Sophomore,4,"I wish it were harder to attend here, as the weed out undesirables."
College Sophomore,4,On campus there is everything I need to create games which will aid my portfolio.
College Sophomore,4,"There are occasional issues with the internet, but these never last long."
College Freshman,4,"There are a lot of geeks at my school; however, they really create a unique and fun environment."
College Student,4,The computer lab is amazing and offers everything that we need in order to be successful.
College Student,4,Network security is on the cutting edge of technology and the demand for it is sky rocketing.
College Student,4,The faculty at my school have experience in the field in which I am majoring in.
College Sophomore,4,"no athletics, lots of clubs, library is awesome, computer lab is huge"
College Sophomore,4,"close to everything, great facilities"
College Sophomore,4,"small class sizes, very techy"
College Sophomore,4,"lots of internship options, great network security lab to practice skills"
College Sophomore,4,"great variety, wish general ed classes were offered more days/times"
College Sophomore,4,"internship for all, great job placing people
"
College Junior,4,"Every teacher has been completely approachable, some providing home numbers for faster access.  Skype has been a godsend for a few of the teachers as well doing online lectures has been fun actually."
College Junior,4,"The process was simple, the financial aid department seemed to take care of everything but filling out my fafsa and applying for private scholarships."
College Junior,4,"I've had many teachers work around my schedule, even when I was having issues in my life unrelated to academics, they modified the syllabus for me so that though I had to do the same amount of work, it was done in such a way that if my situation made something impossible, it was already compensated for."
College Junior,4,I hope to be able to get others to attend this school.  This is the best experience I've had with colleges.
College Senior,4,Most of the students here at UAT are different in their own ways such as there are other that care about others. Some that are married and care for their kids and families into the student factor in their lives. I have to say their are a lot of people friendly to each other and getting along followed by helping each other in their careers
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors are there when you need to ask a question and they are leninet when it comes to your schedule
Recent Alumnus,4,"It's an excellent school, the expericence you get here will help you down the road"
Recent Alumnus,4,This is an excellent school. I really feel lijke I am learning the ins and outs of the gaming industry.
College Student,4,"I'm going for a dual-bachelors degree. The first degree is Game Design, the second is Game Art & Animation. The classes I am recieving pretty much match my expectations for graduating and immediatly entering the workplace. the curriculum and the facilities all aid to make sure that you arent just educated, but knowledgable and practices in the field when you leave the school."
College Sophomore,4,"Im a computer science major, more specificity game programming. My classes are exactly what i expected. They don't put to much work on you and Its not to hard to understand. The curriculum is great and fun. If you don't like working with computers than you wont find the classes or curriculum fun."
College Sophomore,4,The professors are very involved with the students and are always there to help when they can. It's nice being able to get help when ever you need it. The curriculum is great. They offer a number of classes anyone interested in technology would love and the registration process is simple and easy. It's done online which can be a hassle but it's not super slow and it doesn't close you out of a class.
College Sophomore,4,"See my previous answer. I like the online experience. It can be frustrating at times, but that is mostly due to distance and time zone variables. The professors usually respond to questions and comments within 24 hours, if not less. Like most schools, there are some professors that are much more interested in interaction with the students than others. My experience has been very positive. Registration was pretty simple - they only want to speak to you one time on the phone. The rest of the process is done via email."
College Sophomore,4,Career counsellor connects with you and tries to create a path for you to follow that is set up specifically for you. There are many job listings for each field of study and internships as well.
College Sophomore,4,"Network Security - online. The course load for online is pretty simple - one course at a time and the school picks the order for you. It is not easy, however, to feel like a part of the college while being an online-only student. Job opportunities should be easy. One professor said that currently, there is a zero percent jobless rate in this profession."
College Junior,4,"From day 1, the Career Services people make sure that your courses are going toward your career. I haven't gone through internship selection yet (still a first semester student), but every experience I've had with them so far has been productive and enjoyable."
College Junior,4,"The campus library is small, but surprisingly well stocked for its size. I've never had trouble finding any book I wanted to read. The dorms have a small weight room, but it's rarely used - this is a school entirely populated by geeks (and proud of it). The kitchen in the dorms has all the basic appliances (stove, microwave, oven, sink, crock pot, etc.) and the laundry room has enough washers and dryers to go around. The second floor has a movie room and pool table, both of which are frequently used. The residence aids hold activities about twice a month, including cosplay contests, HvZ, and Nerf wars. 

The campus itself is fairly small, but the courtyard between the dorms and the main building is quite nice. You can see pictures of it on the school website if you want to know more. The only thing to watch out for is the sprinkler system; it goes off at the strangest times. At 9:30 in the morning, when many people are going to class, the sprinklers make it nearly impossible to get from the dorms to the main building without getting soaked."
College Sophomore,4,"I am a Game Art Major, and the classes at UAT can be very demanding, however they can be very fun, I am having a blast. You will learn a lot from the courses in your major that you can take to the actual job you want."
College Freshman,4,"Current or graduated, you can go for help anytime."
College Sophomore,4,You Will Learn – I am a Game art student and just being in the classes and doing the work I have learned a great deal and my skill in drawing as increased a great deal. The workload is not overwhelming but you do have to prioritize your work or it will not get done.
College Sophomore,4,"Art Students – UAT seems to attract a lot of artistic students, and they do some really amazing work. It's a lot of fun to see."
College Sophomore,4,"Online Forums – The UAT website has unregulated online forums, which are a good place for students to discuss things and ask the general student body questions."
Recent Alumnus,2,there are only certain classes that are offered at certain dates and times
Recent Alumnus,2,Seems like there is no real set curriculum or if there is it hasn't been changed in years
College Sophomore,2,"Tuition is insanely high for the online program, almost $5000 a class."
College Senior,2,"UAT tried to come off as a geek friendly place to learn how to make games and technology and whatever, a cheap sales tactic and when the students enroll the whole scene changes, and not for the better. "
College Senior,2,"I've been going to UAT for a few years now online for Game Design. It's certainly not the best university although they'd like to think so. I've had to deal with many b.s. situations over the years with their staff and wannabe ""professors"", which the vast majority of them aren't professors at all and just basically copy and paste course work and material from pre-made ""course shells"". The Student Success Team is a waste of money and time unless they actually get them doing something useful. Dennis E. wrote a good review of UAT back in October of '09 that I recommend reading.
Don't be fooled, they care more about making money than giving you an education, but you can and do get an education while there, don't get me wrong. It could just be better. 
Don't be surprised when you do your work, turn it in and submit it, and it disappear and you get 0's for lots of work. Happens in multiple classes with all the UAT wannabe ""professors"". That's just one of the many BS problems and things they cause or make worse; the only time they try to make the student feel better is if their ass is on the line, which they go out of their way to protect, and damn the students. The ""University"" of ""Advancing Technology"" is just a business out to make as much money as possible. It's shown many times education is a secondary, or even third or fourth concern, if at all. Students with problems and in need of assistance get ignored, forgotten about, or swept under the rug, way too often here."
College Freshman,2,"Be Careful – Two of my years in high school were spend taking online courses. I know from that experience that it is tough and challenging not only from a learning perspective, but from every perspective. You have to be careful with what you do and make sure you put your priorities straight. However, I am comfortable going into online courses for college."
Niche User,2,"Low retention – During my time at UAT, I couldn't help but notice that a vast number of the students don't stick around to finish a degree.  Many couldn't receive finances for the tuition beyond the first year, some left because UAT only had a very limited variety of programs, and still others left because of the strict graduation requirements and timelines.  Perhaps a third of the people I knew migrated away from UAT for one reason or another, so bear this in mind before deciding to go here; you might have difficulty shouldering the costs or staying within the specific boundaries they desire."
College Sophomore,2,"Currently Not Worth It – While I am having a good time learning the basics in my first couple semesters, I have not really gotten into my field of desire yet. The cost is ridiculously high and the return is somewhat weak depending on professors. I hope to see improvement in my later semesters."
Niche User,1,Very expensive with basically zero return for investment. Not as bad as Trump University but close. Cannot recommend.
College Senior,1,"They only help you when it's convenient and easy for them. Getting ignored happens way too often here, especially since we the students are paying their salaries. Frustration and hassle isn't even the beginning of it. "
College Senior,1,"""Some Reviewers have only begun their time at the school and seem to be regurgitating UAT marketing materials where as others have actually completed a degree, been involved with student activities, know the kinds of people the management are, and have even worked in the Student Life department.  I would recommend current students reading this to go to a Student Government meeting and ask to read what some of the Alumni have to say about the school in the Alumni forums.  There's a reason the school keeps the current student population and Alumni population segregated."""
Recent Alumnus,1,"As an online student, I feel like I pay WAY more than what the education is worth. While some of my classes have been incredibly informative, the majority of them require you to read a book and/or do your own research online but charge me 5 grand a semester to post that research on a discussion board. The classes with legitimate labs do a great job of instructing you how to do things and teaching you new information, but unfortunately the majority of my classes have been self-taught through reading assigned books and Google.

Check out the UAT scholarships. I got one my first year, and because of the lack of applicants the next year they extended it to me for my entire attendance the next 4 years. Definitely helpful"
College Senior,1,"It may just be the way I learn, but I've never been able to get anything out of the online courses and generally end up dropping them mid-semester.  Not enough access to teachers, basically taking the class on your own with no meaningful interaction with other students; difficult to get feedback on assignments, let alone in a timely fashion."

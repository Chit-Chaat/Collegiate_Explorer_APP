Sophomore,5,"I'm currently on my second year here at Sam Houston State University and so far I'm liking it, I was a bit hesitant on coming to this university as it is 6 hours away from home, but in the end I ended up liking the place and I have already developed a sense of home here at Sam. The school is great and campus is nice. There is a sense of security all across the campus. With events happening almost every month, there is never a dull moment here at Sam Houston State University."

Sophomore,5,"I love Sam Houston overall it is an amazing school. I've met so many different people and seen so many organizations, this school is more like a family. The campus it's self (although having lots of hills) is beautiful overall. The Athletics at Sam are unmatched as well from regular basketball games to the ""battle of the piney woods"" every game is always full of excitement.

Junior,5,I took all my courses for my second semester online during half the semester due to covid-19. I liked that professor had the lectures recorded and uploaded for the students who couldn't attend zoom meetings or just wanted to refer back. I like how they let you know in advanced when things were due and that if you had any questions about the assignments then you could email them and they would respond as soon as they could.
Senior,5,"All of my online classes have been excellent. The teachers really strive to assist students who are taking online classes, to make sure they get the best information and support."

Senior,5,"Like all colleges we went to on-line learning for the rest of Spring and all of Summer  because of the pandemic.  I have been in Summer school and it has been going very well.  I was concerned about doing on-line but my professors have made it really easy to adapt.  They have been supportive with instructions on getting all of my assignments in on time.  I would recommend on-line to everyone, even though I miss the interaction with people when going to the campus."

Junior,5,"My online learning experience with Sam Houston State University has been like none other. Professors are there to do their best and present learning materials in multiple formats such as through prerecorded videos, textbook questions and solutions for extra practice, written notes as well as fill in the blank notes, and even scheduled video calls with your professor could be made to help. Truly the best online education I received."

You are certainly getting an amazing education here and amazing opportunities will present themselves if you put in the work."
Sophomore,5,"I loved everything about SHSU, I had an amazing first year of college and I wouldn't trade it for anything. The only thing I would change is huntsville the city. I think it has alot of potential to grow bigger and have more things to do and also I think about sam I would have loved to see the building projects and renovations on things go alot faster because it felt like they were working on it way before I even attended the university and didn't finish untill after the corona virus hit at the end of the school year."
Junior,5,"I loved living on campus. It’s a great experience. The small town is nice because everything is close by. There’s a lot of fun things to do. The walking on campus can get tiresome because of the hills, but it’s a beautiful campus."

It's a joy to walk through campus and even to sit on campus during the evening because it is very tranquil."
Junior,5,"Sam Houston is a great school. I have attended for a year and I am in love with it. It's such a great environment and there is help everywhere you will never feel stuck somewhere in Sam there is someone there willing to give you and answer to help with any problem. Also, Sam Houston has grown a lot Huntsville went from being this small town into a place filled with young college students driven to do great things the town is growing and so is everyone around it. There is over 18000 students from undergraduate to doctoral it a very looked over school but it is so great the fact that it isn't as big as others makes you feel like you are not just another student."
Niche User,5,"I am a high school senior of Cypress Springs High School that is planning to go to Sam Houston State University, and the last time I had experienced my future college was at a tour.

Sophomore,5,I like the diversity of the students at Sam Houston. I also like the easiness of navigating the campus.
Niche User,5,This is my dream college. They have all the resources I need to become successful and I still have time to be social.
Junior,5,"My experience at Sam Houston State University has been nothing short of astonishing. Coming from the lower income part  of my hometown, I was was not exposed to much diversity.  I was surrounded by individuals who shared similar cultural, societal, and economic characteristics  as my family and I. Looking back now, it was as though I was raised with blinders on, incapable of  knowing nor experiencing anything outside of my cultural norms. Sam Houston has done an amazing job at embracing as well as celebrating  the variety of  cultures  that make up their student body. In my first year at Sam I have came in contact with Three times as many people with different lifestyles and traditions than I have in my entire young adult life. There is such a great pool of personality’s from student and staff that embrace you with open arms."
Freshman,5,I absolutely loved the togetherness on and off campus. The professors are focused and caring with everyone. The staff really does care about the success of each student.
Junior,5,"I like Sam Houston University because it is a great small university and very affordable. The experiences and academics their are great. I enjoy the campus setting. I am in the nursing program, and they have a very great and competitive program. I would like to see some changes in the dinning halls and the food they provide. The Rec center should be enlarged because their are too many students for just one center."
Freshman,5,Sam Houston criminal justice program is awesome and the best in the nation. It’s a very prestigious for its criminal justice program.
Sophomore,5,"Sam Houston State University is an excellent learning environment that offers both a fun and hands on experience.  I am myself am a kinesiology major there and will be a junior this coming fall.  In my time there, I have already made a number of friends and peers who also have a passion for their studies as I do.  The professors and the faculty all care about their students and provide aid for their students in any way that they can .  Personally, I have been able to meet, visit, and speak to all of the faculty in the kinesiology department.  Everytime that I go to talk with them, they are always eager to offer their services and make sure that the students are able to succeed.  Sam Houston State University truly portrays the spirit of ""The Measure of a Life is Its Service."""
Niche User,5,Great campus! looking forward to attending in the fall of 2020.Sam Houston State University stood out from the rest of the universitys to me because of the value you get for the reasonable price.
Sophomore,5,Sam Houston is a very welcoming and laid back environment that has something to offer for everyone. If you’re here for strictly an education or ready for that “college experience” you’ll find what you’ll looking for here.
Freshman,5,"i loved the campus and the way it looked, my clinic with the drill team went well and im really excited to attend the coming years"
Freshman,5,"Since the first time I toured the campus it felt like home.  Everyone is very friendly, answered all of my questions and if I got lost, I was pointed in the right direction. 
As a Freshmen, I love all of my classes, have a great respect for my professors and the classwork is intense at times, but love to learn.
Getting involved in the school, clubs, attending games and making friends has truly been fantastic.
Sam has a small town feel, just like home."
Freshman,5,"Sam Houston State University has professional friendly teachers that want to help you succeed. The programs at SHSU are very diverse with tracks to help you achieve your goals. They have an excellent mass communications department, studios, and a study abroad program."
Junior,5,The campus has a  very friendly and helpful staff. As a new member I felt a tad overwhelmed in a new environment. Thanks to Sam Houston State University studying for classes was made easier to smaller class sizes and tutoring opportunities. Not to mention the campus has a beautiful aesthetic and is nice and quiet out in nature.
Freshman,5,I'm currently enrolled here. It is my second semester here. I love the environment and the people here. I joined an organization heere and it has been one of the best experiences I have had.
Sophomore,5,The campus is beautiful. This is my dream school and this is only my first semester here and I think it’s great. My only issue is all of the construction. There’s constantly something else being built or added.
Niche User,5,The overall lifestyle i live at Sam Houston is amazing the people are nice and easy to get along with. The professors are awesome they really understand the students and want them to truly succeed. I would recommend everyone to try and go to SHSU
Freshman,5,"I love being a student at Sam Houston State University. I have been pushed outside of my comfort zone around people who want me to express my true self. The people around the school are so friendly and will always give a smile. The professors are relatable and make you want to show up for class every day. Sometimes it does rain, a lot, but that doesn't keep me from going to school events at school. The events are so fun and they really do want you to feel like you are apart of the school. Underneath all the orange and blue there is so much school pride and love between the students and faculty. Plus lots of free shirts! One thing that can get you through a hard day at Sam is, ""Eat Em Up Kats!"""
Niche User,5,SHSU is a great college for if you want to go to a small but at the same time a big college. This college gives you a number of opportunities as well as it gives you a home like feeling. I wouldn't change a thing about this school it's all around great.
Freshman,5,Sam has a beautiful  campus with an inclusive atmosphere.  Sam is a wonderful campus for those aspiring to be teachers.
Sophomore,5,"It is a great school to be apart of and the student and staff members here are incredible because if you ever need anything, the people here are always nice enough to help each other out no matter if it takes a small time out of their day to do so. Sam Houston is also very proud of its self when it comes academics and just being a bearcat . The only problem I would change is to have a more enthusiastic football team and fans. We do win often but the level of the football team is slightly suppressed compared to the other colleges in Texas."
Freshman,5,"I loved everything about Sam Houston! I was very scared to start at the beginning because I thought it would be a big change for me. I originally lived in Houston, but the change was not bad at all! My peers and roommates made me feel comfortable and welcome I loved it. I especially was thankful for the resources they provide for you. Everywhere you look there's help, all you have to do is ask for it. This was hard for me because I am a very shy person but it helped me definitely for the better."
Niche User,5,i hear this school is the best school is the best for criminal justice and in also hear the school has a solid band and is also well known for dance. I have never attended this school but i have heard great things about this school. I hope that my application will be accepted to this school so that i may experience the wonders of this  school and ultimately graduate with a degree in criminal justice so that i may become a law enforcement officer for the city of houston and protect my community.
Graduate Student,4,I like how Sam Houston university has my major career that involves criminal justice and forensic science .
Sophomore,4,With this semester being a mixture of online and in person it has been very confusing to keep up with and the university wifi isn't the best but since I am living on campus its all I have
Freshman,4,"Currently, SHSU is doing hybrid classes, I quite enjoy this method as the in person is more optional and reserved for additional help. Proffesors are accessible and understanding, it is easy to reach them. This may have to do with the classroom sizes as well, they are small to medium size.Work and attendance is mainly through blackboard, with math classes using edfinity."
Freshman,4,"Sam Houston is known for its criminal justice department, and also has amazing opportunities for biology and agricultural students. The campus is beautiful, feels like hiking through a meadow wonderland on the way to class."
Alum,4,SHSU is a great university for students who want to enjoy a small town as part of their college experience. It is a veteran friendly school and a great place to exceed your own expectations.
Niche User,4,"My only online experience was through the Sam Houston State University website. Besides that, I have not taken any classes online."
Niche User,4,"I love the wide, open campus. The architecture is beautiful. The people there are friendly and nice."
Junior,4,"With the global pandemic, SHSU has really been able to adapt to the online version of classes. With the help of Zoom, my online class was awesome. I was able to focus and participate like a regular in-person class."
Junior,4,"Since being expected into the Nursing program, I have only been able to enjoy the woodlands center building. It is a beautiful facility. The staff is very helpful and willing to go the extra mile to help new students."
Senior,4,The campus is very beautiful. The duck pond is located close by and it is a good place to relax and study. The school charges a lot of fees and it can be expensive.
Senior,4,I love Sam Houston and the diversity it offers. The people that go to school there are all wonderful individuals and work hard to achieve their goals. I had a set back with my course work because I was advised incorrectly. I would like to see more accurate advising and support by student advisers.
Freshman,4,A good school with lots of internship and career opportunities but the financial support isn't the best if you're not already in a financially stable position.
Senior,4,I like Sam Houston State University because of it's size and friendliness of staff and students.  My personality shines when I feel comfortable with my surroundings.  SHSU allowed me this freedom yet it was still only 2 hours from home. This was especially important to me since my first year I was a bit scared and homesick therefor went home a lot.  Now I'm a senior and rarely go home because SHSU feels like my home.
Sophomore,4,"I am very passionate about my school, as a Freshman, I obtained positions on campus that I would have never applied for without the support of professors that I had in my first semester at Sam Houston State University. I intend on leaving a legacy when I graduate and I believe that at SHSU there are many opportunities to do so. Overall, I love my school and the resources that I have had while on campus. On that note, I believe that SHSU is lacking in diversity and campus safety, I believe for the campus to be a safe environment as they claim it needs to feel safe for everyone regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, or otherwise."
Sophomore,4,I really love Sam Houston. The people there are really nice and helpful. the professors really take the time out to make sure you actually understand the concept. everywhere u go there is always someone there to help. you can make friends really easy too.
Graduate Student,4,"Because of the current pandemic and the adjustment to online learning, my professors went out of their way to ensure the lectures would still be delivered and reached out to us to ensure we were safe and doing alright. I missed in-person lectures however I was not lacking during online learning."
Graduate Student,4,"Sam Houston State University has been my life for the last five years and now for two more for graduate school. I loved my classes and my professors, however it is very obvious where the campus' priorities lay. The president of the school allocated money to the sports departments when the chemistry students were working with expired chemicals and old reflux kits for experiments. I wouldn't change anything about my campus except the people responsible for the funding of crucial departments."
Freshman,4,I have not yet had an online learning experience with Sam. Although when school does start I will be hoping to take a class online.
Freshman,4,So far for my experience as an incoming freshman has been amazingly easy and thorough. Sams faculty members are there to help each and every child in need whenever they have questions or concerns regarding anything. The advisors are there to help the process go smooth for incoming freshman. With all the COVID-19 scares going on Sam has done an outstanding job with keeping students informed about what is going on. I highly recommend Sam for anyone looking for a diverse school to attend.
Junior,4,I liked the school's spirit because of the student's organization that would keep students interacted outside of class. Overall on campus student life was amazing.
Junior,4,"The online learning is very easy because of how the teachers have the information organized and accessible, but it does depend on the teachers and how they run their class. All my online classes so far have been very easy and I have passed with A's thanks to these teachers."
Senior,4,"While Sam does have a couple of professors who can be a bit troublesome overall they are a great place to go to learn. They offer many Majors to be able to study in and they get people to teach who have actually done the work you are planning to go into, they also work on building you great connections in class to help you succeed in the future."
Freshman,4,"I have not had much online experience with Sam Houston State University, but they have been polite through emails."
Senior,4,It was a little rocky at first but I made it. The professor were very understanding when I had any issues or questions.
Junior,4,"Coming from small town, I absolutely love this campus and Huntsville. The campus is a perfect size, its clean, and I never meet a stranger in my classes. I cannot speak for every major and every professor, but for the most part the professors are very friendly and eager to help. The class sizes are very reasonable and the professors really get to know you. My two years here i would have immediately said the parking is terrible and there is not a lot to do on campus, however that is changing very quickly. There is always something being added/renovated on campus. Yes, construction is annoying, but the campus is continuing modifications by the year (including a parking garage and more on-campus dining!). Overall, I enjoy my time here and I would not trade it for anything else."
Junior,4,"Great campus, perfect size and great community. Academics are fantastic. ISam Houston State University is located in Hunstville Texas which is only an hour away from my home town which makes coming home on the weekends easier. Lots of student organizations to join on campus, everyone is super friendly."
Senior,4,"Great school, could use some stronger school spirit. Also needs improvement on obvious misconduct happening on/off campus by its students."
Freshman,4,"I've only been attending Sam Houston for about a year as I am entering my sophmore year. I can honestly say I love this school with my whole heart. In fact, the whole reason why I chose Sam Houston to be the school I studied at was because of the home-like feel that it had."
Junior,4,"Overall I think that this is a great school, you meet great professors and students. I think there is a little bit of everything in this school, many clubs and programs to choose from. The only downside is that it can get quite expensive especially for online students, there is also limited space for us online students. It can get in the way of choosing your desire schedule."
Sophomore,4,"Sam Houston is a great school to go to. The teachers really care about what they are tracking you and are very passionate about their class. Their may be hills but that just makes it even better if you want to exercise. If you want a relaxing campus vibe, SHSU is where you want to be."
Sophomore,4,I am a music major so my classes being online were really something not ordinary. But I really thought that my professors really pulled through and helped us grasp the material from afar.
Senior,4,I like the professors here & the support from them. I wish famous was more accessible for those with disabilities.
Senior,4,I took 3 online classes during the 4 yrs I was at SHSU. All professors were very organized and clear !
Junior,4,"Sam Houston was really good to me, I just wish they would offer more things available for students to engage in."
Junior,4,"It was pretty good for the most part, had to keep up with it though. You honestly have to teach yourself the work."
Junior,4,"My learning experience was hard at the beginning, but I feel that my professors were diligent at answering questions and helping. The few times that I contacted support for help, they were professional and fast."
Junior,4,My time at Sam Houston has been so far enjoyable. My professors are great and I feel their love for what they are teaching. I feel that there needs to be an improvement in the advisory department.
Junior,4,"it's been good, Sam Houston has helped out their students all they can. Blackboard worked smoothly and i was able still to do my work without having difficulties."
Senior,4,"I personally am a face-to-face type learner more than online but the online program here is very good. If you have any issues you can call IT and they will help you no matter what the issue is, the professors do their best to make sure you understand their lectures that way you pass the class while retaining the knowledge for later in life."
Junior,4,"Sam Houston is a great school. I have attended for a year and I am in love with it. It's such a great environment and there is help everywhere you will never feel stuck somewhere in Sam there is someone there willing to give you and answer to help with any problem. Also, Sam Houston has grown a lot Huntsville went from being this small town into a place filled with young college students driven to do great things the town is growing and so is everyone around it. There is over 18000 students from undergraduate to doctoral it a very looked over school but it is so great the fact that it isn't as big as others makes you feel like you are not just another student."
Sophomore,4,"I like the community vibes that students and professors give off. I would only change the parking situation. The buildings are up to date and the professors are semi young and they know how us students, feel about school work so they take it slow for us."
Freshman,4,SHSU is an all-around good school to attend. The dorms are above average compared to other univeristies in Texas. It is easy to move around campus since most of it is connected.
Freshman,4,"After living in Washington DC while serving in the Marine Corps, I moved to Huntsville to attend SHSU. Upon arriving and starting college in Huntsville at SHSU I do not regret the change in my life. I did not think I would be suited for college or that I would integrate into the civilian life very easily. However, the staff and students for the most part are very welcoming and humble thus making the transition somewhat easy. The experience I had this past year was one I will not soon forget."
Freshman,4,I believe Sam Houston is one of the best universities in Texas. It is most established and well-known with the top-notch professor.
Junior,4,I like how my professors have been so willing to go the extra mile to help out their students. I do not like all the construction on campus but I know the end result will be worth it.
Junior,4,"Sam Houston is an overall good school, professors are always willing to help students out. All the staff is helpful when needed. I enjoy being a part of the Bearkat family."
Freshman,4,"I loved the overall feeling at Sam Houston State University! Everyone was so welcoming and accepting to new students, they were also helpful. I was quite nervous to be going to college on my own but being able to have such a great school to go to made the process a lot easier"
Niche User,4,I am just a prospective student going to go Sam Houston in the Fall 2020 year. I have no experience with Sam Houston at this very moment except for the campus tours I have gone on.
Freshman,4,"Sam Houston, one of Texas's most diverse universities. Every student feels invited and has excellent programs for both majors and minors. On-campus, people are socializing with new newcomers and love helping each other. There's always something to do on campus after class with its plaza, parks, museum, kat klub, etc. The school is still being added to; everything keeps getting something new. The dorms are great and lovely to live in. This university is excellent for all students, and with its new art building, all the art students are loving it."
Freshman,4,I want to major in Criminal Justice so that i can become a crime scene investigator. When researching colleges and talking to people I learned that Sam Houston had one of the largest and most prestigious criminal justice programs in the country. When I first went on a tour of Sam Houston State I knew it was the perfect school for me. The campus is gorgeous. It's the perfect size for me. It's not so big that you feel like a number instead of a student. The class sizes are small so you get to connect with your professors and classmates easily. Sam has such a great student environment. Everyone is so nice and it's really easy to get to know people and make new friends. The staff have helped me with anything I didn't understand and they are super nice.  Another reason I like Sam is all the campus opportunities for clubs and organizations.
Junior,4,"One of the main reasons I transferred to Sam Houston State University apart from its outstanding academic standing was its wide range of diversity. Sam Houston, unlike my previous college; Houston Community College; there is more diversity. There are student activities where students from different countries showcase notable aspects of their ethnicities, like clothes and food. These interactions with different people made me open up and socialize a lot more; this helped me get rid of my fear of public speaking and helped me communicate more effectively.
I have been able to learn a lot through Sam Houston State University, I have become more out-spoken, and generally more learned after various aspects of life.There is nothing particularly I would like to see change about the school; Sam Houston is a great school that I would definitely recommend to new students trying to apply for colleges as freshmen and even transfer students."
Junior,4,"I think that Sam Houston State University is a great school to go to. They have a nice looking campus with lots of history, and many years of success. I would highly recommend this school to those looking to apply."
Junior,4,"I am currently enrolled in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Program at SHSU.  So far, I am enjoying my time at SHSU.  Nursing school is hard in general but the nursing program at SHSU gives me the tools that I need to succeed."
Sophomore,4,"Sam Houston State has given me a lot of opportunities to showcase my academic abilities. I’ve also learned what I’m capable of by professors pushing me. Since I’m a commuter I don’t spend as much time on campus as others do; however, I would like to see someplace where the commuters could go to spend time in between classes. We have the library but I think a lounge would beneficial."
Senior,4,"Sam Houston State University is a good school. Students are able to connect with each other while also gaining a good education. For the most part the campus's social scene is not that big; their are school sanctioned events held, but not raging parties. 
As for the education and professors, most are relatively easy courses, with helpful professors. Some of the online courses are more difficult than the in-person courses. The living situations and food is a bit expensive.  The food lines can be very long  during the peak eating hours, but otherwise the school has the typical restaurants found in a small town."
Junior,4,"The campus is good, people are nice, professors are knowledgeable and helpful, and classes are not unnecessarily difficult. I don't like the parking situation on campus as there is no free parking anywhere."
Freshman,4,I really enjoy Sam. The campus is very easy to get around.  People are nice.  Great profs.  My classes have been very informative and enjoyable.  I want to pursue my computer animation degree here so I can be a video game designer.  I love the area as it is close to home.
Alum,4,"Sam Houston State is one of the best, if not THE best, universities in the state for criminal justice majors. Most of the more recent research into the field comes from professors and Phd students at the school. It is also an excellent choice for those wishing to go into teaching as a career."
Sophomore,4,"So far I have found Sam Houston State to be a great university. I chose to attend Sam Houston because of the great things I heard about the criminal justice department. So far I have found the criminal justice department to live up to my expectations. All of my professors have been accommodating to their students. If you have a problem they are willing to work with you to get it solved. Also, my professors have made themselves available to their students outside of the classroom.  One thing nonschool related that I like about the university is the size of the campus. I have enough chance of running into one person I know as I do with seeing someone new. I have not yet been at the school long enough to have noticed something I would like to change."
Senior,4,"Overall, the school offers plenty of resources to help you with pretty much anything you can think of. This can include financial aid, payments, class schedules, and much more. However, there could be improvement on hospitality and customer service for employees who answer the phone."
Graduate Student,2,"I havent taken any online experience with Sam yet because I haven't graduated from high school yet , but I graduate this year"
Senior,2,"I'm a non-traditional student in the final stretch of my BS in Criminal Justice. I have just two classes to take this last semester to graduate in December. My tuition alone is $3,000 for ""two classes"". Students can't utilize any of the campus facilities we're being charged fees to maintain, yet the fees aren't waived during this pandemic to reduce the financial burden for students.  Also though, SHSU alumni donated over a million dollars to help students in need but the information that such help even existed was deliberately hidden from many students such as myself. The application information could only be discovered on SHSU's website under ""COVID updates"" rather than made available to ALL students through the SHSU email system.  ALL students should have been able to apply fairly. Yet, students were deliberately not made aware to reduce the number of applications submitted.  I think this school lacks integrity. I'm quite disappointed."
Sophomore,2,I disliked the online learning process with SHSU solely because I am a visual learner and it was hard to get in contact with my professors. I actually had to drop my Stats. class because I could not learn it through a computer screen and I also worked so I couldn't do the short zoom meetings.
Sophomore,2,"I never wanted to take online classes but due to covid-19 all the classes had to go online. When it switched over to online, I really hated because it was difficult for me to learn that way, but most teachers took the time out to help."
Graduate Student,2,"Want a place to park for class? Good luck with that because this school sells more passes than spots and they build ""art"" building in lieu of them. You can tell the staff is low budget and despite what your opinion is about a teacher this school won't get rid of them because they can't afford it. I would give this review one star if it was not for me joining a sorority because it made my experience bearable considering they hate greek life even though we are the reason this school gets great reviews and appraisal. This school is lacking and I'm not surprised the student population is still rather low compared to other campuses because it's not worth the time or money. I wish I would have known this before transferring here because I did not feel respected by the staff, the dean doesn't even care for students rather than the new ""bowling alley"" and amenities they are building when it should be for parking spaces. Thank god I am a graduate and that this review is over."
College Freshman,2,"School spirit is really really bad, theres barely any."
College Sophomore,2,"When my roommate had his friend (not in college) live with us for 6 months, the RA refused to help me get rid of him."
College Sophomore,2,Not very many students participate in sporting events (low student turnout).
College Senior,2,"Living on campus is more expensive than renting an apartment year round. You cannot stay in your dorm over three day weekends or other holidays without paying extra. I stayed in Estill Hall and we had a Roach and rat problem. The rooms never felt clean. The university currently requires freshmen to live in the dorms, but there is no space for upperclassmen to use the dorms if they needed to. One of my friends was offered $500 to move off campus. Personally, my student loans would not cover the cost of living in a dorm."
College Senior,2,"Practically nobody attends the football games unless an organization they are a member of requires them. This is Texas and football is a huge part of our culture. Many people drive to College Station to go to the TAMU games instead. As a club sports member, we must jump through hoops with minimal faculty support in order to compete."
College Sophomore,2,I have been accosted on campus in an area with no lighting.
College Freshman,2,"I lived in Lone Star Hall.Found bedbugs in my second week of school.Contacted resident life and they brushed it aside,took 6 extermination to take care of it.Staff were rude,still very upset by the service I get paying for the overpriced dorm.Other than that,the location is convenient,I like the layout of the room,and the size of the bathroom."
College Freshman,2,I do not get involved in any event that involves drinking or drugs but most talks I hear about parties always include drinking.
College Freshman,2,"I do not enjoy the Greek Life here on campus. I see them as the typical ""buy your friends"" types of groups. Some are nice but others come off as snobbish and cliquey. One in particular has such a bad reputation, women know to stay away due to the group's tendency to drug and take advantage of women."
College Freshman,2,They don't really have a lot of job internships for prospects except criminal justice and law
College Freshman,2,Nobody really cares for the frats on campus because they don't matter. People really just live to party at Sam Houston.
College Senior,2,While it may not be open for all to see there is a huge drug problem here.
College Senior,2,"Cheap liquor and beer, but filled with ill intentioned people and LOTS of drugs."
College Senior,2,Compared to other universities there is nothing here.
College Senior,2,Not worth the cost of education.
College Senior,2,"If I could go back, I'd choose another school."
College Senior,2,"SHSU is against Greeks, especially IFC chapters."
College Senior,2,"SHSU is concerned with money, not its' students."
College Senior,2,"If I wasn't so close to graduating, I would leave."
College Sophomore,2,"There are so many fraternities and sororities on campus, it's annoying. Being surrounded by people in Greek life bothers me because they are always partying."
College Sophomore,2,"I have lived in the dorm for a year and a half, and trying to get out because of a recent condition has been a nightmare. They won't work with you on hardly anything and love to fine people. Not very understanding on anything. When I say fines, they fine $100 for propping your door open. Little things like that make it ridiculous."
College Sophomore,2,"Personally, I had a very rough year because of my own personal circumstances. I'm from Houston and I wish I would have gone to a school in a major city with a similar lifestyle/pace."
College Freshman,2,"My Dad recently lost his job and my mother is the only one bringing income into the house hold; she is also going to college and working a full time job. They told me there was nothing they could do, which is ridiculous. There could have been more they could have done to help take the financial load off of my mother."
College Freshman,2,"The fact that we have to pay some much for low quality food makes angry. Old main is just despicable. I understand we have bearcat bucks we can use all over campus, if we don't want the food provided. I paid for the meal plan and I should not have to rely on the bucks to get good food. I literally ate Moe's my majority of my freshman year. I hope my college see's this and fixes their food preparations."
College Sophomore,2,Don't try to help students to get more free money nor do they advertise to help students know it's free money. Very secretive!
College Sophomore,2,"Theres no partying here at SHSU, the majority of students either hit up the pool and thats about it, Oh and a lot of people commute from houston to SHSU so Partying happens at College Station, or Houston"
College Sophomore,2,"You maybe want to learn how to cook or else you'll get the freshman 30 special. If you were to dare compare aTm off campus food section to us you'd laugh at how bad ours is. 24/7 Food selections are few and scarce, Whataburger, Jack n the box, and Two Mcdonalds are your only options, McDonalds by the Fox only accepts cash after midnight and their staff decides to make breakfast at 3am unlike others. 

Regular Restaurants suck, if you like crockerbarrel you'll love the bland selection of home foods from farmhouse 

Asian star is nice i consider it the hidden gem of Huntsville"
College Sophomore,2,"If you're in greek life (IFC or Panhellenic will not have fun, but SHSU loves minorities so Multicultural you're okay) or plan to be watch out don't be super crazy."
College Sophomore,2,"Food on campus is okay, however I feel like SHSU is accepting more students than they should. Massive Lines Plague Old Main, and Moes, especially the LSC. Old Main sometimes seems like they saved the cuttings and left overs from yesterday and decided to make it a dinner. Be prepared to wait at least 30 minutes in line to get your food during noon and dinner at Old Main."
College Sophomore,2,They mainly shut down different events held by the same group of minorities.
College Freshman,2,"As far as the FAFSA is concerned, they really don't give you money based on your financial need. I needed more than what they gave me, but because my parents make over $70, 000 a year, I didn't get what I needed. But my parents don't just have me as their only child. They have my two sisters who are in school and need shoes, clothes, and supplies for school, and on top of that, they live in California where the cost of living is significantly higher than Texas. My parents cannot afford to pay for my college, AND adequately support my siblings in school as well. They need to rework their idea of ""financial need."""
College Sophomore,2,"Not many options, have to drive to another town to get better options"
College Sophomore,2,Could be better. Some on campus housing is out dated.
College Freshman,2,The dorm life is so strict that you honestly cannot do anything without being fined or charged money.
College Freshman,2,"Everyone parties all the time and comes to class drunk or hung over. It is more than just a typical party school, I believe the kids just come here to get drunk. It has a very negative impact on the school."
College Freshman,2,Places close really early. Most places are more than $10.
College Freshman,2,Old main is awful. Not a lot of options anywhere. Once you use your meal you can't have it back to go some where else.
College Junior,2,"We definitely need more variety around here, a chick-fil-a would be wonderful."
College Freshman,2,There are not many options for food within walking distance of campus. The few that are here are okay but there is definitely a need for new restaurants around campus.
College Freshman,2,"Scholarships, at least the large ones, are almost entirely ""need"" based and not merit based.  With a twin and an older brother only two years older than me, I'm drawn thin despite my dad making a good amount.  While my ACT scores were better than my twin's, she received a large merit scholarship from her school; I received nothing.  All of my scholarships are private, one-time awards, but the tuition is low enough that I can afford to go to school here as long as I get a handful of private scholarships.

That being said, scholarX is an easy application to use, and there are a handful of small merit scholarships (think $200-500)."
College Freshman,2,The financial aid on the school's behalf is very slow. But I wasn't complaining much because it is a lot of students. Though they don't inform you as well.
College Junior,2,I've had trouble receiving the amount of scholarship money I needed.
College Freshman,2,The people give no remorse and they really just don't care.
College Sophomore,2,"For a theatre major, I have to seek my own internships. The theatre department only offers internships to its musical theatre majors. I have concerns finding internships because of my disappointing training at Sam and having to go up against students who study at reputable schools."
College Sophomore,2,The Greeks are not very active in philanthropic events. They raise money to keep up appearances but for the most part it's a means of making friends and drinking.
College Freshman,2,I really thought I would qualify for more aide and scholarships.  It has been a real financial struggle.
College Freshman,2,"Not much to do. Everyone is the same. There's not much cultural diversity, it being such a small stereotypical town in Texas. It's easy to feel left out if you're not white, religious, or in a fraternity/sorority."
College Freshman,2,"Financial aid is a pain, I don't always get the help I would think I should get but they try their hardest to help."
College Freshman,2,I had the money! Then my money wasn't there! When mi got my scholarship I lost some of my financial aid! It was kick in tthe butt
College Junior,2,"Since Huntsville is a small town, there are never really any parties besides the ones the campus puts on."
College Junior,2,I wouldn't live there. I specifically transferred here with a degree so I wouldn't have to live in those outdated dorms.
College Senior,2,Not much to do but school and sports.
Recent Alumnus,2,The few bars are subpar.
Recent Alumnus,2,Huntsville is not pedestrian friendly. There is nothing to do either.
College Sophomore,2,"Takes forever, however the staff on campus are super helpful and know how to legal submit things, sucks if your parents make above a certain amount because you will hardly qualify for anything."
Freshman,1,"Never took online classes, I transfered before this COVID mess took place, and I thank god I transfered"
Freshman,1,"I’ll say this. Sam Houston has the upmost worst faculty I’ve ever seen in my life at an institution, my high school did a better job than these people. First things first their “Financial Aid” absolutely sucks, they don’t care about you or your situation. If you’re gonna go to SHSU I suggest you start saving because it’s not worth your time dealing with the terrible and RUDE staff at the Financial aid building."
Sophomore,1,I wouldn't say i took normal online classes like on zoom since the COVID-19 pandemic. My teachers just sent us powerpoints and but it wouldn't really go into depth.
Junior,1,"Spending 100k plus on higher education requires thought and research. Do your research because the support in admissions is not there to help navigate you in any fashion. Academic advisors cancel without reason and change departments at whim. The students are the best part of this small state school. They graduate in spite of the faculty not because of them. Sam Houston does not have a very bountiful job outreach beyond the prison system in Huntsville. Be prepared to find your own internship and job search by yourself. This University is the perfect example of why you should work hard in high school, you don't want this to be your best option."
Junior,1,"every next semester, I regret coming to this dump. Th administration doesn't care about the students AT ALL."
Sophomore,1,I absolutely hated my time here. Every single one of the professors here want you to fail. It really sickens me to see such twisted individuals in charge of our higher education and essentially our future. I hope that in the future they find a way to rid this beautiful campus of its ugly hearted instructors.
Sophomore,1,I go to Sam Houston University. I here to study Chemistry. The school is alright a bit secluded and very tight. Sometimes I feel claustrophobic since everything is close but other times I don't mind.
College Junior,1,dorms are far too expensive for the quality you're getting
College Sophomore,1,"It's pricey, small, loud and smelley. There is no one to enforce the rules. Residential Life has very little care or concern for resolving conflict."
College Senior,1,The dorms are like section 8 housing.
College Sophomore,1,its okay could be better
College Sophomore,1,its been okay but i feel like the class and showmanship this school has is deteriorating due to their admission rates
College Freshman,1,financial is not fairly given and is based solely upon first come first serve.
College Freshman,1,No one can give you definite information and usually don't have a clue what they are talking about. Information does not get sent out in time and before you know it there are more fines and dropped classes because they didn't inform you in enough time. It is awful and is a nightmare and a headache. People need to be sending out more information faster.
College Freshman,1,"No one knows what they are doing in financial aid and can't answer basic questions. If you are white, middle class you probably won't get any money."
College Freshman,1,"I was placed in what they call ""the small houses"" my roommate and I have to share our small restroom with pur suitemates. Besides that our room is ridiculously small, and there isn't wireless internet. We also live very far from every main building."
College Sophomore,1,"Dealing with financial aid is a pain at this school. This is my second year, and the same thing that happened last year is happening again this year. They are always saying they can't find something, or that they never received it. After you get your refund is when things get good, but up until then you might want to buy a bottle of Aleve because they're a headache to deal with."
College Senior,1,They do not provide accommodating college student type restaurants.
College Student,1,"My car is a necessity to get me to campus, because I live an hour away.  There is a parking fee I have to pay every year and parking is horrible.  The parking lots need a major renovation to accommodate the growing number or commuters."
College Student,1,"One way to put it, I don't eat much off campus.  If I do I go to sonic, but they are pretty pack right after classes are over on my way to work.  If I get hungry I eat on campus and just pay the extra cost."
College Sophomore,1,I don't live in campus housing but I hear it is very cramped and not all the halls or buildings are great.
College Freshman,1,There are about four gross bars here that all the frat boys and sorority girls hang out at. The cops circulate the places all night trying to bust people for underage drinking and the night seems more based around how you can get away with having fun than actually having fun.
College Freshman,1,One time a cop followed me from my dorm to my friends dorm and questioned me when I got out of my car for absolutely no reason. I have a few friends who have been kicked out of the dorms here for fairly dumb reasons as well.
College Sophomore,1,"It takes forever to get ahold of them. Important documents are often lost  , making the process long , stressful , and harder."
College Freshman,1,"The weather is horrible. The weather app on the phones are not accurate. It can be blazing hot one day and the nest its freezing cold, the weather is bipolar."
College Sophomore,1,We need regular school shuttles
College Senior,1,Parking permit is almost $100 per school year :(
College Student,1,Health center is always booked. You're sick? Good luck. They can't squeeze you in until week after next.
College Freshman,1,"I go here and I hate it. There's little to nothing to do, almost every single person identifies as a christian and a republican with little acceptance of those who are not. The frat boys and sorority girls walk around like they're kings and queens even though the frats don't even have houses and the sorority houses are on campus and therefore cannot host parties. The dining services are awful, residence life is horrible, my advisors are clueless every time I go to them for advice, etc. Everyone leaves on the weekends and there is nothing to do. Occasionally there is a horrible house party that gets busted within the first few hours. People like to go to the bar but the bar is disgusting and dirty. I hate it here and am planning on transferring next semester. Only come here if you like being bored every weekend and being around closed minded individuals who think they're better than you."
College Freshman,1,Very humid and rains almost every single day.
College Senior,1,The parking is not adequate.  I walk to most of my classes to avoid parking issues and tickets.
Recent Alumnus,1,A lot of the students are commuters and parking is always a problem.
College Sophomore,1,Got there 30 min early. NO parking available. Finally found a spot clear across campus and totally missed my first class. They offer a $300 assigned spot in the garage but who has $300??
College Junior,1,I was basically screwed over. I went to this one complex instead of doing a down payment I had to pay full rent for only half a month. They also wouldn't let me move in until everyone else moved in.
College Sophomore,1,"When you are a commuting student like I am, parking is an absolute nightmare. At Sam, you have the option of parking in the closed Parking Garage, which allows you a reserved and guaranteed space, but it costs a lot more than a normal parking tags. Which brings me up to my next point. The price for one of these parking tags is ridiculously high!"
College Sophomore,1,"For a University, Sam Houston State seems to have a lot of students who could care less about their education. I find this attitude particularly ironic, but the generally exhibited contempt for learning from the undergraduate students is explicitly undeniable. When I walk around campus I feel like I'm in Hollywood's depiction of a degenerate High School. The student community seems to be focused on the ""College Experience"" (i.e. parties, alcohol, sex, drugs, etc.) while the professors are pushed over by whining students ""I studied for 12 minutes before the exam.. I deserve an A!!!"" Sam Houston, from what I've seen of it as a student, is full of underachieving fun-seekers. I feel that the quality of the courses at Sam Houston has been lowered by the extremely low expectations of the students."
College Sophomore,1,I'm sure there is people who do drugs but it is not obvious that the students are using drugs none the less on drugs.
Recent Alumnus,1,There is no free parking on campus. If you want to park for free you may be able to find a spot on a street near campus. This requires a fair amount of walking. The permits cost about $75 a semester. There is a parking garage that charges a $1 an hour up to $10.
College Junior,1,"Being in here just one year has given me the opportunity to act just like my mother when it comes to cleaning up everything I see. Most if not all the people who go to this campus has a high school mentality, so expect to clean up after your roomate as well as ward off bugs!"
College Sophomore,1,"Huntsville is not the best city to be in. It's a tiny city composed of mainly middle to low class citizens that don't particularly enjoy the students. There are few activities around the city; two poor quality clubs, mediocre bars, and an unappealing town center. I'll be honest, the only reason i'm here is because of the affordable education. The only upsides to being in Huntsville is that you make good friends with other students, and the prominence of police and prison guards make it a safe atmosphere."
College Sophomore,1,"After 4 semesters at this college someone from the school finally called and tried to help. Really, does it take that long to realize you have a new student in your program?"
College Sophomore,1,"They have never been helpful, worse financial aid office I have every dealt with!!!!!!!!!"
College Sophomore,1,"If you don't arrive early, it is difficult to find a parking space."
College Freshman,1,Greek life here is very secluded. It is hard to communicate from sorority to sorority without being talked about. It is very obvious when sororities and fraternities run the campus. At SHSU status is everything. So being the right frat or sorority can make a world of difference when it comes to opportunities on the campus.
College Freshman,1,"There aren't very many diverse groups at SHSU. The school has the same student seen everyday. For example, I have yet to have a class with an Asian or an Indian. That is mainly because their numbers here are scarce. That is quite problematic for me, because I like working with people of different races. However, that is quite hard to do if you are only experiencing the same people daily."
College Freshman,1,"I received minimal financial aid from SHSU. I applied for many scholarships and did not receive one. I also applied for grants and provided all the required paperwork, but the financial aid office was little to no help. I called them many times and visited the office to see if I was granted any or not, only to be told that they were not sure yet or they did not have that information."
College Freshman,1,"If you are staying on campus there is no need for a car, and if you stay in an apartment most have shuttle that come to the school. The parking at Sam is horrible."
Recent Alumnus,1,Parking sucks. Come early between 7 and 8 or you will be parking a long distance away to walk in. Permits are cheaper than most though. Just wish they would build more parking garages for closer parking options.
Recent Alumnus,1,The parking is terrible here! You should never drive to class. The ratio of students to parking spaces is 300:1. That's not an exaggeration either.
College Junior,1,"Permit costs are ridiculous, fines are even worse. Mind you other students are hired to give you tickets. And there is hardly any space once school has started (if you live off campus)"
College Sophomore,1,"Not Good – If you live on campus, you shouldn't need a car. If you don't, parking can be difficult. Especially in the afternoons/evenings."
College Sophomore,1,"If you're an out-of-state transfer student, such as myself, I suggest getting everything done ASAP. By ASAP, you pretty much need to turn stuff in the day you get it. My wife and I decided to make a move to TX and I applied for the school in mid-May. My last school (Indiana University) managed to take care of all of my needs within 2-3 weeks (acceptance paperwork, aid, etc). Everything at SHSU seems to take forever, with the worst being financial aid. With IU, I simply had to fill out the FAFSA and I got all the aid I needed. SHSU needed extra paperwork that took forever to process. Now with school about to start, my aid won't pay for classes until the day before class, so I had to put all books and other school materials on credit cards. I've made multiple calls to the office and have been given different answers each time. I guess it's good I am getting SOMETHING, but the process could be quicker and smoother. I quit my job to get a second degree I can actually use, and with a child, SHSU sure did give me a scare."
College Junior,1,Parking on campus is mostly for those living on-campus. I know a lot of students who have had to drive around for hours to look for a parking spot if they were later than 10AM. Your best bet would be to walk or rent a parking spot in the garage.
Recent Alumnus,1,"No Alternative for Commuters – There is not available alternative for commuters in surrounding areas such as Woodlands, Conroe, Willis and that puts a bind on those who have to travel sometimes."
Recent Alumnus,1,"A Lot of the Dorms Are Very Old and in Need of Remodeling. My freshman year I lived in a small house on sorority hill. The atmosphere is great because it was an all-girl house and with only 30 rooms it allowed us to really get to know one another.

The security was great. I never had any problems getting into the house. The dorms themselves i feel could have been in better condition. The drawers and closets were too small and some were broken. The bathroom shower was tiny and I could touch the ceiling because it was so low. The furniture in the living room was outdated and our mattresses were extremely squeaky."
College Junior,1,"Needs Work – There is plenty of parking for students, but there is none close to the buildings, unless you are faculty or staff or have a handicapped sticker. They have some pretty petty rules in parking so watch out. It cost $75 dollars for a parking pass to park in this lots for a semester, so that is pretty high (and they rise every year)."
College Senior,1,"It's a Commuter School, What Are You Gonna Do?? SHSU is a commuter school, first and foremost, and most of its student body are from as far afield as Houston, College Station, Navasota and overseas. Needless to say, the parking gets filled up really quickly and early, but for the few hundred or so students who reside in Huntsville it's no problem because all the dorms and student housing are right next to campus."
College Senior,1,"Not Strict at All! We have campus security, but it overall the feeling on campus is that it isn't too strict; if anything, there should be more security, as once a year you hear about a girl being raped/attacked in one of the dorms. For the most part, things are pretty laid back, because most people commute--they go to class and then go back home and on with their lives."
College Senior,1,"You Have to Commute for Decent Options/Variety – There isn't much in town aside for a couple fast food places like McDonalds, Taco Bell, Sonic, and stuff like that. For good variety of eating options, you have to drive at least 15-20 min to the nearest town."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking on campus is completely awful! It takes forever to find a spot, and there needs to be more space for parking."

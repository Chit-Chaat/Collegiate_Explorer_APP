Alum,5,Adapted well in COVID to online learning. Professors are flexible and offer video support along with options to learn at different times.
Alum,5,"Nothing but the best from this medium sized college.  The faculty and staff really cared about me and my success, never felt like just another student. Then with the help of my advisor, I landed my first job within months of graduating.  Great southern small town charm and university professors who care."
Freshman,5,I like the environment at Southeastern. The classes are small enough for the professors to be able to talk to each student one on one. It is extremely easy to get in touch with your professors and they are all very helpful. The students are all nice and welcoming.
Freshman,5,Many of my classes are hybrid classes. This means that one day a week is online. The professors are very caring and helpful with the online tools. I have not had any issues with online learning and it has been a relatively smooth shift to online learning.
Freshman,5,"I love SLU! For the most part, teachers are very easy to work with and want the best for students! I have taken most of my classes online and they are great!"
Junior,5,"I am so blessed to have the opportunity to attend this university. I have waited 20+ years to attend college and earn a degree. Now because of the amazing staff in the Business Dept. I am not only excelling here, but I’m earning 2 degrees!"
Sophomore,5,"My online experience  was very overwhelm if you allow yourself to let assignments slip away, but professors were over all understanding and trying their very best to make students comfortable and learnable."
Sophomore,5,What I like about the Southeastern is the way they are handling things like Covid-19 and making all students understand and work together to protect each  person.
Sophomore,5,Growing up I have always lived very close to Southeastern and I knew that when it came time for me to go to college this s where I wanted to go. Originally I wanted to go here to stay with all my friends but I have met so many new amazing people and they all help me get through every class and break down I have.
Sophomore,5,Online was a huge change for me because I prefer being on campus. Despite the sudden change the staff made sure that all students were prepared in the best ways possible. My School did everything it could to ensure everyone had a smooth transition.
Junior,5,I love how small of a school southeastern is and how majority of the teachers really care about you. This school really wants to see you achieve and be the best person you can be while you are there.
Freshman,5,"Any student looking for a friendly, welcoming environment should definitely consider Southestern. My only complaint is that even the highest merit scholarship covers less than half of the cost of tuition and housing."
Senior,5,"I have taken 2 classes online before this pandemic occurred. I don't entirely remember the classes, but I know that the professors made assignments easy to complete."
Senior,5,My experience has been pretty good so far. Professors are very nice and informative whenever you ask for help. I love the Zoology classes at Southeastern. College has been fun for me for the most part. I would not change anything at this wonderful school.
Senior,5,"Beautiful campus, Excellent teachers, lifelong friends! Going to Southeastern was one of the best decisions I've made. Would definitely recommend."
Senior,5,It was great! All the teachers cared and were very involved with their students. Thanks so much! The on campus organizations made my experience so much fun and the campus was clean and safe.
Freshman,5,It was good. Didn't have any problems. Great work.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Sophomore,5,I enjoyed my online classes. It was very comfortable to work at my own pace and the professors were very understanding and let us work at our own pace.
Sophomore,5,"The online adjustment was really good, every professor I had tried their best to make sure that we adapted to our new reality."
Sophomore,5,"Professors are approachable and actually care about their students , perfect sized school. It offers amazing opportunities career wise to students."
Junior,5,I really enjoy the atmosphere as well as the instructors that I have had the pleasure of attending their class. The instructors are very easy to get along with and really want to see the students succeed.
Junior,5,"The classes that I have taken so far have been online. The instructors have been very awesome when it comes to responding to questions or concerns. I never thought that I would ever be able to do online classes, however, I do like going at my own pace."
Junior,5,"Easy to access and the professors make it fun.  No problems. When we are on the computers, the professors treat it like in a classroom, as in they ask questions to make sure that you are still engaged.  They keep you on your toes so you will actually learn."
Junior,5,"Southeastern has exceeded my expectations.  The college life at the university is filled with things to do.  It may not be a large university, but there are sports and greek life to be involved in.  The university is located in a small town that pretty much caters to the college students.  Lots of restaurants and bars make social time a lot of fun.
Classes are small and there is always time to speak with the professors, you aren't just a number."
Graduate Student,5,More parking lots around campus and more lights at night. The shuttle system is handy and the food options are ok.
Sophomore,5,"They offered an altered grading system after a petition got signed by more than 4,000 students so they do listen."
Junior,5,Southeastern has been a really great experience so far. You can tell that the teachers and the staff really want to see you succeed. They are always there to help or to talk to whenever you need someone.
Junior,5,"Yes i have taken my classes online. The teachers stay on top of checking and responding to all their emails to make sure you are able to complete your work. Some teachers do video chat lessons, notes, or audio files. It has been a really great experience and has been extremely easy to follow along"
Freshman,5,I have loved Southeastern since the first time I went on campus.  I like the smaller campus and small class sizes.  My recruiter has been amazing answering any and all questions I have.  The financial aid department was great working with my mom trying to help figure out how we are going to pay for my college.  The only thing I would change is that accessing departments and people right now is very difficult to to COVID.  I  like to talk to a person when I have a question instead of emailing back and forth waiting for responses.
Freshman,5,"The small campus and class sizes are nice and conducive to learning. I would, however, like to see a broader selection of courses."
Senior,5,This campus has a very relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. I would like some new food to be added just so I would not eat Chick fil a everyday but that is not a big issue. The only negative thing i have to say about SLU is their parking. Besides that I love my school and i have finally found a major where I belong. I love my department.
Senior,5,"I love Southeastern Louisiana University. I have been going here since 2016 and there has never been a dull moment. The professors are always engaged in their work and being helpful in any way they can, they always motivate you to do better, and they are never irrational about their course load. The food you can buy in the Student Union is immaculate. There are so many different kinds of food available to you; plus, the commute from my house is just under 20 minutes."
Niche User,5,Southeastern Louisiana State University is a wonderful campus for students seeking excellence in education at a smaller university campus.
Junior,5,The classes are rather small but it helps to give you more personal time with the teachers.  This helps you to learn the way that you as a student do best.  Almost all the staff is highly friendly.  I feel like I learn my best here.
Sophomore,5,"I like how small the classes are, all professors are very one on one if you need it. The professors really do care about your college success."
Senior,5,"Transferring to Southeastern Louisiana University has been the best decision I have made ever. I love the location that the school is located at. It is green everywhere you see and environmentally friendly initiatives are highly encouraged. The curriculum here was the deciding factor for me to join this school. Most of the classes are project-based which not only provided hands-on learning but prepares me for the real world job environment. The professors in this school genuinely care for the students' success. I cannot thank enough to all my teachers for their help and for creating such a fun and positive environment to learn. Outside of the classroom, I enjoy the fun events most of them hosted by diverse groups of student organizations."
Niche User,5,"It’s great, the campus is kept up with, the professors give constant help regardless of how difficult it may be."
Niche User,5,Southeastern is a place where everyone is nice and outgoing. By me wanting to attend Southeastern Louisiana University I fee that i won't be disappointed.
Sophomore,5,"My experience at Southeastern was an amazing experience. The campus is small which means my class sizes were small as well. The people on the campus were sweet everyone who worked there was sweet. I enjoyed going to Southeastern because even when it came down to your peers, everyone was cool and didn't mind helping each other out. When times became stressful there was people around you that would help lift you up and help you. In this generation, mental health is at an all-time high. Southeastern has so many different outlets that you could go to when your mental health just isn't right. That is only some of the things I love about Southeastern."
Niche User,5,I have visited Southeastern Louisiana University a lot over the last 5 months. My experience is that southeastern is a very diverse facility that accommodates everyone. There is a activity for everyone to participate in. Overall  I would give this college a five star rating and would love to attend this university. Hope to become a lion soon.
Sophomore,5,"Southeastern is a small school, but this is a good thing. It allows for close relationships with your professors and really getting the help in a class when you need it."
Freshman,5,I just finished my first semester as a college student at Southeastern Louisiana University . The experience wasn’t bad the teachers were okay and they not as strict as you would think.
Freshman,5,"I like how involved the staff and students are. The only dislike is that it is all about joining a group or activity and I feel that it is almost forced on you to be involved, and some people such as myself, have other commitments that come first and I am not in college for groups but for my education."
Sophomore,5,I like that they have a bunch of ways to get involved. No matter how you feel they are there to help
Sophomore,5,"Southeastern Louisiana University was my first choice amongst my college options and I love everything about the university. The students on campus are diverse and incredibly friendly. The teachers are incredibly helpful and they engage students regularly. The campus and the dorms are very clean and there's even strategically placed emergency hubs throughout the campus. Whenever a student or faculty member feels unsafe, they can simply push a button and alert the police to their location.  Southeastern Louisiana University has constructed two new dorms that are energy-efficient, modern, and contain new facilities such as a laundry room and game room. The campus has a delicious buffet that any dorm resident can swipe their campus card to get into."
Alum,5,"Southeastern is an overall great college. I received my bachelors in accounting in 3.5 years with the guidance of my undergrad professors. At school, I felt that my opinion mattered and my voice as a student. Professors in the college of business work diligently to help you reach your goal."
Senior,5,They have great programs! It is a very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very very good school.
Niche User,5,"Southeastern when I first visited at a campus tour was absolutely beautiful, had the kindest students and it was super easy to get around the campus and to know everything with their help. I'm already accepted and planning to attend SLU in 2020, can't wait! Absolutely stunning campus and great campus food and dorms."
Sophomore,5,Southeastern is the perfect school for anyone who loves the homey vibe! All professors are nice and willing to help out each student! You are more than just a number at Southeastern!
Freshman,5,Southeastern University is the best university to attend because of the student facility  ratio. The campus is very diverse with people from all over. The parking lot is easy to find somewhere to park and the students there are wonderful.
Niche User,5,Southeastern is a small environment but very welcoming. I like the fact that if you don't have certain supplies instead of going to the store you can go to a cabinet and get many supplies but only once a month I think. I also like that you can ride a trolly around campus instead of walking or driving to class. Overall there was a very great touring experience.
Senior,5,"It’s really a great school. Small, no huge classes. Clean. Textbook rental. I love it. I have been here since 2016 and Southeastern is what you make it. If you just commute or stay in your room, then of course you would think it is a boring school. But this school has so much to offer! Get involved with organizations and clubs on campus. Talk to faculty! You will succeed here."
Alum,5,"I've enjoyed my time at SELU. The town is very safe so I always feel comfortable on campus when I need to study late at night. The school has nice facilities and I've enjoyed my classes. The professors have all seemed to really care about my success in class. The only issues I have with SELU is a problem with parking and dirty bathrooms. Most of the students on campus are commuters, and this leaves the campus with a lack of parking options. Also, certain buildings get less janitorial attention, likely due to budget cuts."
Sophomore,5,Southeastern is a great school. It reminds me of home. The staff and departments are amazing at helping you out when needed. Everyone is friendly and it is like a second family there. There are a lot of clubs and extracurricular activities available to get involved in.
Freshman,5,There are a lot of ways to be active and involved all around campus. They have a lot of fun events that go on.
Freshman,5,"Southeastern gives students multiple ways of study by providing study rooms in the library, and giving activities to students to help them relax and not worry. Communication between students and professors can use a more work by giving teachers longer office hours to help students more."
Sophomore,5,I love how many different things they offer for students and how the students are always so excited about just being at southeastern. so many great and friendly people there as well.
Sophomore,5,"Southeastern university has a good classroom setting for honors and upper level classes, they also have a good food plan for students."
Freshman,5,"For those that like more of an intimate environment, Southeastern is a great university to be at. The class rooms are very small, and you will most likely have a relationship with your professor. Also, they work with you to make sure your schedule is good to graduate. The cost of attendance is not too high, and they promise to not change the tuition once you have started. While it is small, they do have modern dorms and facilities."
Junior,5,"from the first day that I set food on the campus, I literally felt at home. From the faculty and staff to the student that I would pass every day, everyone was comforting and thoughtful. The Professors can and WILL speak to you one on one whenever you need it. To give you an example, my ENGL 102 Professor talked to me and some other students way after class because she wanted to know if we loved writing and culture as much as she did and we talked for hours and it was wonderful. My experience at Southeastern has been the best and I could not be more proud of where I am and what is MY school. LION UP!"
Niche User,4,"I like the professors, they are willing to listen to you and help you out in any way that they can. The one thing I would change is the fact that it is known for being a party college."
Freshman,4,Southeastern Louisiana University is a great school! Facilities and teachers are great! Online classes are done through a good platform.
Sophomore,4,I haven’t taken on line classes as of yet. My first on line class will be Fall semester 2020. Therefore I can’t really judge the online atmosphere. I do know that online classes are offered as I am scheduled to take 2 this semester and I’m quite eager to see how the term plays out.
Sophomore,4,I’ve wanted to be a lion since I graduated high school in 2000 and now my dream has come true. It was a real integrated experience from the beginning without many complaints. One thing I’d like to see is the availability of more online classes.
Junior,4,"When all of our classes switched to virtual I was nervous about the quality of instruction we would receive. Even though change is hard, we all worked together during the transition and most of my professors made the time online exciting."
Junior,4,"It’s a good school and the campus is beautiful, the students are so nice and I enjoy spending my day there. Although the library stairs could be a bit safer, I broke my leg when I fell down them."
Junior,4,"I have taken some online classes, it was about as much as you could expect from online learning. The notes were comprehensive and we had some great resources but it wasn’t as good as in person classes"
Sophomore,4,I only took classes online once everything happened because of the virus. the teachers seemed very well prepared and I was able to finish my semester with no problems. I am very thankful Southeastern has given me this opportunity
Sophomore,4,I love Southeastern! The campus is beautiful and the teachers along with the staff truly care. The only issue I have with campus is the lack of parking available! You will spend forever just trying to find a parking spot so you better not be running late!
Sophomore,4,"In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, Southeastern effortlessly adapted turning all classes into online for everyone's safety. My professors found effective ways to teach despite having to do it through computers. My Spanish professor for example used google meet to meet with us every Tuesday and Thursday. And along with the MySpainshLab program that was already in place I feel I was able to get a full grasp of the material despite the circumstances."
Sophomore,4,"I liked that the classes are smaller and more close-knit than some larger universities. At Southeastern I am able to learn in a focused environment where I am more than just a face in the crowd to my professors. Southeastern also gives the students on campus plenty of opportunities to get help when they are struggling in certain classes. For example, students taking math classes are given the chance to go to the math lab center and complete homework in there with knowledgeable people nearby that can help you when you need it. SELU is all about giving students every opportunity to succeed and it shows in every aspect of the university. On-campus there are also a lot of opportunities to get involved in clubs and organizations which in turn gives every student the opportunity to become more social and well-rounded. I am not much of a social person but a class for my major required me to join a club. The club pushed me out of my shell. Southeastern pushes me to become a better me daily."
Senior,4,"The online experience depends entirely on the teacher you choose. So far, the online teachers I have had were great. Great communicators and very easy to get along with."
Senior,4,"I will never regret applying to southeastern. Southeastern is a very affordable school, but still has some of the highest rated programs in the state and country. The campus is small and because of that, students are able to easily create a community with each other."
Sophomore,4,"People are nice there. I enjoy the campus size, everything isn't too far away. Though sometimes certain departments, such as housing or the special needs departments may not be as helpful as you would think."
Sophomore,4,Great school with a great campus life. Everyone who works there really cares about the students. LOVE being on campus
Alum,4,"Further into my college career I preferred taking online classes. I’m not very fond of lectures. With online classes, I was able to complete my course work & readings without hours of listening to someone talk."
Sophomore,4,"I attended Southeastern Louisiana University for my freshman year, very nice school and the people are friendly! I was welcomed immediately when I stepped foot on campus for my campus tour and for orientation. They help out with overall resources such as providing free blue books and scan trons, they have free textbooks, to where they can be rented out and no classes are on Fridays! Dr. Crain who is the president of the university, helps his students out in a major way because he knows college is a lot to deal with especially with insufficient funds. Other students are nice and they are there to help when a professor may not be."
Graduate Student,4,"The online platform Moodle is easy to use. Also, the professors are compassionate and understanding. They want you to succeed and learn, not fail. Southeastern feels like home. With COVID we used zoom and Google meet which worked perfectly"
Sophomore,4,Southeastern University's Music Program is phenomenal and I have been opened up to a whole new world of music because of it
Niche User,4,"I really like the family feeling at Southeastern. The university is on the smaller side, but it is not crammed. It is a very comfortable campus and there are many opportunities to get active."
Freshman,4,"Hammond can be pretty sketchy, but the campus is very nice. Everyone is super helpful and nice, and it’s very easy to make friends! I love living in my dorm and all of my classes are fairly small. I’m glad I picked southeastern all in all."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at Southeastern Louisiana has been a very good one.  The people on campus are extremely nice and will help you with what ever you need, wether it is with school work, financial problems or just finding your way around campus."
Freshman,4,"Moderate size campus.  Close to all my classes.  New dorms. Good, unlike food options.  Rental textbooks."
Freshman,4,It was good. The food is only good during the school tours. During exams the food is garbage! Overall this school is a scam!
Junior,4,My overall experience with Southeastern Louisiana University has been very good. Most of my professors have been extremely helpful whenever I have a question or need help with something in a class. My advisers have all been extremely nice and I really feel like they care about me and my future career. The school has many students who commute from home and I also have commuted since my freshman year.  This has given me an interesting college experience because I have never lived on campus. I was home-schooled in high-school and my freshman year being in a class room was different for me. I did however enjoy being in that environment and feel like I adjusted quickly. Overall Southeastern and its faculty has been extremely helpful and I have enjoyed ever minute of my experience.
Junior,4,"Incredibly fun and engaging school! Everyone is there to help you become a better student.

Before I got accepted into any of the schools I had applied for, I was heavily considering attending LSU for the 2019 fall semester. Now that I've been at SLU for a while, I know that SLU is definitely the superior choice!  

Classes and books are cheaper, campus is smaller and easier to navigate, cafeteria food is near-perfect and professors are always ready to talk to you about anything."
Junior,4,"I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of my education here. I was influenced to think it was a blow off school because I live close by, but it has given me amazing opportunities."
Niche User,4,I do not attend Southeastern University yet. I plan to. The campus is nice and they have good nursing and education programs
Junior,4,"I've finished my freshman and sophomore years at Southeastern Louisiana University and am currently heading into my Junior year. Although I've had some poor professors and difficulty with the financial aspect of this university, I've enjoyed getting plugged in through campus organizations such as the BCM and meeting the friends I will have throughout my life. This school also does a great job getting all of its students involved through movie nights, gumbo parties, and other campus activities thrown by the Student Government Association. Overall, I would give this campus a 4/5 because, although it has its downfalls, it's a great and affordable university for people seeking a higher education."
Sophomore,4,"I love southeasterns atmosphere, you never feel out of place and there's always a group you can fit in with. The classes are small so you really can get 1 on 1 time with your teachers."
Junior,4,"Southeastern is a very manageably-sized campus that still manages to meet all student needs without feeling cramped. Students are generally genuinely interested in their subjects of study, making it easier to find study groups that meet your academic needs. There are excellent recreational facilities and a great variety of shops nearby, so after you're done working out, you can drop by University Donuts for a job well done."
Senior,4,"Although tuition is not cheap, compared to what is offered here and what is offered at other schools, it is worth it. Their facilities are not as nice as more expensive schools like LSU, but they are updating and building more dorms and buildings on campus."
Niche User,4,My experience was very spectactular at southeastern. The people were friendly and the environment was lively. Every moment there was an unforgettable moment.
Sophomore,4,"More covered sidewalks would help with all the rain we receive. Also parking is very difficult for freshman commuters. We have a good amount of parking space but it is also filled up with non-students, overflow from upperclassmen, and is almost impossible to park in when graduation ceremonies are ongoing in the UCA. More on campus choices for food would be beneficial as we do not have a lot of options, also on campus food places should accept gift cards because it sucks when they tell you that you cannot use a gift card to their place just because its on campus."
Senior,4,"At Southeastern, my favorite thing is that the professors are willing to go above and beyond for you. They want to see you succeed! My least favorite thing is the 45 minute commute to campus, but that's no fault of theirs. Parking on the other hand, is. I think that is the worst thing about SELU. Commuters are often found circling the parking lots like sharks. They have a variety of food: Subway, Panda Express, Chick-Fil-A, Tacobell, Starbucks, etc. There are multiple places around campus to sit and study or talk with friends. There are strategically placed computer labs to help students, which I found to be helpful multiple times."
Senior,4,"I liked the academic advising and it is basically a counselor advising you what to take in the next semester. They have small class sizes and lower tuition than LSU. However, the teachers in the chemistry department could use some improvement and it is in a small town."
Junior,4,"Southeastern is a very inclusive school. The administration actually knows who you are; I'm not just another number here. I love being involved on campus. I have met some of my best friends, and my girlfriend at Southeastern. Southeastern is a great school. I always feel safe and protected on campus. The parking system needs improvement, but that is the only thing that I can think to improve."
Freshman,4,"What, I love of about Southeastern is the environment of hope and positivity for all students. At times when I was at my worst, staff and faculty at SELU made sure I had the mental and emotional support that I needed. Southeastern is truly my home away from home."
Freshman,4,I truly enjoyed my visit on the campus. Everyone was very friendly and helpful during my admissions process. The campus is beautiful and well kept along with very educated professors. I am looking forward to my new school year at the university and would recommend the campus to others.
Freshman,4,"SELU is a great school to attend as well visit. I'm only a freshman in my second semester and i'm enjoying myself so far when it comes to balancing my schooolwork, my job, and my social life."
Niche User,4,"I've taken online high school classes through Southeastern and everything has been great, they have really helped me and worked with me through most of my classes.I'm a senior in high school, at Holden High School and I plan to attend Southeastern in the Fall of 2019, but I need some scholarships to help me pay for my college, as I work through college to pay for my education."
Junior,4,"Southeastern is a very good school , I love how quiet campus is at most times I enjoy the campus restaurants and the movie theater, we have movie nights often and on campus back to school and semester parties as a whole students and staff definitely knows how to come together and etc. It’s  A very nice wildlife type of camps trees everywhere which I think looks nice ."
Graduate Student,4,It is a small school in small town. I didn't much care for the town but I liked the school. Because of the size of the school the classes were more intimate and the teachers were always looking to help. However the freshman classes are designed to fail you so you will have to take them again and pay the school more money.
Niche User,4,The professors are active and provide helpful feedback. The campus is safe and clean and its location provides access to the nearby city. I have really enjoyed my  interactions with other students and professors on campus.
Sophomore,4,I have been a student of Southeastern Louisiana University for a year and a half now. I love the community feel of the university. It is very easy to get to know people and make friends. There are always events happening to give students a way to interact.
Niche User,4,Southeastern Louisiana University overall is a great school. The purity of the community is a great influence on your personal mood.
Sophomore,4,My overall experience at Southeastern was very good. There is a wide variety of food places to choose from and the campus itself was in close proximity to other restaurants as well as shopping. Most of the classes are relatively easy and the professors are very kind and provide students with resources to pass. I would definitely recommend this college to anyone.
Freshman,4,"I love that southeastern is such a big yet small place. It is so easy to make new friends; because I thought it would be hard to meet new people my freshman year but they literally just walked up to me and now I have an amazing group of friends! The school work is not difficult if you learn what ways of studying help you understand better. The extracurricular activities are always fun things to do if you or your friends are bored in the dorms(plus you meet new people that way also). The cafe food is great and the atmosphere is peaceful. The lunch ladies/men are funny and enjoyable, they really love getting to know you. The teachers vary from student to student. Overall southeastern is an amazing school and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a nice, fun and peaceful university!"
Sophomore,4,Southeastern is an amazing university. Everyone is really nice and the professors will help you as long as you do your part. They should have a few more places for food choices because it is limited . Southeastern is affordable and there are many campus activities to keep you entertained.
Senior,4,Southeastern is a great college for someone who doesn't want an oversized campus. Most of the faculty care about you and your success.
Freshman,4,I am a duel enrolled on campus student who has enjoyed my experience greatly. It has a small university with many good classes and good professors.
Junior,4,"I have learned a lot about psychology and love the program offered at Southeastern. Through studying here, I have gained an amazing job working with children that have ASD. I have a goal to get my masters degree here as well."
Sophomore,4,I like the community feeling of Southeastern. It’s easier to get to know people. There are also several chances to be involved on campus which was awesome for me! I love meeting new people and being involved around my community.
Niche User,4,"I went on to visit Southeastern Louisiana University and I liked it. I viewed the campus with the football coaches, it was amazing."
Senior,4,I began my college Education Degree here in 2015. The teachers have been wonderful and so helpful. The school in general is very welcoming and there are lots of activities always going on in the court yards.
Niche User,4,"Southeastern University is a really great school. The environment is laid back and a lot of the professors there know exactly what they are doing & are open and willing to help students. There's so many wonderful people you can meet there. Some of my best friends in the whole world are friends I met at Southeastern. The campus is beautiful, and the school is constantly making renovations to make the campus look even more amazing. I highly recommend this school to anybody in high school right now or looking to transfer. Go Lions."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at southeastern was a great year, I learned do's and my do not's. In college you will find out your weakness and your strong areas. I learned that you have to remain focus stay on top of all your school work. Don't feel discourage ,and to always find time to spend studying in a quit area. If you do everything that needs to be done you'll have a great year. Southeastern is a great school , they all education and wants every student to be involved an also to attend on campus events"
Junior,4,"Southeastern Louisiana University is a wonderful school for students to work hard but relax at the same time. There are tons of student made clubs for many to enjoy, and many after school activities planned by SLU. The campus is clean and the teachers are personable with their students. It's an overall positive environment to be around!"
Sophomore,4,Southeastern has been a very good school for new students and freshman. they are great about explaining the process and making you feel at home. The campus is generally clean but the bathrooms could use some TLC.  There is a very diverse group of students on campus.
Senior,4,I enjoy the close-knitness of the school - the classroom sizes are small and I feel as if I am not just another number. The professors work with you and really care about you and your future and your success. The only thing I dislike is the parking - they're building so many new buildings and dorms that it feels as if parking is being neglected.
Sophomore,2,"My online experience with SELU has been very rocky. The type of student I am i need to be in person instead of online. Also some of the teachers are not understanding how during this time, students are going through it. I don't like how some classes just consist of just taking test, like no other work or extra credit and some teachers not giving extra credit. We are in a pandemic and students are going through things at home, scared to get sick and struggling with classes as this year of 2020 has not words for it. Such as the numbers of  deaths that has happened this year, just the whole world right now during this year is in shambles."
College Sophomore,2,Steroids for sports players. Uppers for anorexia girls and studying. Alcoholic Greeks. Psychotropics for the mentally ill.
College Sophomore,2,Only for Greeks and sports players. Everyone else is treated different. There is definite favoritism because they bring in the money.
College Sophomore,2,Advising is poor. Registration is always messed up. Bookstore is a disaster. Workload is average in some classes. Part-time professors are added who add ridiculous amounts of work in hopes of a full-time job. Unrealistic.
College Sophomore,2,Registration is always a disaster!
College Sophomore,2,"They make students leave in between semesters for cleaning purposes. I moved into the filthiest, disgusting dorm room ever. It probably had not been cleaned for years. It took 2 days to clean. The toilet was the nastiest one that I ever saw in my life. A gas station at a truck stop would be cleaner than this. Buy a lot of mold cleaner for the toilet. Disgusting. It will take several dust pan empties for the piles of lint and funk on the floor. Several mop passes. Floors are old. They will charge you for other people's damages (Money hungry). Make sure that you fill out the forms on how you found it, but they will deny it and call it average wear and tear. Charge you for it after (Money hungry)."
College Sophomore,2,"Athletes get special treatment. They don't have to earn their degrees. Athletes bring in the money. The college is trying to update, prevent shutting down by budget cuts, and grow. If you are an athlete, it's a good school for you (especially if you need someone to fix your grades). Other people should find another college to attend."
College Sophomore,2,Administration is the worst. Very unorganized. Change rules to fit their needs constantly. Just don't go here. There are so many other colleges that are so much better than this in Louisiana. Students in sports get special treatment and don't have to earn their degrees. Favoritism is practiced at this college.
College Freshman,2,It is safe during the day but not at night I believe adding more lights would help so that the many dark places on campus wouldn't seem so scary and sketchy
College Freshman,2,Would you live in those dorms
College Senior,2,I don't ever have a good experience when I have to apply for financial aid. The people that work the desk for the financial aid office is student workers and they are not helpful at all. I don't like that I can't meet with my financial counselor instead of dealing with the students.
College Junior,2,"I lived in the dorms my freshman year and I personally did not like it, but I do know many that did.  Some of the things I didn't like were the tile floors and it being like a motel (the hallways being outside)."
College Junior,2,"There aren't many convenient restaurants to eat near campus, they are father away from campus which is annoying.  I think there needs to be more options closer to campus."
College Sophomore,2,"The financial aid process is a pain. If you are lucky enough to get in touch with an employee, thank god."
College Freshman,2,"I received aid from a scholarship I had been selected for. The financial aid posted as pending. The day before I started college, I get an email saying that they had messed up the scholarship and took $500 off of my scholarship which left me with $500 more to pay the day before college started. This doesn't look good on their part, and if I hadn't have been able to pay it I believe my classes would gave been cancelled."
College Sophomore,2,The financial aid office at this school is very unorganized and very unhelpful. It took 3 months to get a loan when it should only have taken a week. Also they do not send in your information for tops on time so sometimes that is money that you will not receive
College Sophomore,2,I had trouble getting my loan thru the school and when I finally did they charged me a late fee because I didn't know I was still missing some important items. It was a pain.
College Sophomore,2,"The girls dress in really short shorts and barely there shirts. It is upsetting sometimes. Everybody is pretty talkative and fun, but the way people dress ruins it."
College Sophomore,2,There are too few spots and the parking tickets are outrageous.
Recent Alumnus,2,"There are bars but, to actually party the scenes become repetitive. The same spaces with the same people."
College Senior,2,"The union is the best place to find food, obviously for the variety. I wish there were a few more choices, but overall, I can't complain. It could be a lot worse."
College Sophomore,2,"There are some nice apartments and there are also some rough ones.  There are not tons of options and there should definitely be more choices.  I've seen some nice ones but for their prices, a student could not afford it on just their own income alone."
College Senior,2,"Hammond has two to three landlords that basically own all of this tiny city.  I am living in one of those apartments and they have very slow help when help even comes.  If possible, I would advise to stay on campus seeing as you don't have to bust your butt for rent money and have it all sucked out of you at the beginning of the month.  It is also very easy to find an apartment seeing as this is a tiny college town."
Recent Alumnus,2,"Closer towards downtown Hammond, it is not as safe, but everyone still keeps it clean. I do not see hardly any littering going around. There is something to do in Hammond. There is different things like bowling, party stores, restaurants, mall, movie theatre, etc."
Recent Alumnus,2,"There is availability at certain times of the year, for instance when a lot of students are graduating. The apartments are a little shabby unless your budget can afford one of the nicer ones not so close to campus."
College Junior,2,"Great walk to and from classes. The meal plan should be based on what the students would prefer. From the housing department, they should pair students based on age differences, although they do pair on other preferences."
College Freshman,2,"There are often officers walking arround writing tickets if you are parked in the wrong area or other violations. The police can be called and show up very quickly but unless your being loud and don't listen when the RA warns you to quiet down, you'll be fine. They don't serch your room or person so wouldn't know if you have alcohol unless your careless."
College Freshman,2,the campus is great but the area around it and hammond itself is boring. theres not alot to do and the atmosphere around the campus is not that great
College Freshman,2,Southeastern is definitely not a party school. There are very few bars around. The Buzz is the main one close to campus.
College Sophomore,2,"They vary. The houses are really expensive, but I think they mostly all contain free wi-fi. The apartments are cheap-ish, but not the best quality."
College Senior,2,"At my school Greeks are mostly praised and recognized by each other. The students outside of the Greek life do not make them a big deal at all. Of course we go to their events and parties, but as far as communicating with them on a daiy basis. It is only ""hi and bye"". I do see them do things around the school except have their own picnics and parties for us to attend. Greek life is only something they are proud of and care about, to others, it does not matter. They are not benifiting us outsiders in any type of way."
College Sophomore,2,"Nursing Program – Very difficult, STUDY, make sure your GPA is as high as you can possibly get it"
College Student,2,Bright and Muggy – Typical day at campus is usually sunny so you do not have to worry about the weather being a block factor. Most days we would get some stormy weather but classes would not get canceled.
College Senior,2,"Greek Life and SELU is unfair they way they accept people into their ""clicks"" and should be revised."
College Junior,2,"Honors Housing Is the Way to Go – The housing situation at Southeastern is subpar, but the honors housing is the way to go if possible. Most students commute and choose not to live on campus, but those who do are often met with issues. Room items often break and housing can take forever to fix them! The worst part is that there is no rhyme or reason as to how they choose roommates and you can end up with some awful living arrangements. The one good thing about honors housing, is that there is a convince store in the building and the RA's are often more lenient."
College Freshman,2,"Drinking Is Too Common – Unfortunately, Southeastern Louisiana University is all about partying and drinking. With college night, Greek night, and ladies night, the alcohol abuse is at an all time high.  With so many bars and clubs locally advertising $1.00 Longnecks or $2.00 shots, who can help but be attracted to such events. Unfortunately, at SLU I feel that a large majority of the focus of students has drifted from obtaining degrees to "" What bar are we going out to tonight?"""
College Student,2,"Accessing the Internet in the Library – there are many computers in the library, but when everyone is studying, its wise to bring a laptop and do your work on there. If I'm on the second floor and have only one or two bars in internet service, I cant get any work done."
College Sophomore,2,"The Greeks frequently organize events that are usually fun, with free food and activities. They do not do this often enough, however, and it is usually sororities.  The fraternities do not seem to do much of anything."
College Sophomore,2,"Campus Police Are Slow! On the few occasions I have known the police to have been called, the troublemakers are long gone.  Southeastern Louisiana University has the slowest police response time I have ever seen! The student workers are rude, but the police are very nice, they just don't do anything."
College Sophomore,2,Not Many Discounts – there are not many restaurants that offer student discounts.
Sophomore,1,I really didn't like online learning. Half of the professors were helpful the outer half left us to figure it out on our own.
Junior,1,"Campus security is a joke. Within the first few weeks of the semester my car was broken into, and nothing was done. There was no effort in finding the culprit and no attempt to fix the damages done. I dropped out the university after the incident and they still want me to pay the full tuition after their failure in security measurements. Teachers don't engage you in the learning process or bother to learn your name. The learning system isn't personalized to meet your needs and different learning styles. Most professors will read from a PowerPoint slide and put you to sleep. I don't recommend the university to anyone thinking about attending. There are more affordable alternatives within the state of Louisiana."
Niche User,1,"Discriminates heavily, especially on religion. Even if you claim to be a Christian but don't go to church you wont even get accepted. The most unintelligent people get accepted here as long as your pastor has something good to say about you on your christian character assessment. I'm not sure how a public college gets away with this legally. If you aren't a white christian don't even bother trying to get in. And of you are but actually want a valuable education, look elsewhere."
College Sophomore,1,Country town. No such thing. Take your date to a chain or fast food place.
College Sophomore,1,Thefts are common. Health Center has a lot of complaints about poor service and money charged for services that they fail to provide.
College Sophomore,1,"All about the money, unless you play sports or a Greek!"
College Sophomore,1,"They talk a lot. Have a lot of false promises, but no one goes through with them."
College Sophomore,1,"If you are not Greek, you are a Geek. Nothing to do. Cliques. Outcasts. If you are average and normal, forget this school."
College Sophomore,1,There are not many places to go. Poor city. People in town are poorly educated despite the fact that there is a college in their town. Good for people who like fast food life and boredom.
College Sophomore,1,I'm very sorry that I chose this school. I could have went to any college. Very poor choice on my part.
College Sophomore,1,"No enthusiasm. Teachers are sarcastic. Administration are like robots. Money, athletes, Greeks, etc. are their focus. If you aren't one, don't go here. It's boring and miserable."
College Sophomore,1,Snobs. They get special treatment because they bring money into the college. Everything about this college revolves around money.
College Sophomore,1,"The parking department is seriously the worst department on campus. The officers are referred to as ""parking nazis"" and will ticket you for violating the most ludicrous regulation. The good news is you can park anywhere after 4pm and on Fridays, but I have witnessed the head nazi writing a ticket on a car at 3:58 pm, so be careful. Parking availability is also a major problem."
College Sophomore,1,Varsity sports at southeastern are not huge especially football. We have great potential to become huge the sports but we do not have a lot of campus support. The sports facilities are great of athletes and non-athletes; any student can play or try out of our sports' team.
College Senior,1,Not enough parking space and i have to walk a lot from the parking to my class
College Freshman,1,I always have a designated driver if i am drinking
College Sophomore,1,"Parking sucks especially for freshman, but when youre an upplerclassman it gets better"
College Sophomore,1,"Athletics at my school is only really exciting for the first home game of the season and homecoming game. Students really don't attend unless for these two games. Our team just received a new head coach and we are adjusting to his methods. Since we are second in the conference. I have never seen the inside of the athletic facilities but according to some of my friends on the team its ""all good""."
College Junior,1,The serve the same thing every week! It becomes annoying
College Junior,1,"A Subpar Experience – Southeastern is, at is heart, a commuter school, to the point that it almost feels like a community college. Most students leave on the weekends or do not live on campus to begin with. Therefore, many of the students come from the surrounding public schools, which can lead to lower expectancies for academics. Overall, the school is not much to talk about, but it is very cheap for a four year program."

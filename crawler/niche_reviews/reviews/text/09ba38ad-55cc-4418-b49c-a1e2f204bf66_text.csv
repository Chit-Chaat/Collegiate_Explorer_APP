Junior,5,"Have not started courses yet. I am registered to begin November 2020. You may contact me and ask for an update later on this topic if you would like. My contact information should be listed from when I signed up for Niche.com. My experience with the school so far as been through advisors and student coaches. They have always been available when I have questions and are very quick to respond. This is hard for me to find since I work overnights at a hospital and my hours can get pretty crazy. The advisors even went above and beyond by helping me transfer military credits which UNO, UNL, Metro, and Iowa Western never mentioned.  Overall I have had a really good experience and no complaints so far."

Overall I have had a really good experience and no complaints so far."
Junior,5,"Most of my classes have been online through the university, but I have taken some in person  classes! Bellevue does a tremendous job making the online experience enjoyable, but very professional and educating."
Junior,5,"This school has been an amazing University! I started at Iowa Western than transferred to the University of Colorado Boulder. Many believe the bigger universities have more to offer and give better education, but I disagree. Bellevue not only helped me as a veteran, but as an individual and pushing me to be successful in every subject! They could use more in person classes, yet I realize they are a growing university!"
Graduate Student,5,"I had professors engage in online DB posts.  I never saw this anywhere else.  Online learning is probably not for everyone.  It takes self-discipline and independent study.  It works well for graduate students.  In my program, only certain classes can be taken online.  We still must engage in clinical practicums and internships under the supervision of licensed professionals.  

This school makes no distinction between online or in-person courses on the diplomas or transcripts.  That said if you are looking for an easily-earned credential by taking courses online, you will be sorely disappointed."
Freshman,5,So far with Bellevue my experience has been great! I haven't had any issues with the process to apply and the staff is fantastic!
Freshman,5,All of Bellevue is a positive experience. From the professors to the office staff! Our online courses are actually enlightening.
Senior,5,"Great staff who care about your education! When first applying to Bellevue this was simple easy and they made it fun and exciting to be continuing my education! Bellevue also offers online course, this was very easy to work full time and also work towards my degree!"
Sophomore,5,"I will be a new student at Bellevue University starting this winter term. I haven't been a full-time student in almost 10 years and the transition that I made was easy and effortless thanks to the advisors and enrollment specialists at Bellevue! I was hesitant at first to do my degree online, and I wasn't sure my credits I had done from 10 years ago would have been accepted, but my enrollment specialist worked with me for several weeks to make sure that everything went smoothly and that I got as much out of my previous classes as possible. I am looking forward to starting the new term and thanks to everyone that has helped me out, I'm looking forward to starting my college career again!"
Senior,5,Bellevue is a great school to attend as they offer multiple programs online and on campus. As I chose this school because it is easy to work around my own schedule and everyone was friendly and easy to work with!

Alum,5,"It's one of the easiest programs I have done. The professors are helpful and always available.  It's mostly an online school but, the campus is beautiful and worth a visit. The building is modern and is in an amazing part of town. Near Omaha the largest city in Nebraska. So many places to eat and visit."
Junior,5,So far the enrollment process has been good and the advisers are super patient and kind and will go above and beyond to help you.
Junior,5,Just a few more credits until I get my degree and they have been very easy to work with and very responsive.
Alum,5,"Bellevue University is great for adult students. There are many night and online classes to chose from. Not only do they have flexible hours, they have many courses of study. The campus is small so you won’t feel overwhelmed when you attend classes. Not only is the campus small but so are the classes. This way you’ll get the personal attention from your professor and they’ll even know your name!"
Senior,5,I really loved Bellevue. I took my classes mostly online but the campus is beautiful. My professors were amazing and my class schedule was really flexible. By far one of the best decisions I ever made was going to Bellevue.

Senior,5,I love the International Security program at Bellevue. The professors are knowledgeable and the course work is interesting and challenging.
Junior,5,"I am an online student returning to finish my Bachelor's Degree in Communication Studies.  I learned about Bellevue University after the company I work for announced that they were offering financial assistance to any employee who wanted to return to school.  My admissions experience was both fast and informative.  My advisors were extremely thorough with my admittance and registration.  Although my classes are all online, I still find them to be engaging and interactive. Every one of my professors were attentive, willing to answer questions, and quick to correspond with either issues or praise.  So far I have had an excellent experience in just a semester and a half."
Freshman,5,"This is my first time taking online courses. In the beginning, I was unsure if it was the right choice. Since I have been enrolled for 11 weeks, I can not think of any other way to attend college. Online courses are so convenient."
Junior,5,"Great to work with and get my education from.  Starting for  my Bachelors and am excited to get started.  Also, love my own student page with all my information right in front of me."
Alum,5,Great University with multiple degree plans to fit every student. friendly teachers and staff. easy schedules either online or in classroom

Freshman,5,The online courses at Bellevue University are easy to manage. The portal and blackboard are self service and enable one to complete coursework with ease.
Junior,5,"It is an interesting university, that offers multiple courses. The staff and professors are friendly. I love it."
Senior,5,"I like most the supportive staff, the real world knowledge of my professors as well as the diverse student population.    I also like the accelerated cohorts which allow students to complete their studies slight early. I would love to see more scholarships offered for working adults attending the university.  Paying for classes can be a huge hindrance to working adults especially those who have families and household responsibilities."
Junior,5,Great college and caring professors. Can't expect a great scene in the middle of Nebraska. The work is challenging but not too difficult to accomplish. Flexible options for going to school such as online or hybrid classes.
Junior,5,I'm am an online transfer student. Bellevue has accepted all of my community college credits and it has been an easy transition.
Freshman,5,I like that everyone at Bellevue is Really Nice and always tries to help. The Professors are all nice thats what is making class so easy.
Junior,5,"I am new to Bellevue, but have had nothing but a positive and easy experience so far. The counselors and relationship managers are extremely connected to you and respond quickly with solutions."
Freshman,5,This is my first year of school here at Bellevue & I am extremely happy so far. I am most impressed by how helpful the faculty is ; and how much the professors are willing to go out of their way to help you get the best education possible. There is a lot of resources and facilities available for free not to mention how much money they give in scholarships on top of how affordable it is already. If you are looking for a school that provides the best experience or opportunity Bellevue University is the school. GO BRUINS!
Junior,5,"I tried to accomplish my college goals through another university prior to going through Bellevue.  My first choice let me down when they refused to help me out with my application and trying to get in to my major.  I almost didn't go through with college until I looked in to Bellevue.  Right from the start I felt like I was the only student attending and everybody went out of their way to make me feel important.  Whenever I have a problem I can always get an immediate answer or a call back that same day.  They also check up on me through the school year and see how things are going.  I also like my professor as he's knowledgeable and is easily accessible to answer any questions I may have.  Bellevue is one of the best colleges in Omaha to attend, especially if you are doing online courses like me.  I recommend Bellevue University to friends and coworkers all the time."
Senior,5,My experience at Bellevue University have been very good. Being a disabled student allow me to participate in the cohort program.  I enjoyed the classes and professors were easy to work with. Having a student coach was very helpful throughout my degree program.
Junior,5,It is a great school and everyone is always willing to help you if you have questions. It is very easy to take online courses as well as in school. They work with you so well to get the most of your education. Teachers are always helpful when you have questions as well as office staff. 
Junior,5,"This school offers an Online Cohort (Accelerated) classes and I am an AA transfer student. I only have 1.5 years to finish my bachelors and then I will be moving on to a certification. Through the process, they have communicated well and continue to strive for excellence and constantly looking to improve their college experience for students."
College Junior,5,At Bellevue University the teachers are very caring and the environment is conducive to your needs. Being a student there I feel safe and I'm confident that the education I'm getting will prepare me fully for a career on the outside.
College Sophomore,5,I am working at a chemical company and getting a human resource degree will help me get a better job.
College Sophomore,5,"I love this college i have had a chance to visit it and i love all the offers they provide on campus, off campus and for online students."
College Sophomore,5,I know that i will be able to do a variety of jobs with my degree in Child Protection and Juvenile Justice. I am looking forward to my future and what lies ahead. I am not involved in any alumni's or anything else.
College Sophomore,5,"I love Bellevue University. I feel that the administration staff has been so helpful and respond in a reasonable time. I am so glad i choose Bellevue, i know that my future will be a lot brighter after graduation. The school is a little pricey, its hard to complain about that when i get such great support from professors and staff."
College Sophomore,5,"I am an online student. I do have the Bellevue app on my phone and i have up dates to what is going on, on campus. I think that the students are a priority at Bellevue. They have different sports that is supported by the students but it is not made a priority."
College Senior,5,"This school has exceeded all my wish list check points. I love the location, the staff, the options of interesting classes, and the classroom environment. Going to class is not a bother it is something I look forward to. I am currently on break and I miss two of my main professors. They make  you want to learn more and have many experiences and stories to share. When they are in front of the class it doesn't feel like class. As for the work it will challenge you but it is fun and the psychology department makes your work feel appreciated. The campus also has many great activities and know how to make their students happy. They do a great job in helping with financing options in which allows yourself to grow. I originally was hesitant about college because of the time and money but now if I could I would be always be a student. I am proud to say Bellevue University is my school!"
College Junior,5,I got all the financial aid i needed and then some!
College Senior,5,I love my program and my teacher and fellow classmates
College Junior,5,There's a lot of places to sit and is always clean.
College Junior,5,I never have any problems with the computers. Computers browsers off campus need to be configured to submit homework on their angel program.
College Sophomore,5,The college has great student advisers. 
College Senior,5,"Many nationalities, races, and cultures represented in the student body."
College Junior,5,"There are tons of fast food restaurants in OMaha, NE & Bellevue ,NE for cheap!!"
College Junior,5,Looking forward to completing the PRM class to advance my career in business management.
College Senior,5,"Great parking at BU. Whether the weather is bad or good, you never feel as though you've parked too far away."
College Senior,5,"There is a lot of diversity at BU. In my class alone we have a guy from Benin, three black males, four black females, at least four older students and a variety of ages."
College Junior,5,"I received some financial aid and that is better than none. Although some of it does require more work with writing essays, the application process is vary simple and something most universities do not have or leave up to you.  I find this to be one of the main reasons I like this school in that they don't leave everything up to the student and they help the student seek and apply in the right places.  Takes patience and effort but nothing in life is free."
College Junior,5,"Lots of parking, but when the weather is bad, its very cold"
College Junior,5,Wide range of ages and cultures. Most persons are older (30+).
College Senior,5,Bellevue University has up to date computers and students can find computers when they need one.  There is also wifi available for those who have their lap tops.
College Junior,5,"I had no difficulty being admitted to the program. The only problem was that I am exclusively an online student and they didn't have any classes I needed online for the Winter term. After looking at the schedule, the professors in my department decided to go ahead and offer online courses for the Winter term, so it all worked out in the end. They let me in to the program based on the Associates Degree I had earned previously, so I met all of their criteria for admission. I am not aware of any abnormal application process, and admission was easy for me, so I can't offer any tips there, either."
College Junior,5,"The professors are very knowledgeable and helpful. Their curriculum is engaging and to the point. The registration process was very simple and easy- the people who help with registration were quite willing to help with any questions, and inform me of any changes. The workload is reasonable. As you get higher in your course numbers, the work gets harder, more complex, and more detailed, as it should be expected to."
Junior,4,"I am taking one course that is half online this school year. So far the experience is fine, for the assignments are very doable, and the Zoom meetings clarify any questions that might turn up. However, the only real negative thing is that sometimes there can be a dead silence due to our own experiences on certain topics. But that cannot really be avoided if one does not know how to answer certain questions."
Junior,4,"It's a small university, but it has what it needs. The staff are open minded, patient, and willing to help out student when needed. The campus itself is small enough to walk around in about ten minutes, but it's a peaceful walk. There aren't many crowds of students due to the small size except for about five minutes after the university bell rings and even then it's pretty small. As a new transfer student I like the place a lot. The only thing that is really missing is a nurses office on campus, but there are some nearby the university so it doesn't impact it that much."
Graduate Student,4,"I am currently a student in Bellevue's MS Clinical Mental Health Counseling program.  I selected this school because of its CACREP accreditation.  This school is open access, offering quality education to anyone who is willing to work hard for it.  I believe their acceptance rate for my graduate program is around 43%.  

Classes may be taken in person or online, though currently, most/all courses moved to online due to Covid-19 considerations.  

Most of my professors have been attentive, helpful, & friendly.  Students are expected to work independently at the master's level, so do not expect much hand-holding.  Still, the school has a quality writing lab available.  Academics are rigorous and comparative to other private graduate schools.  

My experience with the financial aid department thus far has been smooth sailing.  Tuition is a little on the heavy side but is still competitive for a private, non-profit institution.

All in all, no complaints.  4 out of 5 stars."
Junior,4,"My experience online has been great. Everything is simple and easy to follow. Having all the materials I need to study and finish assignments, tests and quizzes. Love their library resource tools. I can connect to any library in the world. It's set up for students to write good research papers. I'm having the time of my life at this university."
Junior,4,"My experience has gone good so far. Only been there six weeks. I'm studying for a bachelor's degree in Business through the cohort program online. So, I'm still new to this experience but loving every minute of it. We meet live once a week with the professor via zoom."
Senior,4,My online experience has been great. I like the setup of the classes because it allows you to complete the course at your own schedule.
Senior,4,I like the ease of the set up of the classes. I do wish there would be more online videos for the harder classes.
Senior,4,This is my last year of bachelors program and I have a great academic adviser. She is really there for all my needs and steps during this process. Transferring can always be challenging but she is making it a smooth transitions.
Freshman,4,"Very knowledgeable professors. The support system is very quick to help. The financial aid office responds quickly to requests and questions. My student adviser stays in contact and responds quickly to my needs. The workload is very doable. With the app and online resourses, you have everything you need to be successful right at your fingertips. With you can buy and sell items, see the activities happening on campus, see job openings, check your email, have quick access to financial aid or any other college business you may need to attend to. This makes having time to get things completed in a timely manner very easy. The app is very easy to navigate also."
Freshman,4,I am in my second class at Bellevue University and so far my experience has been good.  The enrollment counselors were really informative and knowledgeable on pointing me in the right direction.  What I love most is that my program is accelerated and the classroom size is small.
Works Here,4,Great for working adults. Tons of online degrees offered. Online environment is easy to use and navigate. Professors are always willing to talk to you and help if you need it. Classrooms on campus are very nice and new. Lots of state of the art technology in science labs and everywhere else. The university is clearly making an effort to keep up with the times despite having been around for 50 years.
Freshman,4,So far I have had an absolutely wonderful experience with the faculty at Bellevue University who have gone out of their way to ensure my experience is as easy as can be for an out of state student moving across the country to attend class in person. I cannot wait to start next month.
Senior,4,"I take online classes and have been with Bellevue for two years now. Because I worked in corporate, my job had a corporate partnership with  Bellevue, My student advisor has been amazing in staying in contact with me, going over the curriculum layout and making sure I'm keeping my head above water."
Junior,4,"I was deciding on a degree, general but specific.  Does that really exist?  Yes it does!  While I was leaning toward one program, that didn't completely fill my needs, my advisor suggested another program that is a perfect fit and I am excited about the curriculum!  I've not had that great of an experience.  I really appreciate that thoughtfulness.  I'm a student, not a number."
Junior,4,"I liked the content of the classes learned at Bellevue, however, some of the professors did not take the classes as seriously as the students did."
Senior,4,"Great online program, had many issues with Blackboard on Apple iOS.  Great starting point after being out of school for 15 years."
Junior,4,"I have enjoyed this university, it is a great place to go if you want online options. They took a lot of my trnsfer credits. The classes are a little pricey."
Junior,4,The advisers are so wonderful and they call to check in on the students mid semester which helps motivate the student especially if they are lost about what to do in class. They also keep you informed of how to contact them anytime to get assistance or guide the student
Freshman,4,"I just started attending Bellevue University online. They are one of the few colleges who offer graphic design courses online. I love that they made the application and acceptance process so easy. I took some Summer courses and the teacher I had were exceptional. They were patient and worked with me and really taught me a lot. I look forward to continuing my education with Bellevue. My only thing I wish would change is tuition. While it's a good school, it's just as expensive as the rest of them."
Senior,4,"Would be nice to have a few on campus classes for my graphic design major. 

Great professors though!"
Sophomore,4,I am an online out of state student. I have had an overall good experience with Bellevue. The advisors and professors are very helpful. The intial regestration process is easy you have an assigned person to help you get started. Could use more online club opportunities but I think that is the case with many online colleges
Freshman,4,"I like how helpful the professors are. They are really willing to help you through your journey. The online courses are challenging for a first timer, but I'm sure with each semester I will get more used to it. Overall, the staff from enrollment to professors are extremely helpful."
College Senior,4,The admissions and advising team was super helpful and basically did the work for me.
College Senior,4,I've never gone to a school that's been so incredibly involved in helping me succeed. Quality people work here.
Recent Alumnus,4,"There is a great deal of team spirit and fan support at UNK, the gyms and facilities available meet the needs well."
Recent Alumnus,4,"The campus is beautiful and is very green so it is easy to be there. Classes are taught by professors who care more often than they don't, the dorms are outdated in some areas but are being remodeled and the student body seems to work well together. I would go to UNK again if I had to choose."
College Sophomore,4,"The courses are very educational, and the professors work well to make sure you succeed. The diversity of the classes help keep it interesting also."
College Sophomore,4,Bellevue University makes going back to college easy with on-line classes.
College Sophomore,4,Again i am an online student. So i am not thoroughly sure about problems on campus.
College Sophomore,4,It is an up to date campus with great technology and a really nice campus.
College Senior,4,The teachers are very accommodating and understanding.
College Junior,4,Professors are understanding and willing to work with students. Admin staff is very hands on
College Junior,4,I am assuming they are great. Athletics in Nebraska is a big thing. I am an online student only so I don't know what the facilities are like. I also live 400 miles away
College Senior,4,I chose Bellevue because they are a very creditable University. I looked into many different Colleges and Bellevue seed to have the best accounting program offered. I also chose this university because Sara in administration answered all my questions and made me feel very comfortable in my choice. I also plan to sit for the CPA exam and here I can finish my credit hours needed for this.
College Senior,4,The financial aid department was very helpful during my initial registration period. From that time on any questions I had all I really had to do was email the department and I received a response within 2 days.
College Senior,4,I am attending through online courses.  But the process has been easy and the people very helpful.
College Junior,4,I love the administrators at Bellevue
College Senior,4,Very helpful staff and willing to go above and beyond
College Junior,4,There are many students of many colors and backgrounds. Nobody treats anybody negatively.
College Junior,4,2 options for my bachelors would be Business management or a computer technician degree. A business management internship is not likely but a computer technician degree has a good chance.
College Junior,4,A car is a must. There is usually decent parking but the college likes to cluster classes on Tuesday and Thursday nights which makes parking more difficult.
College Junior,4,Omaha's public transportation isn't great but it works. The four campuses are all over the Omaha area and require a vehicle.
College Junior,4,There are very few snow days. The city does a great job clearing the roads. between April and December is the warm period.
College Junior,4,Most people that go to Metropolitan Community College are between 18-26 and are employed. I've made quite a few friends and never really disliked another student. Students main focus at this school is to get their degree done and move on with their lives.
College Sophomore,4,I've seen a good number of different ethnic backgrounds in my classes and they've all been wonderful to interact with.
College Sophomore,4,From what I've seen it's spacious and nice. There's nice options available to eat.
College Sophomore,4,"I take night classes, so it may be a little better then. But I think it's decent. I've seen way worse at other Universities and colleges."
College Sophomore,4,"Among student policies are academic amnesty, attendance, payment/financial aide ect. The University is consistent, they abide by their policies. They do not accept cheating or plajorism. And I think they're pretty stern, in a good way to that."
College Sophomore,4,I think the computers are decent.
College Sophomore,4,There is a good mixture of cultural diversity in the classroom. The students seem classy and focused on their studies. There's usually good conversation with fellow students during breaks. All students I've encountered have been friendly and helpful. We're all there to learn.
College Sophomore,4,"The student physical library is quite nice. The associate there are helpful and insightful. The online library I don't particularly care for. It's difficult to find what we're wanting. The student center is excellent and appealing. There's places to relax and eat, take a phone call. There's a variety of food during eating times. There are many events on the campus throughout the month and activities."
College Sophomore,4,This school provides school email which most do. Bellevue does send out regular communications inviting students to attend monthly activities occuring on campus. The website features all different activities going on. They also provide good access to students who want to find out what jobs they can get in each major. Bellevue has a group of associates that operate OneStop email. They answer a good number of general questions and help find you some one to respond appropriately. Classes are fair cost.
College Senior,4,Wonderful small town with big town things to do and there is always Omaha 6 miles away.
College Junior,4,"There are many options to choose from, they will help you decide once you complete the application for admissions"
College Junior,4,It works well with my currect career field
College Junior,4,"It was time consuming but it was worth the wait, they verified all items need to get the best Financial Aid Package available to me"
College Senior,4,"Taking the bulk of my classes online the weather has virtually no impact on me. The only obstacle, which would be rarely encountered, would be the occasional snowstorm."
Recent Alumnus,4,There isn't much pressure you encounter at Bellevue since most students are un-traditional.
Recent Alumnus,4,Omaha is a great place for housing. We have affordable homes in great neighborhoods as well as luxury housing available.
College Junior,4,"I am in an online program. I love it for it's flexability. However, not every professor is as prompt at loading classes for the flexability depends a lot on the the professor. I love not having set class time though. Major A+!"
Junior,2,"I don't consider myself a genius but I  find the curriculum very unchallenging. I don't know if its the programs I'm in but I expected much more challenging work for college level courses. I also don't know if it makes a difference being online but I would guess the assignments are the same. To me, answering 2 or 3 questions on a discussion board, looking for articles and having to write a 2 or 3 paragraph summary, answering 2 or 3 questions on a chapter or doing a 5 question quiz seems more like high school homework. The online discussions are the worst. Most students post with 1-3 sentences and then we're supposed to create responses based on that. I've had classmates even copy my answers and put them in their post.Online projects are horrible. Classmates do poor work don't answer when you try to communicate and if you want to submit a quality assignment you're going to have to do the work yourself while they also get credit on their crappy work for your hard work."
College Sophomore,2,We don't really have a lot of public transportation options where the University is at.
College Sophomore,2,I chose bad because I don't really think we have an emphasis on these at this University. If we had more attention to this it could grow a bit. But may not be a large focus.
College Senior,2,The majority of students are working adults that are pursuing degrees associated with their profession.
College Senior,2,The usual variety of homogenized national chains along with a decent section of ethnic choices. Few within reasonable walking distance of the campus.
College Senior,2,"It is typical midwestern weather.  Hot in summer, cold in winter."
College Senior,2,"Night Life – I dont know if there is night life as I am a student who works full time, I am married and have a son. I dont have time for a night life other than studying and sleeping."
College Senior,2,Social Life – Meeting guys and gals is not really encouraged since Bellevue University is a private one
College Senior,2,"Bellevue University is a costly university to attend due to it being a private one.  However, there are plenty of private donors affiliated with the university that are willing to offer scholarships to students"
College Senior,2,Public transportation is average at best...below average in regards to city bus transportation
Recent Alumnus,2,"Be Careful and Tape Everything – When I first started to get my financial aid funds together,I was told two different answers by different people in the financial department, it was very frustrating and I was always so angry with them. Word of caution,make sure you tape the entire conversation,take down names, times and dates when you speak to someone as your own proof of who told you what."
College Senior,2,"Black Ice – As far as crime, I feel safe, but I almost fell on some black ice in front of the Admin building. I barely stayed on my feet and I was walking where I should have been walking to go into the building."
College Junior,2,"you never can call finaid, counselors any of the business type offices and get anyone to answer the phone. you have to wait till they decide to call you back"
College Senior,2,"I am an online student so I'm not familiar with the nightlife at Bellevue University. As far as I'm aware there really isn't much of a nightlife scene there.  However in Omaha, the nightlife is pretty good, there is always somewhere new to try."
Niche User,1,I have been waiting for class to start since August 2019. They still never have enough students to start me. They wanted me to change my major to something else just to attend. I asked to be withdrawn and for they to cancel my loans. They are refusing.
College Junior,1,There is no campus housing.
College Junior,1,I am a single 22 year old that lives on my own. I had a small amount of money that will run out when i get my associates degree but still need to acquire bachelors. Somehow my parents income matters in financial aid when they don't contribute at all.
College Junior,1,Community Colleges don't offer extra curricular activities like these.
College Senior,1,My experience was very frustrating. While the scholarship offerings were adequate the process was horrific.  A technicality in my paperwork held up my application for months with no apparent solution.  They kept telling my they were waiting on me.
College Junior,1,Process took forever to finish and then the aid amounts kept changing.
Recent Alumnus,1,I Am Not in an Internship Program – The career center does not help distance students in finding internships or any other job.

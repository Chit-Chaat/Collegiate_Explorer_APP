Sophomore,5,"I had a hard time finding where exactly I fit in when I first started to explore going to college. After finding MACU, I knew that this was the right place for me. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They're always available for me when I have questions. The grounds are updated and well kept."
Sophomore,5,MACU has an easy to use the online system and the on-ground staff is always more than willing to help. The online professors are nice and very informative.
Junior,5,It has been wonderful my professor are available for me when I need them. I feel like I’m connected to all my classmates it has been great
Junior,5,The staff there is so helpful and professional. They let you know everything you will need to do to succeed.
Freshman,5,I am currently a freshman at Mid-America Christian University and as of right now I am absolutely in love with this college.
Junior,5,Very helpful. Great instructors. I love going to college at Mid-America Christian University.  Wonderful adult online learning program.
Freshman,5,I love MACU. The environment is amazing. Everyone is so nice and care about everything. Professors are  great and care so much. The athletics are amazing and extremely talented.
Sophomore,5,I was septical about starting here at MACU but it has been one of the best decisions I have been pertaining to my education. There is just such a positive vibe about the school and evertyone seems to want you to succeed from the instructors to the students.
Freshman,5,Mid-America was my only college choice because of the baseball program. Coming to this school has taught me about God and taught me to have a relationship with Him.
Freshman,5,All of the staff is so helpful when you are first starting. The university’s president is a wonderful man as well. He just wants God’s will over your life and education.
Freshman,5,"Everyone is so caring and helpful. I never would have even gotten this far, anywhere else.
The class schedule is AMAZING, I'm not at all overwhelmed!"
Graduate Student,5,The people who work here are vert helpful and want nothing but the best for their students. As an adult student it also is wonderful that they have a variety of online degree options.
Senior,5,"The staff in all departments are very helpful.  They go above and beyond to seek answers.  They are very consistent with keeping in touch with you throughout your classes.  They will call you or text you to see how everything is going.  They will respond back within 48 hours when you have a question.  They are very committed to seeing that you have the best success with attaining your degree.  Their online degree programs are convenient for working adults and all resources are available to you.  The same student specialist has been ""assigned"" to me during my semesters and he has been very consistent with checking on me and my progress."
Freshman,5,MACU is a fantastic school. You get a lot of one on one attention from your professors  and the attitude on campus is very positive and uplifting. You will build lifelong relationships here! It truly is a place to call home!
Freshman,5,"Thus far, the Staff are extraordinary in their passion about their courses, they ensure they are available at all hours and are very prompt in replies to questions. The courses are challenging and engaging. Professors are excellent in grading, guidance and encouragement."
Freshman,5,"I chose MACU after I felt like God had called me to play softball here. I spent many sleepless nights towards the end of my senior year praying that God would give me a vision for the next few years of my life. Softball drew me here, but the Lord has kept me here. My experience at MACU is similar to most people's experience at MACU I love, the Love. At MACU I feel the presence of the Lord everywhere I go, whether it be the place or the people. I believe that God is love, and when you feel or see God in places you began to love them, along with the people."
Freshman,5,"The student-professor relationship here is truly amazing, and everyone is like a family, while there is still diversity. People are so friendly and are always willing to help if someone else is on need of assistance. The only thing I would say needs some work are the activities and food on weekends for the students who live on campus and can not go home on the weekends. "
College Freshman,5,I enjoy my classmates and teachers. Everyone is friendly and easy to work with. Teachers and staff are always there to help.
College Junior,5,"Again, I am online so therefore personally I do not know, but I chat with some students and they tell me they enjoy it. Of course it is not like home so, we do with what we have. If you look at the schools pictures you can see the new structures being built, that alone shows determination to succeed."
College Junior,5,"I am online so I have no idea if MACU offers any Greek life, therefore I can not judge what I do not know. But I can tell you from what I know the staff and students there at MACU are  diversified and are just great."
College Junior,5,"MACU has offered more than what was offered at another school. They make you feel like family, which is a big thing now a days. I wanted a school that treated like a human being not a number and that worked with you and so MACU did this and more. Bravo! Keep it up."
College Freshman,5,"Once on campus the only public buildings are the two with classrooms in it. To get into the dorms one needs a student ID and then to get onto their respective halls they need IDs again. Campus security is always walking around campus or driving around, if a hall has a broken card swipe security usually sends someone to stand by the door or the patrol that hall a number of times. Also security knows the majority of the students by name and same goes for students knowing security."
College Freshman,5,"A number of the schools alumni have jobs at the school , or come back to speak to students pursin the same major has them. The student center is great with trying to help people find jobs while enrolled at school and for after school."
College Freshman,5,"Macu just built a new dorm this summer , and it offers a lot of privacy inside the room. The dorms are built amazingly and offer a little kitchen area, a nice view, some have living rooms. All the dorms are about 5-10 minutes away from classrooms depending on how people walk."
College Freshman,5,"If i could choose my school all over again I would. Macu has a great family  environment and while your in high school they go the extra mile to make sure  you are ok in daily life, to see if your still interested in the school. One thing that makes my school unique would be the fact all your teachers know you by name, and for the most part they all have open office hours. Also the fact that the President walks around hanging out with students or eating alongside them."
College Junior,5,I have had a terrific experience since attending online at this college. Only situation I have that will not let me continue is financial difficulty. I am not approved for pell grants nor student loans.
Recent Alumnus,5,My school is unique and top quality because of the Christian environment and the attention I get from faculty and staff at MACU.  I am very proud to tell people that I am getting my degree at MACU.  It means everything to me.  I have been going to school for almost two years and I am still just as excited as the day that I got enrolled here.  I have loved every minute of it because MACU gives me the confidence that I can do this and I believe it because of the one class at a time.  I love being able to concentrate on one class at a time!!!
Recent Alumnus,5,It is great!  I believe there is so much opportunity with my degree.  I do believe there is more homework with the online classes but that's all I have ever taken except for one class.
Recent Alumnus,5,I feel confident that I have the best professors who are the best in quality and Christianity.  The registration process is great.  The student success center is a great place to study and get to know other students and network.  Some classes have more homework than others.  I believe they could slow down a little on online classes for the working student because there is a lot of weekly homework in each class.  It is taxing when a person works full time.
Recent Alumnus,5,There is no partying on campus because it is not allowed and zero tolerance.
Recent Alumnus,5,"I honestly believe MACU is one of the very safest campuses there is around.  The reason is because they set high standards of conduct for the students and do not allow alcohol, tobacco or drugs on campus.  Therefore, the crime rate is very low. I know students feel very safe and secure at MACU.  I have always felt very safe on campus."
Recent Alumnus,5,"There is a great variety of restaurants from fast food to dine in nice eating places at student rates.  There is everything in Moore like Ricky's Mexican food is great, Furr's Express, and tons of others."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Students have every facility accessible to them that they could want.  They have campus hangouts, activities, academics, technology, new library, etc."
Recent Alumnus,5,I have had a great experience with my courses and professors.  Each professor has been different.  I have only had a couple that were a little difficult but overall they have been fantastic and go above and beyond to help.  They are accessible and there for you and bring Christianity into the curriculum which I love and the reason I came to MACU to finish my degree.  I can't speak for onground classes because I take online courses because no onground classes are offered in Management degree.  I have taken one onground and it was a very nice size and great experience. The quality of courses are great.  There is only one course I have a problem with and that was my last course I took.  It was a Computer Based Information Technology class and it has way too much weekly homework.  It is ridiculous.  They need to revamp that class because it is way out of people's league for what it is trying to teach.  It has four courses in one with four Microsoft programs taught in 5 weeks.  That is way too much!!!
Recent Alumnus,5,I have found Financial Aid to have very efficient service and they have always been there to serve me when I needed it.  I have always had a positive experience with Financial Aid.
Recent Alumnus,5,"It's located fairly close to two shopping malls, Water parks, concerts.  We have our NBA Thunder team right here close for them.  Bricktown is close with all of the fun stuff there like paddle boats, dining at it's finest, bowling, movie theatres, you name it we have it.  We have historical museums, Murrah bombing tour site.  People highly respect MACU students because it is a private college and they know it has a fantastic reputation."
Recent Alumnus,5,"Students here want to learn and get an education.  The students who go to MACU are clean cut, dress modest for females and the males dress sharp. They have interests in Christianity and their class activities.  They want to make good grades, and they have good relationships with each other.  They have fun but there is no drinking, smoking or drugs among any of the students.  They are here to learn.  They come from good families and have a good positive influence on each other."
College Freshman,5,"I enjoy attending MACU online campus and the instructors are very helpful and always ready to assist your individual needs. Enrolling in MACU was a breeze, compared to other colleges which I have experienced. They practically did all the necessary paper for me and explained in detail every step of the way. They never  made me feel stupid or hopeless when I asked questions about their school, and they always had an answer."
College Student,5,"theres no bullying, its better than home it seems like."
College Student,5,"its so wam, its awesome!"
College Student,5,"theres no need for one, all of your classes are together, its awesome!"
College Student,5,i havent had it but i love that i can always count on them!
College Student,5,"no one uses it, but if you do have a problem theyll help you instead of kicking you right out."
College Student,5,"its not trashed, very clean and family atmoshpered."
College Student,5,"its awesome, they never go beyond the point!"
College Student,5,"Your freinds become family, and your never a face in the crowd."
College Freshman,5,"Here at the university in which I attend, the faculty is awesome. They have been my personal babysitter, they take good care of me. Even on those days , that I am very frustrated, they keep a cool head and listen to my needs and problems. There has been times I wanted to quit from frustration, and no matter who I have talked with they took the time to listen to me. They treated me like a person with a heart, not just another number for the university. Here we are people with real lives and with the same needs. They understand and show it by helping every student ."
College Sophomore,5,"I enjoy attending classes at the campus, and I enjoy doing the online classes too. The professors are all very nice and very helpful both ways of being schooled. I love interacting with the other students online and in the classrooms."
College Sophomore,5,"Go to the college or register online, it's that simple. I didn't have any difficulties enrolling or getting into Mid America Christian College. The entire staff was very helpful in all areas. I was enrolled and registered to start in one day. It took about two hours two get everything completed."
College Sophomore,5,"Mid America Christian University is a highly respectable college with a ""No Tolerance"" for illegal drugs, substances and alcohol. No excuses and no tolerance, it's just not acceptable or tolerated. Most students and staff are serious about the education and the rules. It is a fine college to attend and it is clean, drug free. The professors are helpful, kind and serious about teaching. The students are motivated to learn without drugs. I love this college. It is awesome!"
College Senior,5,"Since God sends his angels to watch over us we are extremely safe, as he keeps us safe from all manner of hurt harm or danger."
College Senior,5,"My home is my school and in answering the above questions, it sums up my home enviornment."
College Freshman,5,I don't think I would be here if God didn't want me to be so I would choose to come here again. 
College Freshman,5,People play in the student center or play games in their room
College Freshman,5,There is no peer pressure and hardly anyone on campus drinks or smokes. More likely smoking though.
College Sophomore,5,"it was very easy, I really need some scholarships to help me with my classes!!!!"
College Junior,5,No drugs on campus. This campus is Christian.
College Junior,5,"Very diverse , acceptance  and religious."
Junior,4,"It has been a great first semester. People are really nice and help you to fill like at home. There are people all over the world. They have different activities to do every week. His philosophy is towards spreading the word of God. As a student-athlete, I wish they had more things for us, such as our own gym or locker rooms. The university is small so you get to know each other and have one to one experiences with the professors."
Sophomore,4,Mid America Christian University has treated me very well. The staff and faculty are always ready to help you with whatever you need and the campus is small enough where you'll never miss a class because of distance between classes.
Junior,4,I have been going to this school for just 3 semesters so far and I have really enjoyed being an Evangel. I was a bit skeptical on going because it is a Christian college but they don't force religion on you and the adult program is amazing. The professors really work with the students to make sure they succeed.
Junior,4,Overall it has been a good experience.  I do have issues some time with the promptness of certain departments.  I also believe the online courses are too expensive.
Senior,4,The staff in the adult program are extremely helpful It has been a terrific school to pursue my degree. The schedule works perfectly for those working a full time job and want to pursue a college education.
Junior,4,Currently enrolled in the Adult Studies Program and it is very working adult friendly.  Enjoying the ease of the online classes much better than sitting in a class room because you can do it on your own time.  So far professors have been very easy to work with and student services has been very helpful.
Senior,4,"I think one of the best things about Mid-America is how small it is. It's so easy to build relationships with others and make connections. My favorite thing about MACU however, are the professors in the ministry department. I have never felt so supported and encouraged before and it really helps me to learn better and want to understand what I am learning because I know my professors actually care about my education."
Niche User,4,Mid American Christian University ( MACU) is a great smaller than usual private college. The smaller classes offer chances of individual and more personal help. Teachers and staff are excellent. The environment is one of a kind.
Freshman,4,Its okay I just feel that there should be scholarships for people who need help going to school because I am on a fixed income and can not afford to pay for school and pay my bills to maintain my house to live in
Niche User,4,Mid-America Christian University is an incredible school for those interested in pursuing a career in ministry for the Kingdom of God. The atmosphere is pleasant and welcoming with no judgments on who you are or where you come from. The professors are engaging and personal with each and every student. This school is completely focused on helping you understand what God is calling you to do with your life.
College Junior,4,I have met Professors from all walks of life and that makes these classes interesting. They share their life history in relation to the topic taught as well as we as well. They have a motive of teaching that far surpasses what I have experienced in other schools. The subject matter is by far diligent to say the least in the race of education. Especially when doing God work.
College Junior,4,"MACU has up graded there services with it's own Police Department. Unlike some schools that depend on outside sourcing for help, MACU is right on top of protecting there students. It is imperative that they provide such a service to deter crime and make the students concentrate on their school work and not on their life persay."
College Freshman,4,"My first semester was amazing, do teachers were great different from highschool teachers though. But you could tell this teachers still like what they do. The classes were all small, I believe my biggest class had twenty students in it."
College Freshman,4,"Since going to MACU I have realized that highschool and middle school spirit clubs while fun are nothing compare to college games. My school has its own section for students to cheer at. Unless its a game during break that section is always full. Saying this might not come as a shock to most people but we dont have a spirit  club, we have a Facebook page that some students student's and to post when our next home game is and we always get great turn outs."
College Senior,4,Solid school overall. God-centered values but high standards.
College Student,4,"I have not yet started classes yet, but the experience I have had this far as to enrolling and their counseling staff has been a breeze."
College Freshman,4,"All the food tastes excellent,  wish is rare for a college campus."
Recent Alumnus,4,"Oklahoma City is just like where I live in Washington state, lots of variety."
Recent Alumnus,4,There is a very diverse group of individuals that attend the online program from across the united states.
Recent Alumnus,4,There is plenty of interaction between the instructors and students. There is flexibility and the class sizes are not over 20 students allowing for the instructors to address all issues.
Recent Alumnus,4,My degree is a Bachelors in Science with a major of Business Administration and Ethics. This allows me to apply for a wide variety of employment opportunities.
Recent Alumnus,4,There is culturally diverse places that offer student discounts and plenty of variety.
Recent Alumnus,4,"This particular program is set up for one class to be taken at a time, the workload is comparable to on-campus classes. My specific major correlates with my current profession."
Recent Alumnus,4,Everything is completed online which is wonderful since I live out of state and work through the online learning program at my pace. All courses are 5 weeks to 8 weeks long. There are several things to chose from online. The whole process is streamlined and you only have to work with one person the entire time you are attending classes.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I am from a different state, but from my understanding that prices are relatively average for the area and very accessible."
Recent Alumnus,4,The menus are great and the food is great and it is very reasonable in cost. There is a good variety and very good like home cooking.
Recent Alumnus,4,I have no exposure to internships so I can't really answer this one.  I'm sure they have some great internships at MACU. They have the best of everything.
Recent Alumnus,4,The admission is fast and easy.  I got enrolled in two days when I decided to go back to school.
Recent Alumnus,4,I feel confident that my major is going to give me a lot of opportunity in businesses out there since my major is Management and Ethics.  I'm very excited.
Recent Alumnus,4,"All in all I believe MACU does have a good career prospect program and the value of a degree from MACU is very good, one of the best.  It may not offer as many degrees as some, but it does offer a good variety and they are very high quality.  The career center/services on campus is an amenity because people really do need help when they are not sure what they want to major in."
Recent Alumnus,4,"They have new dorms and keep constructing new buildings on campus because it is growing so fast.  The amenities are the Student Success Center, auditorium for programs, activity center.  The housing is wonderful and the students love the campus.  It is easy to get to know each other because of the personal touch of the faculty and staff."
Recent Alumnus,4,I know there are a lot of students who come to MACU to play sports mainly Basketball.  It's big on campus.  Some have scholarships to play basketball.  They have a great athlete program and they are well supported.  Students support the athletes also.
Recent Alumnus,4,"I would say there are varied backgrounds as far as economic, ethnic, political, religious.  There is a good mixture with high quality students who want to learn."
Recent Alumnus,4,"You do have to attend class and make a certain GPA.  It is a Christian campus, so there is no tolerance for alcohol, tobacco, or drugs.  Modest dress code.  That's why I like this campus because it is a Christian atmosphere."
College Sophomore,4,only things i know about the sports is what i read on line.
College Sophomore,4,good work and helpful tools.
College Sophomore,4,Mid-America is a great school.
College Sophomore,4,I am an on-line student.
College Sophomore,4,I am an on-line student.
College Student,4,the school spirit is awesome! The facilites arent new but theres no need for new ones when everyone takes care of what they have to work with.
College Freshman,4,"My review of the professors is great, I am an online adult student and every professor I have had, has been online right along with me. They offer contact numbers and their own personal cell numbers, they set up chat rooms, virtual chat, as well. I have received positive support throughout my learning online. They all have been great!"
College Sophomore,4,I think throughout the years technology has progressed to an optimum level in colleges. The colleges I have toured and the one I currently attend almost relies solely on technology.
College Junior,4,The teachers are very good 
College Junior,4,Just follow the instructions its easy
College Freshman,4,The weather hasn't affected Mid-America to much yet. We haven't had any days off because of the weather but the winter has not hit yet. 
College Freshman,4,There are restaurants near by and good to eat.
College Freshman,4,The campus is near a big city so there is stuff to do but you have to drive a little. If the job i want is available near by I would like to live around here 
College Freshman,4,A lot of people at Mid-America are there for the sports. They are also getting a degree but mainly sports. The sports facilities are not as nice as they could be but they are good enough for the student body participation 
College Freshman,4,It's a pretty safe environment nothing doesn't happen that's crazy or scary.
College Freshman,4,There are good classes they aren't to hard yet and teach what needs to be taught. 
College Freshman,4,All around its a pretty good campus not to many weird people. 
College Freshman,4,Really no parking near by the school but there are plenty spots in the school.
College Freshman,4,Mainly friendly very few guys that are jerks. I couldn't name three off the top of my head. 
College Sophomore,4,I like it because of religious view!!!!! 
College Sophomore,4,they are very understanding and the staff is very nice!!!!!!
College Junior,4,This is a Christian school. Everyone is into the Lord and not stuck on looks.
College Senior,4,I have not witnessed any smoking or drinking at this school
College Sophomore,4,There has always been security present upon leaving and going into class.  My classes were at night and security was an issue for me.
College Freshman,4,Very good internet and very big labs I never had to wait
College Junior,4,My school is pretty small but it is very cozy. I love the feel of the campus because every one knows one another and it's as if everyone on campus is like a family. Students eat lunch with our professors and it is a very tight knit set of people.
College Sophomore,2,"There is no night life around my school, although I am sure a lot of students would like more parties, I believe that college is about the education, not the parties."
College Junior,2,"When the weather is bad, it is har to move about"
College Junior,2,"There aren't very many scholarships available, the financial aid office was not helpful in providing information or assistance and I ended up having to rely on student loans."
College Junior,2,"There is not much of a ""nightlife"" at school. Most of the students are usually going to either bars or dance halls which are fun. If you find one you really like, you usually end up being there a bunch."
College Senior,2,"The off campus experience can be pretty costly but living on campus is pretty expensive. Its some what convenient and the landlord are pretty average, you will find some that are willing to work with you but then you have the ones that are mean as can be. The okc area is pretty good on safety most people are really nice."
College Senior,2,"The weather in Oklahoma is always skeptical. One day its hot, the next its raining, and the day after that its snowing. The conditions are crazy but its a wonderful experience."
College Sophomore,2,"I've had a 50/50 split.  I've had professors engage the class and really teach, I've also had professors who practically didn't even exists.  It's really a hit or miss."
College Sophomore,2,"This is a Christian University in the middle of Oklahoma.  You have to expect it to be full of many conservative white Christians, as there are many more in this state than other places.  There is a larger amount of diversity in the Adult program, but not by much."
College Junior,2,"Safety of Campus – needing more lighting around parking areas,when getting out of class after 10pm it very dark and some more lighting can be used"
Alum,1,"When applying for Mid-America Christian University, I thought it would be a great institution to further my education and the option for living on campus would aid in getting to know like-minded people. WRONG. The RD & RA were not welcoming on any level or aspect, they seemed to be too exclusive to introduce themselves to freshmen or put any help into making them feel welcome. Spoke to the Student Life director on multiple occasions, he was not willing to offer any help and gave me the “suck it up” attitude. The required cafeteria ""meal plan"" costs $1,855 however, does not cater for alternate diets, the food you will find is all reheated frozen packaged food, old mashed potatoes mixed with a newer batch, the only fresh items was a salad bar which more often than not had wilted lettuce and squished tomatoes. 
If possible I would rate this University a 0/5, but the academic advisors, professors and president were all lovely and showed they had interest in your education and welfare."
College Senior,1,"The online MBA program is a disaster. I've had 4 classes not put online on the date the class starts and then got penalized for late work. If you have all A's and a D they wait till the end of the program and tell you that you can't graduate unless you retake the class. You are told numerous things, and the success coach turns around and says he miscommunicated information to you. I have SEVERAL emails regarding all these problems. Other students in my online class are constantly emailing with the same complaints. It has turned into a nightmare! You would think we were the first graduating class it is all so unorganized.. Save yourself the headache and enroll online somewhere else. I wish someone had told me before hand."
College Junior,1,Constant Worry – I have received a little financial aid from the school and government. I have had trouble every year though with financial aid. I had an added amount of  money that somehow appeared and no one could give me a reason where it came from. I suggest making personal appointments and keeping all your paperwork in a handy folder.

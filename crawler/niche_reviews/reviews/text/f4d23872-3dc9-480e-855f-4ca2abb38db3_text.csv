I wouldnâ€™t change anything about my experiences this far."

Senior,5,"I love Washburn University! Go Bods! Its a school with a friendly atmosphere. If you like small classes this is the place to go. I've never been in a class of more than 50 students, and I've been there for 4 years. The professors are very helpful and will do everything in their power to help or be available for you. We also have many resources for study materials, and Topeka metro bikes to ride around campus. It's not a big campus, so the walk to classes is not very long, 10 minutes max. The only thing that needs to change is parking. There isn't enough."
Sophomore,5,Washburn does an amazing job with getting students connected and getting them the help they need to succeed. The professors are always looking out for the students and always want the best for them.
Junior,5,"Washburn university is a close nit college where everybody is like a family! Its large enough for you to experience student life but small enough to where you know or recognize people.

Freshman,5,"I love washburn university.Im only a freshman but my brother transferred from another school because he was partying and got his degree and he loved it.If people could over look the town and make a effort to do their work,know the professors,actually make effort to look for clubs online and remember that college is about school and your future not partying this school would be a A rating school.I dont know why there is bad ratings.Washburn was best decision ever made at this point."
Niche User,5,"While Washburn is a smaller school, it has been great. I have connections with all my professors and I have been able to become established not only at Washburn but in the city of Topeka as well. This University and Topeka have so amazing things in store for them!!!!"

The faculty including teachers, janitors, coaches, etc. all work together with a positive attitude and truly care about each student as an individual. I love where I'm at and I couldn't ask for a better school."
Sophomore,5,I started studying at Washburn University last year and so far it has been a great experience coming from a foreign country. People at Washburn are very friendly and welcoming. I really feel like I am home. It is a great university. You should all come here.
Sophomore,5,Washburn is a fairly small school but the community there is better than any you could get at a big division 1 school. There are so many ways to get involved and they work really hard to ensure you have the tools for success.
Freshman,5,"Washburn is so friendly and you get a one on one experience. The professors know you by name, they actually want to get to know you. There are many organizations that you can be apart of. The staff want you to ask questions!! Ask for help. The tutoring is free!! Parking is free!! The only fees you should have is an activity fee, tuition, and living expenses!!"
Sophomore,5,"I love Washburn and all it has to offer. The campus is just the right size for me and the staff and facilities are great. The professors all know their stuff and are super helpful. I haven't had a professor who wasn't helpful or mean. What I love most about Washburn is that even though I don't live on campus, it still feels like a home away from home."
Sophomore,5,"I love it here. I have made so many amazing friends and connections with faculty and staff. The professors here really love their students and want to see them succeed. I have never met someone on campus who doesnâ€™t love the students and their job. There is so much school pride inside and outside of the classroom, and it really draws you and your classmates together. Everyone respects one another despite background and cultural differences. Washburn is really a home for students."
Sophomore,5,"At Washburn University, I have met many people from around the world (countries like Burundi, China, Congo, etc.) and have broadened my horizons significantly by not only taking classes important for my major (Biology B.S.), but I have also taken classes in an assortment of other studies (like Sociology, Jazz History, US Government, and even Philosophy). My experience at Washburn University has been extraordinary and when I graduate in a couple of years, I will never forget the people that I met and the things I learned at Washburn University."
Sophomore,5,"Washburn has been the perfect school for me. Its moderate size has allowed me to really connect with the professors and the students. Although I am just a sophomore, Washburn has helped me grow tremendously. I have been challenged academically and even stepped outside of my comfort zone to take on leadership roles. One of my favorite things I have learned about Washburn is their motto, ""Non Nobis Solum,"" which means not for ourselves alone. This motto completely embodies what Washburn University is all about. It is a place where professors and advisors really care and want to see their students succeed. Although this school may not have the most exciting athletics or the greatest food, it has a lot more to offer then what meets the eye. I have found that I am happy to call this school my home away from home. This school has provided me with a great college experience academically and socially that I will never forget."
Freshman,5,The students and staff are so helpful! The campus feels like a home away from home. I really feel like I fit in there!

Sophomore,5,"Living in Topeka all my life, I thought Washburn was not even on the list of colleges for me; thankfully, I was wrong. Before I decided on colleges, Washburn University was the new home to a Kansas Bureau of Investigations building. This building encouraged me to pursue my dream of working for the FBI. If I could change one thing about Washburn, I would add solar panels to the roofs of sunny buildings in order to prepare the future of the university with cheap alternative energy sources."
Graduate Student,5,"I loved the professors I had at Washburn and the opportunities that were given to me through the University.  My degree required a lot of group work, but it helped me get to know my peers and learn to work as a team.  Student life is very friendly and there are many networking opportunities through Washburn.  Unfortunately, Topeka doesn't have a lot to offer incoming students as far as entertainment, but it is a cheap place to live and is still somewhat of a fun college town."
Junior,5,I love the diversity that Washburn offers and the fact that I feel safe walking to and from class everyday.
Niche User,5,Cannot wait to attend Washburn. Junior day was a blast and I am taking dual credit classes through Washburn. I plan to take more next year and the tour was excellent. Made everyone feel welcome.

Junior,5,"My experience at Washburn has been great. Im a student athlete (tennis), have made a lot of friends. My current major is Finance and Entrepreneurship & Innovation. Im planning on graduating in 2019 if possible. I think the only thing that I'm not used to yet, its the weather, Ive always struggle with the cold weather but everything else is great. I totally recommend Washburn for people."
Senior,5,The staff is so friendly and really cares about your education. I have emailed teachers to ask questions and they get back to me within a few hours on the weekend!
Sophomore,5,"I love Washburn! I love the size because there's enough people for diversity but there's few enough you get to know a bunch of them! It feels like a home and a family. It shows you the real world without throwing you to the sharks. If you want a great college experience, Washburn could be for you!"
Niche User,5,I loved all the Washburn campus and the staff are very friendly and helpful. There are many opportunities for student but the only downfall is the crime in Topeka.
Junior,5,"Washburn University is great. Professors are focused on the success of their students and are helpful to everyone. Student life is excellent. There are multiple organizations offered to students and various activities to do around campus. Washburn focuses on diversity, providing multiple events tailored to encourage diversity. The courses are perfect for anyone looking for a more individualized education. Classes are small and focused, allowing for each individual student to really thrive in their academic field."
Junior,5,"Washburn University is a great environment. The nursing school has great professors who are passionate about healthcare and teaching. They are there for the student, supporting them through the rigorous nursing program. I feel that I'm getting a great education here."
Sophomore,5,The most amazing thing about Washburn University is the staff. I have not met a single staff person on campus that does not want to help you succeed. All of the professors I have had want each student to succeed and will go above and beyond to ensure that. They also challenge students ineffectually everyday to make us the best scholars we can be.
Graduate Student,5,"I loved Washburn University. The school continues to grow, however, as they add more buildings, they are not adding more parking."
Niche User,5,I love the campus. It so pretty and everything about it is amazing. I am going to be a freshman but I already know that this is my new home! I'm so excited to begin my journey.
Freshman,5,I loved that the students had their own bathroom! I love that everyone know almost everyone. I love that the campus feels like home. I love that there is an exploratory program!
Freshman,5,I love Washburn University! The class sizes are perfect for me and there's a ton of opportunities to get involved!
Freshman,5,"Met new people and enjoy my classes and professors. Really like that they care about their students to succeed. They are no doubt a good school for law school. If you ever need help with your work or anything for class, there are a lot of helpful people in the library that would help you."
Junior,4,"The upper level leaders genuinely care about the students success and that is incredibly helpful if you get the chance to meet and make a connection with them. But some of the professors are not cut out for teaching, despite their knowledge of the material. On campus events were always fun when they were available and WU's transition to online classes has been as seamless as a transition can be. I do think charging more for tuition when we are not getting the same academic and social benefits as we were last year is unfair and doesn't seem to make sense."
Junior,4,"Some professors are very equipped to teach online and it makes me feel as if I am not lacking any aspect of an in-person class. However, there are many professors who struggle with technology and therefore lowers the quality of the class. Other professors are very afraid of students not learning the same amount and over-assign out of class work to a ridiculous point that stresses all the students regardless of previous academic performance."
Freshman,4,I enjoy online classes. It works with your schedule.  The faculty wants you to succeed.  They send out emails and check on their students
Freshman,4,I enjoy attending washburn.  Everyone is very inclusive and want you to succeed.  There is always some tpe9of event going on.
Junior,4,Online classes are the best. They are just as challenging and offer different varieties of material.
Junior,4,I have two amazing teachers and they have a well-prepared semester outlines for us to follow. The only thing I struggle with is that I have kids at home and because of COVID-19 I can't get childcare nor will the school give me any Grant Relief money that the government offered students.
Sophomore,4,I really like how all the buildings are close and it is pretty easy to find your way around. The professors and faculty are very nice. The campus is beautiful and it is amazing. I am very happy I chose to go to Washburn University!
Sophomore,4,"Online learning is not my favorite part of school, but the teachers are doing their best to be accommodating to all the students. I would advise students to take at least a few online classes throughout their college career."
Junior,4,When I first got to Washburn it was difficult to find my way around because there were really no signs to show me but I have got it done now. Everyone is usually friendly and helps you out. The staff and teachers are nice. Not a lot of diversity on campus though.
Niche User,4,"Majority of the time the administration is knowledgeable on what I'm asking, and if they are unable to then they direct me to whom I can speak with. The instructors are wonderful with making sure to be there for the students. The classes are good size where the instructors are still able to provide one on one time with the students if needed. In addition to a wonderful student environment with food, drinks, and study areas."
Junior,4,"Great school, tight knit community. Most professors are nice and understanding! Would recommend attending if you want to build relationships with your professors!"
Sophomore,4,I thoroughly enjoy my professors. While classes are difficult you will come out of them retaining a lot of information. Intramural sports are easy to join and help you meet other students.
Sophomore,4,The teachers are very well diverse along with there students. Everyone is super helpful whenever you need something. My boyfriend earned a degree from here and now makes over $22 an hour. This school will help get the career you deserve.
Sophomore,4,"Washburn is a very pro-student success and they have many on-campus tutoring programs and an entire course required for Freshman students dedicated to educating them about how to pass their classes and succeed in college, meanwhile how to balance academic and social life."
Senior,4,"I like how small the school is and how involved professors are willing to help their students. 

Diversity could use some work"
Sophomore,4,"I have had a fairly good time being a student at Washburn University. My professors are all very patient, helpful, and understanding, and I greatly appreciate that. I have had great experiences while taking classes required for my major and look forward to furthering my education in that field at Washburn."
Senior,4,"Washburn University has been a great home to me for the last 3 years, and will continue to be my home through my final year of nursing school. Overall, the campus is presentable and easy to navigate. Fellow students are generally rather diverse and open to meeting others. Academics are astounding in terms of value for your money. I feel as if the knowledge I have gained directly applies to the career path I am pursing."
Sophomore,4,I like the small college atmosphere. Professors are great at connecting with students and being able to spend more time on individual students rather than just teaching their classes and leaving it as is.
Freshman,4,The students and staff are welcoming and supportive here. There is never a dull moment here on campus and there are plenty of clubs and events to make friends.
Sophomore,4,"I like the small class sizes, but the big university feel of campus. the professors are helpful, and knowledgeable. The overall atmosphere is welcoming and the advisors are helpful. I attended my nursing prerequisites here and will now be attending here for nursing school. I like how modern the facilities are, they have done a lot of remodeling, and improvements. they have a good science programs a nd have learned a lot in those classes"
Sophomore,4,"The courses are very challenging, but it is a very great atmosphere to learn in! The only complaint I would have would be the location, but that is something that Washburn University can't help. That, and the food here isn't good."
Niche User,4,"I really liked the positive energy that seems to radiate from the campus. This energy comes from the administration all the way down to the students themselves. It's a very welcoming and safe climate and campus that make you feel at home. I really enjoyed my campus visit and am seriously considering going to Washburn now. However, I have been taking concurrent credit through Washburn and have actually preformed at Washburn before."
Senior,4,I like the small class sizes because it allows for professors to get the time to know you and help you one on one. Diversity needs to grow at Washburn University.
Junior,4,"Washburn has a very friendly environment that is open and accepting to new students; especially the students and professors. At Washburn University, there is a lot of opportunity for growth and development as a person within the community."
Niche User,4,"I am currently going back to school at washburn after taking a 7 year hiatus. I was welcome back with open arms and the advisors there are great(mine in particular). I think Washburn is a good choice of college because of the value but also because they seem to care about their students. They have a lot of services for free like a gym on campus plus free classes at the gym, free tutoring,they have a health facility for students on campus(so of you have bad health care it's a plus for sure), activities on campus, ect. They want you to succeed and be the best student you can be. I for one am excited about going back to school. So if you are looking for a college, dont pass up Washburn University. Take a tour, who knows you might just decide to go there."
Senior,4,Love Washburn University! My experience here has been nothing but great! the staff and faculty are so supportive and both care about the success of the students! Faculty and staff will bend over backwards to ensure that they students are succeeding and excelling in school. Itâ€™s really like a family atmosphere and I love it.
Freshman,4,"Very personal experience, with small class sizes you have great access to professors. A university where a lot of people care."
Graduate Student,4,Website is a bit confusing.  Loved ease of coursework available. Flexibility and variety of study areas and courses were also great.  Would suggest anyone interested in online courses to take a look at everything Washburn University has to offer.
Freshman,4,"I have not attended to Washburn yet,  But I do have the high hopes of going to a program on the campus of Washburn University. I have heard amazing stuff about this university things such as they have tons of clubs. They also the biggest area of writing and library as well."
Sophomore,4,Washburn University provides a great student to teacher ratio as well as having an understanding staff to provide comfort and ease that you will succeed.
Freshman,4,"At Washburn University there are very friendly teachers that want you to succeed. Campus not very big, which in my opinion is great. Students are also very friendly! As a freshman everyone is very welcoming."
Senior,4,"Transferring to washburn, took some adjustments. However,  the professors are amazing,  these classes are small so the professor acually has time for their students."
Freshman,4,The campus is nice. I get a very friendly vibe. Calm. Easy Going. Medium School and Medium Class.  It has a very friendly and welcoming vibe. Very Honest and Calm Settings
Junior,4,The size of the classrooms is amazing. You actually get one on one time with your professors. The environment is so pleasant and nurturing to my learning experience.
Freshman,4,"Washburn is a good school, there is nothing I would change because they will help you through your journey."
Sophomore,4,"What I like about Washburn is that there are a lot of people willing to help you and wanting to see you graduate. They are helpful in as any ways as they can be and the majority of the staff is approachable when it come to any questions. The thing I would like to see change is to get more diversity into the school, even though they may be hard task but with outreach to more students while still in high school will help a lot."
Junior,4,"Washburn is a very friendly and open campus. All of the professors that I had were very helpful and always wanted to help as much as possible. One thing I would like to point out is that if you need handicap accommodations like elevators and automatic doors, that's hard to find in most buildings. However, there are a lot of activities and fun things to participate in on campus."
Junior,4,"I enjoy the professors at Washburn University. They are always willing to help you through coursework and any problems. Washburn also has plenty of options to become involved on campus. However at night I don't feel safe on campus, there are not enough lights on paths and parking lots."
Sophomore,4,"Washburn is a ver friendly campus that is right next to home. And its good for people who want to attend a university but dont want to pay $20,000 a year for it."
Sophomore,4,"Very wide range of clubs/organizations, most faculty care about you and take time out of their day to help you (especially ones in your major field), small enough to make good connections with friends and staff/faculty but big enough to get a good feel for college and being on your own, very clean and taken care of

Not very good school spirit unfortunately, overpriced food, parking can be problematic (not enough or not in a convenient place)"
Senior,4,"The best thing that I liked about Washburn was that everyone and everything on campus was close. There were always people to talk to if you needed help with something and also had very good security on campus. If anything, I would change the food served in the cafeterias."
Freshman,4,I chose Washburn because of the hands on staff that had my best interest in mind. Since attending Washburn the staff and faculty have only exceeded my expectations.
Sophomore,4,Washburn has been a great experience for me so far. The professors make sure you succeed at everything you do. The different organizations  and diversity on campus make it a great place to be a part of. There are clubs for everyone to participate in and enjoy to complete their college experience.
Freshman,4,"One of the best things about Washburn University is that the staff and professors are always ready to help you with any kind of issue that you may have. Whether that would be with having trouble learning new information or with just enrolling for classes. Washburn also offers many different services to make sure students are in a good mindset and are not too stressed from tests or finals. My favorite example of this is during finals week, the University brings puppies and kittens on Campus for students to interact and play with to relieve some of the stress from preparing for finals. I love how the University does little things like this to ensure that their students are happy. It shows that this college does care about each student and not about the money."
Senior,4,"I love going to school and being involved in grouos on campus. I love that it only takes about 10 mins to walk from one side of campus to the other! I enjoy that it's a small campus and a small school, but it gives you a good quality education that you'd expect from a larger school."
Senior,4,"Great school! Affordable. Not too big, not too small. Yet there are some degree programs that a pretty small and have few varieties of courses or few professors to teach the material. But many of the professors are great teachers whom care about their students!"
Senior,4,Washburn offers a great education at a very affordable cost. The professors really care about the success of their students. There is plenty of great activities and events for students on campus. I enjoyed my four years at Washburn.
Freshman,4,"While Washburn isn't the most known college; especially for out of state folks, I think it's a great school. The teachers really do seem like they want you to be as successful as possible. The advisers are super helpful if you're confused about your path to graduation. Living on campus is fun, I just wish they had a little more to do on or around campus."
Freshman,4,"Nice teachers, helpful staff and overall very understanding . Things could be a little wider known and information more accessible to students."
Freshman,4,I have enjoyed my time at Washburn so far. The campus is very pretty and clean and the students are generally quite nice. It's quiet and chill on the weekends. People travel a lot to other school and cities to party and hang out with their friends. The professors I've had so far have shown interest in their students and worked to help them through the classes.
Senior,4,Washburn is an amazing University located in the capital city of Kansas. The campus is not that big so it's easy to find your way around. The class size is small so you really have a chance to connect with your instructor and peers. Washburn also has great athletics and awesome school spirit.
Sophomore,4,"I liked it, but not many areas to get involved. People don't really participate in anything. Not a big athletic scene and parties are on the down low"
Junior,4,"Overall, Washburn University is a great school with many possible great opportunities. There is a huge staff available to provide you with assistance including academic and applying for financial aid. In addition, the university police is very friendly and can even help you change a flat tire or jump-start your car."
Sophomore,4,So far at Washurn I have had a wonderfully experience. All of the teachers I have had have been willing to help and explain if you are not understanding and they are easy to communicate with via email or office hours.
Junior,4,Washburn has a great small community feel to it. The class sizes are small and the education is individualized. Every student gets the attention they need from professors.
Freshman,4,Washburn overall was a good school. There was not much to do there. There was a lot of Asia and Middle Eastern Students there. The people were friendly. Classrooms good size. Food was okay I've had worse.
Senior,4,The Biology Department and staff at Washburn are amazing. They are extremely caring and available for one-on-one interactions. They are always there to answer your questions without making you feel dumb.
Freshman,4,I loved the small class sizes and my professors got to know me and they really cared. However it's a very small school.
Senior,4,"So far Washburn has been great! The campus is kept clean, and anywhere you want to go is just a short walking distance. The staff and students have all been friendly. The teachers are helpful and will work with you on problems that you may have."
Freshman,4,"Washburn is a great place to be if you are looking for academics. I live in the dorms, and haven't had the best experience because I live with strong willed people, but the other people I have met, are amazing!"
Senior,2,"Itâ€™s okay but Washburn has a lot of zoom problems with connection and wifi. If you donâ€™t have wifi or connection to do zoom classes, you will not get help whatsoever by your professors. They will tell you, oh well, you should get wifi, even though they know some students canâ€™t afford it. If you donâ€™t have wifi, you might as well live on campus. They should do this with professors too because some professors donâ€™t have good wifi ethier. Oh and tutoring over zoom is a big joke."
College Freshman,2,There is almost no emphasis on sports at this school.
College Freshman,2,"ALL chain restaurants- Applebee's, Chili's, etc."
College Freshman,2,expensive and the food is not clean
College Junior,2,They didn't give me money one time when it said i had a couple thousand available.
College Sophomore,2,Topeka is a dead city
College Freshman,2,"There really is not a lot of clubbing and bars in topeka. You can definitely find some and they are cheap but the real partying is in lawrence so many of us drive over to other places or keep the partying on campus, not that there is a lot of partying anyway. Partying is not that important on campus because most students are very focused on academics."
College Senior,2,"The options are very expensive. They have also reduced from last year. There is only one company who is allowed to provide food on campus. The meal plans also dont carry over to the next year. If it is the end of the year and you have money left on your meal plan, you lose it."
College Junior,2,Topeka is not a very safe town therefore I refuse to participate int he nightlife. The areas that I could participate in are located in some of the known worse areas in the city.
College Student,2,"The psych department is in my opinion subpar. In the psych classes I've taken, they are either dumbed down or are unnecessarily hard. I don't see much opportunity for career advancement after school. The workload is etiher ridiculous or nonexistent depending on the class. It is definitely focused on research here. That is not what I wanted to do."
College Student,2,"It's good if you know the right people. If you don't, then you're not gonna find anything. Even if you know the right people, there's no guarantee you'll get in the party. There is a lot of ""small drinking sessions"" and parties run by people who only let girls in on it. So overall it's kinda garbage. A lot of people here don't even party after the first week."
College Student,2,"It is Topeka. I don't know why the people at Washburn say they want to leave it so much yet still go to Washburn. There isn't much to do, which is odd considering it's a small city. Luckily Lawrence and Kansas City aren't super far away"
College Student,2,"Dorms are really nice but you don't really meet too many people in them, which is kind of their purpose. People stay in their rooms, hang with roomates/people they already know prior to college, etc. But there are a few exceptions to this. Unlike me, if you're just looking for a place to live, Washburn has nice dorms"
College Student,2,Unfortunately nobody really cares about the athletics on our campus. It is a pity because some of them are actually pretty good. As far as facilities they are ok.
College Student,2,"Honestly, I hate this place. Washburn acts like it's such an amazing school. However, unless you're in a business or pre-med major, I have no idea why anyone would go here. Even then KU has better programs in both those areas and it's only 15-30 minutes away. The classes I've taken include a lot of busy work, with very little actual learning taking place. The social scene is a joke. Topeka sucks. While others may see good in Washburn, I honestly do not. I am transferring to another school and am glad I'm doing so."
College Student,2,"A lot of people who go here are non-trads. Of the traditional students, many are from Topeka or the surrounding area. That said, the people here are very cliquey and secluded. If you are not from the Topeka area, don't expect a very welcoming place. Most of the people here leave campus after class or stay in their rooms. While there are a few genuine girls I have met here, most of them are taken. Of the single ones, most are stuck-up, often with unrealistically high opinions of themselves and their attractiveness. It's the same way with the guys for the most part. As a whole, people here, with some exceptions, have been pretty unfriendly in the time I've been here. Washburn is definitely a place where to partake in the social scene that is there you need to know a lot of people on campus prior to coming."
College Student,2,Nobody does much of any drug here. Unless it's alcohol. If you do something other than alcohol you get judged a lot. If you do use any drugs be careful. Sometimes I feel the only reason the cops are here is to bust the unsuspecting toker.
College Sophomore,2,There's not much to do.
College Freshman,2,Don't come to school thinking that it will be easy to get away with. The school has had several drug busts already and are willing to continue doing so.
College Freshman,2,I haven't heard of or been to any parties this year. Any parties that are held you have to know someone that is close to the groups involved.
College Sophomore,2,There are not very many bars or clubs to choose from in Topeka and Washburn is not a huge party school.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Rip off prices.  Think 6"" sub for $7.  Closes around 8 or 9 (been awhile) most nights except on the weekends - 5 every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday."
College Sophomore,2,Most of the guys here are stuck up and have no interest in most girls on campus. Except one night flings.
College Sophomore,2,I am not 21 and I do not drink. The nightlife as an underage is fine for me though because I just study and play pokemon with my roommate.
College Junior,2,Topeka is a pretty big city. There is always a lot of things to do in topeka. The only problem is it really isn't a college town. Most people go to Lawrence or Manhattan on the weekend if they want the college experience.
College Junior,2,"On campus, there are designated smoking areas that most people go to when smoking a cigarette. No drinking happens on campus to my knowledge, or that I see. But i know that off campus drinking and alcoholic activities happen quite a bit."
College Student,2,"The drug scene at Washburn University isn't huge at all, maybe in the areas surrounding campus. But I have never seen use of drugs on campus"
College Freshman,2,"Guys at washburn are very outgoing, Girls don't participate as much as guys"
College Senior,2,"Most of the frats and sororities at Washburn think that if you're not in one you're not really living the college experience. I haven't even thought of being in one and after seeing the way some of them act, I feel glad I never did. I'm enjoying college even without being in one!"
College Junior,2,I received a ticket for parking in a handicap parking space 178.00 it cost me because why? I am disabled but I don't have a handicap sticker to prove it I was told by students and staff members that after 5 it was okay to park there and I thought wow because I don't like walking in the dark and there are no police when us women come out of class at night. There should be campus police around we should not have to worry if we are not safe.  I don't know one of the problems that is talked about in the forum is under age drinking sexual assault and violence on campus.
College Junior,2,"Now I am not trying to make the school look good but when I walked into the cafeteria I was just without words and then it was what in the world am I going to eat there was so much and not just the quality it was the quantity there were so many different bars, stations where they were serving different types of food awesome is the word why leave campus when you have what you need there. 

The C grade is because the only thing close to the campus is a quick shop and then further away a Sonic any place else one would not have time to get back. 

Again AWSOME and DELICIOUS"
College Junior,2,Weather is always changing. Very hot and very cold temperatures.
College Junior,2,"I really don't like Washburn's Financial aid policy for transfer students who have previously attended a 4-year university.  These students are ineligable for all incoming scholarships, even if they have high GPA's test scores, were in honors programs, or members of PTK."
College Freshman,2,The bars in Topeka are really difficult to find and also hard to get into at times.
College Sophomore,2,"It is easy to drink on campus especially if you are in the dorms, but I wouldn't recommend it just because of the fine. Most alcohol or drug use goes on off campus."
College Student,2,The computer labs at Washburn are always crowded and full. It is always hard to find a computer to use. Lots of students use the computer labs instead of bringing or using there own personal computers. This is a big problem to me.
College Freshman,2,"There is one computer lab on campus and there are about 200 in the library. They are always occupied. The network is average, for Dell's anyway, but the six Macs are good. I would recommend a personal computer. Printing is free in the library, so it would not be necessary to purchase one."
College Freshman,2,"The only thing to do close to campus is karaoke at a bar on Friday nights. Other than that, it's a ten minute drive to restaurants like Spangles and KFC. It's a fifteen minute drive to Target and Wal-Mart. Other than that, there's nothing else to do. This school is definitely for commuter / local Topeka students only."
College Freshman,2,Lower division courses are easier than high school classes. This school lacks academic rigor. I feel like I was sent back to high school.
College Freshman,2,Lower division classes and teachers are terrible. There is little classroom management in these courses. The students are disruptive and disrespectful during class. I'd say 75% of students text throughout an entire class. If they are not texting they are carrying full on conversations throughout the lecture with their neighbours. 
Junior,1,"I was so excited to be going back to school but this school was not very informative when you enroll, they didn't offer me recommendations when I dropped out and they did not care that  I told them I struggle from mental illness and offered me no accommodations nor did they inform me to fill out a form they have if you have a disability. I would have not returned to this school but I am determined to finish my associate's degree. I went to Washburn Tech in Topeka, I had no issues that is a WONDERFUL technical college. The staff and teeachers there actually care of you succeed."
Junior,1,"Kandace mars: total liar. Richard Liedtke: corrupt adminstrator at Washburn who claimed I was harassing his financial aid department. Completely false.

The Chief of Police there threatened me with trespassing charges before I was suspended. I filed a police report about this. I just emailed the city prosecutor today about an incident where the Washburn Campus Police arrested me at the Topeka Public Library. I wish someone would have warned me about the place. They ultimately did me a favor though, wouldn't want my name anywhere near theirs on a degree."
College Sophomore,1,The financial aid office is very rude and not helpful even in the slightest.
Recent Alumnus,1,Topeka is a great bedroom and back yard community for families.  It is struggling with its identity to support a modern university. You really have to work to find things to do and the conservative nature of the town really affects and great night life programming.
College Junior,1,The bars are very sketchy and transportation is an issue. The campus is on a very bad side of town also. Cops are assholes so parties get busted usually and underage students get MIPS.
College Junior,1,"The campus is surrounded by bad areas of town, the bars are all very sketchy, and the restaurants close early. The cops are assholes so house parties get busted a lot."
College Junior,1,"There are two places to eat; the Corner Store (like the store at a gas station) and the Union Market (cafeteria).  The food offered at the UM is not extremely diverse, tends to be expensive, and is not the most appealing.  All students who live on campus, even in the apartment style housing with a full kitchen, are required to have meal plans, which are a la carte.  Although the unspent portion of the meal plan carries over to the Spring semester, at the end of the academic year, what isn't used is lot.  In other words, use it or lose it."
College Student,1,Parking on the Washburn campus is extremely hard to find. Students usually park on the streets so they are not spending all day looking and waiting for a parking spot to open up.
College Freshman,1,"Don't expect to get a computer in the library during the day. Every single one is occupied. About 30% of the people using the computer are either on Facebook, Youtube or playing games, which is really annoying when you need to work on an assignment or print an essay. "
College Freshman,1,"Though the staff are incredibly friendly, work hard, and provide excellent customer service, the food is revolting and the seating is horrific at noon. Unlike other universities, Washburn dining charges by the item, rather than by the meal. You have to be extremely selective with your choices in order to make your meal plan last for the semester. To make matters worse, there are very few options to choose from. There is a pasta and salad bar, sandwich station, and fried foods. Occasionally they will offer a special, (homestyle meal like chicken, mash and veg), but it's very expensive, an average of $7 a plate. The only okay thing about the dining is the wide variety of coffee and like beverages at The Corner Store. "
College Freshman,1,Procrastination Is Not Good! I applied after the deadline for scholarships for the FASFA so I only got 1 scholarship instead of more. Then I realized that the code for my school was wrong so I had to go back and change that. After that I began the Financial Aid process with my school and it took a very long time. I am now awaiting my status. I hope I qualify for a grant or I will need to drop out of school.
College Junior,1,The staff of the center is rude and not of good quality.  The 'doctor' or more likely nurse practitioner has incorrectly diagnosed me and classmates so many times and so horribly we stopped going to the health center.
College Freshman,1,"Night Life â€“ There honestly isnt much night life. Washburn is located in Topeka ,Kansas and there just isnt much for anyone at any age to do after ten o' clock . Its a sad but most students go to KU or KSU to party or go out."
College Sophomore,1,"Poor Town â€“ I have lived in the Kansas City metro area for nearly 8 years and going from that town be it the wide variety of nightlife, daytime things to do, places to go etc... Topeka pretty much shuts down at 7pm aside from the EXTREMELY POOR mall the town has which stays open til 9pm which is more where the suspect characters go when they are not out on the streets here."
College Freshman,1,The incoming freshman at Washburn usually party a lot. Some even go out every night.
College Freshman,1,"Very Boring â€“ This school has a serious lack of a social scene.  Many students who reside on campus go home on the weekends, and those that don't are either Greek or they hang around Topeka partying and drinking.  Those students who prefer not to drink do not stay around since there are rarely any activities planned on the weekends."

Graduate Student,5,WMU has provided me with incredible opportunities to further my education and giving me hands on experience in my field.
Sophomore,5,I love Western they are so open to everyone! The way the campus is set up makes it perfect for the town it’s in! When you enter the campus it feels like you are in a whole different little town! I love how so far all of my teachers just want the best for their students. I love that the campus just feels like comfort too. One change I would make is parking there is just not enough.
Alum,5,"I didn't take any courses online, it was not offered at the time that I was going through college. Though I am sure that it is a great feature for many nowadays."
Alum,5,"Western Michigan was the perfect mix of small enough to meet and know many students and large enough to not know everyone. I loved living on campus, working at the cafe, meeting new friends and experience all that Western had to offer back in 1998."
Freshman,5,My professors have been very helpful with the new elearning system. They have explained it throughly.
Freshman,5,My counselors and teachers have helped me navigate the college life. They are super helpful and you can tell they care about their students.
Sophomore,5,I have enjoyed my online experience at western. The platform we use for classes is very user friendly and easy to navigate.
Sophomore,5,"I’m very glad I chose to go to Western. I’m studying music and their program is phenomenal. The campus is the perfect size. It’s big enough to feel like a large school, but not so big that you are overwhelmed."
Freshman,5,At Western University the campus is beautiful. This college is 100% an ally to all minorities. I love this campus.
Freshman,5,The proffessors are great at communicating. They help me through every step of the way. They take one on one time out of their day to help their students. they truly care
Freshman,5,"I personally highly recommend this college for anyone. At Western Michigan University there are loads of opportunities to grow in both your career and the community. The diverse selection of degrees ranging from fine art and childhood education, to business and law school the options are endless. Because of Western Michigan University being a Public college, The tuition fees are much lower compared to a private college (the price is basically cut in half). Now all this is great but I am yet to mention the variety of clubs and after school activities that are presented to you as a part of the Bronco community. There are many options here from fun board games groups to running and casual and competitive sports. As for the staff at the school, well the easiest way to say this is... they are amazing and are super helpful for any problems that need to be solved or questions that need to be asked they are right there whenever you need them. Overall WMU is great and accepting to anyone."
Junior,5,"I will be graduating Western Michigan University in 2021, so far my experience has been near perfect. No complaints!"
Freshman,5,Amazing the school is the best school in Michigan! I enjoy studying here and living on the campus and meeting new people.
Freshman,5,Campus was amazing! I loved the way everything ran so smoothly and taught me everything I need to know today!
Freshman,5,This is an amazing school with such a great campus. The campus is small enough where it is easy to make so many close friends and get to one side of campus to another within a reasonable amount of time!
Freshman,5,Taking classes online is easy as can be! There is an online portal on the website that makes it easy to follow each class.
Freshman,5,"What I like most about Western Michigan University is the diversity, growing up I was placed in a predominantly white school district. There were small percentages of an other races such as black, mexican, or german, etc. I would see people from different countries come and go. Though when I came to western the community for me acted as a remedy not only for my career but my mentality as well. I'd made friends who are from vietnam and other states such as indiana and florida. It made me feel like there was more than what I was used to. I felt as though even though i wasn't used to the culture differences that this university was definatly going to be my home. The professors there are either graduate students around the same age or people who are married with children who love working at western. I love how understanding everyone is there and how leanient everyone functions. If I were to change something about Western Michigan University I would want to change the meals for health."
Senior,5,"I love the professors that I've had while attending online and in-person through this institution. While on campus, I was able to meet some amazing people from other countries and make some really great friends. Some of my closest friends were residents of my floor and my roommate. There is so much diversity here and there are so many amazing course offerings here available for any and everyone."
Freshman,5,"I will be entering in the Fall 2020 as a Freshmen.  I really liked the Campus Tour and the feel of the small home like environment at the dorms.  The Campus appears to be easy to navigate around and offers many activities on campus. Several dining options, an amazing Gym to help students stay fit, and a lot of new construction to benefit the students.  The curriculum offered for the students is very diverse.  I am very excited to be a Bronco and look forward to an amazing year."
Junior,5,"Western Michigan University is always willing to help when student are in need. Whether it be tuition, housing, classes they’ve been able to help most students when they’re in need."
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Western Michigan University. All of my professors have really cared about their students understanding of the class materials and take interest in getting to know us on a personal level. I have also met some of my best friends at this University. I cannot wait for quarantine to be over, so I can move back to campus in the Fall."
Freshman,5,"The campus is absolutely beautiful and the surrounding area is full of life and activities. The other students are very friendly and welcoming, and the advisors are very helpful. I have felt incredibly rewarded and impressed by each of my classes and professors I have had so far at WMU."
Sophomore,5,Western is great school where I learned a lot about my major but also myself. I made some of my best friends there.
Freshman,5,"I am a freshman at Western Michigan University. The campus is fantastic, and it is right in downtown Kalamazoo!"
Freshman,5,I really appreciated how warmly I was welcomed and the many opportunities to be engaged.  I feel like I am part of a community.
Sophomore,5,"Western Michigan can be a wonderful undergraduate experience if you are serious about your major, have plenty of goals, and get to know your professors."
Sophomore,5,The people here are so welcoming and kind. The professors care about your education and the overall campus is beautiful and makes me feel very safe!
Alum,5,"Mostly great professors. Campus has a ton of new renovations and lots of fun ways to get involved and meet new people. I love how much help there is in the area with school, finances, etc. Most professors want you to succeed and it’s an overall great school! Student life is so much fun and Kalamazoo is such a cute city with lots to do. Very diverse and welcoming feel as well. Freshman year is such a great experience and there’s so many degrees to choose from. If you’re someone who doesn’t know what they want to do, there’s help to get you to a point where you’ll get it figured out. Lots of scholarship opportunities too!"
Freshman,5,I have truly enjoyed my experience at WMU so far. It is a very welcoming place and it is easy to have fun and make friends. All of my classes are meaningful and I have liked most of my teachers. The dorms and dinning centers are only good in very specific places.
Freshman,5,I like the diverse amount of students at WMU and the fact that they not only accept but embrace and value people's different opinions and values. I love how the business program is set up and I feel like my professors really want me to learn and not just teach a difficult class that no one will pass.
Sophomore,5,"I liked the atmosphere of people being welcomed despite the differences people had. They have a wonderful dance department as well which I had a lot of interest in, the changes that I would like to see are the professors being more caring and maybe housing situations. With housing for students who are rape victims just have accommodations for them to feel more comfortable and safe in the environment."
Junior,5,"My experience has definitely been a great college experience. I like how WMU is so diverse you get the opportunity to learn more about the different cultures, also it is so many things to do on campus if you are trying to get more involved"
Freshman,5,"Western Michigan University has a huge focus on diversity and community, making everybody feel welcome. There are plenty of registered student organizations offered, and most people can find at least one they are interested in. The academic advisors are supportive and always trying to help you to the best of their ability"
Freshman,5,I would like to see the parking system change.  Many students have a car with them and parking for class is often a struggle.  The campus feels very safe and is easy to maneuver around.  Finding classes is easy as many buildings are near the dorms and it is always well lit.
Freshman,5,"I feel that being a freshman at WMU I feel that I have had a great first semester on campus. I have gotten a chance to meet many great professors who have given me the tools to be successful at college. One of my professors I would like to highlight is Mr. Doug who is a professor of the major LBS. I remember how I email him about interest and he was very excited to invite me into his office and talk about the new major. Then, he introduced me to the seniors in the major and those people became some of my closest friends and people I communicate with the most because I could see their passion as a freshman and it motivated me to want to achieve more and to pursue the major even more. Also, One association I'm apart of is my SBMA association which was great for me because the leaders of the organization are very respectable people and welcomed me in as a freshman, they have also given me opportunities to grow in my development within the organization and as a person in general."
Freshman,5,"WMU has a very nice campus, all within walking distance. The food is ok as some dining halls have better food than others. The only thing that I wish was better was the party scene"
Alum,5,"Looking into Western Michigan as a possible future education option for me, and going onto campus was mesmerizing.  You quickly notice how all students on campus work together, to help everyone there reach their dreams, and improve the goals they are striving for. Western Michigan has so much to offer on and off campus, including cheap concerts for artist that our generation enjoys, like Panic! At The Disco and Lil Yachty. Before I visited Western, I was wary about what the future held for me, but now I feel more prepared and excited than I have ever been before."
Junior,5,"Western is a very good fit for anyone who is passionate about Psychology and Anthropology.  The institution is in the midst of becoming increasingly progressive and provides ample resources and opportunities for one's future and/or potential career pathway. I have greatly enjoyed my experience there thus far.  I am a transfer student from Kalamazoo Valley Community College, so this is my junior year, as well as my first semester on campus.  Within  just my first semester, I have acquired many networking opportunities and met many amazing scholars and professionals.  I am very much looking forward to my future within this institution."
Niche User,5,"I have only been on a tour of the school seeing as I am still a senior in high school, but my personal experience being on campus and meeting some of the students, staff, and teachers has been excellent. They are very kind and helpful. the campus is very nice, they have some really modern buildings set for new student of the future like me. The housing looks pretty good where I could see myself staying there for 4 years."
Junior,5,Western is a great school. They offer a wide variety of programs with experienced professors at the head of each class. It is a great environment for learning. Diversity is always welcomed and celebrated at WMU. I cannot say enough good things about the professors I’ve had in my program. They’re genuinely passionate about their work and they care deeply for their students.
Sophomore,5,"Western offered a very easy and understandable application process, making it a very easy and smooth process."
Freshman,5,"All of the professors are very kind and care for miles about the work we do and our success. There are nearly unlimited amounts of ways to find help, and the beautiful campus is wonderful to just walk around when you need a break from your work!"
Sophomore,5,"As a current member of the U.S. Armed Forces, it was nice to be welcomed into a school with open arms, not only by the admissions personnel, but by the Military Liaison for the school. The Liaison made my process for applying into the school very easy and without stress."
Sophomore,5,"Being a transfer sophomore, I haven't been attending long but I do know I enjoy this University much better than Eastern Mich. The campus is a lot nicer and safer. The overall attitude of people and the community of it all is overall very positive and I feel very welcomed"
Niche User,5,Great Campus! Every tool you'd need is available to learn and grow academically. Great staff that cares about their students!
Freshman,5,This is a very unique school with students of all backgrounds. The camps is beautiful and the professors are very committed.
Freshman,5,"WMU It is a very friendly environment, teachers and staff are always willing to assist the students with anything needed, from tutoring, to selecting a Major or minor."
Junior,5,"I love the university! It’s such a great welcoming campus, with great professors. The professors excel to get you the right tools you need to succeed! Western is a very welcoming community and very much accommodating to each individual student’s needs."
Senior,5,"I am a new transfer to Western Michigan, and so far everyone has been so helpful with my transfer process."
Freshman,5,Western Michigan University is a place where all students can excel. The Campus is amazing and the faculty are all able to be available for you whenever you need it.
Junior,5,"I'm a business major at WMU and I love it there. There are numerous academic resources and most professors go out of their way for students to succeed. Yes, there are the professors who still do not like technology that much, but with all of my professors I have hit the jackpot. I love the friends that I have gained while going here and I love living on campus. My campus is beautiful and all of my classes are within a walking distance. The only downside is that the university doesn't always close for snow even if all of the schools and businesses in the surrounding area are closed. There were many students who couldn't even get their cars out of their driveways this past winter because of the heavy snowfall."
Sophomore,5,Great party school and great body of students can’t wait to come back and visit to party. Tailgates and Thursday nights are some of the best you can get
Freshman,5,I will be moving in on August 24th. I am very excited to meet new people and learn with new experiences. I have stayed at the university over night for orientation and loved!
Junior,5,"I'm actually just transferring to Western Michigan University this fall, but I have had the opportunity to get engaged in student life there while I was at a community college close by. I have attended hockey and football games, joined a club and found a whole community, been to Broadway shows such as the Phantom of the Opera at their very own Miller Auditorium. The campus is so diverse in people and activities that there is something for everyone. The campus activities and lifestyle at WMU are what made me sure about continuing my education there and I’m so excited for go back to school believe it or not."
Freshman,5,"I like the campus here a lot.  It is beautiful, and it is so easy to get from place to place.  The security is also great here; you always feel safe.  I also have amazing advisors; they are so kind and helpful which is such a blessing.  I have not been here long, but I know that I made a good choice on my college.  There is not much I would change about it."
Sophomore,5,I currently am a Music Education Major and I absolutely love it here at Western! The faculty is amazing and the course work is  relevant. Would highly recommend this university.
Freshman,5,Western Michigan is a great school . The staff is very understanding and nice. The campus is beautiful.
Junior,5,"I love everything about Western Michigan University. I have made many new friends and the campus is beautiful. If i were to change one thing it would be big lecture hall class sizes. But, being as WMU has a high amount of students they do a good job at keeping relatively small class size which is better for the learning environment."
Freshman,5,I LOVED everything about Western! I worked 2 jobs there and lived on campus. I was on the travel soccer team and met so many different people while there. I honestly wouldn't change anything about this campus. I think it is a perfect campus all the way around.
Sophomore,5,"In high school I was not very social and did not have many friends. I felt that not many people shared my interest. However after just a few months at Western I met all kinds of different people who had the same interest as me, and slowly I started to go out more with these people. Now I can say with a doubt that with out Western Michigan I wouldn't have the friends or social life I have now."
Freshman,4,"Beautiful campus, good food, great friends. That hard part is learning online during the covid pandemic. They do their best."
Alum,4,"Western is a great school for the cost. While financial aid can be harder to come by, the cost of the school is lower than many other institutions who offer the same quality of programs. They still have work to do on student support services and helping ensure students graduate within 4 years. There is great school spirit. The environment is an encouraging one that promotes learning and scholarship."
Junior,4,"I love the environment of WMU. I enjoy all of the things it has to offer. However, I feel as though opportunity for scholarship for the school is rather low, and the buildings in some cases are out of date."
Junior,4,"Overall a good university, they offer a variety of programs and on-campus activities. There are lots of opportunities to get help from the staff on campus.  The dorms are not the best, the rooms are small and tend to get too hot and the food at the cafeteria is not very good depending on where you go."
Junior,4,"WMU offers some really great programs ranging from computer tech to anthropology and archaeology.  They also have some brilliant professors like Jon Holtzman and David Benac working there.  However, they also have some not so great professors on pay roll.  So, definitely do your homework and ask around before registering for certain classes.  Overall its a good school with a lot of good people and amazing programs."
Senior,4,I have taken a few classes online at Western and depending on the professor it is very easy to do well. The school usually offers an in-class version as well as online so depending on how well you learn and easy it is to pick up information taking online classes is a great way to allow yourself to have time to do other things while still earning an amazing education.
Senior,4,My experience so far at Western Michigan University has been amazing. The school is so helpful and has many resources to help you do your best. I've met some amazing people and built lasting relationships during my time here. The professors are amazing and try their best to help you thrive.
Freshman,4,"I really love the campus and the kindness of everyone there, I just wish there was more to do around the area."
Freshman,4,"The online experience was well, the professors are very nice and also very understanding of everything that is going on. I love the school."
Freshman,4,"I enjoyed the diverse nature of the students attending the school, but it feels like some of the dorms and campus buildings are a little dated and they could use a renovation."
Freshman,4,"Since covid-19 I had to take all of my courses online and it wasn't half bad. Most of my professors helped all students including myself by staying in touch through email and using our online source through e-learning. Only one of my teachers sometimes emailed us when we had questions or to notify us of an upcoming test. Though it was harder to take a math class online because I was used to going to bronco study zone for tutoring, yet because there weren't any online tutoring available at the times i needed it just wasn't convenient. So I had to mostly go through one on one tutoring online with my professor who always was willing to help me out because of my being dyslexic with numbers. Though overall my experience was positive and I would recommend taking westerns online course if you have don't have lots of time in the day and need something expeditious."
Senior,4,I didn't start to take classes online until COVID but WMU has been very considerate and helpful along the way.
Senior,4,"Professors want to help but sometimes they don't always have the time with bigger lectures;however, there are tons of resources around campus to help with a multitude of subjects."
Graduate Student,4,"Western Michigan University is a good university. It offers a lot of academic programs and student life activities. There are many different options for students to get and stay connected to other students on/off campus. The Kalamazoo area is not the safest, but as long as you are smart, it will not be a problem. The university built new dorms when I started my freshman year, and they were very nice. They are now building more student housing. Recently, they are continuing to update campus and have many great ideas, so I am excited to see how they all turn out when I come back as an alum!"
Freshman,4,"Western Michigan overall is a great school! I recommend anyone looking for a medium size school to really look into this school! I love the campus, it is very welcoming and gorgeous. I will say while on campus is very safe and I have not experienced any unsafe events, the area around campus is not so safe. You will hear of many robberies, shooting and car theft."
Junior,4,Professors are very passionate and overall effective in their teaching methods. The social aspect of the school is amazing and I absolutely love it. The food and housing were average and the cost could be worse. I overall love my school and I am glad i made this choice.
Sophomore,4,"Western Michigan University, education can vary with different professors. Just like our first twelve years we have had those great and not so great teachers. Western has its great professors and some not so great; however, they are always willing to help you. If they know they aren't helping you comprehend the material they will point you to a different directions; whether its my seeking a different professor or a student who is able to teach the material, until you come to understand the material. Western Michigan University campus is definitely breathtaking, and if you don't feel like staying on campus, the university is in the heart of the city of Kalamazoo. There is a variety of things to do in Kalamazoo, it is definitely a city for students. This university in addition, is very diverse!"
Alum,4,"Over all I don't have many complaints about Western Michigan University. I had a great experience and feel that I learned a lot along the way. The one complaint I do have is that for the first 3 years of my experience there I had an advisor who was instructing me to take my required classes in an order that was prolonging my graduation date and I have no idea. Thankfully my 4th year I got a new advisor who helped me out a lot and fought very hard to get me back on track, she even wrote a letter to the board to get me permitted to take specific classes I needed over the summer, although that was not aloud, in order to get me graduated on time. She definitely made up for the mistakes of my previous advisor."
Senior,4,Great staff and learning opportunities; facilities are always kept clean and orderly; feel very supported by professors and other faculty
Senior,4,Western Michigan's campus culture is very accepting and inviting. I have been able to grow as a person by meeting and interacting with different people from diverse backgrounds. There are many opportunities to become involved on campus.
Freshman,4,Western is a wonderful university! There are so many opportunities for students to be involved and to be successful as students!
Freshman,4,"This University has it all. Great academics, great campus food if you know where to go, an amazing sports facility, great clubs, spectacular party scene, and great location. I am a freshmen at this University and I definitely will be attending again next fall."
Alum,4,"Beautiful campus, updates being made regularly. Good size, not too big and not too small with plenty of going on for minority populations."
Junior,4,"I love WMU because it is a division one university that is very diverse. There are all types of people that attend WMU. There is a good balance between males and females, a good balance between race and religion, and there are all different types of clubs and activities as well."
Sophomore,4,"I love some of the professors at WMU, and my advisors are the best! Of course college is expensive but watch out for parking services because they will ticket you! Other than that I love WMU"
Senior,4,Western has been a very high quality experience for me. The instructors have a lot of real life experience that they incorporate into the classroom. I have been able to apply the material I have learned into my experiences. The campus life is fun too!
Sophomore,4,Overall I enjoy my school there are minor changes to be made. Such as campus food and being more diverse to the different types of students' food choices. I also would like to see an improvement in student parking there are limited places for students to park and causes students to get tickets. Lastly a closer look at the professors and there teaching styles and student comprehension.
Alum,4,"I loved my time at WMU. I made priceless friends and memories there. I majored in Philosophy and really enjoyed it. All of my philosophy profs were intelligent, willing to help and generally open minded and understanding people. WMU allowed me to study abroad in Germany for a semester which was awesome. The dorms were pretty standard (lived in valley 3 as a freshman). Food on campus is usually good and there are always plenty of options available. Some of the buildings need updating (Dunbar, Moore) but generally the facilities are all up to date and well kept. Party scene is wild- there are always house parties to go to and plenty of college bars around campus and downtown. Football tailgates and hockey games are both a good time. I always felt very safe during my time at Western- as long as you’re being smart you should be good. The only real complaints I have about WMU are that the academic advisers were not good at their jobs, and the parking on campus is very limited/ expensive."
Senior,4,"If I was a college student living in the dorms, I probably would have had more solid college experiences. I spent a lot of the time going to work and loved the time I spent in my program. I'm an Arts Management major and absolutely adored everything about the Gilmore Theatre Complex and Miller Auditorium. The College of Fine Arts was good for me, and I spent a lot of time hanging out in Waldo Library. I wish they were open longer hours of the night for those pulling all-nighters. Avoid the Y bar and 13 Twenty Four Apartments, there are a few shootings in those areas."
Junior,4,"I like the diverse amount of students at WMU and the fact that they not only accept but embrace and value people's different opinions and values. The professors are great. Campus has a ton of new renovations and lots of fun ways to get involved and meet new people. I love how much help there is in the area with school, finances, etc. Most professors want you to succeed and it’s an overall great school! Student life is so much fun and Kalamazoo is such a cute city with lots to do. Very diverse and welcoming feel as well."
Sophomore,4,"Western Michigan University has a unique student body, as a high percentage of students are commuters. I am an English major, and I have loved all of my teachers so far. They genuinely care for their students. As for social life, I've heard the parties are amazing, but I'm not really into that ;)"
Freshman,4,I like the community and educational standards. I am in the School of Music and the level of personal growth and musical growth is tremendous.
Sophomore,4,"As a second-year student here at Western Michigan University I have been able to engage and interact with many people and organizations.  Although I have every intent to graduate from this institution I am never the less too full of school-pride to point out the few things I have noticed that Western lacks in my time here. 
Diversity being a major one, with the black population slowly decreasing annually and the retention rates increasing is troubling as well.
Another thing that is a problem the price for attendance is increasing which makes it difficult for students who do not have the funds. 

Other than these issues I believe that Western is an accredited institution, one that has helped many become great professionals."
Niche User,4,"I liked how well mixed the school was and how they tried to include everyone without still making that person feel differently from others. I liked how passionate the teachers seemed about the classes they teacher, and also how small the class sizes are or how much attention you can get if you do need help from other students, staff, teachers, etc. Overall, it seems as if their is always a place to sit and gain support from others or just the space in general."
Senior,4,"I think they truly have a good business school and finance program. I would like to see more of the analyst style courses, and a bigger push on the student managed investment program."
Niche User,4,"I went there for a few music festivals, the music was great, the people were great and the experience was overall great! However, the Michigan Youth Arts Festival was not organized very well. The campus is really quiet and nice though, I could relax and focus well."
Junior,4,"WMU, while very reputable, also has given me some challenges. These challenges include not transferring credits as was implied to me in my advising meetings, being inconsistent with how they transfer credits (three of my friends and I transferred from the same school with the same major and we all ended up in different places), and not having the resources to help everyone out without a month's notice. 

However, I love the professors here. Even the general education professors seem to genuinely take an interest in me even if there time is split between 60 students. The professors in my major as very smart, respected in their field, and have been allowed to design the program based on the ever-changing demands that students fit. This is the first college I've ever heard of where the professors actually utilizes their course feedback. Which makes me feel heard as a student."
Junior,4,"I like the amount of assistance they provide to their students. They have free tutoring on campus, career services, free counseling, and a lot of organizations to be apart of."
Senior,4,"I love this school and feel I thrive here. Any issues I have are often really miniscule, and I feel both exposed to the world yet comfortable. I love it!"
Junior,4,"The biggest advantage about Western Michigan University is definitely the student life. The events that the CAB and WSA put on bring the entire campus together, regardless of race, religion, etc. With the student organizations also working together to bring great events to campus, the atmosphere is always inviting and encouraging for struggling college students."
Senior,4,I have been at WMU for several years now. I completed my first bachelors degree a year ago and have returned to complete a second bachelors degree. I enjoy being a WMU alum and student to say the least. The professors are caring and only have the best interest for their students. There are various opportunities for students to get involved and make a difference on campus. Nothing is out of reach if a student tries. I would recommend all students to consider WMU for their education.
Freshman,4,"I recommend this College to anyone coming in for Engineering. Has a great group of professors. Help is everywhere, if you need help finding your classes, the right groups, resources are available for everyone. The dorm life is a good way to meet new people and get to know more resources that surround you at WMU. A very respectful Community and you can make your voice be heard in so many ways and occasions. They have 3 dining centers that serve pretty good meals and breakfast. The Student recreational center is a really good facility."
Junior,4,"At WMU, the campus focuses on diversity and creates a safe space for all students of ethnicity, identities, abilities, and social status. Western is a great school that has many options for departments and services for students that focus on the well-being and success in all areas of life for students, not just education."
Senior,4,"This school was almost a happy accident. I discovered it through one program and fell in love with another. There is always a major or program to find that can fit what you like, and the school will provide you the tools and skills needed to succeed. The professors help students in any way that they can, and can provide connections if need be. They something for everybody, and everybody can be prepared for when they graduate. 
(Of course there are some professors who don't care, but unfortunately all universities have those kinds of professors.)"
Junior,4,"Transferring to Western Michigan University has allowed me to find myself not only as a student but as  a person and has helped me find where I belong as an individual. The campus is very diverse and always has event scheduled to help meet new people and make great friends. However, every university has its corks from professors to the food provided on campus. The dinning halls are great but the stop and go's are usually equivalent to snacks and gas station food/ finger foods. The professors are great but of course like all universities, once in a while you run into a professor that doesn't fit you needs as a student and WMU is very responsive when it comes to you academic success and will attempt to aid you in anyway possible to help you be successful."
Junior,4,I love it at Western Michigan. There are countless resources of all kinds and they really highlight the importance of diversity and involvement on campus. The only complaint I have is the Parking Services. Parking on campus is awful and the price of a parking pass is way too expensive only to be unable to park anywhere on campus.
Alum,4,"Overall, WMU is an excellent school. They offer a wide variety of programs and social groups to keep everyone included. Some of the building are outdated, which can sometimes make technology learning difficult. The professors are very helpful, and the students are very friendly. One major negative is the cost of parking on campus. The charge per semester is outrageous and doesn't lend itself to the commuting student."
Sophomore,4,Western has a beautiful campus and lots of activities to take part in on campus! I wish some of my professors were better but overall good experience.
Freshman,4,"Western Michigan is an incredible university. While tuition for an 'out of stater' like myself is a bit pricey, the experience is incredibly humbling. From what I have observed and experienced, WMU has a very diverse community and thousands of people with a variety of interests. For those who are timid and/or not keen on the idea of a large school, I would not count WMU out. The best part about a mid-large size school is that you can be anyone you want and not worry about seeing someone again. Campus seems awfully large at first, but you can get anywhere from the center of campus in approx. 5-10 minutes of walking. I find that the food is surprisingly not repulsive. If you eat 3 meals a day or less, it is just not worth going with a dining plan. As for partying, from what I hear there is definitely a party presence in ""frat-ville""."
Junior,4,All of the staff members are extremely helpful and want to see you succeed. The environment is beautiful and calm and the classes are just what you ask for and exactly what they say when signing up.
Senior,4,"The professors are a mixed bag. Some professors are very talented teachers, while others struggle to communicate their knowledge in ways that the average student can understand. I would absolutely read professor reviews before registering for classes. I've done this every semester since Sophomore year, and I have had nothing but excellent professors."
Niche User,4,"My experience at Western Michigan University has been a beneficial learning experience. I have been challenged as an individual, as a student and as an aspiring professional. The resources that I have been provided with have made lasting impressions on my perspective and goals for my future."
Sophomore,4,"WMU is a great school that has taught me a lot. While it is not the most glamorous or prestigious of schools, it is a place I have come to love. I always feel welcome and safe, and there are always things going on; parties, schools sponsored events, RSOs, and much more always make their presence felt and are always a welcome addition to campus. While the food is good (not great) and many professors are still behind the times when it comes to online education, Western is still a great school. Go Broncos!"
Graduate Student,4,Lots of college options.  Not necessary good customer service for students. Interesting town that supports LGBTQ and has lots of various interests.
Sophomore,4,I absolutely love this campus and everything they offer. The only hard thing is getting connected when you first get there. There are not many opportunities offered to get out and meet new people for freshmen.
Alum,4,"I had a blast during my undergrad at WMU. I do feel like the staff members are ""yes"" men when it comes to doubts or questions about your major. I majored in the Arts and was told I wouldn't have much trouble finding a job after school, boy were they wrong. 4 years later, I'm going back for Business. Awesome school, awesome staff but could be a little more honest or knowledgeable about the programs and their return on investment."
Senior,4,I think that Western has a lot of great programs and things to do around campus whether you party all night or like to just chill.
Sophomore,4,"Honestly after one year at Western as a student athlete I’ve really enjoyed myself. The atmosphere and the opportunities make it a great place to live and learn. Western is one of the best party schools as well, there’s always something going on at the frats or with the athletes it’s great. For the most part academics are good, math and science are difficult departments but it’s like that almost anywhere."
Freshman,4,What I like about Western is how at home I felt. It's not a super big campus which is something I particularly like because it made it easier to connect with the people you're around.
Sophomore,4,"My experience at western has been a roller coaster. I've had a ton of downs but more ups, from my first visit I knew western Michigan was the college i wanted to attend. I call western a heads up campus, everyone is smiling and talks to each other. Very little people are on their phones and i feel as if that adds to the welcoming feel of the campus. If you ever need help there's always someone willing to help. Professors are open to building relationships with you and will notice if something is off with you. I had a Professor reach out to me when i was going through the depression of being away from home and she did not get off the phone with me until she knew i was okay and then later checked up on me every time she hadn't heard or seen me in awhile.  The school is always remodeling and taking into consideration to what the students want. There's always events happening on and off campus, so if you feel bored just go on the schools twitter and see whats taking place."
College Junior,2,"I did not receive enough financial aid to cover my semesters and now I am stuck putting my balance of $3500 on my Macy's credit card because I have no other way to pay for it! My ""family contribution"" is supposedly $5000. My mom said she would have to pull from her retirement fund just to help me pay the balance for this semester (which I wouldn't let her do) . I honestly don't know if I'm going to make enough to pay it down before next semester rolls around!"
College Junior,2,"Students are always getting in trouble at parties on campus. Having partied my freshman and sophomore year at a different school, I'm over the party scene. I work two full time jobs. I don't have time to party"
College Senior,2,"Okay, the clubs in Kalamazoo are terrible. They play music that no one likes, and the locals are crazy and violent. Also, there aren't many to choose from."
College Junior,2,hated the dorms they are too old and gross
College Junior,2,I applied for many scholarships and financial aid and received nothing. This is very unfortunate for me because my parents are not able to pay for a single cent of my tuition and I have been struggling to pay for it myself.
College Junior,2,"Off Campus housing is not as safe as on campus housing. There is a section of housing called ""The Ghetto"" and it is not safe. There are many break in's and robberies in the area."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is pretty bad here. I didn't brig my car but it was a struggle for my friends...
College Sophomore,2,Beer cans and bottles of alcohol constantly left around campus and inside the dorms and the smell of marijuana pollutes the air in the elevators and hallways of the dorms I've been in
College Senior,2,It cost a lot of money for a parking pass ($300) for the year and there are hardly any available spots open. You have to get to campus right at 7:50 am if you want a spot.
College Freshman,2,"Parking at WMU is tough and It costs $300.00 to park you vehicle at your dorm and maybe a few other lots. If your lot is full then oh well, and if you park somewhere else then parking services will find you in less than 3 minutes and fine you."
College Sophomore,2,"The whole process is too difficult, you pay $300 to simply park. And if you have a guest come visit you, they can't park without paying an abundance of money for a one hour visit."
College Freshman,2,I personally do not like or enjoy the city of Kalamazoo. It is run down and pretty trashy.
College Freshman,2,"The weather, especially in the winter, has been rough. It is very cold and has been snowing and a blizzard almost everyday. It is hard to ride the busses to class because they are packed, but it is way to cold to walk."
College Junior,2,I lived in Michigan for 10 years before I moved by down south. Then for college I came back up to Michigan for school and the weather is terrible. I say that about the winter because i feel that the campus does not clean to sidewalks off good and it sometimes not that safe to walk in.
College Junior,2,I feel that the peer pressure is really bad on campus when it comes to drinking and everything. I do not know how the drug are on campus because I do not take part in that kind of action.
College Freshman,2,"There is hardly any noise-control at Western. Which is great for people who don't hold 7 a.m. jobs. otherwise the noise can be a bit daunting, which is why my roommate and I invested in earplugs. There isn't a very strict visitor policy as far as staying the night, and some people even have third roommates that aren't registered to live with them but they're checked in."
College Freshman,2,"There is a very obvious use of marijuana and alcohol all throughout campus and off campus. You can generally steer clear of the peer pressure to engage in these activities if you hang around with the right crowd, which living in certain ares can make difficult. The campus enforcement is very straightforward on policies and enforcing the law."
College Freshman,2,People walk into class high as a kite and the teachers don't even care. Sometimes you can smell the weed all over the person.
College Freshman,2,WMU Doesnt give much to non-athletes/non medalions
College Student,2,"freshmen dorms are on a hill, and we are in a weather belt of all weather, meaning if it happens, it happens big, or hard hit where we are, but it comes with the state we live in, but it has been this way for years, and it is a teaching moment in life to pay attention before you walk out that door, and i am sure that the staff do there best to keep it clean of snow and ice, but the hills can get slick fast and quick"
Graduate Student,1,"I was an online student there and my experience has been unpleasant.  The eLearning software is awful and not user friendly but my biggest problem was the lack of communication with the advisors.  They don't help you register for courses nor do they tell you which ones to take.  You're on your own.  I had financial aid for 9 years in good standing and one summer I registered myself.  It wasn't until the end of Fall semester that someone told me there was a balance on my account because I didn't fill out a form for summer aid.  Now I'm stuck with a $5000 bill because my advisor didn't tell me sooner that I can't register for summer until I speak to Financial Aid.  No, they were hands off.  If you're looking for an online school, this isn't the one.  Avoid.  Also, the staff will talk about you and mock you to each other via email.  I know this because they accidentally included me, the person being mocked, in the email."
Freshman,1,"had the worst experience ever at this school. For starters, it isn't a safe campus whatsoever, we have gotten multiple text notifications from the police station about gunman on or around campus. Not only that but the students are incredibly rude. I hate to say this but its a trashy party school and the students show it. I'm not opposed to partying or anything, I went out multiple times but overall the school is called ""wastern"" for a reason. Really trashy. Not only that, the education here is awful. I've never learned less in my entire life than I did this year at this school. I got a significant scholarship to this school but am giving it up without a doubt because theres no chance I would stay another year here. DO NOT GO HERE! Worst experience of my life and cannot wait to leave."
Freshman,1,Terrible school. Terrible faculty. Terrible food. Terrible dorms. Can't wait to transfer. This was the biggest mistake I ever made coming to this awful school. It was a complete joke.
Alum,1,"My final straw with this school was when we had an active shooter for 5 hours. This was on a Saturday night, while people were out at house parties. Western didn't use their warning system to warn students of the ongoing event."
College Sophomore,1,I never got any jobs I applied for despite being the most qualified!
College Sophomore,1,I would rather not obtain a degree at all than go back to school here. Misery and depression does not even begin to explain what this school has done to me. The courses are terrible and have no value. The professors are so terrible and mean it is unbelievable. I cannot explain my deep hatred for this university.
College Sophomore,1,I felt in danger anywhere on campus or in the city of Kalamazoo. Horrible and dangerous place.
College Sophomore,1,Don't even get me started on housing. they placed me with the all time worst roommate in history. they made me move out when he was the one being a jackass. I really hate everyone involved in this school's housing process.
College Sophomore,1,People in greek life are very rude.
College Sophomore,1,Subpar teams that think they are it.
College Sophomore,1,"I am transferring out of Western. It was the most miserable year of my life. I have never experienced anything like it. The roommate situation was awful. The classes were awful. The campus is hideously ugly. This school took my depression to a whole new level. Everyone laughs at Western and thinks it is a joke school, and it is. No kids take it seriously. All they do is drink and do drugs. They laughed at me when I told them about my roommate problem, how unprofessional. It hurts me to even think about this school or anyone that goes to it. It was the worst year of my life by far and I do not think anything else could ever top it. Goodbye Western. I will never miss you and you were the worst place I have ever been."
College Junior,1,"Had a professor for one course who showed up late and never left her seat behind her desk, was boring and hated being there and it showed"
College Junior,1,N/A no right words can ever describe Greek life on campus
College Student,1,"Compared to other universities, the food blows. The whole dining system should be more student friendly with more benefits."
College Sophomore,1,I got no scholarships from Western even with a 33 ACT and 3.73 high school GPA.
College Freshman,1,living in the dorms was probably the worst choice I could have made.
College Sophomore,1,The campus food could use more healthier options.
College Junior,1,Getting into the Occupational Therapy Program at WMU was extremely difficult.  I worked very hard for years to get in to this graduate program.
College Junior,1,"Absolutely horrible! The Greek life at WMU is the worst organization at the school the sororities are the worst. Being a former member of a WMU sorority I can personally say my experience was awful. They ALL lie during recruitment to make it seem like greek life is sooooo fabulous and that these girls will be your best friends through everything and instead most of them will turn on you the second you actually join the house and treat you like crap until you go crazy, this not only happened to me but to many of my friends that joined as well. Don't let them fool you and tell you otherwise it'll be the worst decision of your college career"
College Freshman,1,My parents completed the FAFSA and supposedly make too much money for me to receive any financial aide. But they could only pay for my room and board. So I applied for over 25 scholarships and didn't receive even one.  I made an appointment at the financial aide office and it took all of 5 min for the guy to tell me he couldn't help me and suggested I live at home and take as many community college classes as I could transfer over. I am working full time but still don't know how I'm going to pay for everything.
College Senior,1,We've lost almost every game last school year
College Freshman,1,This year the winter weather has been horrible. We have had to shut down school three times. I think that it should have been shut down more than that but they didn't want to have the classes running through the summer. the bus system is very convent during this horrible weather. They even add extra buses to the system because they know hoe bad the weather is. So they do care and try and accommodate to the situations at hand.
College Freshman,1,To me it is the worst because I do not like snow and already this year we have had over 4 ft of snow.
College Sophomore,1,No Greek life available here.
College Sophomore,1,"No athletics at this campus. It's a university center, not a traditional campus. Intramural sports/athletics can be joined at the community college, which is affiliated with."
College Sophomore,1,"There is no campus housing at the University Center. I live in Traverse City and attend locally, but some students drive up to 4 hours to get this degree here."
College Sophomore,1,The parking permit is very expensive. The parking enforcement is the worst ever. The officers babysit every parking meter and parking spot. There is no lead time after your time has expired on the parking meter. If you are a student you are force to buy a parking permit. Students are not allowed to park at the parking meters
College Freshman,1,This school isn't just for me nor the location
College Sophomore,1,The smell of marijuana is disgusting. Once there were students something it in the cafe.
College Sophomore,1,Not much to choose from. 
College Sophomore,1,The football team is horrible. 
College Sophomore,1,"Very hard to communicate with certain sororities. 
And some are very rude. "
College Junior,1,"Parking is terrible on campus. If you are in need of on campus parking you are required to pay $300 dollars for a year long pass that gives you designated parking spots/lots depending on your housing status. For example, when I lived in Zimmerman hall there were only about 5 parking lots that I was able to park in. Some were close to my dorm and some were a good 10-15 minute walk away. The ones close to the dorm filled up fast and after I got off my midnight shift at work I was never able to find a parking spot. This meant walking alone on campus at midnight, it was NOT okay!"
College Senior,1,It is in Michigan! The weather is unpredictable. Classes are never cancelled if the weather is bad!
College Sophomore,1,"No guest spots, if you don't use the meters you will get a ticket."
College Freshman,1,The classes are extremely boring and so are most of the professors.
College Freshman,1,"The housing is very unattractive, the bathrooms are gross, the dining halls are gross. The rooms are way too small, the beds are uncomfortable, and their is no air conditioning."
College Sophomore,1,"I gave WMU a D+ because this is a very boring school. If your a party person, then it is right for you. But if your a person that takes school seriously then it's boring because its absolutely nothing to do except drink, party, and/or smoke. The professors here overall aren't good, I only had a few that cared about their student success. Tuition goes up each semester. My financial aid doesn't cover my cost so I have to pay out of pocket. Most professors are grad students-this can be good or bad. The food here is horrible. I cried my first semester because the food was so bad and I was hungry. I thought it'll be better than what it has actually turned out to be. P.s. the advisors do not care to help students. "
College Sophomore,1,Price for parking is outrageous and your lucky to find a good spot.
College Junior,1,"Im a Film major, the classes are rarely hands on and the advisor is useless and awful."
College Junior,1,"Difficult to find scholarships you qualify for, school doesnt help you find any."
College Freshman,1,"Crime doesn't happen that much one campus, but it still happens and most of the time the crime takes place more than once before the cops can take action."
College Senior,1,Parking on campus is awful. The lots are so far away from classes and there's like four lots you can park in. Also I don't think the price of a permit is worth where you can park and when and the ticket prices are terrible as well.
College Freshman,1,"The valleys have very small rooms which is a problem for those who are clean freaks and are roomed with messy people. The dorms are not very nice looking either. I wish I did not choose the valleys because of how small and unappealing to the eye they are, and also, they are a pain to walk back and forth to class."
College Sophomore,1,"Parking permits cost $180 a semester or $300 a year. The major problems are: 1. You can only park where your permit allows you to park. Commuters have three lots. Everyone else can only park in front of their dorms. 2. Getting a spot as a commuter is a nightmare. Get to school extra early. You'll need it. 3. You can't drive to class if you live on campus. If you want to park in front of your dorm, you need a certain permit. However, that's the ONLY lot you can park in on campus at all. The only reason to have a car on campus if you live in the dorms is if you go out on the weekends or do frequent shopping trips."
College Senior,1,Poor or Crowded. Your Choice. The good apartments are very expensive. Far too much for college kids. The ones that are affordable are very trashy and full of loud parties. People often are required to share a space with too many roommates; most are around five.
Recent Alumnus,1,Nursing Program – The nursing program is great at western...so i 've heard.They only accept roughly 45 students a year so it's nearly impossible to get in because it's so competitive. Also they keep changing the requirements to get into the program making it even harder to get accepted.
College Sophomore,1,Parking spots are usually full and the ones that appear empty are always parking for faculty.  The worst part about the parking is that the campus police LOVE to give out as many parking tickets as possible.
College Freshman,1,Well the school have you buy a parking ticket but you can only park in parking lots that have your letter on it. I feel that if you buy a parking ticket for 300 dollars you should be able to park any where you want.  Also it restrict you from parking at the library at certain times. I really think that this should be rule that should change at my school.
College Sophomore,1,"I have a dorm parking pass so I can't park anywhere on campus until after 5 pm except for my assigned dorm parking, which is NOT nearly large enough to accommodate everyone who lives there. I can park in the student rec if its full, but but it fill up at 9 pm. So if I come home from work late, I have to park far away (about 8 min walk) and walk all by myself (a white small girl in Kalamazoo) at midnight. And we are not allowed to carry pepper spray on campus? That makes sense. I do not feel safe. 
The parking people are pretty much Nazi's and get you within minutes. Tickets are $15 and go up to $25 if not paid in 10 days. There is not enough parking and the parking people are too strict. It is very frustrating. I had to go to an RA meeting in a dorm building that was a 20 min walk from my dorm and I was coming from work (off campus) and did not have time to park in my dorm parking lot and walk to my meeting. I got a ticket for parking in the other dorm parking lot and could not negotiate it at all with parking services. I need a car because I work off campus but a lot of people survive just fine without a car. There is a lot of student living around the area so even people who live off campus will be fine without a car. parking passes are $ for the year, plus the 10 tickets you will most likely get through the course of the year :)"
College Freshman,1,Permit Costs – Parking is expensive.  Costs around $300 per year.
College Freshman,1,"There are many issues with parking on campus. You can only park in your designated spot that they assign you, which is fair, but when you have an advising appointment or something you have to walk all the way there or pay the meters, which no college student has extra money for. Another huge issue with parking is parking at the student recreation center. It's not fair for the people who pay tuition to go to school including being able to use the rec center, and if they do not have a parking pass they cannot park there. They are paying the money to have access to it and they cant use it because they live off campus and would have to drive there, but there is no where to park."
College Junior,1,"The parking permit costs way too much and it is the same price for campus and off-campus students. This should be changed especially because off-campus students are there as much as on campus students. Ticket prices are typically very low ($5-$10). However I've seen someone get a ticket (after their meter has run out) while they are a few feet from their car heading towards it, this is very unfair. Most of the shopping (including groceries) is far away enough that one needs a car so they don't spend 30 mins on the bus one way. Parking isn't that convenient. There aren't enough spaces for the amount of cars and the parking is usually far away."
College Sophomore,1,"There are so many burners at Western it's ridiculous. There are people you can choose to hang out with who choose to not do drugs, but they're pretty rare. Drinking at Western is pretty much how people spend their free time, which is acceptable as long as it's in moderation. The big negative are the excessive amounts of students roofied at the frats, AVOID THEM."
College Senior,1,"After the school decided to stop giving me money, the private loan process was a giant nightmare. The loan company told me they were sending the money, and upon visiting the financial aid office I was given a date. A week after that date, no money. I was told it was still coming. Two weeks later, after spring registration had started and I was unable to register because my money was still in limbo, I went down to the office to complain a lot. The clerk looked at my information, looked very surprised that my money hadn't dispersed yet, and had to call and yell at someone. In conclusion, try not being polite because you will probably get s*** on."
College Sophomore,1,"Since the school year consists of the winter, it definitely puts on a toll on whether or not you feel like walking outside in the cold or snow to go to class. Especially if you have an 8 a.m."
College Sophomore,1,"For parking on campus it costs a lot. You are already paying a bunch for tuition and housing but on top of it you need a 300$ permit and on top of that, you cannot even park where you want to! There is parking enforcement that has NOTHING better to do then sit around and wait for the people who do not have a W sticker that will park there. Also, even if you pay for a meter you CANNOT have the sticker for there! it is RIDICULOUS!"
College Sophomore,1,did not have a good experiance getting registered and signed up for college. It took 3 months of getting sent to the wrong advisor to not getting messages that I sent not returned.
College Junior,1,The Bus Is Your Best Option – Everyone always complains about the university parking because of the price of parking permits and because of the lack of available parking spaces.
College Sophomore,1,Never Walk Alone on Campus (No Matter What Time of Day) – Campus crime seemed to be an issue the past school year. It got to the point where I was afraid to walk on campus alone during all times. I believe it is because the location (Kalamazoo) has a higher crime rate than surrounding areas.

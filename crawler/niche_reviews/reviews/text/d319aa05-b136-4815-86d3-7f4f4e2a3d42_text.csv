Alum,5,I have not personally taken online classes at this school as I graduated before 2020. Cant leave this box blank tho :/
Alum,5,"Perfect for me. Focus on being self driven, lots of one on one time with proffessors. Pretty strong community aspect. Not great if you thrive in structured enviroments."
Alum,5,"As a student who transferred to the Art Academy in hopes to finish my BFA with a degree in graphic design, I learned so much more than I had ever imagined. The two year degree I transferred to the AAC with taught me a lot about graphic design, and just that. During my first two years as a student at a satellite campus of a local college, I knew that my education needed to continue and expand into a BFA before I felt confident in the field I was interested in. My first experience with the Art Academy of Cincinnati was at their ""INK BLEEDS"" event: a showcase of local artists' show posters, all having been screen printed. When I stepped in the building and felt the energy of the artists, students, and community, I never stopped thinking of the AAC of the place I wanted to be. 
The AAC allowed me to develop myself into an artist, designer and problem solver. I grew to understand how my skills and mind adapted to writing, painting, design, printing, etc, and that I was not just a designer."
Alum,5,"I never took an online course, but the professors I had were very proficient with technology and virtual communication."
Alum,5,"I wouldn't change my experience at the AAC for anything in the world.  It's a dynamic, freeform education, and during my time going there I grew to love Cincinnati and its people, and I made friends that will stay with me for life."
Alum,5,We did not need or require online learning during the time I spent at the Art Academy of Cincinnati.
Alum,5,"My time at the Art Academy of Cincinnati has shaped my life. I've held a career in the arts since graduating. The trans-disciplinary programming has allowed me to be adaptable to the ever-changing world around us, and I am forever grateful for the relationships I build there."
Sophomore,5,"I appreciate the size of the college. You feel like you get a chance to know everyone really well. Also, regardless of your major, you have access to all of the facilities on campus which was huge for me! I looked at other colleges but if you only use the things that were in your major. Overall I'm happy here."
Junior,5,The school is very small allowing for lots of one on one and hands on time with teachers and faculty. The students are all alike in personality which makes it very easy to make friends. The school is in the city which gets students street smarts and a sense of community.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy the teachers open-ness to each student and their needs. If I could change one thing, I would turn up the heater a bit.."
Alum,5,"I am a 2007 AAC alum.  I went on to fashion school  and got a masters in fashion from SAIC in Chicago.  I taught English in Gifu, Japan.  I was responsible for magazine content, sponsorship and programming at Kiki Magazine.  I have freelanced on music videos etc.  I currently co-run PIQUE art gallery, develop programs and teach. These things were possible because of the rich foundation I built at the AAC.  What separates my experience at AAC was that they really helped me get to the bottom of who I needed to be, and supported and pushed me to get there.  I left AAC with the skills/confidence/strength I needed to fight for my goals moving forward.  While at the AAC I formed bonds in the art community that still inform my art practice today. When I wanted to become a professor, I chose the AAC because I knew they would get behind my big/unusual ideas, in a way other colleges wouldn’t be brave/bold enough to do. #AACPRIDE Www.sparklezilla.com"
Works Here,5,"The AAC creates a challenging and supportive environment for students to contribute to the discourse in Contemporary Art and Design. Their major-fluid program produces artists, designers, writers and entrepreneurs that make a difference in the community and the world."
Alum,5,"The Art Academy of Cincinnati is a great community of talented students and teachers. I am a 2015 alumna currently pursuing an MFA degree in New York. The Art Academy has a small, tight-knit student body with the amazing resources of a much larger program- studios, equipment, materials, and dedicated teachers who go above and beyond to give students access to personalized feedback and critique. Most importantly, the Art Academy gives students the tools to think conceptually and grasp dense, high-brow methods for learning and creating. If art is something that matters to you- go somewhere art matters. Located in the center of OTR in Downtown Cincinnati, new students get a real city experience on a smaller scale, without the high costs. The art and music scenes of OTR are accessible, energized, and always in conversation with the Art Academy."
Alum,5,"This school is amazing because it teaches its students to think for and educate themselves...it is not for a lazy student expecting an easy ride. This school is a good fit for someone with self discipline, the desire to learn, work hard and grow. It is one of the least expensive private art schools, and truly teaches their students to become extremely resourceful artists. You have to work for every opportunity at AAC, nothing is handed to you, just like in real life. The faculty are also working artists and the school is a small, safe, and extremely accepting community."
Alum,5,The Art Academy is an excellent place to find your artistic voice and to develop into the type of professional artist you want to be.
Graduate Student,5,"The Art Academy provided me with an excellent education, a broad network of creative people working in the field and hands on experience. I was always encouraged to try new techniques and methods and enabled me to develop problem solving skills amongst a wide range of critical thinking and engagement. Although I graduated with an emphasis on drawing, the focus of my work came to be installation, sculpture and performance based work. I feel that my time at the Art Academy was submersive and crucial for my artistic voice as I begin my path into furthering my education."
Senior,5,"I transferred to the art academy from a large state college and I have been incredibly happy with my experience here. The academics are much more challenging and the professors are so much more qualified and helpful when compared to the last school I attended. The design program has given me experience with real client projects and access to the plethora of design firms and agencies in Cincinnati. Because of the experience I have gained with the art academy, I have already been offered a job after graduation."
Senior,5,"The professors offer great connections to the outside world. The faculty and staff definitely put students first. There is always something fun going on in the area. Since it's a smaller school, you get a lot of feedback."
Alum,5,"AAC changed the entire trajectory of my life. It not only focused my ambitions to a greater purpose, but instilled a drive toward self-discovery and self-realization. I'm able to take on any problem and any situation and know that uncertainty is a strength. The faculty opened the doors to a rich and creative life. I will be forever thankful."
Works Here,5,Students get personal attention and are encouraged to find their own vision. The interdisciplinary program is designed to give students training for the real world of creative business and professionalism.
Sophomore,4,"Hard to say. I only took classes online after the pandemic happened. I felt like for what the college had to go through, they made the best of it. I like when we go back we have the option to take classes in person, or online."
Alum,4,The Art Academy of Cincinnati is filled with passionate and genuine professors who take advantage of the small student body to truly invest in each student’s career and success.
Alum,4,"I went to the Art Academy because I was looking for a smaller more individual experience with the faculty and student body. I was not disappointed! The professors and administrators are very involved in the student’s life in the form of mentorship, advising, academics and visual art. The professors and staff are local, national and international creative practioners and educators. I felt we shared a unique community with the school that was both respectful and insightful. I would recommend anyone to this great school!"
Alum,4,The Art Academy is where I discovered my love of painting. I was given the room to grow and discover this passion through the guidance and encouragement of the faculty. I also learned invaluable problem solving skills which I use on a daily basis.
Junior,4,"Where one big happy art community. The walls come alive with art works made by the students and teachers. Everyone has there own styles and connections within the art community. We challenge other fellow artists with good sportsmanship. While as we work, we share ideas to help each other to improve. Thus, we work together to help each other to grow as artists. That is what an art community is all about it's to help one another to succeed in our lives growing as artist."
College Sophomore,4,The teachers will go out of their way to help a student out when creating artwork.
College Sophomore,4,"The best professors are most often adjunct, but since we only have 8 full time teachers it makes sense. Professors are all referred to on a first-name basis which makes the classroom very personal, and teachers often encourage students to pursue their desires and art outside of the classroom."
College Sophomore,4,"The dorms are right across the street from the single-building school which is a huge convenience. Each rooms in the 12th St. dorms also comes with a full bathroom, kitchen, and washer/dryer in-building which is fantastic. The 13th street dorms are a little less convenient, featuring single bedrooms with a connected toilet and sink and shared kitchen and showers and coin laundry. The dorm community is absolutely amazing- when I lived in the dorms no one locked their doors and everyone had total mutual respect for one another. Depending on the students there can be a little partying and most of the RAs are very lax on rules, but outside of the expense there are no other substantial problems."
College Freshman,4,It was easy but I still need a lot more money
College Student,4,It's a great school over all
College Student,4,"Only thing bad is that we have to pay to use the printer. We get a set of 30 free bucks to use the printer, once it goes out, we have to put our own money in. That can get expensive depending on your major. Your laptops cannot connect to the printers either, you have to log into their computer to use it."
College Freshman,4,its a small collage so we have a library down the street its a nice sized library they have limited space in dorms but you can live in either single dorm rooms or a group dorm room that you share and you fill out a survey questionnaire so that they can match you up with some one your similar to there is a lot going on in the down town area of Cincinnati at lest in the over the rhine area  they have parks near by just a walk away 
College Freshman,4,they have you use art work in a portfolio to let you get a scholarship that way its very simple and you just go in on one of there many portfolio days that they have 
College Freshman,4,Cincinnati and Safe – There are areas of Cincinnati that are considered very unsafe. But the AAC goes above and beyond to make sure you are safe and taken care of in your day to day life. There is security on campus to help you get from your car to the building if it's late.
Niche User,2,"The biggest flaw I saw with this school was that I was at my end of year review and a professor asked me, ""So, what did you learn this year?"" and I opened my mouth to answer, but had to close it again. I have good grades, yet I couldn't think of one new thing I had learned. 
The school is fine if you want to work in a gallery, but I tried to investigate what classes I could take that would allow me to work in an animation company and I was told that I would essentially have to make it on my own, no classes would give me the skills I needed."
College Sophomore,2,"We should already have security cameras throughout the school and outside the building, however, they are cutting budgets and installing them for next year."
College Sophomore,2,"I do love the teachers at this college, but the school is not safe around campus, people are stealing stuff within the studios and they are just now getting security cameras. This is my third year and they threw Juniors under the bus because they switched how credits worked for the whole course. Some advisers wanted certain students to not take a certain class, and now behind in credits they need to graduate. The teachers will step aside and will talk to you besides class time to make sure you are learning what you need to learn, however, they are not really teaching on how to get your first contractor or how to go about in getting a job. They do encourage students to explore mediums and subjects, and second term of junior year along with senior year, they want students to make work that is a body of work."
College Sophomore,2,"There is no job training and job assistance like at most schools, which is absolutely awful. There is also no official ""career center"" so upon graduation, students are almost entirely on their own."
College Freshman,2,"Since Campus housing is freshmen only, upper classmen are forced to find a place to commute and if you wanna live downtown its extremely pricey."
College Freshman,2,Not really a party campus. its in the middle of downtown.
College Student,2,It's downtown. It can get expensive
College Sophomore,2,"There are a lot of things to do, because they're trying to improve the area by creating new shops and restaurants. However, the population is awful, and crime is through the roof. Though there's plenty to do, I don't feel safe leaving school to do it unless I have other students with me."
College Freshman,2,Parking is good if you buy a pass for the garage or lot near by. Parking passes can be quite expensive though. If you do purchase a pass you will not have to worry about not having a spot.
College Freshman,2,"Academics are good, but a fairly laid back. The class load is small and easy to do. The professors have all been pretty decent."
College Sophomore,2,"It is soo unpredictable! its really hot and humid in the summers and fall, then icy cold in the winter all the way till late spring!"
College Sophomore,1,"I do not know if we have a career center at all. Occasionally students will get emails, but it's never for certain majors. We have about six majors(Design, Illustration,Print media, Painting&Drawing, Photography, Sculpture), and the emails are usually for two of the majors(Design and Photography) and occasionally Print media. Anything else would be word from mouth through teachers. The teachers would only tell only a select few."
Recent Alumnus,1,"Do not under any circumstances, waste your funds at The Art Academy of Cincinnati. As someone who had to work ridiculously hard post-graduation to have my career and be successful, I am disappointed to report that I was horribly unprepared in my field. I'd also like to note that I graduated with honors, and was a very successful and driven student, and was even on the board. 

The school ignores all practical and professional information for the theoretical and avant-garde. There should be a balance. Most departments only have one or two professors so your breadth of access to different viewpoints is severely limited, and in the areas of communication arts (graphic design, ad photography, and illustration) you are pushed to ignore professional practice and encouraged to copy the fine arts students. Internships are a disaster and you are only required to have one, relatively short one. I have repeatedly had points in my career where my superiors have asked ""Didn't you learn that in school?"" 

After college, if you move out of Cincinnati, the alumni association will have no contact with you, except a yearly mailer begging for funds. There is no career development. They occasionally email current students about part-time and summer jobs. Post-grad you will hear nothing. (They do have an explanation of how to make a resume on their website.) Several of my fellow alumni have expressed the same sentiments and many find themselves much worse off. 

Choose a bigger school with better connections and instructors. My friends who attended RISD, MICA, or Parsons were much more satisfied and with $45,000 of student loan debt, I definitely regret what little I got for my money."
College Freshman,1,No one from the school checks on drugs and underage drinking. It happens VERY frequently and no one says anything about it. There are consequences if you are found doing drugs or drinking but no one seems to check on the students or really care.
College Senior,1,"Burnt Everything. Kaldi's is a very nice cafeteria vendor when it comes to the variety and people, but the food almost always comes out burnt or not very satisfying. And when you ask about taking something off a special, like no pickles or mayo on a burger, you get a lot of sighs and rude remarks. 

I suggest packing lunch almost always. Saves money, most likely a more healthy alternative, and is served the way you like it."

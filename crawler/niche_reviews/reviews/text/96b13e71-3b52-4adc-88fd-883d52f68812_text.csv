Junior,5,My online experience has been great. The professor have gone easy on us and made sure that everyone had access to everything. They helped me with any questions I had and walked me through the online process when we first went online.
Sophomore,5,I really enjoy meeting all the new and different people I see on campus whether that is within my classes or at the student union or at events held by Cal U.  I also have had many exceptional professors here who are great at instruction as well as helping me with any questions.  The campus is also very well kept with beautiful greenery and buildings.
Sophomore,5,I personally have had a wonderful experience so far. Employees are very helpful which is great for a new student.
Sophomore,5,I haven't taken any classes online at this university yet. I may plan to though as online classes are beneficial for my work schedule and I.
Junior,5,"I love that it’s a big enough school to make really great friends through clubs and other events. In the same sense, it’s small enough to have individualized attention from professors and staff that really help you through anything."
Senior,5,I really like California University of Pennsylvania. The staff have been very helpful. I have gained a lot of knowledge that will help me be successfully in the future.
Senior,5,I really enjoy California University of Pennsylvania. The online platform is easy to learn and navigate.
Alum,5,"I loved the atmosphere, the personal relationships students could have with their professors  and the size of the school."
Junior,5,I love Calu. I’m glad I chose to attend this university. We receive a great education for a decent cost. They’re very handicapped friendly as well. They’re amazing.
Sophomore,5,"California University of Pennsylvania is a campus that makes me feel like I'm at home. It's not a big campus but it's not a small campus either, it has enough people where you'll be walking and see somebody you know and there's also many people that you won't know. I have had great experiences with almost all of my professors, they are easy to communicate with and my learning experience has been good overall. There are multiple places on campus to eat including Rush, Fyre, Chick-fil-a, Modeco, and etc. There are a variety of clubs to get involved with and to make your college experience better. California University is a great school overall."
Freshman,5,"Professors are absolutely fantastic, everyone is so nice and there are so many things to do. Advisors and professors help you in every way possible, and the food is amazing."
Sophomore,5,It’s a great small town with plenty to do. But not to much to do and that’s good to keep students on task with their work.The environment and professors are great.
Freshman,5,"They have a great comp sci program and always host events for students to do.
The Dorms can be ruff at times tho"
Freshman,5,"The campus is an overall beautiful campus, and has its own character. The professors are nice, and it isn't hard to make friends on campus."

Overall, going to this college has been one of the best choices I have ever made."
Freshman,5,"Everyday I wake up extremely happy that I chose to attend California University of Pennsylvania. This college has given me more than I imagined. The campus is beautiful, well-cared for, and safe. The professors actually care about what they're teaching about and they stress that they're here to see us grow and pass their courses. The dorms are newly-renovated and clean, and they also provide amenities such as a computer lab, full kitchen, laundry on each floor, and so much more. This campus is one of the best around."
Junior,5,"Calu is a great University that offers education and the University experience to countless students. As a commuter I appreciate the accommodations. And from what I see on a daily basis, those who live on campus seldom complain. The campus is clean, safe and very involved in social issues. And the staff are second to none. I wrestled with going to Pitt like my father. Or Penn State like my uncle but for the tuition Cal U was a no brainer. 
Proud to be a Vulcan."
Sophomore,5,"So far I really like my experience at the school. It is very clean, the dorm rooms are really spacious and well kept. Students and staff are always willing to help people no matter how small the issue is. I've made friends on the first day because of how warm and welcoming everyone is. The campus is big enough to explore and find things to do, but it is definitely not big enough to get lost. The class rooms also have a lot of space and updated technology."
Freshman,5,The things I like about CalU was there professor on how they teach us. I also lover how there campus is made and designed an there dorms.
Freshman,5,"I enjoy being a student of California University of Pennsylvania because the staff and students are very helpful, welcoming, and friendly. The campus is one of the very many things I like about this university.  Each time I visit the campus there are people everywhere ready to help me in any way possible. They have been able to answer my questions and help me no matter what information I needed to know. As a commuter, I also like the commuter center and the lounging and studying areas provided for me as I spend the day there."
Freshman,5,"California University of Pennsylvania is a wonderful school! They have so much to offer such as multiple majors, financial aid, mentoring programs, tutoring and work-study opportunities, etc. Everyone is so positive and only want you to succeed! They even have a student success center for anyone who needs an extra hand. One thing I would change is the scholarship help. I would like to see more individuals on campus that help fill out scholarships and things like that."
Freshman,5,"My experience applying to CalU was extremely simple and easy. When meeting with an advisor to discuss different programs and what they entail, I was given an enormous amount of information with a layout of the classes I needed to take, when I needed to take the classes within my four years, what classes needed to be taken together in the same semester, and information to help me stay on track to graduate in four years. My experience was calming and stress free and everyone did whatever they could to make my decision to attend 100% easier."
Sophomore,5,The best well-rounded school you could ever be at. Great professors and students. The campus is beautiful.
Freshman,5,"I like California University of Pennsylvania because of its' campus and staff. Everyone there is so welcoming and very nice. One thing I would like to change is the food, it could be more appetizing, but the ice cream station is amazing!"
Freshman,5,"I absolutely love Cal U. They have an amazing criminal justice staff there and it's really encouraging me to go through with school! Also, I got involved with Greek Life and it's the best decision I ever made!"
Freshman,5,Life in college couldn't be any easier than what it is in California university. Students always have a smile in their faces at all times and never seem disappointed with their experience in the university.
Sophomore,5,I wouldn't change anything about Cal U. The school has an amazing atmosphere and amazing programs. Students and staff are so kind and are willing to work with you on anything you need or have a problem with.
Alum,5,"I loved the Secondary Education Program I experienced and thrived in at Cal U. I had outstanding professors in my education, English, and General Studies classes. The campus was always in pristine shape, with a welcoming atmosphere. Technology was up-to-date and commuter-friendly."
Sophomore,5,I absolutely love the staff and the campus is beautiful. The staff is very helpful and willing to work with the non-traditional students!
Niche User,5,"I absolutely LOVE the campus, I fell in love with the dorm rooms. The admissions department and counselors were amazing and helped a lot! I loved taking a tour of the campus."
Freshman,5,California University of Pennsylvania is a kind and friendly school. Everyone from the students to the professors are so nice and are willing to help. The campus is gorgeous. There is history with the buildings that you can read about and see all over campus. The dorm rooms are roomy and large enough that you don't feel trapped in a closet. the admissions team is constantly willing to ask questions when needed. The food is great and the student activities offered are amazing as well.
Freshman,5,"I like California University quite well. It is a great school with plenty of majors to choose from. I am currently a freshman, or more specifically a High School Early Admit student. I have enjoyed all my professors, as well as all the time i have spent at the campus. It is a nice campus that is very well maintained. It is a great school!"
Freshman,5,"California University of PA is a great university. The people here are extremely friendly and welcoming. Your walk to class is not too long, everything is about a 5-8 minute walk. Because of this you get to know your classmates more and your professors. If you are not comfortable talking to your professors inside of the class room that is okay. They always offer to help outside of the class time, they encourage this so they can give you the best help possible if you want it. Going to a sporting event is always a must at Cal the sports teams are all dedicated inside the classroom and outside. If sports are not your interest then Cal also has a other activities like, music nights, movie nights, clubs, or simply sitting in the common room with friends. Overall it is a spectacular environment and school."
Niche User,5,Love the envirnonemnt and staff. Very welcoming. The facutly seems very welcomgn and interested inwhat the student wnats.
Sophomore,5,"I love the Campus ! In my opinion , it is absolutely beautiful and has a very “homey” feel to it . The only thing that I would change would have to be that I wish there were more things to do around campus , rather than driving half an hour away to go do/ find something. In all , the professors are excellent and really show that they want you to learn, not “I want you guys to just pass and get out” kind of professors. They take time out of their busy days to schedule available office hours to you."
Freshman,5,California University of Pennsylvania is a great school to operate with a 30:1 ratio per class to gain a relationship with your professor to help you progress.
Junior,5,The campus is huge and diverse. There is a lot to do for fun. There is also a lot of academic support available.
Sophomore,5,"California University of Pennsylvania has a great campus that is its own town. Campus is not huge, and is very accessible. The professors care more about the students then at most universities. So far, I enjoy going to school here very much."
Alum,5,"Recently graduated from Cal with a Bachelor's and am honestly considering going back for a second degree because I loved it so much! The Honors Program and the Psychology program both prepared me for my Master's program so well that I feel more experienced than most of my classmates. It's got a great ""bang for your buck"" - affordable, rigorous, and homey."
Niche User,5,"Went for my visit the other day and fell in love with the place. Academics was very good, a lot of different choices. Dorms were renewed and the student life looked liked they were all a family."
Freshman,5,"I love the campus, where the buildings are absolutely beautiful and the walks are well tended. The recreational centers are amazing, and include a track, a rock climbing wall, two gyms, and a pool. The classrooms are clean and an ideal learning environment. The professors are always available and eager to help in you have any questions or problems. The dorms are gorgeous, and extremely homey, which can help lessen home sickness because it is made to feel so much like a home environment. Overall, I love Cal U and can't think of anything that could possibly make it any better."
Freshman,5,It was an overall great experience and I cant wait for my first year there. I feel like I will be welcomed considering it is a larger school.
Alum,5,California University of Pennsylvania provides a world class education experience with individualized attention to all students. The programs and professors are exceptional.
Freshman,5,I'm just starting there at this school in the fall but already the people are so nice and they are really there to help you succeed.
Sophomore,5,California University of Pennsylvania is definitely my favorite college experiences so far. I also went to a community college beforehand and there are many thing I love about Calu that weren't offered or as wonderful at my old college. One example would be the size of the school. Calu has a beautiful and very large campus. Another example would be the size of classrooms. In my old college we had a similar number of students but smaller rooms. Students were lined up against walls and very uncomfortable if they didn't show up to class almost 15 minutes earlier than everyone else. In Calu the rooms are much larger giving everyone an adequate amount of space.
Freshman,5,"I love California University of Pennsylvania, they have a lot to offer here. I like how friendly everyone is here also I like how they have so much for you to do on campus, with activities in the dorms. I like how they have a lot that can help you educationally as well, with tutors and the professors are open to help as well. The classes are not too big so the professors can personally get to know you, unlike in bigger schools."
Freshman,5,"it offers a variety of different aspects of college life and a lot of activities to do.

so many club and groups that you can belong to.  several events and places to do on campus"
Freshman,5,"The school is close to home and family. On my first day I felt more welcome than I ever have at high school. The school is in a small town and has a nice feeling to it. The professors are great, and the other students are great."
Freshman,5,Great school great programs and an incredible music program. The mechatronics program is brand new the teachersare good people and they’re good at what they do.
Sophomore,5,"The small class sizes are perfect for my learning style.  The campus scenery is absolutely beautiful.  I highly enjoy seeing all the trees and flowers walking to class.  The dorms on campus are so spacious with private bathrooms in each room!  The professors are friendly and helpful.  There are an abundant amount of resources on campus, as well as, many places to get food.  There are a lot of things to keep a student busy on campus.  The gym is a great place to burn energy; there is even a pool, hot tub, and sauna!  California University even has a movie theater that shows all the latest movies, not to mention the great popcorn!"
Senior,5,"California University is a small, but incredible school with fantastic professors and amazing majors."
Freshman,5,It's an amazing school. The professors are nice. I have yet to meet my roommates in my dorm yet. I meet them of Friday.
Junior,5,"I really enjoy CalU. It's close to home, and has an amazing campus. There are plenty of places to eat or just hang out. I haven't had any problems other than the Vulcan Flyer times, they say it should be  there every 15 minutes, but it varies. The Vulcan Flyer is the bus that takes students to Vulcan Village, the on-off campus housing."
Freshman,5,My experience at Cal U so far has been amazing! The acedemics are excellent as the professors are passionate about what they do and the school truly cares about preparing students for their future.
Freshman,5,I loved staying in a dorm at Cal U. Our Ca’s always had fun activities that helped us meet new people. The financial aid of office could use some work though.
Niche User,5,"CalU is great. I had a very dedicated cross country coach as well as lifting coach. Classes are average, but the campus is small and easy to learn your way around."
Freshman,5,I like that everyone is pretty outgoing and easy to talk to. Very helpful in many ways. There are many resources available to majority of all students needs. I am a first semester freshman and have a wonderful experience attending this college so far.
Senior,5,The campus and dorms are beautiful and spacious. The campus is small but perfect for students to concentrate
Graduate Student,5,"I'm currently a Global Online student of CALU and my experience thus far has been awesome. Staff are willing to assist you in any way that they can, they are very responsive, and overall the staff of CALU really wants you to succeed. I would recommend anyone seeking to enroll in college to consider CALU as an option."
Freshman,5,"I first love the rural area in which the 
Campus sets very refreshing 
The dorms are modern clean
And well manage they come with
20 inch flat screen tv and free wifi
The food is delish home cooking
To fill your palate.The staff are wonderful and very helpful.
California University is the place to
Achieve."
Sophomore,4,I really like the helpfulness on campus for literally anything you’d have questions about! The small class sizes are great too!
Sophomore,4,"At the time of this review I am currently a Sophomore at CalU studying for an Electrical Engineer Bachelor's Degree. My experience at Cal has been overall positive despite COVID-19 disrupting our in-person classes for our 2020-2021 school year. This school accepted all of my transfer credits without any hassle and offers an abundant amount of classes for general education as to not bore students with learning the same things they may have already learned during high school. The dorms and food services are absolutely fantastic, and there are many on campus and off campus options for food, entertainment, and residency."
Junior,4,"My overall experience at California University of Pennsylvania is wonderful. Everyone from the professors, advisors, mentors, and staff have been amazing. Everyone is willing to help and answer any questions you have. I never feel judged and made a ton of new friends in my major. Overall, California University of Pennsylvania is a great experience."
Sophomore,4,"I think the online classes here at Cal U are very good...if you get a professor who knows how to purposefully set up an online class to maximize learning.  Sometimes you get professors who are overwhelmed by the online aspect causing students to feel they are not get the same quality of education they would in other in-person classes or online classes.  Overall, I do think Cal U has a decent online learning experience though."
Senior,4,For how fast they had to turn in-person classes into online classes the courses were very satisfactory.
Freshman,4,"The online experience was pretty easy. As with any transition into an online experience, there are road bumps. Overall, though, the experience was fairly easy."
Freshman,4,"As a future student, I've had a good experience with CALU so far. The web of individuals willing to help you is extremely expansive. The teachers and directors of specific departments are very open to student discussion and willing to assist in whatever it is you need."
Freshman,4,"I like your results may vary but classes are a good size. academics is the core thing that drew me into this place, and although I am a commuter to this place it's still a nice drive about twenty minutes from my house not to bad I guess."
Niche User,4,"It has variety to it, from becoming a biologist, to making robots, and even to a large variety of engineering pursuits. It has an OSD (office for students with disabilities) where they provide services that can help make sure everyone is cared for."
Niche User,4,"For a school that has never had all of its students do online before, it did pretty good. Teachers were understanding and everything. Now, when it comes to classes that are normally online, teachers answer questions as soon as they could as well as provide useful resources."
Junior,4,"The format for online classes vary by subject, but the professors make it easy to access and understand. Teacher’s sometimes have trouble communicating through online courses. Overall, super accessible!"
Senior,4,"For the most part, the teachers were good. Here and there you’d have one that took teaching more like a way to hold power over people, but then you’d have teachers who went above and beyond to make sure you understood. Everything that was in the school was good. Food was average. Housing is spectacular though- beyond most schools in the area."
Junior,4,California University of Pennsylvania is a beautiful campus and has so much art and greenery to look at.
Niche User,4,Cal U of PA is a university that has many programs of all your majors. They are very responsive and you make even get a answer back from them in the same day on the matter you are  dealing with. They have a very well trained  staff that is willing to work with you in any problem you may have .
Junior,4,"As a Junior, I have had very good experiences during my education at this university. Most professors are knowledgeable and helpful. Work opportunities on campus abound. The campus is always well taken care of and looks great."
Sophomore,4,"I'm a sophomore at Cal U and my experience so far has been positive. I like that the university offers so many unique experiences to its students, such as international trips and music concerts. They also have a great Greek life community. I joined a sorority last spring and it has helped me make new friends and given me volunteer opportunities. Overall, Cal U is a good option if you're looking to get a good college education without spending a fortune."
Junior,4,Not a bad school for education.  Professors do care about the students and will help them succeed. Not much to do on weekends. Mostly a commuter school. Very small town with nothing in it. Most students live close enough to go home every few weekends if not every weekend.
Niche User,4,"i love the campus and atmosphere, my favorite thing is the mountains and trees. it just makes me feel like i am in the right place. the classes are just right and i cant wait to go to visit the campus in person."
Freshman,4,"I have only been at Cal-U for about a month, but so far it seems good. I don't like how we have to buy our own scan-tron papers for taking tests (they're only $0.20 a piece but still). It just seems like another money taking thing. I am a Vet Tech major and the head of the program is awesome! The only thing I don't love about the program is that we are learning human anatomy and physiology not animal because they didn't put together an animal A&P yet."
Freshman,4,I like the Was Cal U Carries itself compared to other schools. Cal U To me is one of the best schools in Pennsylvania and I think nothing has to change about it it’s cool just the way it is. I love everything about it .
Sophomore,4,The campus is beautiful and the professors are very helpful. There aren’t many things to do around campus but it is still a very nice place
Junior,4,"Cal U is very comforting because of how the campus is in one area, you don’t have to worry about getting to classes on time because the buildings are all in the same spot. The housing options are very nice and very suitable for college students. The security is fairly good which puts a lot of students’ minds at ease. The parking situation could be better, but there is the campus bus that runs in case you don’t have somewhere to park. Overall, cal u is an awesome university to choose for your college education in regards to student living, academics, and your social life!"
Freshman,4,"California University of Pennsylvania is by far my dream school. As a freshman coming in the people here were so welcoming and friendly. Cal offers so many majors and opportunities to help you succeed in whatever path you decide to take. The campus is beautiful and is in a small quite town, making the community very close to the college students and activities going on. CalU has wonderful housing with bathrooms in your own dorm and a big space to store your belongings. Food probably being the most important question and yes, the school has many options. Chic Fil a, Starbucks, Salad places and many more. Being hungry or craving a coffee will never be a question. I encourage all students in high school to just take a look at CalU, although the location and some amenities don’t seem super appealing I promise it will feel like home once you move in."
Sophomore,4,There have been so many helpful people who I've encountered randomly who have helped me be successful.
Senior,4,"My overall experience with California university of Pennsylvania is good, the campus offers a wide variety of classes/ majors/ activities for the students and local community to participate in."
Senior,4,"The course work is light and the campus is on the smaller side. However the course work is not challenging and there is no organization between advisers, scheduling staff, and other departments. It is next to impossible to get something done with your credits if you really need it. I do feel that the courses themselves need to be more challenging and that there needs to be a more comprehensive way of teaching the students."
Junior,4,"CAL WHO?! CAL U!

Over all, I love California University of Pennsylvania. I can count on one hand how many professors I disliked, but I would need to make a list for all of those I have loved. Most of them are willing to work with you if you are experiencing issues.

As a heads up, all first year students at Cal U, Freshmen AND Transfers, must take a course, UNI 101. The prof who teaches it is a nightmare. For one of the sessions we had to do physical activity. I have a bad hip that likes to randomly flair up and it just so happen to do so on the day of physical activity. I tried talking to her at the beginning of class about the issue and that I could barely walk. She kept brushing me off until she cupped her hands around her mouth like a megaphone and yelled, ""I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR YOUR DRAMA!"" I should have reported her.... My advice for this mandatory course keep your head down, do all assignments as soon as you get them, and bite your tongue."
Graduate Student,4,Great online graduate program with great professors who help when needed and keep the online courses flowing smoothly.
Sophomore,4,"I really enjoy many things abut California University of Pennsylvania. I am in the teaching program, which CalU is known for, so the structure is very good but difficult. I am in a program called the Four Year Grad Plan which helps you to graduate in 4 years which I think is awesome since so many people have a 4 year degree but have to be in college for 6 years. If Cal could change anything, I don't think it'd have to do with the education. Maybe just making the parking situation a little different. Overall, California University of Pennsylvania is a very good college. I think I am learning so much, I work so much harder in college than I ever even tried to in high school."
Freshman,4,"As a new freshman who has never had any prior college experience, I really enjoy living at home and commuting to a beautiful campus. The class sizes are smaller than I anticipated, but it’s really wonderful to build close relationships with my professors. However, I’d like to see more students with the attitude I have. It seems that a lot of students keep to themselves, and while I’m not much of a “party-goer”, it’s good to have friends and make connections. I can’t wait for the future semesters! Go Vulcans!!"
Sophomore,4,"I just transferred here after attending a much larger university. I definitely enjoy the smaller campus, ease of access, and constant student activities."
Junior,4,"I'm currently going to CALU and I will say overall I'm having a wonderful experience. As someone who takes online college, I never feel left out or can't communicate with my professors. Every professor I've had so far have been professional and helpful. Besides the ongoing headache with financial aid, I would highly recommend CALU to everyone especially military members. They have worked with me and my schedule being active duty. I've went through several colleges that offered online degrees and by far this is the best. Also CALU was one few universities offering the exact degree I wanted to have so to me that always a plus."
Junior,4,The campus is beautiful and easy to get around. The faculty are overall helpful and kind. My experience at Cal U has so far been great and I am looking forward to getting my dregree from this university.
Sophomore,4,"CALwho?CALU! Great looking school with a lot of opportunity in a small town. The professors are professional, and require a lot of growing up to do to communicate well with them. The facilities are great though and the campus feels safe at any time of day."
Sophomore,4,I love the college. The professors are very caring and push you to succeed. The dorms are amazingly spacious and well kept up.
Sophomore,4,"The teachers are very welcoming and understanding and they do their best to help you. The offices are the same way however, some of their regulations make things hard."
Junior,4,I’m student transfer to this university. I found a degree I wanted for a long time (Arabic language and literature) . I’m going to take all my classes online. I live in Wisconsin. This scholarship if I get it would help because outside state tuition is very expensive.
Sophomore,4,It was the right fit for me personally. It's a smaller campus so I didn't feel lost in the crowd. The staff is friendly. There are also great resources around campus.
Freshman,4,California University of Pennsylvania is a great campus for every person that comes here. California's academics and campus environment is very exceptional.  There are many students activities and clubs here at CAL U it is as well a great place to make friendships. While being on the CAL U hockey team it is very easy to get along with people on campus and as well enjoy the campus life.
Freshman,4,"This school has an amazing atmosphere. The students and staff are so friendly and the faculty is always more than willing to help you succeed in your future. They have many opportunity's for success like Starfish, The Four Year Grad Plan and many more. If you do not succeed at this school, you are not using the facilities to your advantage because there are so many things out there to help you at California University of Pennsylvaina"
Junior,4,CalU is a great university that meets my academic needs. I am a transfer active duty military member and I have not had any problems thus far. My instructors are fantastic and understanding of my situations and my degree program fits my current and future employment needs.
Junior,4,California University of Pennsylvania is a wonderful school to attend.  It is awesome for students who enjoy smaller classrooms and better one on one time with professors.  It is a very enjoyable experience if you choose to go here!
Graduate Student,4,I have had nothing but smooth sailing with the academic and non-academic aspects of this school.  Everything is timely and very well organized.  The faculty and staff are helpful and friendly.  The quality of education is very satisfactory.  I feel that I am getting my monies worth.
Niche User,4,"I really like the fact that it is a small campus, they normally have around 9,500 students which is not very big for a public college. The dorms are also very nice."
Freshman,4,"The campus is full of gorgeous scenery. It's much more beautiful than the town. The food could be better in the cafeteria, but there is a lot to choose from, both from in there and the surrounding on-campus ""fast food"". It is a small campus so it's pretty easy to get to classes unless they're on the exact ends of campus, with 10 minutes in-between. Even then, it's still pretty reasonable."
Freshman,4,"My first semester at this college has been good. The classes I had were challenging, yet bearable. It can bee very quiet at times, and that means study time can be good for you. Its just the location is bad if you dont have a car because alot of the places are driving distance and that the buses run differently. The professors help and there are a lot of resources to help you with what ever you need to help pass the class."
Junior,4,"I have had a lot of fun within the few years I have had here at CAL-U.  I've joined many different clubs and I've made lots of friends.  This is a really good college to attend to. Everything is really close and not far spread out making it very convenient to get back and forth to classes without any hassle of transportation. Most of the professors here are willing to take the time out to help you with anything if you need it, but only during their office hours.  There are lots of resources on campus that you can use if you are having troubles or need any help with anything.  Some of the students are willing to help or even talk to you; you just can't be shy to talk or you won't make any friends here. Get out of your comfort zone and go make a friend."
Freshman,4,"California University of PA has an amazing academic program, specifically the Criminal Justice Department. The culture here is very diverse and fun; there are always events to get involved in. A change I would like to see is the food; the options are always the same. A mix of foods would be great."
Senior,4,"I love the campus and the diversity. Everything is close by and the campus is only a mile around. The teachers are amazing, in my experience with Criminal Justice all the professors are retired or part time from what they teach which is really awesome because they can not only have the academic side but personal story side to the teaching."
Sophomore,4,Great atmosphere! It's very diverse and there's always something to do on campus! The food has its days and the housing is great. CalU is very welcoming to incoming freshman and transfer students.
Sophomore,4,I am a current student enrolled in a global online course offered by CALU. I love that I can be anywhere and have access to coursework at anytime. I am challenged by the course work and enjoy the online presence (interaction) with my classmates and professors. Everyone wants me to succeed.
Junior,4,"I really like the campus at CalU. It is very ""earth friendly"" and has some great places on and off campus to dine. If you have friends or family visiting, you can show them a good time."
Freshman,4,My experience with Cal U so far is good. I met the right friends to have fun with and also got involved with many things on campus so I'm always busy and active.
Niche User,4,I like California University of Pennsylvania because it is a good place for students to get an introduction into the college experience.
Alum,4,"Most professors were very organized. The chemistry courses were all set up the same way, which made it a nice transition between classes. Classes should have been offered more often and with larger class sizes. It was difficult to get into the courses I needed to graduate."
Senior,4,"The Environmental Studies and Biology department at CalU is wonderful. There are incredibly intelligent, devoted, and caring professors in the department who want to see you succeed. I have been lucky enough to learn from many of these professors, and they have immensely increased my knowledge in my field of Environmental Science. 
The college is incredibly expensive though, especially being an out-of-state student. There are certain fees that should definitely be lowered, such as the amount of money we're paying to cover the costs of the Natali Student Union, as well as the semester-based fees for the workout facilities. I also disagree with some of the required 100 level classes; some of these requirements are incredibly frustrating as a transfer student who is trying to complete required classes for my major but has to pay extra money to take the 100 level classes over the summer so I can graduate on time."
Niche User,4,The students and teachers are great and easy to work with. Athletics at California University of PA are great also. I would like to see more students participating in the sports and activities.
Freshman,4,"This school has lots of wonderful attributes; there are many options for dining, there are many options for physical activity (including a gym/pool, the activities/groups you can join), and it helps you meet unique personalities of people that go to school at California University of Pennsylvania. I would do first semester of my first year all over again, because I loved it so much. I know you will too!"
Junior,4,"I love going here. the campus is beautiful and small. You really get to know your peers here. The dorms and apartments here are nice and well kept. The town however could be better. It's not a lot to do in town. If you are not involved on campus, you will be bored."
Senior,4,"Overall, the school is very nice and has some truly excellent professors. However, with it being in such a small area, sometime there is not much to do: i. e. movies, shopping, etc. "
Freshman,2,can't really blame the school's staff because the coronavirus popping up out of no were but to be fair to everyone no one was ready for that
Senior,2,Here at Calu the faculty don't seem to care too deeply about the students. There's nothing to do off campus except for go to the bar. More faculty involvement would be ideal. Maybe something the community could offer the school or the town could be invested in a little.
Sophomore,2,The professors are okay some care about what you learn some are just there. Other professors are terrible at teaching students. The food there is awful. And it's just boring to be there.
College Sophomore,2,Lots of parties get busted.  Not good.  They don't do much for the community.
College Freshman,2,"We do not have greek life at our school that I am aware of, it is a community college."
College Freshman,2,"There is not much religious diversity, it's mostly Christian or non-affiliating people on campus. There is a very nice amount of racial diversity but there is a lot of racism. A lot of people are conversative and not open to discussing issues respectably that they don't agree with during classes"
College Freshman,2,Everyone seems to hate the Greek community and they do nothing for the campus culture other than throw parties and attempt to recruit members. Otherwise they're entirely irrelevant.
College Freshman,2,"A lot of this is inapplicable to me, but I have not had any problems."
College Sophomore,2,"You have to be in with the right people to know about parties, or at least good ones."
College Senior,2,"There is nothing around the campus, the school makes up the whole town. Everything outside of the campus feels weird and uncomfortable"
College Freshman,2,There's like 3 places you can go to and they're very dirty and don't have the best food.
College Sophomore,2,"It's a very small town with basically nothing to do. Once you're 21 you can go to a few bars, but that's about it."
College Sophomore,2,"Getting into this school is one of the easiest things in the world. They practically begged me to come here once they found out I had a 3.8 GPA. That should tell you a lot. The application process is really standard, as long as you graduated high school and took the SATs once, you'll probably get in. It's kind of a joke really. The real issue comes with the major you pick. My major, Commercial Music Technology, requires a performance and interview audition which I will be completing next week. I've been told it's pretty competitive because there aren't many spots available due to not a lot of equipment or space to teach everyone. Other programs you need crazy high GPAs for so really if you care enough, you'll work hard to stay where you want to be."
College Sophomore,2,"The town is mostly dependent on the college to sustain it. I imagine that when summer or winter break rolls around it's a ghost town because even just the weekends feel like that. There is very little to do in town, what with the five whole restaurants and all but one of them close by 10 on weeknights. The campus activities are not enough to hold interest so mostly people end up just wandering around town looking for something to do. That's why there are a lot of frat parties and other weekend things that happen off campus because we have nothing in town to occupy our time. Also, there have been quite a few reports of crime in my short time here. Armed robberies have happened twice in a year and a half and there are numerous unreported rape cases and other petty thievery. It's not yet gotten to the point that I'm afraid to walk into town alone, but I prefer to stick with at least one other person. It's just a bit sketchy and that's because there isn't really anything else to do. Once the town realizes that it's not just old people in it, then maybe we could try to do something about making the young adults who have to stay here more welcome."
College Sophomore,2,Town can be sketchy at night- I wouldn't walk alone. Anywhere on campus is pretty safe though. As far as locations in town there's basically nothing and the campus is the main attraction.
College Junior,2,I don't really party. I don't drink and its pretty boring when you are the only person that is not drinking
College Sophomore,2,The liberal arts / general education classes are very hard to get into because they try to limit class size to 30 or less but without the proper amount of professors on staff to do it.
Recent Alumnus,2,"Sports should be a large part of college; with groups of guys attending games with letters painted on their torso. However, it really isn't, which is a shame because sporting events and school pride can be very fun and exciting."
College Freshman,2,There's nothing to do and the majority of the town is populated by older people.
College Freshman,2,"The man who owns most of the property in town refuses to allow any new chain restaurants to come in.  Because of this, the only options are a Subway, a Quiznos, a Dairy Queen, 3 bars, and a couple small restaurants.  This sounds like a lot of choice, except that the only places that are cheap enough to eat at more than once a week are both sandwich shops.

The only grocery stores are a Dollar General and a Walmart."
College Freshman,2,There's always alcohol at parties and no one is really concerned if you go to Cal or not because usually there's at least a couple high schoolers from the local area there too.
College Freshman,2,"The town of California, really doesn't have much, but it's not too far from Pittsburgh."
College Freshman,2,There's really nothing to do outside of Cal. The closes mall is like 20 minutes away and you usually have to pay a toll to get there.
College Freshman,2,"I didn't know who my advisor was until the end of the first semester. Also, I was confused by the required tests and qualifications I needed by my second semester."
College Freshman,2,There aren't really any options and there's nowhere to get healthy food.
College Freshman,2,The town is small and there is nothing to do. The only good thing is being close to a large city which is Pittsburgh.
College Freshman,2,The campus says it is strict with certain things but do not act upon any of the problems going on
College Freshman,2,I honestly feel not very safe being on campus especially at night when I am alone. I will not leave my room unless I have some one to walk with.
College Freshman,2,There are a lot of underage drinking going on inside the dorms and no one has noticed. There are also people doing drugs inside the dorms and you can smell it throughout the hall. The safety needs some work done to it.
College Sophomore,2,Not a lot of diversity.
College Sophomore,2,"It's alright, somewhat dangerous in some locations. There is a lot of off campus crimes."
College Sophomore,2,I don't care much for greek life.
College Freshman,2,My financial aid process is alright but I still don't full understand and it is more difficult to receive financial aid.
College Freshman,2,the school is broke it is hard to get scholarship money
College Freshman,2,if you dont have a car or a friend with a car your f***ed the bus takes forever
College Freshman,2,Its strict but nobody ever follows the rules too many ppl do it at once its impossible to get everyone in trouble
College Freshman,2,"there are like very few places the mexicans got shut down so thats one less, chinese food is good but very very low quality, there is a subway, a DQ, a quiznos which i keep forgeting exists cause the walk is long. Spuds is like the late night hangout but very not healthy. there are a few more but no big deal if you want mcdonalds or like other places you have to go out in the real world"
College Freshman,2,There is only like a few good fraternities and sororities and they aren't even that good like in other colleges they just throw like the only parties around this boring town
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't a ton to do around campus or town, it's pretty low key and honestly not a party school."
College Freshman,2,I did not get much even though I needed it
College Sophomore,2,My opinion could be biased because I live in close proximity to the school and never wanted to go there but the meal options are limited. There are few places to choose from on campus non of which were good and they have no big name options. It's a very small campus but it is beautiful. There is not very much diversity the campus population is primarily composed of Caucasians and African Americans.  Cal U is almost like a bigger high school and you do not get a true college experience here. 
College Freshman,2,"when its cold, its freezing it makes you not want to leave your room."
College Junior,2,"Nothing in town. I suggest if one is to attend this school that it is for acedemics and a party every now and then. Everything is out of town, and getting to places is difficult, if not impossible without a car."
College Junior,2,A lot of things on campus are controlled and regulated by campus police. It is a dry campus and incidents that occurred with the past few years have made the school more and more constricted.
College Freshman,2,"Peer pressure is very bad on campus. Most students persist in doing drugs and drinking alcohol on campus and tend to pressure others into participating, even if they do not even notice that they are pressuring them. Police try to enforce underage drinking as much as possible but there is only so much that they can do. "
College Freshman,2,It's expensive unless you take the river lot which is a little bit of a hike
College Junior,2,"The games can get very interesting, but there isn't much school spirit which is disappointing."
College Junior,2,There is not much to do at all. There are local pizza shops and a Dollar General and that is it. You are an hour away from Pittsburg though. It's easier to find things to do if you bring your car to school with you. Otherwise you'll get bored very easily.
College Junior,2,"Parking on campus is scarce  and permits are too expensive.  Best that I lived near campus in school housing and my parking was included, and I was able to get a free parking permit and take campus bus from housing to campus and back every day."
College Freshman,2,"The health center is excellent, however there was an armed robbery in a students dorm this past week..."
College Freshman,2,"The campus is beautiful, and the staff and students are friendly. However the town is not up to par, and the amount of break ins and attempted armed robbery make me question my safety as an out of state student. "
College Freshman,2,"The food is average, there is always some where open for food. However the cafeteria it is either hit or miss by day. "
College Freshman,2,A lot of variation between types of people. Some one for everyone 
College Senior,2,"I love my area of interest, but the faculty and staff have been a struggle working with. The students are wonderful, but it has been a difficult three semesters."
Recent Alumnus,2,Nothing to be done about it. It's Southwestern PA. Overcast most days but always beautiful.
College Sophomore,2,All we have are fast food places. There aren't many healthy food places nor food markets.
College Sophomore,2,"I am going to give an average grade for the city. There really is not much to do in the town.  There are really only places to eat, two banks, and off campus housing.  To actually go out and have fun one would have to go to surrounding cities."
College Junior,2,Not a lot to do.  Mostly just some places to eat.  Very few places to hang out around unless you want to drive to Pittsburgh which is about 45 mins.
College Freshman,2,There aren't many options that aren't outrageously priced near the campus without living beyond 10+ miles away.
College Freshman,2,There are different races and religions at CALU but whites still out number by other races by 85%.  They do have organizations for the different races but they do not have good churches in the area.
Freshman,1,Horrible set up you’ll be learning absolutely nothing. Or atleast I didn’t was a waste of my tution honestly I decided to transfer to a better school to actually lean something that can elevate me academically
College Sophomore,1,Nothing for my vegetarian diet. Really hard to eat healthy.
College Freshman,1,The food at the Rush is disgusting. The meal period times are ridiculous which makes students lose out on money.
College Senior,1,"It's HORRIBLE! The only thing we have around campus is Subway, Diary Queen, Spuds & Campys which is pizza and stuff like that, and a Chinese place that idek how it is still open."
College Junior,1,I have attempted to receive a scholarship every year for my internship and have always been turned away.
College Freshman,1,"Im too poor for any of this. If I do have extra money and grab food, I end up getting sick from grease."
College Freshman,1,Every cop around treats you like a criminal. I was carrying a coffee cup and was asked what was in it at 8 am.
College Freshman,1,It would've helped if I received even a little bit. My wallet is hurting but because I'm just above poverty level I don't get a dime.
College Freshman,1,"I normally end up heating meals in my dorm. The gold rush makes me sick. The bistro is probably my favorite, but it only accepts dine dollars."
College Freshman,1,This town has a limited number of off-campus dining and if you want a decent meal you would have to go to Pittsburgh or any other cities nearby.
College Sophomore,1,Everyone goes home on the weekends.
Recent Alumnus,1,"California is a small town that few even hear of outside of the university residing there. It is about 45 minutes from downtown PGH, Morgantown, malls, etc. It is a drive to get practically anywhere. If you attend the university there is enough to do and enough people to talk to that it doesn't matter, but you start to get cabin fever after a while and are just looking for some crowds and excitement, so a lot of young people leave on weekends and return Sunday night or Monday for the week to begin again."
College Freshman,1,"There's nothing to do in town, so most of the students party."
College Freshman,1,"If it's not raining, it's muggy.  Pennsylvania has the worst weather (it used to be a swamp!), and it gets worse as you go south."
College Freshman,1,Police break up parties immediately
College Freshman,1,"I am transferring, I would not want this experience again."
College Freshman,1,"Internships are lacking, no one seems to want to help you either."
College Freshman,1,I did not receive any scholarships I applied for.
College Junior,1,"I have had bad experiences being a minority from both campus police and the students. I believe that such a rural area for a minority can be difficult or easy depending on priorities, and focus on parties or academics. Parties will only get you into trouble."
College Freshman,1,"Not much of a town, and there are crimes and armed robberys nearly once or twice a month. "
College Junior,1,"CalU recently changed their parking policy to paid parking by having a permit.  Even with a permit you are not guaranteed a spot near your class building, especially if you are commuting.  I often park on a side street to avoid parking tickets and paying for a permit.  They do not offer a parking package for students who commute and only visit campus 1-2 times a week.  Paying for a pass for the entire semester is not worth it."
Recent Alumnus,1,This pertains to end of degree loans and may not be cal u's fault. The exceeded loan limits bs leaves students hung out to dry.
College Junior,1,"They say they prohibit all illegal drug use and it's a dry campus, but it's far from it. I told several people about drug use in my hall and nothing was done. Party!"
College Freshman,1,The California Police tend to forget this is a college campus and college activity is going to occur. Parties get shut down within an hour or stating . If it does get busted the fines are a ridiculous amount even if you weren't drinking . And don't even think about having a party in the dorms the CA's will shut it down in 5 minutes.
College Freshman,1,"NIghtlife for students under 21 is boring there is not anything to do , no where to go and no one to really see. There are no clubs in California Pa, There are not really any place for college students to hang out. College life for 21 and over is just two bars and even that I hear get quite boring"
College Freshman,1,"The nightlife at Cal U is okay, I think that most students that are not the age of 21 are scared to go out due to the amount of cops that are out, & how oftem parties get busted. There is not much for teens to really do at Cal U. You pretty much have to make your own fun most of the time."
College Freshman,1,extremely expensive! parking tickets are a constant present from the parking police. inconvenient and far from the dorms with an exception to the few who get a lucky draw from the hat. the river lot sucks!!!
College Freshman,1,"Horrible end of story. You will go bored out of your mind. If you are not eating you will find nothing in town. Seriouslly there is a dollar store, gas station, dairy queen, spuds, and a bank thats it."
College Junior,1,On campus food is expensive and tasteless. The Gold Rush is a buffet there that is known for making people sick. I eat off campus.
College Sophomore,1,"The wireless through the school is almost always slow, especially when trying to use things like netflix and xbox live."
College Junior,1,"Punishments Are Followed Like a Rulebook – Policies are very closely followed here. If you don't have a parking permit, you will get a ticket. Underaged drinking is followed by a ticket. It is a very fun, yet safe school."
College Junior,1,"Learn to Spend Money Here and There – The cafeteria food is poor.  They could have done a better job with it.  The other places to eat in the student union aren't too too bad but honestly, learn to spend a little and be prepared to every once and a while because the food will get old real fast."
College Senior,1,Classes Hours and Online Courses – seems to only apply to younger students not a very good school for older adults.
College Sophomore,1,Greek Who? In college movies the Greeks tend to play a huge role in them but not here!  I have never even heard of the Greeks aside from one time.  There is a movie theater at Cal U and I went to go see a movie.  I was told the movie was cancelled because the Greeks had a meeting.  Other than that it seems to be just regular students and no one group dominates the University.
College Sophomore,1,"I'm Too Drunk to Know What Drunks Means. Drug use at Cal U is terrible!  I do not partake in any of it but my friends and roommates surely did.  My roommate would come home drunk and my friends would tell me how someone offered them drugs and they said yes.  Also, my roommate had alcohol bottles on our counter and we had inspection in a few hours. It was in plain sight.  I once had a knock on my door and the person on the other side wanted to know if I wanted a crack lollipop.  He had a whole bag of them."
College Sophomore,1,They Took Away My Aid! The took away my financial aid because I had to medically withdrawal because I was in the hospital. It has really screwed me over beyond belief.
College Sophomore,1,"It was my first semester of freshman year. School hadn't started yet, but we had to move in a week early for orientation. My roommate was stuck up and privileged, I was poor. She decided to call the cops and tell them that I had stolen her green highlighter. By the way, I didn't do that. I got taken by campus police, they took away my dorm key, I was left without a dorm room for a week and had to crash in other people's dorms randomly, I wasn't allowed to get my books, laptop, money, or even ID out of my room. Not until I was escorted by police. I was reported and had to attend several hearing at the university, they kept it on my college record as, ""breaking in entering, theft, and threating to harm"", I had to take several courses online on how to live with a roommate. 

I got robbed. I told police. They accused my of both lying AND selling drugs. Okay...1- why would I make that up? And 2- what does drugs have to do with anything!? They went into my dorm and found my roommates drugs (she's insane). She was on cocaine at the time and thought that I reported her. She attacked me. I fought back. I got reported again, I had to go to both real people court and university hearings. That was also first semester. 

I was walking and minding my own business. I got taken away for being drunk, I was sober. I had never even drank ever at that point in my life. Nothing happened. The point of that story is to let you know that they are constantly harping on innocent people because they are over staffed and have no lives."
College Junior,1,Permit Costs – It cost $200 per semester for me to park at school. The parking spot I have is a bit of a hike from where my classes are. The cost of parking is outrageous and unreasonable.
College Sophomore,1,"Old Coal Town – California is an old coal town, a lot of the buildings that students rent out are not in good condition due to ""slum landlords."" The people who live there are nice but really a majority of the population is students. There are no grocery stores nearby only a Rite Aid and Dollar General. The closest Walmart and Giant Eagle are about 15 mins. away by the interstate so if you don't have a car you are stuck or have to take the Mid Mon Valley Transit. As for restaurants there are a few bars, Subway and a Dairy Queen not too much to pick from. There are two parks but they;re small but they seem to be used a lot. There is no other attractions in town the only shopping other than the aforesaid are a clothing store for CAL wear and that's it."
College Sophomore,1,"Not a Lot of Options – There is not much variety when it comes to food. The little food offered is overpriced, often under or overcooked, and not very tasteful."
College Senior,1,"Slumlords of Washinton County – Apartments abound. Problem is, they're not maintained and one man owns a large majority of the rental properties. He's notorious for neglecting maintenance and finding legal ways to keep security deposits."
College Senior,1,Overpriced Poor Selection – The selection is terrible at every venue except for the dinner banquets hosted for special events. I spend $15 to $20 a day just for two cappuccinos and two sandwiches or two rolls of warm sushi.
College Sophomore,1,Physical Therapy Program – I love PTA but hate that you have to basically compete to get in because they only accept a limited amount of people. The work is really hard also.
College Freshman,1,"there isnt much to do if your 21 and under excpet go to parties, which usually gets busted by calu police."
College Junior,1,"Doesn't Exist. There's a bar or two in town, but the only nightlife is what's on campus."
Recent Alumnus,1,The parking is crazy. It is insane that parking is the amount that it is. Even if people wanted to ride the bus it still cost $175. They raised the prices this year and the rates are even more higher.
College Junior,1,The Boring Life – I lived off campus since I started to attend cal.  On the plus side the locals are very nice I met alot of new friends but other than that off campus living is not fun at all.  Cal hosts some events to keep students happy but there is not even a movie theater or mall in the area you have to drive at leats 30 minutes to even get to a walmart.
College Junior,1,"Not Easy – I'm filling out this survey in hope of receiving some money for school. Financial aid through Cal U is helpful, but they don't offer a whole lot. I once asked a woman in the Financial Aid office if she could help me find some scholarships, or at least give me some direction in where to look. She asked if I had filled out FAFSA and when I told her I had, she said there wasn't much she could do and to look online. Not very helpful."
College Sophomore,1,"Small Town – California, PA is a very small town.  The campus is beautiful but it is kind of boring.  To really have fun, students have to go to WVU or Pittsburgh and that is like 45 minute to and hour long drive.  There isn't much in the town to really have fun, so students have to make their own."
College Sophomore,1,"Not Very Good – Being a commuter, I didn't hang around that much, so meeting guys hasn't been working out for me."
College Junior,1,The parking situation is terrible. The cost is way too high now. And if you park somewhere you shouldn't be for more than 2 minutes you get a huge fine. There isn't anywhere to park on side streets even..
College Junior,1,"There are many different types of races here on campus, but they're more Caucasians, than minorities."
College Sophomore,1,"The parking problem just increased the university is making people pay 400 dollars for a permit, when last year parking was free.  A lot of students are recieving tickets for their cars."
College Senior,1,Parking is terrible. Permits cost too much and you need a car for everything.
College Senior,1,"In the Middle of Nowhere – There are only 3 bars in town, and one bar that is a short driving distance. The parties are very smalll and are typically not very fun."
College Junior,1,Parking is not free for the first time this year and it is extremely overpriced.
College Sophomore,1,"Okay for a Starter College – Cal U is not a challange. I came here for 2 years to get my grades up and i'm transfering somewhere else. The town is crappy and dangerous, it snows all the time, and there is hardly anything to do."
College Sophomore,1,"The off campus housing at Calu is dirty and dangerous. People have been shot and raped at parties. The apartments are very unclean, and often unlocked. I do not live off campus but I can only imagine how easy it is to get robbed."
College Freshman,1,"Way Too Expensive – Parking is outrageous. It is way too expensive. There are many spots and parking lots that are vacant during the day and weekends. I think that the ticket pricing is okay, but unecasary. No one even uses the parking garage."
College Junior,1,Not Very Good – It is really expensive to park and there is not enough spots people have to park about 10 minutes away it blows.

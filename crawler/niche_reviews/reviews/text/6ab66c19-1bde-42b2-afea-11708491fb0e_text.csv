Niche User,5,As an athlete I attended a visit and was very pleased with the welcome and environment of the university. Very nice people and a small but beautiful campus with a nice town nearby.
Alum,5,"Professors work hard to ensure that content is rigorous and accessible for the online platform, giving students a personalized individual experience even online."
Alum,5,"Rigorous individualized instruction, beautiful campus, great opportunities. Caring and knowledgeable faculty."
Senior,5,My experience at Mary Baldwin has been great. Professors and advisors are caring and supportive. Classes meet academic standards.
Freshman,5,"I haven’t been attending Mary Baldwin long, but every single person I have come in contact with through the college has been so helpful! I honestly don’t think I could have gotten any luckier and I know that I made the best decision by apply for this college. Everyone is always right there willing to help you in any way possible!"
Freshman,5,So far everyone working for MBU Online has been  OUTSTANDING. I have had so many obstacles that they have worked so hard with me to overcome. I am so incredibly ready to begin my year there!
Junior,5,"I am an online pat time student and a full time employee, I like the online set up.  the professors are wonderful, and they really want to see us succeed that means a lot. they are more than helpful. the financial aid crew are wonderful as well"
Freshman,5,My experience with this school so far has been amazing! The workers here really try to go above and beyond to make you feel understood and at home.
Freshman,5,MBU is an amazing school. There is a large LGBT population here. Neither me or my boyfriend have experienced no discrimination here. I love it here.
Sophomore,5,"Small class sizes with professors that care. The food is ok. I have yet to have a class I haven’t enjoyed. We don’t party here, we got to Bridgewater and NMU to do all that."
Sophomore,5,"I JUST RECENTLY FINISHED MY FIRST YEAR AT MBU. ALTHOUGH I DON'T LIVE ON CAMPUS, I FOUND IT REALLY EASY TO CONNECT TO THE CAMPUS LIFE AND THE ACTIVITIES AROUND ME. I FELT REALLY COMFORTABLE IN ALL MY CLASSES AND I FORMED GREAT RELATIONSHIPS WITH MY ADVISORS AND PROFESSORS. LOOKING FORWARD TO THE THREE YEARS AHEAD OF ME AND EVERYTHING THEY'LL HOLD!"
Graduate Student,5,"I love the history surrounding this college/university, its roots in educating women, and the supportive environment from their educators and the location itself. As a current Student Physical Therapist in their Doctor of Physical Therapy program, I have fallen in love with the area and couldn't have asked for better professors to guide me in my path of becoming a health care provider."
Freshman,5,A beautiful campus with an extremely diverse and inclusive atmosphere to it. Professors care so much about you here. If you don't show up to class you'll get a phone call from your professor asking if you're alright and if there is anything they can do. Our men's soccer team is also amazing.
Senior,5,They are a small University with a lot of personality.  The professors are encouraging and friendly.  They have gone out of their way to help me be successful in my college career.
Freshman,5,"Our Campus is old and beautiful. We have good food and an extremely diverse student body population. Lots of study abroad programs. 
We are NOT a party school. If you want that you're gonna have to drive up to JMU or Bridgewater on weekends.
Our dorm halls don't have AC (bring a box fan)
Downtown Staunton is a beautiful area, a little sleepy in the winter though.
There is always something happening on Campus. 
Join clubs (it's fun and it keeps things exciting).
We are coed now. And male athletes are extremely desirable to the school. If your a guy and you play a sport, apply you'll get hella scholarships.
Lots of snow in the winter. If you're from somewhere where its warm you're going to want to bring warm clothes and boots.
Were on top of a mountain. We got hills. And stairs. You ain't gonna need to go to the gym cuz your gonna get your workout just by walking."
Freshman,5,I wish MBU got more credit! Ive never had a class with more than 20 people in it.  The campus is gorgeous and Staunton is a beautiful little town. We have 5 other colleges and universities next door to us. I got an internship as a freshman working at the local PR firm. Where else could you do that?
Junior,5,"As a man who had previous reservations about attending this school, I can tell you that this school is an all around amazing place to be. I don't understand why Niche is still saying its an all women's college. Its a small school so theres no greek life, but the boisterous social atmosphere makes it worth it. The Marketing and Communications tracks are amazing."
Freshman,5,"Mary Baldwin University contrary to this website, is a coed University. The school is beautiful. Academics are phenomenal. The people are amazing. The school itself is nearly two hundred years old, therefore dorms and a few of the student life buildings could use some updates."
Senior,5,Mary Baldwin University has allowed me to explore all of my interests. I do not believe that I would have double majored at any other institution.
Freshman,5,What i liked about Mary Baldwin university is that the scenery is beautiful and everyone there is wonderful
Sophomore,5,"Mary Baldwin University, what could I say in order to give you a picture of campus life. The students body are as diverse, as is the exceptional variety of courses offered.  I believe growing up in Staunton I was in awe of the history surrounding the school.. Within the small town of Staunton, you cannot help but be in awe of such a picturesque campus, steeped in a long history of excellence. Now that it is no longer a Girls Only School, my dream has come true!"
Freshman,5,"The best thing about Mary Baldwin is how they make you feel like family. JMU is the place you'll have to go for a party and the Campus Cafe for a decent sandwich, but you'll always be coming home to a warm bed, nice people, good teachers and role models, and new friends."
College Sophomore,5,"Hundreds of courses are offered each semester with amazing professors to teach them and with the classes being grouped small, students can focus better. the style which is usually a lectured type of teaching is both boring but interesting when learning about a topic you are interested in."
College Junior,5,"I love how small the campus is and how friendly the faculty and students are. There are many opportunities for you to advance, not only academically but also in student government and in clubs."
College Sophomore,5,"Mary Baldwin has such a welcoming, comforting feel to it I can't imagine going to any other school."
College Sophomore,5,"I got really good financial aid, and the process was easy. They worked with me with my military benefits, and were very helpful."
College Senior,5,"The process of getting into the RCW (residential college for women) progrzm was easy. I received an email from Mary Baldwin College during my senior year in high school offering me to fill out a premium application in which i did not have to pay an application fee or write an essay. I filled out the application and found out that I got accepted. I ended up choosing a different school for my freshmen year and I began attending Mary Baldwin during my sophmore year. During the summer before my sophmore year I received numerous emails to set up my student account and to fill out my housing application. I also received my award letter which stated the amount of money I would get for tuition. I called the registrar in order to register for classes since I did not have an advisor. The entire process was easy and I was always able to get in touch with someone at the school when needed. I think the most important criteria fr admission is GPA, SAT/ACT scores and extracurricular activities. Even though Mary Baldwin does not have a required GPA or SAT/ACT score, they still would like it to be at least C average."
College Senior,5,My prgram is great. The workload is not too heavy and they offer a lot of internships
College Senior,5,The financial aid process was very easy and I received more money than I expected
College Senior,5,The academics at my school ar absoultely great. They offer a wide variety of majors and course. The teachers ar also very good and are always available when needed
College Senior,5,"There are a couple of off campus housing that is ran by the school where students can stay but they are reserved for international stidents snd juniors and seniors. However, there are plenty of apartments near by that  students can rent that are very cheap and very nice"
College Sophomore,5,"I definitely enjoy the Communications and Marketing program at my school. The professors and advisers for the program are very helpful. The workload is so-so, not too hard and but challenging, but the setting is very relaxed."
College Sophomore,5,My financial aid process went well and was not stressful at all.The financial aid staff are always helpful.
College Sophomore,5,Our campus is very safe. Our security is on watch at all times.
College Freshman,5,"Everything is great, helpful, and positive."
College Freshman,5,"Professors focus on one student at a time, the scenery is beautiful, someone is always willing to help out. It's by far the best school I've ever attended."
College Freshman,5,THE FOOD IS THE BEST
College Freshman,5,Campus housing is the best!
College Senior,5,There are a lot of options for classes which I love. The professors are also really great. They are always available when needed either in person or through email.
College Senior,5,I expect to have a job upon graduation
College Senior,5,Great school and the best classes
College Senior,5,I have had a positive experience
College Senior,5,I feel very safe on campus
College Junior,5,Staunton has so many dining options all within walking distance of campus.
College Junior,5,Mary Baldwin is not a party school and has a zero tolerance policy.
College Freshman,5,"Basically, you can get into any program you want to. There is no rigorous selection progress. The only program that has requirements is Global Honor  Scholars, and you need a 3.5 gpa or higher."
College Junior,5,"The women who attend this college are all very different.  We all have very different beliefs, backgrounds, and social status however everyone is open.  Everyone listens and everyone is accepting."
College Junior,5,I love the English program.  I wish they offered more classes and had more class times available.  I wish they would expand their English program.  The faculty is always helpful and will go out of their way to help you succeed.
College Junior,5,The professors are very helpful and are always willing to discuss things and recommend things to help you along the way.  I only wish there was a doctorate level English program at MBC.
College Junior,5,We have an honor policy and no one does anything to violate this.  When people do they are thrown out instantly.  Because of this we have no clime or safety issues on campus.
College Junior,5,There are a plethora of unique and posh little places to eat with in walking distance.  They are diverse.  You can eat anything from homemade pizza made with only local ingrediants to yummy pasta with only veggies.
College Sophomore,5,"I feel extremely safe at school, we have campus security. also because the school is so small everybody know each other therefore we all help each other out and make sure that everyone is okay. there are really no violent acts on campus "
College Freshman,5,I love it here. It's a great school and an awesome atmosphere. Don't let the size make you shy away. 
College Freshman,5,I adore our off campus choices
College Freshman,5,"I feel really safe and protected on campus. The security staff makes a point to know students, and to let them know that they are there whenever you need them. Nothing too serious ever happens, except the yearly drunken car accident or someone got locked out of their dorm because they lost their key."
College Freshman,5,"There are several computer labs, that are always running unless there is emergency maintenance which is very rare. The wifi is not that good in some places though. The only negative thing i can say is that the secretary sometimes forgets to fill the printer back up with paper! But thats fine, she usually leaves some outside of her office."
College Freshman,5,"MBC is known for celebrating diversity, and has no problem accomadating to everyone. Everyone seems to fit around campus, international and national students, black/white, or whatever else is around to enjoy and experience college life."
College Junior,5,MBC has a great staff and therefore academics are really good! The small class sizes offer students more one on one attention and its easier to get help if it is needed.
College Junior,5,MBC has parking everywhere so it's pretty easy to find a spot. Parking permits are very cheap compared to other schools and the security officers are always willing to help when someone is having car trouble.
College Junior,5,"As part of the ADP program at MBC, I enjoy all of the perks typical students experience.  Additionally, the professors provide added flexibility for adult students with families.  This attribute is highly desired and required."
Niche User,4,"Online learning keeps students safe and up to date on assignments. If there is any trouble, teachers are easily accessible and will answer an questions to assure you are caught up and understanding the material of the class."
Freshman,4,"The campus is beautiful and a great place to stay outdoors, but the hills and several staircase is getting tiring to travel by. I dislike that the campus is on several hills in the mountains, but I can't change that nor can the school. It is fun to roll down the grassy hills when you just want to have fun."
Freshman,4,"The professors did well with going online for schooling. However, it's hard to learn because of technical difficulties such as no audio, poor connection, and bad video quality."
Sophomore,4,"I love this school. I just hate that it cost so much to attend, even though it is private. I love how downtown Staunton is close by."
Sophomore,4,Professors are very understanding of any issues that come up to prevent on time turn in of items. Amazing staff that gets invested in the students lives.
Senior,4,Mary Baldwin has been such an exceptional school to me. They have encouraged me to finish my education and to be the best student I can be. I am humbled and greatful I chose this school.
Senior,4,"I met my spouse while attending this college, so it will always rank high; however, the lack of diversity in the teaching staff is very disheartening."
Senior,4,"Professors are 1-on-1. They adhere to your needs. Small campus with a focus more on academics, rather than parties. However, there are awesome events coordinated by the BPB chair such as Signature ball, and mixers by LOE. So it is a pretty good balance."
Sophomore,4,"Here at Mary Baldwin, my professors know me by my name and I receive the opportunity to work with them one-on-one to pursue my own interests.  I've never had such supportive teachers!"
Freshman,4,"Professors care about each and every student that do their best and want to do well. No matter how hard things get, there are always people that care. There are friendly faces everywhere and a very diverse campus. There are always events that help students get together and have a good time."
Niche User,4,I really enjoyed the campus. I would recommend this school for someone looking for a small town scene.
Freshman,4,My time so far at Mary Baldwin University is great there are great people here. There is a great sense community where everyone knows everyone. the thing i wish would change is the food isn't the best. its edible but not the best taste. i also wish that some of the administers would keep their promises.
Sophomore,4,"I love Mary Baldwin. All of my professors are willing to work with me in order to reach the goals I came to accomplish. All of their staff is friendly and very helpful. The whole school, including the almni, are your biggest supporters. I have learned so much from class and love that you are not a number, all of your teachers know you by name."
Freshman,4,"At Mary Baldwin, the community is small, but not too small. It is the perfect place to know everyone and socialize and make friends. And because it is small, the class are no more than 20 people in a class meaning you can have more one on one time with your professor. The academics are not the only thing to look forward here though. The extracurricular programs are wonderful and give the students a break from all the school work that could be stressing them out."
Freshman,4,"Mary Baldwin is an awesome school! I love the size, it’s not too big so it feels like home and all the extra curricular options make for great additions to the educational aspect."
Junior,4,I transferred to Mary Baldwin University from a local community college and that transition was very smooth. All of my credits transferred directly over and my Mary Baldwin advisor helped me greatly. My advisor always helped me through everything. The professors are kind and understanding. I work full time and have a very busy life and the professors were always understanding if I had a problem with a due date. Great college and great experience so far.
Alum,4,There were many wonderful experiences available if I wanted them.  I do not agree with how this institution is run.  They abuse employees and donors.  The administration also openly lies to alum and donors.
Senior,4,"By now I have been at Mary Baldwin for three years. I personally think it is a wonderful school, and just like every school, it has its downsides. The Residential College for Women is amazing and very women empowering! The schools Liberal Arts programs are amazing, and I particularly love their education program. The small class size makes it perfect for students to be able to interact with the teachers within the classroom and gain help when needed. Overall, I have had a wonderful experience at Mary Baldwin and would defiantly recommend the school to others."
Sophomore,4,"It's a small school with quaint neighborhoods and locally owned stores downtown. Everything necessary is close enough to walk, and a free bus can take you out to farther stores such as Walmart, Foodlion, McDonalds, etc. There are always events going on, and it's easy enough to hang out with friends. The dining services are decent enough, and frequently available if you pay On-Campus tuition."
Senior,4,I love Mary Baldwin. Overall the teachers are great and the student life faculty actually cares. Its a small school with almost no really big partying and there are tons of opportunities around campus and the town. The school is gorgeous and nice. There are a few issues with some staff but not too many with faculty.  Its a liberal school with a lot of diversity. The school prides itself on being open and understanding.
Junior,4,I love that most of the staff is extremely helpful. I also feel as though their liberal arts/elementary education program has classes and experiences that will help me become a great teacher.
Niche User,4,"Mary Baldwin is known for being a historic campus. It's rich with history, something that makes the experience better, I believe. It recently turned over to a co-education university, which has made room for even more degree opportunities. There's a place for everyone. It's also incredibly diverse, the number one private university in VA actually. The Scholarships are huge so long as you have a high gpa and pretty good test scores. The people aren't always the best, being from the south you'd think there would be nicer people but some just don't mesh well with the southernish vibes.  Almost all the staff is amazing, mainly because I worked closely with them, and other times I did met members who I'm rather glad to not encounter again."
Senior,4,"What I love about Mary Baldwin, are the small academic classes. The professors get to know you, and they are able to work better with each student due to the relatively small classroom size. The campus itself is stunning!"
Senior,4,"Out of the classes I enrolled in, I was disappointed with two, but is not a reflection on the entire institution.  Overall, the experience was great and I learned a lot.  Professors are very helpful with their feedback and encourage students to accelerate learning."
Sophomore,4,"The campus is gorgeous and there is always an event happening in town (which is adorable, by the way). There is a Walmart nearby and always somebody headed there. Largest class I've had contained 60 students, your professors know you by name and are looking for the best for you. Scheduling and housing can be a bit confusing the first time you do it, but I'm sure that is the same across the board with other universities."
Alum,4,Mary Baldwin is a great university to attend. The professors are amazing and the campus is beautiful.
Freshman,4,"Mary Baldwin have great and engagaing professors. Small class sizes. And the university is set on a mountainous landscape, so you'll definitely get a leg workout. 
note: it's an all women's college program"
Junior,4,Mary Baldwin helps students develop leadership and critical thinking. The professors are top notch and easily accessible in terms of communication.
Freshman,4,"I like the professors at Mary Baldwin and the sisterhood I have created. There are many different clubs and organizations here to choose from and the classes are fairly easy. The traditions within the office of inclusive excellence always keep me busy and are a great experience. I enjoy the scenery and weather in the area, the campus is close to downtown Staunton and it is convenient to walk there. Mary Baldwin is a great school with a diverse campus and I am proud to be a flying squirrel."
Junior,4,"My current experience so far has been very enjoyable. Mary Baldwin College is now Mary Baldwin University so there has been a small name change o reflect the growth of the school. The thing that I like most about Mary Baldwin is that the school is very diverse and enjoys being that way. There is a mixture of people, sexuality, religion, and so much more that allows students to learn and grow together in ways unimaginable.
All of the professors here are very passionate about what they are teaching, as well as being knowledgeable in their fields of study. Many of the classes are small, so professors are willing to spend time with students to help them understand course materials."
Freshman,4,The school is pretty expensive for no reason; I came to this school for the Virginia Women's Institute for Leadership program.
Recent Alumnus,4,The career center is a good resource to find interns and jobs.
Recent Alumnus,4,Do not know much about the Greek life because I'm an adult student.
Recent Alumnus,4,The professors are very professional and very helpful if there is something in the class that you don't understand.  My advisor helped me make a lot of good academic choices and is very helpful is stressful situations.
College Sophomore,4,The rooms are pretty nice
College Sophomore,4,Internships are offered every spring to junior and senior students. the Alumni are involved in every process almost within the college including any remodeling done on campus. For the past couple years the recruitment number has been low due to quality and abilities of the recruiters to pull people in with interest.
College Sophomore,4,"Students are filled with school spirit when attending a athletic game, some even dress out in school colors in order to support the team. all the athletic facilities are up to date with amazingly clean sharp fields and a gym is offered to all students during the week and weekend."
College Sophomore,4,I really do love my college because I get the help I need from professors and I can ask for tutoring help. The college is dedicated to their academic success and is very dedicated to each student during and after the student graduates.
College Junior,4,"Everyone is friendly and helpful, many resources avaible."
College Junior,4,Drug use is lower than my previous college
College Junior,4,It's everything I hoped it would be and more. All of the teachers are very knowledgeable an provide help whenever questions are asked.
College Sophomore,4,"The diversity and inclusivity of my school is absolutely  amazing and I am glad I chose to attend. I enjoy the single-sex atmosphere and the small campus. Being on a small campus allows for instructors to better know their students, and allow closer relationships between the student body and faculty"
College Junior,4,I was pleasantly surprised to be more than challenged academically at CNU.  I completed my first two years at a Virginia Community College and (with the rare exception) wasn't challenged academically.  After transferring to CNU I found the rigorous scholastic environment I was seeking.
College Freshman,4,I love Mary Baldwin college! Wonderful learning environment!
College Junior,4,"I love my college. It's very diverse and accepts a plethora of cultures/lifestyles. The environment is friendly, and therapeutic because there is always so much art around. The professors and student body are all there to help you as you progress. It's an experience I'll never forget."
College Freshman,4,I love my choice. Mary Baldwin College is an amazing school and its nice to getting away from Miami into a new and exciting place. I can't wait to see amazing people and to start my new life.
College Sophomore,4,"I stayed in Woodsen my freshman year, and would really recommend it. Its very close to the dining hall as well as the academic buildings. My room was a really nice size, and had plenty of storage as well as a sink. The hallways as well as the bathrooms were always clean. The laundry was free. Woodsen is not nearly as fun as Spencer, and you don't develop the same sense of Freshman camaraderie, as it is a mixed grade dorm. There is only one small kitchen, which is always dirty and was infested with ants. There were no good ""study"" areas, and the community areas are always taken up by people binge watching TV. It is also apparently haunted. Overall, the rooms in Woodsen are very nice, but the communal areas are lacking."
College Sophomore,4,"The food is great, the prices are average, but the only drawback is the fact that there are no student discount for restaurants. The best places to go to are the DEPO, Split Banana, and Baha."
College Sophomore,4,"The people down in financial aid helped me every step of the way. They were able to show me what I needed to do to get more aid, and everything was smooth."
College Senior,4,"There is no typical look, intrests or dress at this school. Mary Baldwin is very diverse. There are mostly lesbian relationships on campus since it is an all female college"
College Senior,4,There are plenty of places to eat near by that offers different cuisine. There are also many places that deliver to the school
College Sophomore,4,"There is a party scene to an extent. Students will have parties in their room, and for students who live off campus they may have one too. However, you need to know certain people in order to have some kind of ""party scene"" at times. Going to another school can be exhausting after a while and even expensive."
College Sophomore,4,"Housing at Mary Baldwin is pretty nice and definitely not something I would take for granted. I live in the Tullidge Dorm Building which is a very long walk onto main campus, but the other dorms are directly on campus."
College Freshman,4,Didn't realize my scholarship wasn't full so I have to pay some out of pocket money
College Freshman,4,Make sure to read the fine print
College Freshman,4,There are lots of different girls from all over the country attending the school. It's very diverse.
College Sophomore,4,Mary Baldwin is one of the most accepting campuses of gay/trans/bisexual people. We are an all girls school that is 70% lesbian/trans/bisexual with classes and activities that provide education on the life of being gay in today's society.
College Senior,4,There are ethnic or racial challenges on campus. No race or ethnicity is excluded on campus. Everyone is accepted and there is always an event for every ethnicity on campus
College Senior,4,Career services at Mary Baldwin College are very good with helping students find jobs or internships during the school year and after they graduate. Career services also send out many emails when there is a job fair in town
College Senior,4,The campus of Mary Baldwin College is very safe. I have always felt safe leaving the library or the gym late at night to go back to my dorm room
Sophomore,2,When coronavirus hit the school forced us out.  The school was not prepared and had no course of action for the students. Teachers would not answer emails until it was the day after the deadline. Other teachers expected everything to be done in one day.
Sophomore,2,"Online is very disorganized. They don’t have proper times to set up for the students and you can’t get straight answers. I don’t know how many times I needed help and never got it. In class is alright, but professors can get distracted in a snap. Sometimes they will grade you lower than what you got because if you emailed them with a problem and they don’t see it, you’re screwed. I had to end up PNCing 2 of my classes because I could not get an email back with my grades. I almost even failed a class because my professor would not reach out to me over an online test."
Sophomore,2,"So I just finished my freshman year here and i’m about to transfer. I hate it. Now why you may ask? Office hours are crap, professors are never there. You can’t get mental health help properly, and it’s very boring. I struggled my first year and could not get the help I needed. I play a sport there, yet there is nobody who’s experienced at it besides me 2 other people who have played for years. We have absolutely no spirit. I have to stay another year sadly to get my gpa up. Online school with MBU is not great. It’s very disorganized. The campus is beautiful, but really hilly."
Sophomore,2,Nothing to do. You don’t get the college experience here. Food is disgusting and dorms are terrible. Transferred to a university in Richmond and it was the best choice I’ve made. Think twice before coming here.
Niche User,2,The rooms have mold and the school doesn't do anything to rectify that. The food is discusting and they don't worry about people that have food allergies.  Some professors are great and others leave alot to be desired.
Niche User,2,I have not had a good experience with the ADP. There are always bumps in the road with little or no help. Looking to transfer.
Freshman,2,It's an okay school if you don't want to go to graduate school and want to go to a school a step above community college.
College Sophomore,2,"The gym is gross. Its on the opposite side of campus from everything else, and there is practically no equipment.Sports are kind of a joke. If you want to play a sport, you can, because sports are not competitive in anyway. I don't think we win things, like ever. It is nice that you can participate, just know we are not known for sports."
College Sophomore,2,"There are only two on campus food options. Hunt is the large dining hall, and has very limited selection as well as terrible hours. The hours constantly changed, and at some points hunt was only open for an hour for dinner. During lunch lines are very long and can last up to 20 minutes, as there are only two lines. They often prepare the same meals over and over, such as the deli bar, which consists of lunch meat and white bread. The only plus is the salad bar, and the fact that it is close to campus housing. The Pub is even worse. The food is all fried and very greasy. The healthy option is normally a baked potato.   It has very short hours, and the lines are often long. The portions are very small and severed in greasy paper containers. The plus side is that it is often not crowded as people get it to go."
College Senior,2,"The teams are good and practice often but almost never win. The work-out equipment in the gym is horrible, limited, and small."
College Senior,2,"The food will ruin your stomach, they close at 6:30 p.m., and have no late-night alternative. The dining facilities on campus haven't passed health and safety in a few years and they have been guilty for cross-contamination of the food. Also, cockroaches, flies, and rats are found crawling into the dining facilities at night and early in the morning. The town  closes early (around 8 p.m.). The closest places to eat are approximately 1-3 miles away so you need a car. The places in town are too expensive for college students. 

The dorms are falling apart, they're covered in mold, are infested with cockroaches, there is no air conditioning in the summer months and you can't open your windows because the screens have holes. The dorms also have no bathroom ventilation system and there is inconsistent house-keeping. 

The school cleans up for visitors but does not clean up for the students. When there are events on campus, the students must relocate their vehicles as parking is taken away from students and given to visitors. Freshman parking is dangerously far away. Parking for Faculty is also poor as they often must park on Staunton streets and move every two hours. 

There is also a huge disconnect between the board of trustees and the campus body. For example, throughout the years faculty and staff have mysteriously disappeared with no words nor explanation.  

There is a serious problem with security as there are only two in-shape security officers currently employed. The rest of the officers are over the age of 50, smoke, and have health problems. 

Tuition is too high for what you get, it is not of good quality for the money spent."
College Sophomore,2,Parking is taken too seriously. I think parking passes need to be cheaper or nonexistent.
College Sophomore,2,I wish we had a late night option of a 24 hour bar with food at least during the weekends. We are held to a standard of being a honest and responsible Baldwin woman so therefore we would still be fair with swiping our food cards. I think we could possibly have more options with food over a week it would be much appreciated. Not having Chinese and Mexican in the same day would also be awesome. Our tuition is enough that our choices for food should be more of a variety than just chicken and the occasional burger day. breakfast is very repetitive and i think we should have an egg bar to cook eggs for ourselves everyday of the week! I also think that we should have more than 3 types of cereal to choose from. At least change them every couple weeks!
College Junior,2,"There is little nightlife on campus, but a few bars/clubs are within walking distance."
College Freshman,2,"There is no night life. Even if you go to Zaab's, it's only fun if you have absolutely nothing to do and are miserable. Go to JMU"
College Freshman,2,I go to a liberal arts school so every major is ont offered there so it is kind of hard to be satisfied.
College Sophomore,2,"everyone just lives on campus, it is more convenient "
College Freshman,2,"Student life is very minimal. The athletic center is awful. The library is pretty good, though. Not a ton of ""green spaces"". MBC does have some fun traditions, but those too are limited. Other than that, not much happens in the way of student life. Local shops that are popular with students are Split Banana (a gelato shop) and Coffee on the Corner."
College Freshman,2,"My experience at MBC has been a very mixed bag.  MBC is the right place for some students, but I am not one of those students. I'm applying to transfer and hope to start at a new school next academic year (which will be my sophomore year). My roommate, as well of several of my friends, are similarly setting their sights on transfer schools.

There are many reasons why MBC has not been a great fit for me. The academics are kind of easy and spotty in quality. There is a very limited number of academic programs offered, as one might expect at a tiny LAC.  Some of the profs are awful (though some are amazing and life-changing). There are a ton of stairs, which sounds like a minor complaint but can be a real obstacle. The facilities are aging and somewhat inadequate, especially the dining hall and fitness center. There are no engineering, comp sci, etc. classes whatsoever. The surrounding town of Staunton is charming but sleepy. Much of the student body is not engaged in any sense of the word and can be trashy. The small environment is boring and suffocating. Gifted students are not offered much in the way of academic challenge, which is funny considering that MBC houses PEG (incidentally, I am a PEG). The list goes on. I don't mean to hate on MBC. It's a great fit for some students. I am just not one of those students. 

If you are considering attending MBC, please please please research it carefully. MBC is a love/hate kind of place. You need to know what you are getting into, lest you wind up in the ""hate"" group and become one of the many freshmen and sophomores who choose to transfer away. But if you fall into the ""love"" group, you're in for some of the most special years of your life."
College Freshman,2,"Athletics are not big at MBC. Few students are involved, and non-athletes never attend games or support the program. The teams are limited and don't do super well. Facilities are inadequate. There is basically zero athletics scene."
College Freshman,2,"Computers are sometimes available, but you really should bring your own. You get 1,000 pages of free black and white printing per semester (or maybe year, I can't remember, but either way, it's more than enough). If you want color printing, or don't want to trek to the library to print, you can bring your own printer, but that's not essential. The network is slow and very unreliable. The wi-fi goes down at least weekly. This is frustrating and can make it hard to complete online homework/research.  "
College Freshman,2,"The academics are easy, especially for underclassmen. The standards are low. Most of my academically focused classmates load up on credit hours to provide some challenge. It does get more challenging for upperclassmen.

The professors are hit or miss. There are some amazing profs, and some unbearable, incompetent profs that should not be teaching. It's important to research profs when you're picking new classes so you can make sure you don't get any awful ones.

The curriculum is okay. There are WAY too many gen eds, including some really weird area requirements, such as Gender Studies, Race Studies, and a ton of physical education requirements. It can get annoying trying to fulfill everything, especially since some of the required classes, such as Intermediate Composition, feel useless. However, there are also some very unique courses, which is a major plus.

The registration process is pretty ridiculous. You can either register online, through your adviser, or in-person at the registrar's office. But if you're doing anything 'unusual', like repeating a course (fairly common for students taking music lesson courses, etc.) or taking over 17 credit hours, you have to go to the registrar in-person. Last registration window, I arrived at the registrar's office around 5:00 am and was the fifth person to show up. The office doesn't open until 8:30 am, so if you have an 8:00 class then you're out of luck.

Because MBC is so small, the first course of a two-semester sequence would only be offered in the fall, and the second half would only be offered in the spring. Also, a lot of classes are only offered every other year. This means you have to plan very carefully. It can get frustrating.

Popular study areas include psych, English, theater, some econ, and biology. One thing to note - MBC is VERY much a liberal arts college. There are no engineering classes available, let alone majors, nor are there any comp sci classes.  "
College Freshman,2,"You don't need a car to get around campus, but MBC is fairly isolated, so a car is essential if you want to do fun stuff on the weekends. Freshman parking sucks, but it gets better for upperclassmen. The school sometimes clears out parking lots for events, so it can get tiring having to move your car around."
College Senior,2,Unless you are into girls there is no dating on campus there are graduate students but they are all married or weird. there are a few adult students but they are old. there are no young males on campus 
College Senior,2,there are very few vegetarian options and practically no vegan options. on the chance that there is a day where the food is actually good the portions are tiny 
College Freshman,2,"Just don't come here for sports, it's honestly not worth it."
College Sophomore,2,"There isn't any greek life. The whole college is basically a sorority
"
College Freshman,2,"Either get your own car, or make friends with someone who has a car. The bus in Staunton does not run frequently, and cabs are expensive, especially if you catch one from the college (8.00 both ways for a five minute trip to Wal-Mart)."
College Freshman,2,There are no guys!!! This is a Women's College (DUH)! If you want to have a huge social scene go to JMU.
College Junior,2,"They are completely average overall. Everyone is very nice, polite, and for the most part quiet. It's been my experience that there isn't anything forcing anyone into groups, since we have almost no clubs, few sports, and no Greek life, but everyone tends to group up anyway. It's an all women's college, so some cattiness and fighting does happen from time to time, but for the most part everything is quiet, friendly, and impersonal."
College Junior,2,"Security is usually present, but they have a tendency to be very buddy-buddy with certain students and often overlook their behavior. The only thing anyone ever really gets in trouble for are parking violations. Every one I know who has a car on campus has received at least one ticket. The school takes the honor code very seriously, but it's all based on honesty. There is a strange, somewhat boggling, notion that the first time anyone denies unruly or illegal behavior everyone is required to believe them because lying is wrong and no one would do it. Needless to say, I find this utterly ridiculous. The only reason I haven't failed them entirely is because the campus is tight on social functions to the point we've actually invested in metal detectors for weekend shindigs."
College Sophomore,2,The assistance is ok I get enough money but not enough at the same time I'm still paying 5000 dollars a year and its real hard to come by each semester
College Sophomore,2,The school try's their best to offer a variety of sports and clubs. Their isn't a dance team on campus but they do have cheer-leading. If you enjoy going to sporting events this isn't the school for you.
College Junior,2,They are average. The school is not sports crazy though.
College Freshman,2,There are not many places in the downtown area to eat besides pizza places and you get tired of pizza quick. To get to a fast food restaurant you have to get on the bus or ask a friend to take you same with Wal-Mart.
College Sophomore,2,The local weather affects the campus because you just want to lay in bed when there is any form of precipitation.
College Sophomore,2,IT is a great thing to live on campus there isn't much to do but you do get the freedom of being on your own. The worst dorm to get placed in has to be Woodson. the rooms aren't very big.
College Freshman,2,"I do not like the food at the hunt dining hall because most of it is foreign food, and the food at the pub gets old after a while."
College Freshman,2,The campus is diverse in the personalities that students have most of the students at MBC are African american or Caucasian not too much of anything else.
College Sophomore,2,Athletics is not really a big part of campus. They have a few people to attend the meets but not many. Our athletic building is small and the equipment is a little out dated.
Graduate Student,1,Just horrible. Not challenging at all. I wouldn't recommend it. It was a waste of money. No wonder it's cheap!
Graduate Student,1,"Absolutely HATE the online College of Education program. I enjoyed a few professors, but some of them have moved on to other schools. It was just a bunch of busy work and crappy assignments. NOT WORTH THE MONEY. Didn't feel challenged at all.  WOULDN'T RECOMMEND AT ALL. And, when I was trying to get my license because I just did the degree program so I could get an MEd., it was awful all the hoops I had to go through."
Freshman,1,"I would not recommend this university to anyone. I attended Mary Baldwin and spent more time wanting to leave. The professors were good, but the students were clicky. They could be very judgements, and most people you talk to hate it there. If you go to transfer odds are your credits won’t transfer."
Freshman,1,"This school is extremely small and boring. There is no liveliness at this school, even on weekends. The only thing to do is to walk into downtown and eat. The dorms are very old and look like they haven't been renovated since the school was made. Most dorms have no AC. Overall, I've had a very poor experience here and decided to transfer."
Freshman,1,"I'm a first-year student and this school is honestly horrible. The school for one LIED about having my intended major and did this to many students. The housing is crowded, very old and there is no AC. The food is absolutely disgusting. Everything that I was told by multiple people about this school was a LIE. The only saving grace is the view and the small class sizes but overall this school is a disappointment."
Freshman,1,"I'm sorry but this school just wasn't for me. I was seriously disappointed in just about everything when I arrived. Food is terrible and bland and the so called ""vegan"" and ""vegetarian"" options are limited to mushrooms and black beans. Hunt Dining has a bad reputation for cross contamination and the walk from the main campus to the Cafe is ridiculous, especially when it's freezing outside! Freshmen dorm Spencer has no air conditioning and no sprinkler system (a huge fire hazard that no one thought to tell me before I was stuck in there!!!) ether so random fire alarms sometimes disturb the residents at inconvenient times. The whole place is driving me slowly crazy and I will be transferring out as soon as possible. I know of a lot of freshmen who, too, are leaving!"
Junior,1,"I was a very optimistic transfer. It turned into Hades. The dining hall has cockroaches, and the other freshman dorm. MY freshman dorm has a stink-bug infestation, and it's secluded from the rest of the campus. The teachers are bullies. The best things are my friends and psychiatrist on campus. We pretend to recycle. The front of campus is beautiful and the further back on campus, the crappier it gets. The squirrels throw nuts at you. You get parking tickets for parking where you're told to. The RA's move out due to the living conditions.  No air conditioning, the windows painted shut, asbestos walls, lead water, lead paint, and eminent death all around. The hills are not hills, but mountains.  I've never been somewhere that everywhere you go is uphill. Don't know if we have heat yet, haven't made it that far. Only 2/4 showers work on each floor. We are assigned toilet stalls due to people not knowing how to flush. Thanks for reading. Don't go here."
College Sophomore,1,"There are literally no parties. I'm not kidding. Its not that they are hard to find, or exclusive, they are nonexistent. Many posts say ""go to JMU"", but I'm here to tell you that going to JMU is a joke. Unless you already know someone that goes to JMU, you wont find a party. My friends and I once went to a party there, we found it by driving around for and hour and half until we thought we saw a party. The party consisted of drunk frat boys, there was nothing special or fun about it in any way. If you like to go to parties, even occasionally, this is NOT the school for you."
College Senior,1,Some girls are so uptight that they report you if you're listening to music in the shower too loudly. It's impossible to have a 'party' on campus. Go to JMU for a party.
College Senior,1,"Hunt as almost never passed health and safety. They have been caught cross-contaminating foods. Their chicken is frequently undercooked. The lettuce at the salad bar is often brown or unwashed or left in big pieces. Their dishes and utensils are often dirty or bent. Everything is over-salted because all of the cooks smoke. The food makes almost everyone sick and ruins your digestion. Even though the food is absolutely disgusting, they try to do 'portion control' but their portions are way too small. I have gotten food poisoning from the food on this campus. Pub has a bad smell, their grilled chicken looks like a sponge, the only good thing there is their fried chicken when it is actually cooked all the way through. The food is bad here... really bad. Watch Out for the rats and cockroaches that infest the building."
College Sophomore,1,"The financial aid office is always confused.I hate having to have to pay money still and I took out two loans, pell grants, and have scholarships."
College Sophomore,1,"I don't feel safe on campus. We need more lighting. And we need better security, ours suck."
College Sophomore,1,I wish we had sororities but we don't and it makes the college experience suck.
College Sophomore,1,"They need more sports. They need track and field, a lot of students transfer or don't apply here because they don't have a track team."
College Sophomore,1,You have to give the school a reason to why you're moving off campus which sucks.
College Sophomore,1,It's dirty. The showers never get washed. And it looks and feels like we live in jail.
College Sophomore,1,There's mostly fast food restaurants. I wish the meal plan allowed us to get food off campus.
College Senior,1,I go to an all female college so there arer no parties at my school. Students at my school usually got to James Madison University for parties
College Freshman,1,Its in the middle of no where.
College Freshman,1,We do not have greek life at my school.
College Sophomore,1,"transportation is the worst, we are far away from everything and there is no way to get there if you do no have a car"
College Sophomore,1,I hate that school is so expensive and it is very hard to find help paying for it.
College Freshman,1,"No nightlife whatsoever. There are no parties, aside from boring school-sponsored events. No clubs, no bars. The closest nightlife scene is at JMU, which is a longish car drive away."
College Freshman,1,"Do not go to Mary Baldwin College! It is the worst school you could ever go to. There are no parties on campus. They have these little mixer things, which consists of a bunch of girls grinding on each other. If you want a good fun college experience, with excellent academics I suggest you go to other school. There application process is not selective, so anyone can get into this school. The traditions here are very stupid, they have this thing called Apple Day, which is there ""homecoming"" and all you do is pick apples off the ground. If you like picking apples of the ground, eating NASTY food that will make you vomit, sharing bathrooms with DIRTY females, and being around WIERD girls, MBC is the place for you. IF not I highly suggest you go somewhere else. Trust me most of the freshman here are transferring, and the senior class here is only like 40 girls, and it started out with 240 people. mmmmmm something doesn't sound right, you do the math. "
College Freshman,1,"I would say the local atmosphere is a love/hate type of thing. Personally, I don't like it at all. Staunton is rural and painfully small. There is very little to do. Occasionally there are some fun events downtown, but that's rare.(Also, ""downtown"" consists of one small section of a single street. That's how small Staunton is.) There's more to do if you drive to Harrisonburg/JMU.

If you're the kind of person who thrives on busy-ness and activity, Staunton will drive you slowly insane. If you like small-town communities that don't have a ton going on, you'll appreciate Staunton's charm.
"
College Freshman,1,"Dining at MBC is awful. There are two venues: Hunt, which is the main dining hall, and the Pub, which isn't actually a pub but serves salads and burgers and stuff like that. The menu at Pub is essentially always the same, but the quality is better than Hunt. However, Pub isn't open for every meal, and it's on the far side of campus, so students end up eating a lot a Hunt.

Hunt is the worst. I'll be honest. The options are limited and very low-quality. The salad bar is tiny and oftentimes the vegetables available aren't at all fresh. The food is extremely unhealthy and features a lot of carbs and meat. As a vegetarian, I find it extremely difficult to find good options. The ""vegetarian meal"" is usually hummus (just hummus, nothing to eat it with), something super carb-heavy, or nonexistent. The dining hours are a little restricted, too, which can make it hard to fit meals in between classes.You can't use your meal plan for any location other than Hunt or Pub (when it's open)."
College Freshman,1,"The off-campus housing options are extremely limited, and what little housing is available is usually pretty low quality (too expensive, far away from campus, etc.) The school does not want students to live off-campus, so they don't help students find off-campus housing. On-campus parking is limited and far away from classes, the library, etc., which is hard on students who live off-campus. Basically, if you really want off-campus housing, MBC might not be the best option for you."
College Senior,1,it is very difficult to find a place off campus and since the school doesnt actually want you to move away they won't help you find a place 
College Senior,1,"We rarely get out of class when it snows. Most professors live within walking distance of campus so when it snows, they walk to class."
College Junior,1,"We have one dining hall that serves fish on the vegetarian station. They do not label allergens, resulting in more than one personal illness, and they are not open late. We also have what is called the Pub, which is usually the best option. They specialize in fast food type cuisine and the menu is eternally stagnant unless the main dining hall is closed for some reason. It is impossible to eat vegan on campus and also apparently quiet hard to eat kosher. The food that one can eat varies in consistency. Sometimes the food is really quiet excellent, other times it comea out of a microwave only half heated."
College Junior,1,"The teams lose all the time, only team that seems to be any good is the soccer team if that."
College Sophomore,1,The only guys on campus are campus employees or part of the adult degree program. I think that I have only seen three guys on a regular basis who look my age but the school does hold mixers.
College Junior,1,There's literally no nightlife here. No sororities and everything in Staunton closes early.
College Freshman,1,"Mary Baldwin is a D3 college. Sporting events are not popular, majority of the time students do not know when the games are or who are opponents are."
College Freshman,1,Like This Is the Best School for Doing Dope – Like I have four dif dealers on campus most have 6
College Sophomore,1,I know of no late night events at this campus at all.
College Sophomore,1,There Is None. This school does not have greek life. The closest thing this school has are out gateways that all freshman must be a part of.
College Freshman,1,"This Campus is boring because everyone is usually in the dorm trying to make up fun things to go out and do. The freshmen dorms are horrible, there are tons of bugs."
College Freshman,1,The food isnt the best in Hunt Dining Hall. But the pub and the nuuthouse have good food and coffee. The starbucks is not real starbucks -__-
College Freshman,1,This is not a campus for those who want a nightlife. There are no parties of anykind. The club and bar scene in town is for those 21 and older. Mary Baldwin also has no tolerance for underage drinking.

Junior,5,"Education during a pandemic has proven difficult for teachers, students, and family involved.  At West Virginia University, teachers and students were given many different tools to help in the transition to online learning.  In these troubling times, students have been given immense support to help them succeed."
Junior,5,West Virginia University has provided me with a great community and learning experiences.  Classes provide hands on experience to increase a student's skill level and knowledge on various career related responsibilities.
Niche User,5,WVSU has always been super willing to do whatever they can to help students. They support the non-traditional students just as much as anyone else and are always there to support.
Sophomore,5,"I am pursuing a Regents Degree, therefore, it is all online. My experience has been wonderful. I highly recommend this University."
Sophomore,5,Coming back to college after having 14 years off was scary. West Virginia State University has made it seamless and easy. They were able to help me get transcripts from high school and my previous college. They have been very helpful.
Senior,5,"With WVSU being a smaller school, it allows the Professors to give me individual help. All the students and facility are extremely nice and helpful."
Senior,5,I have done many classes online and the Professors have been very helpful to answer any questions in a timely manner.
Senior,5,"Online classes at WVSU are always well prepared. The course is laid out week by week. Materials, such as the syllabus or readings, are given out at the beginning of the class. Assignments are laid out and due dates are far enough ahead."
Senior,5,"The staff and faculty are all friendly and willing to help. This school takes the education of their students seriously. The campus is clean and easy to navigate. Resources, such as the library and computers are easy to access."
Niche User,5,They make it easy to contact them and they are able to answer questions to the best of their knowledge or easily transfer you to someone who will be able to answer your questions.
Freshman,5,"When you first step onto the campus, it immediately feels like home. Everyone is so welcoming and respectful to one another. The campus is so beautiful and kept clean!"
Niche User,5,"I am involved in the Upward Bound Program at this university and have been provided with college credit and prep for college. I've gotten the chance to experience college life by living on campus and meeting new people,."
Niche User,5,"WVU is a great college for anyone and everyone. From the moment you step foot on campus, you feel like you've found your home! The school spirit is out of this world, and with such a wide variety to offer, you'll fit right in!"
Alum,5,"I completed my undergraduate studies at this University. There are days that I wish I could go back. I loved every single one of my professors, even if I didn't favor the class. The faculty are committed to seeing their student's become the best that they can be, even beyond graduation."
Niche User,5,I like that West Virginia State University was quick with my admissions decision and I love their core values and the goal that they not only want but actually obtain with their students. They also offered me an easier way to pay tuition by putting me at the smaller campus for a year and then allowing me to transfer after one year with a few requests to the main campus and getting the education I want.
Freshman,5,"The school's atmosphere is great. The professor's and student advocates make it feel like home and there's never a dull moment within my daily life. There's plenty of study resources and locations, not to mention that WV is beautiful anyway. I wish to see an increase in safety though, as the drug epidemic is a big issue within our state and it's evident here. Not to mention, the party scene here is huge and although you can avoid it, the university tends to ignore it."
Freshman,5,"West Virginia State is very welcoming. It is a very small school, everybody knows everybody basically. Friendly environment? That's this school the teachers, employees and students well some students.. They always have a positive attitude. When I first came here, nervous I was, I mean who wouldn't be nervous? It's a whole new scene and experience, especially if you're moving out of state from family. You feel alone for the first couple of days. But I actually did start meeting people that I would call friends now. I live on campus, the dorms are not bad at all well my dorm isn't bad. Coming from me, I wouldn't know what others would say. For diversity considering that this is an HBCU (Historically Black Colleges & Universities). I would say it's not too bad at the same time it could be a little more of it. I would definitely do my whole four years here with the people I know and love. I'm having a great experience, and so are other people."
Sophomore,5,Choosing West Virginia University was one of the best decisions of my life. The campus is inviting and its very easy to get around. The people and professors are inviting and helpful.
Freshman,5,Everyone is a joy to be around. It is a great environment! Classes are great and there are many resources for everyone on campus.
Niche User,5,"I haven't attended yet, due to the fact that I am only a High school senior. But I am planning to attend next this fall! When I visited last summer, I was immediately overwhelmed by the students love for the school, which is the reason I want to attend."
Freshman,5,"I have had a wonderful experience my first semester at West Virginia University, the campus is beautiful and there are a lot of opportunities to join clubs in any area of interest you may have.  The professors I have had so far are very knowledgeable and welcoming.  I have met some amazing people and I highly recommend the first year Adventure SOAR trips for Freshman, I got to know a log about myself on that trip.  I am very happy that I decided to attend WVU!"
Freshman,5,"Im an upcoming freshman coming to West Virginia University. Applying has been very easy and professional. I haven't had any problems with getting questions answered and they have provided many ways to meet and connect with friends, faq, etc.."
Niche User,5,"Great school, very clean, the student to staff ratio is 17:1. All the faculty is very reliable, and its in a safe location. Great school Highly recommend."
Freshman,5,"Great university!!! Love the classes and professors. Also, the dorms are like mini hotel rooms. I am really glad I chose this school to further my education."
Freshman,5,"The application process for WVSU was very easy going and it made things a lot less complicated when applying to the school. Now being at the school as a full time student, I have noticed after just one semester that the professors are here for the students and want the students to pass and succeed. I like how the class sizes are not that big which makes it feel kind of like a high school in that sense. The president of the school is wanting all students to pass in four years so no one has to pay more money than what they should. He is very big on the ""15 in 4"" policy and I respect that because if someone wants to go to grad school they should get out of their undergrad in four years! Overall, as much as I am not a fan of where the school is located, the academic side of things makes everything better because I know I can go get tutoring if need be."
Sophomore,5,Remote diverse and incredibly awesome! Wvu is known for its football games but its geographic location of being nestled in one of the best geological locations is why it is perfect for me a budding geologist to learn of our planets dynamic development over the millions upon billions of years of its exisirance when you walk through the campus you cant help but to stop and take in the rolling mountains of stacked beds of strata of sandstone and mud stone.
Junior,5,"State is a great place with such a great and friendly environment. State has honestly given me my best college experience, I am A Junior and Transfer student. No matter what someone at State always has your back. The professors are great and are always willing to work with you."
Sophomore,5,"WVU Dance Major 
The staff and professors are caring, passionate and compassionate.  They are leaders in their field and provide guidance to help you achieve your personal academic and career goals."
Senior,5,"I enjoy having he option of online classes and classroom classes.  It allows flexibility, and gives me more freedom to maintain being a mother and having a family."
Freshman,5,"I am a soon to be student, every interaction I have had has been very pleasant. It is a great school to work with."
Niche User,5,"The times I have been to WVSU I loved how they have the alumni tombs on the campus. I am in love with how old fashion it is. I love how it still has houses from people living there a long time ago and making them into special rooms for the campus to enjoy while walking to class. The campus itself is small which I love, because it's easy to get from one place to another. People there no everyone, which I like that feeling that if I go to a professor that I won't just be a face to them that I'll actually be a name."
Sophomore,5,"I absolutely love WVSU. I am currently in my second year there and I couldn't be anymore happier with my college decision. The campus is small, which I like, and the faculty, staff, and other students are the best."
Freshman,5,"It's been the best time of my life so far! You feel like family, or you can hide and blend in. Just perfect all around!"
Junior,5,They go above and beyond for their students . They have help through student services and student life is great too
Freshman,5,I just finished my first year at WVSU and I absolutely loved it. The professors take time to help you if you're struggling and the student body is very diverse. The cafeteria makes great food. Overall i would recommend coming to WVSU.
Freshman,5,"The university is quiet little place, an easy walking distance from all of the major complexes. A friendly atmosphere for learning a range of different subjects. The school doesn't have a political undertone and all viewpoints are welcomed on campus. The campus is fare enough from Charleston, to be islonated from any of the city crimes committed."
Senior,5,I like everything about the school. There is nothing I would like to see change. It is a great school!
College Junior,5,Registration process was excellent for me but the financial process was a headache because I was rejected.
College Junior,5,"dorms are good, proximity of classes are great. Actually excellent!!!"
College Freshman,5,When I was looking for a college dorms were a big part of my consideration. Keith hall is the best dorms I have ever seen. They are spacious and clean and they are just overall fantastic.
College Freshman,5,"The professors, class sizes, and quality of courses are wonderful. The variety of courses are decent, but many require tedious prerequisites."
College Junior,5,I get constant emails with regards to internships in my field I feel very confident in having a good career.
College Junior,5,Everything this semester was outstanding the professors and classes were fine.
College Junior,5,"I feel very safe when I am at school, but I also take measures into my own hands. I hang with the same people or never am alone. I do not walk far alone."
College Junior,5,I do not live on campus
College Junior,5,I have completed my first semester and could not be happier with the facility and school.
College Junior,5,Free to do what you want within reason
College Junior,5,"Biology education major,  professors are incredible!"
College Freshman,5,"I do not live on campus, but from what my friends tell me, It is great."
College Junior,5,"Even though WVSU has problems, the faculty accepted my high school program, and I was able to take classes there as my homeschool from seventeen. I plan on graduating from state twice, the first time I was a high school senior, the next time I'll have a bachelor's degree. I'm proud to go to school where I do, even if it's next to a chemical plant. You never question or doubt blessings, and college was a huge gift to me, so I am ever-pleased with state. "
College Junior,5,The campus is beautiful! You can sit out on the lawn and enjoy the day and it is right outside of the city so you can be close to the action but set back and relax and receive an amazing education at the same time!
College Junior,5,We have a variety of athletic sports to choose from. There is a lot of student involvement when it comes to games and school spirit. There is always a crowd!
College Sophomore,5,"food is great in the cafe, taco bell and subway are also available"
College Sophomore,5,It has been a challenge for me but I will succeed.
College Sophomore,5,"I love being a psychology major. The courses are not that difficult. Try not to miss class and do all the reading and you are on your way to graduation. Also, internships are offered every spring semester and most students are placed in a facility to learn what the field is like."
College Sophomore,5,Intelligent professors who are willing to help their students achieve goals academically. Most professors will even go out of their way by emailing you and giving up their free time to help students who are having a hard time in a course. 
College Freshman,5,It is right on the bus line. If you need to use your car the interstat is right there. Huntington and Charleston both are very close.
College Freshman,5,lots of campas activities and hands on opportunities
College Freshman,5,Everyone is friendly and seem to be truly interested in student success
College Sophomore,5,"Diversity is abundant there are many different races who come from various cultural bacgrounds. Since West Virginia State University is recognized as a historically Black College/University most spectators would assume the student population is mainly African American. However, this is not the case there are just as many Caucasion students as African Americans, mixed amongst many other foreign races who make up the minority of the overall population. Nonetheless, you will be submerged in a diverse enviroment which operates and forms a social solidarity cohesiveness. Everyone is treated and accepted equally there is no special priviledge or diadvantages based on beliefs, religion, or sexual orientation everyone respects each other's individuality collectively."
Niche User,4,I have taken Dual classes through state as well as online classes and they have always been amazing. They are ALWAYS willing to help.
Freshman,4,I love the city size and environment but I like the small town feel of the campus. I enjoy that the college includes a lot of different majors and it's not difficult to switch between majors.
Freshman,4,"Our campus is very diverse with many programs for students to attend, and I am easily able to meet with professors during their office hours. The two things I would change is that the food in the dining hall isn't stellar, and transportation into and around town is limited."
Senior,4,For the most part I have had a good experience at WVU. There has been a few minor issues but it wasn't bad.
Senior,4,State is a smaller University. This means smaller class sizes and professors that tend to really care about their students academically.
Freshman,4,"So far I've toured the campus and visited a few times. I absolutely love the campus view and what the school has to offer in academics. The food and sports is just a plus as I've never had bad food while in West Virginia. I love how everything makes you feel like home even though I'm from out of state. The campus life is a plus as they have so much to offer besides just school, they have a way of  making everyone feel included and as if they have a place on campus"
Sophomore,4,I loved the spirit of this campus. Everywhere you go you see blue and gold. This campus allows for students to make connections and make new friends easily.
Junior,4,"I have been attending West Virginia State University for two years. During my time there, I have experienced mostly positive outcomes. I have had professors who genuinely care about my academic progress and advisors who have tried to be as helpful as possible. The institution is always offering activities students can partake in, whether they commute or live on campus. The college is also easily accessible for commuters and is accommodating to them."
Alum,4,West Virginia State University was a great place to get my first two degrees. I got one in Business with a concentration in Accounting and the other degree in Economics. All my professors for each degree knew their topic very well and I believe will be able to teach what I have learned to others. I was a tutor at WVSU and felt that I passed on knowledge to other students.
Junior,4,I have had a good experience so far but they need to show all the details of graduation requirements on MyState.
Junior,4,"West Virginia state university is a very small campus but it is family. There is always events happening that are thrown by, Student Life and Engagement, Greek Members, Resident RA's and more. There is not much to do outside of the campus, besides the mall, exploring scenery."
Freshman,4,It is a good small school with great professor's campus is kept clean and secured. A  good place to get a quality education.
Junior,4,"I personally chose West Virginia State University because I am pursing a degree is Elementary Education and they have one of the best Education programs around. In the education department the professors are very caring and helpful. I have encountered several professors outside of the program that were not helpful at all. The students are overall very welcoming and the food is average. The campus is small but this has its perks because since it is a smaller school students get more one on one time with their professors. The surrounding area is not very nice, but just a few miles down the road is the city of Charleston and that has more to offer!"
Junior,4,Overall very good. Very diverse with many international students. Low student to professor ratio. Not a party school at all.
Niche User,4,I like the programs the college has to offer and the improvement in education. State has some of the top educational programs and I believe would help me in pursuit of my education degree. College is an important choice and I think that State has an exceptional program. I believe that after completing my degree that I will have help finding a career. I think the money is well worth the investment in college and will help me have a successful career.
Alum,4,"I loved having a closed campus. No main roads through the campus which made for a wonderful place to study, participate in sports, or other activities that were held in the quad."
Sophomore,4,This small campus really allows you to get the personally college experience and allows a lot of one on one with professors since classes are smaller than larger universities.
Niche User,4,I like the welcoming that i received from the staff at WVU.  They helped me feel like starting a new journey will be achievable.
Freshman,4,"West Virginia University is a great place to learn new things everyday. They work make students more involved throughout campus. The campus is very beautiful and it is such a big school, there is a place for everyone. I am not too happy about the way we register for classes because they do not anticipate for the amount of students who plan to register for a specific class and not everyone can register for the class that semester. It is solely based on luck if you hit the button to register on time before someone else. But all in all, I am happy I chose West Virginia because it gave me a chance to learn how to be more independent and prove to myself and others I can be successful."
Junior,4,The classes at WVU are challenging and provide the level of difficulty needed in courses. The party life can get a bit wild but is possible to control. There is not much to do around morgantown other than drink and hike.
Freshman,4,"I am a incoming freshman class of 2017 , I took a visit back in august of 2016. One thing I like about the campus is the size everything is so close together. The dorms were nice and they have game rooms with everything in it that I loved."
Niche User,4,"I am not currently attending, but I have been accepted and will be joining th yellow jackets in fall of 2017. My younger brother is currently there playing basketball for them so it gives me a chance to get over there and get around the student and get a little taste of the college. And let me tell you it tastes great. Cannot wait to be a part of the team."
Junior,4,Definitely a big change if you have never lived in a city like me.  You are exposed to student and professors from all over the world and the diversity here is one of my favorite parts about this populative school.  I chose to come here personally because it is relatively close to home and I love the campus amd rec center.
Freshman,4,"West Virginia University is a diverse, academically-distinguished, and superb school with an involved and friendly staff. By offering unique majors and minors, hosting free lectures and events, and organizing various clubs and organizations, any student can completely immerse themselves into a positive and exciting college experience."
Sophomore,4,"I attended WVSU my first year and a half of college. I stayed in the dorms, Keith Scholar Hall. I made a ton of new friends, and it broadened my views about a lot of things. There is a variety of people there as well as activities that the campus puts together. The science department was not very good, and that is the only reason that I left...otherwise I would still be there with all of my friends."
College Junior,4,I find most staff especially the professors are great!!!
College Junior,4,The have a big policy on sexual harrassment and this school is a dry college.
College Junior,4,The school is great except for financial aid department and it really sucks.
College Junior,4,Team work is important in the team spirit and moral
College Freshman,4,It's cool how some of them actaually do things
College Freshman,4,We have great counselors and security on campus
College Freshman,4,It's a pretty chill environment for everyone.
College Freshman,4,"I love just about everything about West Virginia State University except for the financial aid department, they seem to loose things a lot."
College Freshman,4,"Campus crime is fairly low. Simple vandalism is the biggest issue. Personal safety isn't a huge concern here. There are certified police officers employed as security officers, and they have a 2 minute response time, so most people feel very safe."
College Freshman,4,"I love dorm life on campus. It was easy to request a room with 2 other people I already knew, and the room is great. It's pretty well spaced, with private sectors, but a shared common room. It has nice handicap accomendations, as well."
College Freshman,4,"My college has wonderful professor's, most of whom are extremely passionate about their field of study, and encouraging for their students. The research opportunities are fantastic, allowing freshman and sophomores to participate in multiple programs."
College Freshman,4,"As far as I'm aware, nothing major has happened on campus except for one fist fight back in September. No one really comes off as intimidating, and the level of harassment is quite low. I haven't experienced bullying or harassment, and I haven't seen anyone be bullied or harassed. For the most part, it's a safe campus."
College Freshman,4,"All of my professors tried their best to make sure we worked to the best of our ability. Some times they seemed to not care as much or came off as condescending, but people do have their bad days. The professors make it easy to contact them outside of class, and make it a point to make sure we know what's going on."
College Freshman,4,"I've only just finished my first semester, but overall I've enjoyed my time here. My only real complaint is the lack of a ""social atmosphere."" You see students wandering about by themselves, and hardly do you see anyone walking with someone else. No one seems to engage in conversation with others unless it's in the dining halls or a classroom. 

I took a few classes this semester that, while seemingly filler, were actually interesting and worthwhile. I had one GEd class (Origins) that covered topics from the evolution of language, to the Big Bang, to the role of government, etc. It was a bit hard at times, but the assignments really allowed me to open my mind up and explore new ideas. I can't really say for sure if I'd repeat this semester again."
College Sophomore,4,The campus police do several rounds around campus to ensure outside is safe for students. They are always available when they are needed.
College Sophomore,4,"Most professors will do anything in their power to help you, but there are a few that will not take into consideration the amount of time their homework takes up in the evenings. Some professors are understanding of outside problems, such as going into the hospital for a week, and others will give yo a failing grade for missing a week of classes."
College Freshman,4,"My experience so far has been good. The campus is really nice and everything is easily accessible. For the most part, its a friendly environment. People here love WVU and people who graduated years ago come back often because they loved it so much. If i had to choose colleges again I would definitely apply to WVU again. The only reason I'm giving it a 4 out of 5 is I didn't really visit any other big schools so I don't know if it's ""the best"" but it would definitely be up there."
College Freshman,4,"West Virginia State University offers a wide variety of majors to choose from, the campus is beautiful, and I couldn't ask for a better staff."
College Freshman,4,The new dorms they just built are pretty good. We get our own room within the dorms and it is set up like a hotel
College Student,4,"I live in the new dormitories that they just recently opened. I love the fact that you get your own room, which mean you get privacy. and you don't have to share a bathroom with 20+ people that live on the same floor."
College Junior,4,"Most professors are helpful and knowledgeable in their fields. Usually they have first hand experience with whatever they are teaching as well. Film professors are filmmakers, language professors have been to the countries, and so on. However there are few professors for each campus section (such as there's just a couple to few professors in the music dept, several in the comm dept, several in the science, a few in the English, etc) so it becomes difficult if you can't learn to the professor's teaching style or have personal issues with the professor/etc. Also due to the low staff, certain required classes are only offered every other other semester or only one class at a time during one semester, making it difficult to maintain the amount of credit hours to accommodate students that work and/or have families to tend to or to graduate on time."
College Junior,4,There are a good number of diverse students at State.
College Junior,4,"Came from big university,  I love this school!"
College Junior,4,"Average university food, even better since I don't have to cook!"
College Sophomore,4,The campus diversity is rather noticeable in all of my classes. West Virginia State University is a very non traditional campus which creates many new opportunities for people.
College Sophomore,4,There is very little that the weather can do to prevent me from enjoying the campus.
College Freshman,4,I love the people at WVSU. Everybody is nice and easy to get a long with and talk to.
College Freshman,4,"My family lives in Florida. If I want to go home, I drive with friends."
College Freshman,4,I see the campus police everywhere. They even came to one of my classes to do a campus safety talk.
College Freshman,4,I was able to get all of the financial aid i requested and needed. I am also able to get a summer grant that I was unaware of at first.
College Freshman,4,"For the most part, the attendance policy with most professors are reasonable. Some professors have ridiculous absence policies that are very difficult to achieve."
College Freshman,4,"WVSU is an ok school to attend. It is sometimes hard to get in contact with the right people at the right time. I wouldn't take any classes during the winter, as they rarely close campus, and you are expected to be in class even if it is dangerous driving conditions. Other than silly things, most professors have your best interest at heart and are very personable."
College Senior,4,It not to bad. Visitation you must have you id to enter into the buildings when necessary. Campus policies are set in place some are enforce and other they can be lax on them.
College Senior,4,It is a big thing on our campus. If you want student to come out of their dorms let them know that a Greek organization is throwing something. The best are the probates and everyone is out on the yard watching people cross.
College Senior,4,There is security always driving around. The also have the emergency pole up so you can press the button. I have yet to hear of any crimes on campus.
Freshman,2,"An overly diverse HBCU in the middle of institute, WV. HAs no social atmosphere or party life... not a fan"
College Junior,2,"I applied for student aid and completed it on 4/4/2016. It took the woman in financial until 6/30/2016 to deny me of any type of financial aid or student loans. The deadline was 6/30/2016. I went to orientation on the 25th of June 2016 and she didn't bother to tell me. I turned everything they needed wasting my time as I am going through the student process. I cannot pay over 1100 in books for one semester and 6,000 for tuition and fees. The school did not bother to tell after going through this grueling process. I am disabled but that did not matter. I mean, the financial lady named Ariene was the one who was not very helpful for me getting aid but causing more trouble and heartache wanting to finish my degree. I made mistakes in the past. I have 106 credit hours and did very badly but now I was ready to make the straight A's I always did in high school. I am depressed and very unhappy that I had to go through so much and not even chance to finish a degree in Accounting. I guess it just wasn't meant to be at all. I am so disappointed in the school leading me on to think I would be a part of the WVSU college experience. I don't make that much for tuition and fees a year much less to take of myself. Very unhappy with Ariene. She was very unfriendly and I am not used to being spoken to as I am stupid."
College Freshman,2,All of our teams suck. And no on particularly cares about sports.
College Freshman,2,"My college's funding, like many colleges, spends too much money on athletics. The fan support is adequate, but most of the campus teams don't have adequate track records. Team performance is generally poor, except for the tennis team. Many of the students are only attending this school to participate in athletics. The emphasis should shift toward the research and academics."
College Freshman,2,"No one, including myself, really pays any attention to the athletics here. It's never mentioned, not even by professors or other administration."
College Freshman,2,Nothing is opened up late night near campus
College Freshman,2,The quality could be improved
College Junior,2,"There really aren't very many parties or events to attend, most are frat centered and aren't good for general students."
College Freshman,2,"This area doesn't have the best night life, you will have to travel about 40 minutes or so for better clubs."
College Freshman,2,The nightlife at our school is so bad that we go to other schools to party.
College Freshman,2,"It really pisses me off when people at my school, including my friends, use drugs on a weekly basis in their dorms. First of all, drugs are prohibited on campus. The smell goes through the whole hallway and everyone gets a community fine for it if caught. During the week, the drug and alcohol use is kept at a very low minimum except for those who are addicted. On the weekends, many people tend to ""turn up"" and violate the drug and alcohol policy like there wasn't even one to begin with. It is very bad in college because the usage of drugs and alcohol is overboard. Students don't know how much they can handle so they end up overdosing, or binge drinking. Peer pressure plays a major role in the drug scene on campus. Many students are faced with peer pressure from their friends or peers when they are faced with drugs or alcohol. I feel like the policy should be enforced a little more because I hate to see people fail classes, drop out of school, and go to jail because of drug or alcohol related incidents."
College Junior,2,"No matter what they serve, it tastes bad or isn't cooked right."
College Junior,2,"The buses run hours before or after classes, so if you ride the bus you have to get to the stop two hours before class, then you have roughly an hour on campus before class starts. Having a car costs more, but in the long run it's makes school less stressful, especially if you have to move projects around. "
College Junior,2,"The Greek fraternities and sororities have great cook out events and homecoming events, but they blast horrible rap music at their function, full of curse words I'm not allowed to say. They have a presence on campus, and sororities do bake sales, but they don't have an impact. "
College Sophomore,2,Depends on what you're looking for
College Sophomore,2,Great College just a little Dated 
College Senior,2,"Institute, is near Charleston which offers a myriad of activities during the summer and spring.  The mountains, and rivers of West Virginia can always offer some kind of activities throughout the year."
College Senior,2,"West Virginia has a nice climate throughout the year. However, the winter months (dec, jan, feb) can bring a lot of snow, and its pretty typical that class could be cancelled or delayed"
College Senior,2,There is no communication from the Department regarding financial aid.  When you call to speak with someone they make you feel like you are a bother.
College Senior,2,"To get a good parking place you have to arrive very early for class. Most of the parking lots are a good way from the classes. There never seems to be enough parking places. The permit cost is too expensive, it is like $80 a year."
Junior,1,They do not care about you at all!! The employees that are not instructors are absolutely useless and have no idea what they are doing. The commuter students are screwed because the awful President never cancels class even when the roads are undriveable.
College Sophomore,1,There are no night clubs near wvsu you have to go to charleston or Huntington. There's only a few in charalton and they are okay no that great and a there are only a few.
College Senior,1,State is safe during the day time. But at night while walking around campus anyone can be robbed or kidnapped. There was once a drunk inside a building at night. No security around.
College Junior,1,"Dining options are TERRIBLE at WVSU. As an off campus student, the hours of the cafeteria are very inconvenient. You have to pay nine dollars just to get in and the food selections are not impressive. They have things such as pizza, cereal, pasta, a salad bar that is not cleaned very often, and other unhealthy foods. As a student athlete, my first year on campus I could never find anything to eat because I needed healthy food for training and the only thing I would eat was a salad every day or a turkey sandwich in which the meat was left out in room temperature all day long. After living on campus, you will never catch me eating in the caf again."
College Freshman,1,awful every morning is like playing eye spy while cars get wrote up with tickets
College Junior,1,Horrible Selection – There is only one place to eat off-campus that you don't need transportation to. It's a really good BBQ place and it any too expensive. The next closest off-campus food would be Mexican restaurant that is about 5 miles or so down the road. You can always have pizza delivered though.
College Freshman,1,"Lack of Respect – The teachers here so far seem nice, and are willing to assist, but I live in a Dorm for the married/with children. I have had two different workers on campus unlock my door without knocking and have complained. I felt violated, like a dog for the lack of privacy respect. Then, the truck needed a jump. Calling the campus security it took two hours until one of the maintenance guys, not the security helped us. I have lost respect for the school's security. Why can't I go to another school or move? Lack of money and ways to afford it, and no way to afford to rent another place for paying for this one. It is scary to walk across campus somewhat because of the college location in Institute. Not to long ago, about a block away, a woman was killed and her body was disassembled. Institute dont seem too safe and the security crew prooved themselves worthless."
College Freshman,1,"You Want to Have Access to Most Things? You Need a Car. Other than the high price food across the street or in the union. The closest mcdonalds or other eating place is at least 20 to 25 mins away by foot. Not much as a big deal with a car. The buses run but during the week peak hours every 30 to 45 mins, after that every hour, after 7 every 2 hrs. Weekend every 1-2 hours."
College Student,1,"The weather is bad, expecialy around this time of year. It can sometimes make it imposible to get to class."

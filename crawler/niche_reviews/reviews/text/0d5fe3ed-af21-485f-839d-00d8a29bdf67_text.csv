Junior,5,"My online experience at SJU is incredible. All of the professors really care about your health and well being during this time and make sure everyone is doing okay in the class. Since this is such a hard semester because of being online and in person switching all the time, the professors at SJU make sure that everyone is keeping up with their work and staying on top of things. The professors also have been very accommodating to students by zoom for any questions they have outside of class or if you just would like to talk."
Junior,5,"Saint Joseph’s University is a place of community. As soon as you step foot on campus you feel like you are a part of the community like that. Everyone is so kind and super inclusive. When walking around on campus you see so many people you know from class, clubs, and so many more! It’s so nice to always know a familiar face when walking to class, and at SJU you always have that."
Junior,5,All of the professors have done a great job adjusting to the ever changing situation and still make me feel I am learning.
Junior,5,So far I love it here. The atmosphere and everyone around it is great. The classes and opportunities outside of school are endless. The only negative is we are still struggling with the ongoing problems of racism and diversity in some select students on campus.
Graduate Student,5,Excellent programs with faculty that has real-life experiences and professional connections. Students are average.
Junior,5,"The community feel is unmatched. I have friends at institutions in the surrounding states and every time I leave Saint Joes to visit my friends at another campus, I come back appreciating my own school so much more."
Junior,5,"I experience at Saint Joseph University so far as  been great  , I have all the support  I need to succeed."
Junior,5,"I was skeptical when the pandemic started, I thought that the transition to an online class format would have been hard. I was wrong, professors made the transition look very smooth and went out of their way to accommodate and help me and my classmates."
Junior,5,"Professors are very friendly, always ready to help you in case you need something. I receive tons of email from the school with many events going on every day. The physical college location is fantastic, especially for me that I moved from Italy, it seems like I’m in a movie"
Freshman,5,"Saint Joseph’s University is a great college. It was a big transition from high school to college, but Saint Joseph’s made it as easy as possible. Sports are fun to attend and there are many ways to get involved on campus."
Senior,5,The strong community. Lots to do in order to get involved. Great location nearest to the city and other Philly landmarks.
Niche User,5,Saint Joseph's has provided me with the necessary resources to complete my teaching certificate.  My professor is an excellent example of the quality educators that adorn the Saint Joseph's University institution.
Alum,5,"Incredible experience in all ways! Hawk hill is my forever home! Professors, administration, peers, and faculty have fully prepared me for my future endeavors in the “real world.”"
Niche User,5,This school is underrated. There are many resources to help you succeed academically. There are also many clubs and social activities. The campus is gorgeous and meticulously kept. The students are friendly and supportive of one another. The chapel is pretty. The Food could be a little better.
Graduate Student,5,"I have yet to begin my graduate school courses, but until this point the staff members at Saint Joseph's have gone above and beyond to help me.  They have been friendly, easily reachable, and encouraging.  I look forward to my first semester with Saint Joseph's."
Sophomore,5,"I have a great experience at SJU even though it's PWI, and I am an African American women I feel the inclusivity. The staff and professors are amazing. The resources available on campus such as the writing center, champion student center, career development center, and our counseling and psychological department. Along with all the events that happen on campus throughout the year."
Sophomore,5,There are a bountiful amount of networking opportunities through clubs and events. Along with tons of faculty eager to help you get the best out of your education and your career.
Sophomore,5,Saint Joseph's University is a great school to be apart of for so many reasons. There are so many different clubs and activities to get involved in you can never feel like you are missing out. Also Saint Joseph's University os a friendly community where everyone who comes feels immediately welcomed.
Alum,5,Great school with many different major offerings. For the small class sizes they still have so much to offer. Sports and other activities.
Alum,5,I loved my time at SJU. The campus has a small school feel with the resources of  a large state school. The faculty at SJU are highly regarded and many of my professors held or were pursuing advanced degrees.
Alum,5,Overall great experience at SJU for both undergraduate and graduate school. Quality Jesuit education to make well rounded students that are well prepared for future success.
Sophomore,5,"I love SJU. The community is so welcoming and a lot of the faculty takes time to focus on their students. The school spirit that is present on campus is so obvious to anyone that walks through. I've never felt so immediately welcomed into a community. The clubs and activities available are diverse and unique, and the location of SJU allows for a lot of fun."
Sophomore,5,"Saint Joseph's University is my home, the kind community and supporting professors allow me to become the best version of me. I am in Alpha Omicron Pi, a social sorority, and the women there are the best women I have ever met and the social sorority gives me opportunities like none other. Campion, the dining hall, isn't great but it's edible food which is expected from a college dining hall."
Graduate Student,5,"Excellent instructors and available classes.  There are countless options and areas of study, and the support given is incredible.  Any time I have a question, I get a return call or email promptly.  I have returned for classes for certification and was able to register and start in less than two weeks!"
Junior,5,"very friendly atmosphere, from students to professors, staff. have become more involve in campus life. this school offers the ability for day and evening students interact and form bonds."
Freshman,5,"My experience at Saint Josephs was amazing. I always thought I knew that I wanted to be in a quitter area and not in the city. However, when visiting I realized you get the best of both worlds, you get the city and the campus still has grassy areas. The campus is beautiful with a gothic stone look. All the students have a balance between academics and their social life, eager to make friends and work towards their goals is exactly what I am looking for. I felt at home when I visited, and can not wait to spend the next chapter of my life there."
Junior,5,I have really enjoyed my time St. Joe's University.  Student life is great. I am an adult student and I am able to enjoy a lot of the facilities that the school has to offer.  The Library is an amazing facility which I have utilized a lot. My professors have all been very helpful in my times on need and I am able to go to them when I need too.
Senior,5,"Best people, high quality education, and amazing city to live around. The alumni base who looks out for the undergrads definitely make it less stressful to find a job post-grad and local companies value the type of student SJU produces."
Freshman,5,This is my first year as a freshman at Saint Josephs University so far I have had all the help I’ve needed for successful completion of courses. The staff is amazing and the teachers are very knowledgeable in their field of study.
Freshman,5,l like the curriculum and the student to teacher ratios.  The community service available.  Great campus and really nice professors & faculty.
Senior,5,"great professors, be it jesuit or lay teachers. mid-size, beautifully laid out campus, easily navigable. excellent education in food marketing. best pick ever!"
Alum,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE SJU! BEST FOUR YEARS OF MY LIFE. GREAT AND BEAUTIFUL SCHOOL AND CAMPUS. EVEN BETTER PROFESSORS!
Alum,5,"Quality Business School. One of the best in the US for Insurance, Marketing, esp Food Marketing and Pharma Marketing. Accounting infused with SAP, and Data Analytics. Aligned with the United Nations for Sustainability issues. A great Leadership program, called the Dean's Leadership, teaching leadership in the Ignatian Tradition."
Sophomore,5,"While not the cheapest or most diverse school around, attending St. Joe's was the best decision I've made in a long time. My professors are awesome and I've never once felt like ""just a number,"" as class sizes are generally small. The campus atmosphere is really great, too-- my peers are generally very accepting and friendly. I highly recommend looking into coming here."
Sophomore,5,"It makes you feel like home, everyone is welcoming and supportive. Everyone pushes you to be a better person."
Junior,5,Currently a junior student athlete at Saint Joseph's University. The University really cares about its students and professors want their students to succeed. Beautiful campus!
Sophomore,5,"I love Saint Joseph's University because of the overall size, the small classroom setting, and how welcoming the student body is."
Freshman,5,"I have loved SJU since I stayed here for orientation. The campus is amazing and safe, and there are always friendly people around to help if you get lost. Living here makes me grateful for the opportunity to live here and be apart of the community. THWND!"
Sophomore,5,Small class size.  Fantastic teachers. Great community.  Varsity rowing team is top notch. Dorms are clean and nice.
Junior,5,"Choosing to attend Saint Joe's for my undergraduate degree was one of the best decisions I have ever made. The class sizes are small and intimate, allowing for professors to work closely with their students. Classes are never taught by TAs and most of the professors have doctorate degrees in the field that they are teaching in. They are approachable and always happy to help out. There is always something to do on campus, whether it be a sporting event, club meeting, party, or University sponsored event, and the city is only a short train ride away! We have a phenomenal business school, and our Risk Management program is the best in the country. Our liberal arts program is also top notch. For those wanting to enter the medical field, SJU is connected to Thomas Jefferson University and offers some accelerated masters and doctorate programs. Many students are able to travel abroad or participate in a co-op. SJU truly is an incredible school!"
Niche User,5,My son attended and graduated from SJU. It was the best decision he could have made. It is a fine Jesuit college which understands its mission.
Junior,5,My experience at Saint Joseph's University has been outstanding in all aspects. The campus is beautiful and always very clean. The class sizes are small and the professors really care about each student's success.
Freshman,5,Saint Joe's is a wonderful university. They offer a relatively diverse setting with many opportunities. Everyone is extremely friendly and the campus offers something for everyone.
Sophomore,5,I love Saint Joseph's University for the community feeling on campus and the endless opportunities that it provides. SJU encourages diversity and the caring of the whole person.
Senior,5,"As someone who is graduating this year, I can honestly say I will be incredibly sad to leave. From the gorgeous campus, to the incredible professors that deliver a top notch education, to the student body compiled of some of the happiest and nicest people I have ever met, SJU is probably one of THE best decisions I ever made."
Sophomore,5,Wonderful classes and opportunists. The more you put out the more you'll get back. The party scene isn't there but there is still lots to do.
Senior,5,"This is my fourth year at Saint Joe's, and I have loved every year. The professors are all top individuals in their fields and make the classroom relevant to the real world. The dorms are beautiful and cover all amenities. The campus is gorgeous, especially during the summer and even snowed over."
Freshman,5,"So far I am enjoying my new life as a college freshman. Making new friends. People and staff are friendly. Environment is conducive to my learning. The food selections could be improved. More choices, etc"
College Senior,5,A lot of the officers try to know and understand the students on a deep level in order to fully protect them
College Senior,5,"My first college experience was not the greatest, this was while in IUP, but here in SJU i feel like i am wanted, and that teachers, staff, security, enjoys teaching us and caring for us"
College Senior,5,SJU has one of the best basketball teams in the country
College Senior,5,SJU is a great school to attend. The teachers are thoughtful of the students and fellow students are inclusive and hard working
College Sophomore,5,"These professors will bend over backwards, jump through hoops, and do a dance in front of the entire classroom if it means helping a student succeed.  Whether it is emailing back and forth, staying after for office hours, or offering to meet up and go over some things, the professors are very helpful and complient.  Every professor has a graduate degree, because they always do more at SJU.  AS for classes, however, I wish our school had a wider variety and did not require so many core courses.  Although I value the idea of being well rounded in language, philosophy, religion, ethics, math, and science, I feel as though there is not enough time to complete every course I would like to complete."
College Sophomore,5,"A Saint Joe's education can take a student as far as they are willing to go.  SJU has a strong reputation, and is known for producing hard working, well rounded students who will later succeed in the work place.  An SJU degree proves that a prospective employee has worked hard to create themselves into the best person they could prossibly be.  Our school always has recruiters, companies, and employers come and scope out potential employees.  However, I wish they had more medical support at our school, rather than business and marketing support."
College Sophomore,5,"This is a tricky question, because all housing is different.  For example, my freshman dorm was a perfect location and relatively new, however, there were some freshman dorms that were older and a bit of a farther walk. Overall, SJU is doing the best they can with housing.  When it comes to the housing process, students get very stressed due to the randomized lottery.  I believe an easy and fair fix to this issue is to allow students who earn higher GPA's have a higher priority over those who do not take academics as serious. This way, students feel more inclined to work harder, and there is some aspect of organization as to who gets to live in what building, instead of it being a free-for-all."
College Sophomore,5,"Although I am not an athlete, I admire the athletic program our school offers. The D1 athletes wake up at 5am, have two practices a day, and even participate on community service on the weekends.  Our fans are loyal, fair, and appropriate at the sporting events.  Their school spirit is incomparable; on the field and off."
College Sophomore,5,"It has taught me how to grow, how to serve, how to be a friend, how to lead, and how to learn.  This school has changed me as a person, and showed me what is truly meaningful and important in life.  Saint Joseph's University is a special place that feels like home, that encourages each person to live greater, do more, and use your god given talents for a good purpose."
College Sophomore,5,I love the sports at Saint Joe's. Its a small school but still a D1 University which means we play against the top teams in the country. Since it is such a small school it is easy to become friends with many athletes at the University.
College Freshman,5,With a SJU education I believe I will be able to find a good career.
College Freshman,5,"As someone in greek life, I have loved the friendships that I have made, as well as the many different opportunities that it presents to me in my life."
Sophomore,4,"Saint Joseph’s University is pretty expensive, but has great academics. There is very little diversity, though."
Senior,4,They did a good job of staying organized during the fast switch. They do not however provide many updates.
Junior,4,Switching to online during the Coronavirus pandemic was difficult at first because I had never taken classes online before. However the professors were very accommodating and made the switch very easy
Junior,4,online learning at Saint Joseph University has been great. The Professors have been helpful and students connects online just like regular classroom.
Sophomore,4,"I enjoy the smaller campus community, which allows for smaller classroom sizes and more opportunities for individual focus from the professors."
Sophomore,4,Saint Joe's has an amazing small school atmosphere. The professors and upperclassmen are more than willing to help you in any way possible whether it be recreationally or in academics. This university also has a variety of tutoring services and study sessions in order to make sure that its students are doing everything that they can to do their best. Its location about 15 minutes from center city Philadelphia makes this school an even better choice for students who want to focus on work but have fun at the same time.
Junior,4,my online learning experience was pretty smooth sailing! I had no technical difficulties while using zoom and all of my professors were good about keeping us updated on what needed to be done.
Junior,4,"This school is located near the suburbs and about 15 minutes from city center which is the most ideal situation. It's a pretty small school, so get used to seeing the same people but the teacher are awesome."
Alum,4,"Overall this school was pretty good. I highly recommend Saint Joes if you are leaning towards a business major. The sense of community and overall environment was very captivating. Once a hawk, always a hawk."
Sophomore,4,"3/4 of the teacher seemed to have an understanding on the online school.  Otherwise, it was confusing and teachers were not clear."
Freshman,4,The university switched from in person classes to online classes for the remained of the Spring 2020 semester in March. The online learning experience was a big adjustment and it took a little bit of time to get used to. It was a big switch for everyone but the university made the most out of it.
Freshman,4,Saint Joseph's has a lot to offer. It's close to Philly so you can take in all it has to offer. Division 1 sports and club teams
Sophomore,4,It's a great campus with easy access to the city. Everyone is super friendly and there are plenty events and clubs for people to become involved with. Dining and gym facilities could be improved
Sophomore,4,I personally love the small campus atmosphere of Saint Joesph’s. The small campus enables you to get a sense of community with both professors and fellow students. All the professors try their best to help you pursue the career path you want to go into and the university provides a plethora of resources at your disposal to help you in your college path. I would recommend St. Joe’s to any current high school students or any student looking for a good college for that matter.
Senior,4,I liked the jesuit education echoes through coursework. One thing I think SJU can improve on is their student resources and student aid.
Niche User,4,"When I visited Saint Joseph’s University, I had a great experience. The campus was beautiful, the tour guide was great, and their location was ideal."
Niche User,4,"We did a college visit and have friends and family that have graduated from St. Joes. It's a beautiful campus, not too large where you get lost in a crowd. I am considering St. Joes for the fall of 2020."
Freshman,4,It has very nice campus and  a lot of people who care about you. There is not a lot of color people or diversity. They food life is really good and they have a lot of stores around. There is many activities to do and trying new things.
Senior,4,I had a wonderful 4 years. I made some awesome friends. But i wish they focused more on the students that are not in the business school. The food could get better.
Freshman,4,"I love this school, the only problem I have with this institution is the dining hall. The food is sub par. Also, try to hire newer coaching staff for athletics."
Junior,4,"I love attending Saint Joe's. It has such a welcoming environment, and the people there truly want you to have a wonderful college experience both inside and outside the classroom. There's plenty of extracurricular options for students to get involved in, from a student-run literary magazine to an improv club to a PRIDE club. SJU students tend to get involved in service, and there are several volunteer programs, such as Weekly Service and a trip to the Appalachian Area during spring break. There are also many things to do on and off campus during the weekends, as the school is very close to Philadelphia. The classes are intended to help students become well-rounded and well-educated. I feel very prepared for my future career, thanks to my dedicated professors."
Senior,4,"This is a great university. Even as a minority, I have loved my experience. In terms of developing skills and becoming a professional, this school is on target. The aspects of and experiences to develop service and leadership skills are endless and infinitely valuable!"
Sophomore,4,"SJU is a good university in a very good location, easy for networking. Student life is thriving with multiple clubs and activities. More diversity is needed on campus, you look at the surrounding neighborhood and the population at SJU, its surprising. The professors are good, definitely, a hit or miss, but I feel like that's most schools. The dorms need remodeling, as of right now they are redoing some dorms as far as I am concerned. The location is fairly nice, definitely one of the more safer parts of Philly, but PubSafety needs to improve. They are always late and needs to respond quicker. Campion as a freshman on a budget is your frienemy, just be careful because it will make you miss your mom's mac and cheese. Last but not least the party scene is ok, not the best but definitely not the worst. A good amount of students go off-campus for parties, but if you don't have the expenses SJU is not too bad. However, they get capped fast, and will probably get shut down."
Alum,4,"This was a great place for me to do my undergrad. I wish it was more affordable but overall a great experience. Overall the food was okay, some days better than others. Sports were doing better when I came in 2014 but if you're not into sports you'll be fine. the religion aspect isn't too present in your academics but you will run into it daily somewhere, but it's not forced on anyone."
Junior,4,"Saint Joseph's University is a well balanced 4-year university. It's location is ideal, only a quick trip into Philadelphia, but offers a large, green campus to make you feel at home. There are many near by towns that offer fun things to do, but the campus life is HUGE. There are so many ways to get involved! The academics are fair. You truly get a liberal arts experience, taking courses in all different areas of studies. The business school is career driven which is a huge positive, having a focus on getting a job in the future. SJU is a perfect size to make you feel welcome and help you step out of your comfort zone. It has about 5,000 undergraduate students allowing it to feel big and small all at the same time. Additionally, there is a large focus on service and the Jesuit ideals,  allowing students to be immersed in it, but also allowing them to decipher if they want to be involved in that aspect."
Sophomore,4,I enjoy the atmosphere at Saint Joseph's University. It is a smaller school so you come to know a majority of the students in a very short period of time. One thing I would like to see changed is the amount of clubs and activities. I am a transfer student and my old school had so much more to offer in that area so it was a let down arriving at SJU. I also think they need better facilities. The dorms are not the best and the gym isn't in the best shape.
Senior,4,SJU is a great university. There are services for most anything and the staff is generally great. I major in German so I would like a better German department since its so limited. The other areas seem much more developed and have more attention. Otherwise its great here.
Sophomore,4,"Very family-oriented university. Lots of great opportunities, activities to be involved in, supportive faculty, and great location"
Freshman,4,"As soon as I stepped on campus over a year ago, I knew Saint Joseph’s University was the place I wanted to spend the next four years of my life. The student environment is inclusive, the campus is pleasing to the eye, and the academics are above and beyond. Professors aren’t just there to teach, but to help mentor you through your college career. The dormitories are all manageable to live in; every student enjoys where they live.  Overall, I have never once regretted my enrollment at Saint Joseph’s University because SJU is and will always be a second home to me."
Sophomore,4,"It requires different classes in humanities, science, and math. They provide a good amount of scholarship money, so it's almost the price of a state school."
Freshman,4,"So far, my experience at Saint Joseph's has been pretty great. I have slowly started getting involved with numerous amount of clubs and activities the school has to offer. At first, it was  slow around campus and I was getting bored, but within a few weeks there were events held on campus, job offerings, clubs, and club sports. Saint Joseph's  University has a ton of opportunities for students to get involved with the school community and the school's surrounding communities. I, personally, really enjoy the service opportunities offered to students. I participate in Weekly Service and once a week I go and work in a kindergarten class. I feel as if I am connected more into the community than I was even in my own hometown. I would like to see the dining hall improve a little more. It isn't bad, but could be updated."
Junior,4,"At Saint Joseph's University there is a strong sense of community between students, factulty and alum. This provides a level of comfort knowing you're not just a number at the school."
Freshman,4,"Saint Joseph's is a Jesuit university and i never got to know that until i got here. The slogan Magis means, live greater. Ever since i have attended this school i have truly lived greater through the academics and the high class of peers that live and attend here."
Sophomore,4,"It iss a great school. It is also a small school, so if you do not like small schools... You probably would not like this university. I like how involved and knowledgeable the professors are. One thing I would change is the diversity, it is primarily white."
Senior,4,I would have liked to know about their food marketing co-op opportunities. If i knew about this program during my freshman year I think I would have joined it.
Alum,4,"Saint Joe's is quite expensive, however, it is a beautiful campus!  I studied psychology there for 4 years and loved it, other than the costs.  I am not a big partier, I much rather stay in on the weekends with a good movie and a few good friends.  Yet, even in the college atmosphere you can still find others who share similar interests with you!  The professors were awesome and really contributed to my learning.  My advisor was also really helpful and through the helps of my supports I landed an internship and then a job!  Some of the dorm buildings are a little bit outdated, but they are still very nice.  I would recommend trying to get any type of grants, scholarships, etc. and try to save as much as you can!"
Sophomore,4,"I am currently a sophomore at Saint Joseph's University in Philadelphia. The campus is small but nice, and the location is perfect, considering it is secluded in the suburbs of West Philadelphia, yet Center City and New Jersey are essentially a stones throw away. If parties are a high priority on your list, you want to consider going somewhere else. Although Saint Joe's has Greek life, there is barely a party scene, and it is more of a bar school than anything else.
As far as academics go, Saint Joe's has one of the top-rated business schools in the country and has many connections to the business world. Saint Joe's also has a top notch co-op program that offers students opportunities to work for some of the most notable corporations, such as Johnson & Johnson, as a sophomore or junior. 
Overall, I am having a great experience at Saint Joe's and it offers resources and tools that will for sure allow its students to succeed after college."
College Freshman,4,I feel that this is the best thing the school has to offer because they want to see u succeed and do well. They really focus on finding your calling and make sure your doing what you want
College Freshman,4,I always feel safe and secure and never feel the need to worry
College Freshman,4,Sports are big here although the gym for other students is average. Sports are probably the biggest social opportunity on campus.
College Junior,4,"i play rugby and it's treated like a division sport, although it isn't."
College Junior,4,hard to balance academics and sports....had to stop working.......no money
Recent Alumnus,4,In this sense i give it a plus!
College Junior,4,It was easy to apply. I received admission quickly.
College Junior,4,The school has a strong athletics presence.
College Sophomore,4,"On campus, from building to building, it is very safe. There are blue light security buttons, officers, and cameras,  However, once walking from off campus housing to campus buildings, there is not much security; this is where most armed robberies happen.  Also, I feel as though public safety in their university vehicles could be more timely and prompt with students' requests."
College Sophomore,4,"Students who choose to participate in Greek life are completely non-discriminatory towards those who do not.  When I joined my academic honor fraternity, I was treated no differently by anyone; I only added more friends to my niche.  Most fraternities and sororities at SJU work together to raise money for different charities, foundations, or even serve the greater Philadelphia area."
College Junior,4,Lots of variety and great professors. Unfortunately a large amount of gen-ed courses
College Junior,4,"Large alumni network/community, especially in the tri-state area for jobs, etc. The school has a lot of connections with nearby businesses. The degree is looked highly upon"
College Junior,4,Unique approach and ideals. Enormous amount of drive and passion from students. Huge sense of community and pride.
College Sophomore,4,I think that there is a good look when a person has a degree from SJU.
College Sophomore,4,I think that the overall safety of the campus is great. I dont think that there is a great amount of sexual assault on campus.
College Sophomore,4,"I really liked the dorm I lived in freshman year.  I was lucky enough to get what I think is the best dorm on campus. It is close to everything and has the best living convenience. However, it is the most expensive."
College Sophomore,4,"I love the campus, people, and location of the University. Our school is unique because of the magis. You can see the magis in every student at Saint Joe's. The magis is basically described as the ability to perform in and out of the classroom. I really became involved with the community at SJU."
College Junior,4,"As a Latina, I have never faced any overt act of doscrimation at aSt Joseph"
College Junior,4,I would prefer more flexibility in choosing classes I'm interested in.
College Junior,4,I loved my dorm freen yr and I love my school apt now
College Junior,4,Ir has been a great experience and I am looking forward to to finishing my education at st Joseph's
College Freshman,4,So many things are great about saint joe's.
College Freshman,4,Health and safety are a big part of my campus.
Sophomore,2,"Saint Josephs does not rank high in my books. It is extremely expensive and when you get here you are unsure as to why. The academics are very good but the overall school is not. We have had multiple incidents of racist comments on our campus and the diversity does not exist other than a few kids sprinkled here and there. The athletics are poor, our biggest team is the mens basketball program but no one goes to the games. Safety is questionable since there have been many armed robberys at stores around and also students being robbed. The food is so horrible that I am not on any meal plan since last year I lost over 15 pounds since i was not eating because the food would make me physically ill."
Freshman,2,Professors are great! Not much help from advisors though and very overpriced for no reason. Do not get enough out of it for the money you spend. Dining hall was awful. The workers were great but barely any selection and was not open late enough. By the time I got home from my volunteer work I could not even eat dinner because they close at 8.
College Freshman,2,Its not a big thing here
College Freshman,2,"The school isn't diverse. 80% of this school is white people who are most likely from PA or NJ, and are upper middle class."
College Freshman,2,"Sororitys are big for that demographic of girls, frats suck tho. The kids that join them are d bags."
College Junior,2,"I had a roommate that was in an abusive relationship with another student at the time. Despite her having a restraining order against him, the office to deal with this was little to no help. Combined with the fact that he was on the same floor as her and that he was not moved at all, it really was no wonder she left the university."
College Junior,2,Its hard to get online classes you want
College Junior,2,"The party scene at school is weak.  Usually it is tough to find a party unless you know someone there, and once you are there the chances are that most people heard of the same party and it gets packed.  With it getting packed, the police are highly likely to come and end the party.  Some nights you will end up not even hearing about any parties which usually results in partying in the dorms or apartments."
College Freshman,2,"Campion food is tasteless, it takes almost the entire 1st semester for your stomach to adjust to the awful food, and there are little alternatives rather than a hot dog or pizza to tie you over."
College Freshman,2,"In la farge housing, Other than the occasional cockroach sighting, cramped hallways, loud construction around 7 a.m. every morning, mediocre bathrooms, warm water issues in shower, life is what you make it in la farge. You will be living ""not so large"" in lafarge"
College Freshman,2,There should be more scholarship options.
College Freshman,2,There's not much to do especially if you're new to campus and don't know anyone
College Junior,2,"Diversity is pretty slim. I can't remember the exact percentage of non-white students that was published in our school's newspaper, but I'm almost certain it was less than 15%. Many students are wealthy; however, Saint Joe's does hand out quite a bit of scholarship money, so not everyone is as well off as you might think after walking around campus. Surprisingly enough, there aren't many extremely Catholic students, which has been pretty refreshing after being non-religious at a Catholic high school."
College Junior,2,"If you don't have any dietary restrictions, you won't have much of an issue. However, the gluten free options are typically restricted to a small fridge and the vegetarian/vegan options tend to mostly focus around the salad bar, although occasionally, you might find a vegetarian (almost never vegan) entree."
College Sophomore,2,"As a Jesuit University, they should aspire to a higher quality of behavior.  BUT they are far too strict and completely ignore the real world connection of drinking and college social life.  If they lower their standards it may keep more students safely on campus rather than traveling into the city to drink.  First hand I've seen this put more students at risk than simply allowing them to drink on campus / in dorms."
College Sophomore,2,"They are too strict, too cramped and one building may be incredible while another may be a disaster.  A true rainbow in terms of something being great to something being horrible."
College Freshman,2,I am not in Greek Life
College Senior,2,"Summer is hot, and winter is cold and snowy."
College Senior,2,Never heard about other scholarships beside the one I am dating with
College Junior,2,Saint Joseph's University does not offer scholarships or grants to graduate students.  If you are interested in obtaining your master's from this institution I recommend inquiring about your employer's education reimbursement benefits and/or finding grants and scholarships from other sources. 
College Sophomore,2,There is really no diversity at SJU. 90% of the kids are rich white catholic kids who come from the tri state area.
College Senior,2,Due to the lack of parking when it is raining or the weather is bad you have to walk atleast 15 minutes before getting to class
College Senior,2,I had many bad experiences with financial aid.
College Senior,2,I usually park on the street but there is barley ever parking spots so you have to park far from class.
College Junior,2,If you get a laptop through the school it has a warranty for your entire time here and they will always fix it. You get a certain number of free prints for the semester and they like to remind you not to print. The network is terrible when you get on it is only average speed and it will commonly drop you. 
College Junior,2,"The exact opposite from the show ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia.""  In reality, sometimes it seems more like ""it's always rainy in Philadelphia.""  With that being said however, when we do have nice weather, it can be gorgeous."
College Sophomore,2,The majority of students on campus are white middle or upper class citizens.
College Freshman,2,Definitely mostly white. Definitely mostly Christian.  Not entirely but do not expect White to be less than 75% of people's race.
College Freshman,2,"We do not have a football team and I would say we are directly focused on basketball which is exciting and draws large crowds. However, sometimes all the other sports go unnoticed. IM are popular though and everyone has a great time getting involved with that."
College Freshman,2,I know for a fact that a large majority of the students on campus are Caucasian.  Not entirely sure what part of the student body makes up other races
College Freshman,2,"Saint Joseph's University is a Catholic University, so the students are mostly Catholic. However, there are studentsof other religions, and SJU doesn't force religion on students except for the required Theology class. There are groups of international students on campus, but it is primarily white."
College Freshman,2,"Guys are preppy, girls are a little stuck up. Unless you go somewhere wearing a polo shirt, you won't get laid."
College Freshman,2,"Food here is average to bad. Unlimited sounds good at first, but it really isn't. I would much rather buy a meal plan and cook on my own, it would probably be cheaper too. But unfortunately, my dorm doesn't have a kitchen"
College Freshman,2,"Conshohocken and Lower Merion aren't too bad, actually pretty nice. But then  On the other side of campus, you can get robbed at gun point. Every so often we get updates of petty robberies in the neighborhoods toward the back of the school. So there are some nice, safe spots, and then there are some spots where you'll get robbed"
College Freshman,2,"There are no actual Greek houses on campus - they do have benches, though! To be honest, aside from one or two service-based activities per year, it seems like most members of fraternities/sororities just meet up on the weekends to go out. It's a wonderful way to make friends from different classes, though!"
College Sophomore,2,Parking can be hectic sometimes. Permit costs are a bit ridiculous too.
College Junior,2,"Shuttle Bus – In all honesty the shuttle bus varies on a day-to-day basis you could freeze to death, or miss a class waiting on a shuttle bus that suppose to run smooth and on time but other days you could be early and they seem to run every 15mins. you just never know with the shuttle bus your basically at its mercy."
College Sophomore,2,"An overwhelming majority of kids are white, but anyone who is not white still feels accepted here."
College Freshman,2,"With the expanding enrollment and limited space for parking, parking can be very difficult during normal hours.  However, there is plenty of space on side streets to park, but the campus will have to address this problem.  Especially with the new freshmen who will find a way to get a parking pass"
College Freshman,2,"Living on Campus Is Horrible – There are a few nice dorms, but for the most part campus housing is WAYYYY overproced, and you will be living extremely old buildings. Thats right, bring on the air conditioning units, mice, and roach infestations."
College Freshman,2,"The academics in the psychology department are a mess, and the Biology department has over half of the bio majors depressed and switching majors. Expecations can be unreasonable and unclear."
College Sophomore,2,"There are not a lot of party places near SJU, which means that you would have to take the train to downtown Philadelphia. Unfortunately, the last train to take you back to SJU picks up at 1:00 am and if you miss that train you must pay for a cab (~$50) or walk home."
College Senior,2,"Jesuit University – SJU is a Jesuit Catholic university, and pretty pricey compared to surrounding schools.  Don't expect a rainbow of diversity, but if you look for them different race/ethnicities can be found.  Most of the students are from Catholic high schools and have parents in higher income brackets."
College Senior,2,"It's the City – Because of SJU's location there are the usual city crimes, mostly robbery.  If you are smart about when you are by yourself it usually isn't a problem."
College Freshman,2,It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia-FALSE! Bring the rain boots and the Uggs! For the spring bring out the flip flops :)
College Freshman,2,"Not Strict – Typically, the people at the front desk don't bag check unless its late night on Thursday-Saturday"
College Sophomore,2,"You can't legally have a car if you are freshman or sophomore. If you are a freshman or sophomore and want a car you will have to find somewhere on a street to park it and that is usually unreliable or unsafe. When you are legally allowed to have a car at SJU you will have to buy a $300 parking pass in order to park it in a safe facility, otherwise you will have to continue to park on the street."
College Sophomore,2,Its Not Always Sunny in Philadelphia – it rains sometimes. it snows everynow and then. typical east coast weather. be ready to bitch during the 2 big snowstorms of the year
College Sophomore,2,Good Stuff – If you want cheap food...go to temple? Theres good stuff in Manayunk and on the mainline if youre trying to class it up. if not then theres a lesser quality but still overpriced places driving distance
College Sophomore,2,"only upperclassmen get parking passes, good luck finding anywhere to park without one, probs will get some stupid parking tickets"
College Sophomore,2,The food could certainly improve at Campion.  Many students tend to use their dining dollars rather than go to the dining hall.  There needs to be more fresh options. Many times it closes early which is very inconvenient especially when your classes happen to be at bad times for dining.  There are many options nearby but that is costly.
College Freshman,2,Its in a city. you have to parallel park and if you're not there early in the morning you most likely wont get a spot. If you buy a parking pass for on campus it can still sometimes be difficult to find parking because it is limited. Live close to campus and walk.. its much easier.
College Sophomore,2,"the crime has gone up around campus and there has not been a noticable increased securIty even though the school keeps saying there is! safety on campus is great but all but freshman housing is ""OFF CAMPUS"""
College Freshman,2,Basically everyone comes here in a relationship. It's pretty difficult to find people that are actually single. 
College Junior,2,"Limited Space and Semi-Frequent Network Problems – Even though the old bookstore got renovated into a student activity center complete with another small-size computer lab, campus labs still get pretty crowded, especially during crunch times.  Earlier this year there were tons of problems with the wireless network for the campus computers, but laptop WIFI always seemed to be working all right.  When it comes down to it, if you know you're going to need a computer for work, bring your laptop along."
College Freshman,2,"A lot of partying, drinking, loudness"
College Freshman,2,Frats Ans Soriorities Do Not Seem Too Popular – Frats and soriorities are not that popular at SJU. You do not have to be in one to fit in or have fun. People just seem to do their own thing.
College Junior,2,"While SJU is in a diverse city, the student body is not at all diverse, with very limited other races or religions. For the most part, diversity on campus is extremely rare."
College Sophomore,2,"Just  Wait – It's fair once your a Junior and a senior, you can apply and get on campus parking pass. Underclassman have to park on the side streets and there's never a spot and your care can get broken into."
College Sophomore,2,"Essentially, unless you're involved in Greek Life, you don't care about Greek Life. A very small percentage of the student population is involved in Greek Life, so it is not an important part of social life at St. Joe's at all. Frats have parties, but they are typically busted, and generally a waste of time. Sororities focus on philanthropy, which is great, but their ridiculous events and pledging antics make it difficult to take them seriously. Sororities consist of lots of ditzy girls, and the fraternities are mostly bros. I would say Greek Life is pretty stereotypical at St. Joe's, minus the reputation for throwing good parties."
Graduate Student,1,"Declined since I started, there is no effective leadership of the school with the SJU President isolated in his office. Faculty  are unhappy with constant bickering that Is beginning to pervade the classrooms"
Niche User,1,"Saint Joseph's University lacks in the following areas:
- Reputation and being well known
- Academics
- Diversity
- Location
- Size of school (subjective)"
Recent Alumnus,1,We do not not have a greek life
College Junior,1,The professor are ok at SJU you will get good and bad ones just like any other school. The registration is a nightmare it seems to change year to year and the student are never informed of this change. Professors are advisors and are not very helpful. The finals schedule always comes out at different times. 
College Junior,1,Public transportation is great and reliable. Campus transportation the shuttle is not on time and is often to full to get on. If you call public safety for a ride and you are a guy you better start walking as they never pick you up. Despite claiming that you can call them for a ride.
College Sophomore,1,There is literally no diversity at this school at all and anyone who says there is doesn't know what diversity is. I am writing this to save anyone with even a SLIGHTLY open mind from going to this school. You will feel trapped and suffocated by everyone's fake friendly greetings that they were taught to say to everyone in their catholic schools. If you want to grow and develop as a person and find out who you are by meeting different types of people do NOT go here.
College Sophomore,1,"The health and nurses department at St Joe's SUCKS. I was very very sick and the nurse only gave me advil to take...she didn't even write me a note for me to skip class. When I came home a few days later my doctor told me I should have gone to the hospital. Plainly put, they have no idea what they are doing."
College Sophomore,1,No diversity. All the girls are preppy and from New Jersey or Pennsylvania. The boys are mainly south jersey guidos too.
Recent Alumnus,1,"SJU is a Jesuit University.  The majority of the students there are both white and Catholic or Christian.  There is little diversity among the students who attend SJU but there is a lot of acceptance for people who are different.  Also, SJU costs about $50,000 a year, so the econmic backgrounds of the students are not diverse either."
Recent Alumnus,1,"I am writing to save other students from the debt that is now destroying my life. I have a decent job - but it's one that I obtained through a temp agency that I could have qualified for with a BA from any school. PLEASE PLEASE do not put yourself in debt over attending this university. This school is NOT worth it. It is priced beyond what it will ever offer you in the future. Please do not make the same mistake I did. It can ruin your financial future indefinitely. The students are extremely nasty. I was laughed out of a party for wearing a non-name brand shirt. I am a decently thin, attractive, mild-mannered girl (I would like to think), and I was treated like a freak of nature because I do not drive a BMW to school every day. Please do not put yourself through the emotional or financial chaos that I now have to live with. This school is for wealthy, white kids whose parents will pick up the tab on tuition and associated costs. Employers look for a BA, not at what school you obtained it. I really hope this helps someone."
College Freshman,1,"This school gave me little/no aid.  This school is outrageously expensive to attend and they gave me an academic scholarship that covered less than 1/4 of my tuition. Very disappointed with their financial aid office.  Basically, there are other schools out there that offer the same academics for 1/2 the price..not worth it."
College Freshman,1,"There isn't much diversity on campus, unfortunately. A majority of the student body is made up of wealthier white students, although there certainly are exceptions. People from different backgrounds are not treated differently at all, though. As far as religious diversity goes, I couldn't tell you much, simply because people don't talk about their faith as often as you might expect at a Catholic university. As a non-Catholic, I haven't felt out of place at all here."
College Freshman,1,"SJU is a business school first and foremost.  They do business very well, and not much else in my experience.  I'm a science major, and have found the science classes and programs severely lacking and disappointing.  I have taken a few business courses and they were surprisingly enjoyable and easy for someone who doesn't like business.  I was very disappointed in my french classes- I have a better accent than both my french teachers- one of whom has a Ph.D. and is the department chair (that's when you know things are bad.)  Also very few of the language teachers are natural speakers; I found that surprising and expected there to be a lot more- it's definitely a huge set back.  I haven't taken any humanities classes so I can't say much on that."
College Freshman,1,"I have not had an internship at SJU, and don't plan on getting one.  There aren't many available in the bio or chem fields, and there is little differentiating those that are available."
College Freshman,1,"I heard from someone that the public safety drivers simply watch a video on driving students then are hired. While I'm sure that isn't true, I wouldn't be surprised if it was. When an organization I am apart of took a public safety van to an event, they put more people in the van than could actually fit (so no seat belts) and the driver drove across a pretty large lawn when turning instead of staying in the road."
College Junior,1,"Presidential City – The apt.'s are close to campus that is the only upside everything else is pretty much down hill. You pay a high price to live in a dump, with very incompetent employees, I wish I never moved in here =("
College Sophomore,1,"There If You Want It. There are only a few greek organizations on campus and none of them have designated ""houses."" It is there for those that want it, but otherwise unnoticeable."
College Freshman,1,"Not Worth It – I thought my experience at SJU was going to be much better than it was, after all, I heard rave reviews about the school. It was all hype. Financial aid, the registrar's office, the food and the price are just some of the nightmares."
College Freshman,1,"I hear about kids getting scholarships, but it is pretty rare, and even if they do get some money, it is not enough to cover most expenses."
College Freshman,1,"Not Too Bad – The school isn't that strict. This us a good thing if you're the one who did something wrong, but a bad thing if you're the one who got your stuff stolen or beaten up by another student."

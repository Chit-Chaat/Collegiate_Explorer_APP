Junior,5,"The online learning experience, for me, has been great. All of my professors this semester as well as last semester were understanding, accommodating, and adapted super well to the remote learning. I cannot speak for everyone, but I think TCNJ is doing great."
Junior,5,"I'm a current junior at TCNJ and I am loving it. My professors are absolutely amazing, there are many different things to get involved with, and I always feel supported by my school. I am definitely being prepared for life after college and I am so grateful."
Alum,5,"The College of New Jersey was great for undergraduate academics, however, they are a hard school to transfer into. Parking is a bit of a hassle for students, and there is little catered to students that commute. Professors, library, academics, and resources are phenomenal."
Alum,5,I took one class online over the winter session. My professor was very compassionate and personable. They were easy to communicate with and a fair grader.
Freshman,5,They have  a great area and lot of restaurants on campus. My schedule isn't too packed and it was relatively easy to get my classes and textbooks.
Sophomore,5,I love the friendly atmosphere and the dedication that staff puts into their students and their class. I have learned a lot and I appreciate that TCNJ is just as passionate about my academics as I am. I wish that the community was more diverse though.
Senior,5,"I think given the circumstances, the professors did a good job at adjusting and being understanding for students."
Senior,5,"I have enjoyed my experience at TCNJ. The staff and students are nice, professors within my major are very supportive in helping students go in the direction they want in there career. Despite all that is currently going on, the support from faculty and TCNJ student community is very helpful during this difficult time."
Sophomore,5,"TCNJ is a beautiful, small campus with a very welcoming community. I absolutely love the amount of support."
Sophomore,5,Enjoyable and affordable school. Top notch engineering department with small class size. Helpful and courteous professors. The school and always has lots of fun outreach events and it's easy to join on-campus organizations.
Freshman,5,"Aside from having a beautiful campus, the environment is just so healthy and friendly. I always feel safe when I walk around, even at night, and everyone I have met is so welcoming. The opportunities available to students are endless, and student activities are always bountiful. The community as a whole is just so strong and it is a great place to spend your four years of university."
Freshman,5,"Academic resources are outstanding, and the amount of help offered students to enhance both personal and academic life is not nearly overwhelming with the help of center for student success.
Classes are challenging yet include stimulating discussion and ample opportunity to make lasting connections with peers, mentors, and professors across campus. 
Student life is diverse and varied, allowing for nearly any club or activity to thrive if students are interested in participating."
Freshman,5,The people are genuinely very nice and friendly. The campus is BEAUTIFUL and clearly well taken care of. The faculty were kins and very helpful. Overall amazing experience.
Niche User,5,I went to a TCNJ Open House event and instantly fell in love. The academic atmosphere is wonderful and made me eager to continue my education at an institution that warmly welcomes students and allows them to pursue their passions.
Junior,5,"What I enjoy most about TCNJ is the friendships I've made over the last 3 years. The campus is such a tight knit community, so it's easy to get to know people, and it's nice knowing that I'll always have a friend at TCNJ that I can turn to. And more than that, the friendship I experience between students can be seen in mentorship scenarios with professors - they have so much to teach! I love the community feeling that comes with being a student at TCNJ."
Freshman,5,The campus is very nice and clean! Everyone was inviting and nice. It made the day amazing! They had an influence in my decision of going there. This college is amazing and I recommend everyone to visit it!
Freshman,5,"I am only a freshman at The College of New Jersey and it has been the best experience for me. The college has been great in creating a great experience for students, especially incoming students like me, to feel comfortable in a new environment. They have programs such as, Welcome Week where students are put into groups for a whole week and are able to connect with other students and have the opportunity to ask orientation leaders about how the college experience. I am normally a shy person, which is normally something that effects me, and I was nervous that it would effect my college experience, but The College New Jersey has changed me in the best ways possible. I now feel confident and ready to conquer my college experience for the next four years."
Freshman,5,This college is very welcoming! My time here has been nothing short of pleasant. I love the atmosphere and I love the friends I made here. The staff are also very helpful and they want you to succeed. This is the place where you form tight-knit bonds that will last for a lifetime!
Freshman,5,"I personally really enjoy going to school here. Many people complain about food. There are many options during the week aside from the general dining hall, but people still complain."
Sophomore,5,"There are so many opportunities to take advangage of, and all of the faculty are constantly encouraging students to do just that. There is enough time for a social life, whether that means being involved in organizations or simply meeting amazing people in dorm buildings."
Junior,5,"My time here at The College of New Jersey has been a fantastic experience. I am a transfer student in my junior year currently in my first semester here at TCNJ. The professors are incredibly passionate and are willing to help their students, even outside of class/office hours. There's always an event happening on campus, and if you're looking for schools with a good party scene, there's so much Greek life at TCNJ, and they're always throwing something. As far as tuition goes, you just can't beat the price here. I was accepted into many schools (e.g., Amherst, BU, Bryn Mawr), but I chose TCNJ because their tuition is quite literally less than half the cost of those other schools. The campus is gorgeous, and it's so easy to find an internship because each department has an abundance of connections. All in all, TCNJ is a phenomenal school, and anyone would be lucky to come here!"
Sophomore,5,I love being a part of the student community at The College of New Jersey. I am currently a BA in Music Major and am adding a double major. The community feeling on campus is one of the things I love most about TCNJ. There are so many opportunities to get involved and meet new people as well as many opportunities to study abroad and in the Ewing community. TCNJ has something for everybody so that everyone can develop what they're interested in and pursue their future to the fullest.
Sophomore,5,"As a nursing major, I love my program. Our labs are up to date with current technology that enables active learning. The majority of nursing professors are still in their field, and they are all supportive and encouraging.  One downfall of TCNJ is its location. The immediate surrounding area does not have much to do, however, the town of Princeton is only a short drive away."
Freshman,5,"I really like the academics and the physical campus, the social sciences building is my favorite place, but the social life is seriously lacking, it is extremely difficult to go out and the RA's are very strict"
Sophomore,5,"TCNJ is a great school! It's a very small school, so most classes do not have a lot of students which allows for a lot of time with the professor. Teachers are more likely to know your name, which can be useful when it comes to rounding grades!"
Sophomore,5,The College of New Jersey is an amazing school and I have nothing but positive experiences here. Everyone is super friendly and helpful which is great because you always have someone to lean on if you ever need it. I could not have picked a better school to attend.
Sophomore,5,"If you are willing to put in the time and effort, your professors will do everything they can to get you where you want to be. Every professor is such high caliber in their field that even the seemingly ""useless"" classes will turn out to be way more informative than expected. The dorms aren't the best but they're way better than other school dorms."
Sophomore,5,"So far, I love TCNJ.  I feel right at home.  I have met so many people.  I have also had so many academic opportunities since coming to TCNJ.  I am participating in the MUSE (Mentored Undergraduate Summer Experience) research program and have secured a job as a teaching assistant in the fall.  Most of the professors here are lovely and are always willing to help you out.  The class sizes are perfect.  They are great for having class discussions or for asking questions during class.  I will say it can be challenging to find parties if you are into that.  I really enjoy the campus vibe.  Also important to note, not everyone rushes a frat or sorority.  I had a misconception that a most people joined them but that is not the case.  Most of my friends did not rush."
Junior,5,"The College of New Jersey has been a great find for my family and myself. It is a small enough school that I am not lost among the masses, but large enough to be challenging. The proximity to Philadelphia is great and the easy trip back to see my parents a couple times during the school year makes it great. I would recommend TCNJ to anyone and actually have influenced a student that graduated the year after me to come here."
Senior,5,"The College of New Jersey (TCNJ) is a public university in Ewing, New Jersey. It has amazing class sizes, employs the Socratic method, and has a great career center. It is a cost-effective option, which delivers on all that it promises."
Junior,5,The teachers really want you to succeed in life. They prepare you for the real world. The resources the school provides are amazing. The tutoring center is very outstanding.
Junior,5,The academics are the best in the state. One of the best in the nation! Excellent all around for job placement and high starting salaries.
Sophomore,5,"I love that TCNJ is such a welcoming place to be. Every time I stepped foot on to the campus I was surrounded with some of the nicest people I have ever met. In addition, I loved the dorm life at TCNJ. The towers are the most social place to live, and you are always surrounded by new people. As a freshman, you are put in orientation classes that are meant to expose the new students to all the endless opportunities the school has to offer. It was very beneficial because I would have never known that these things were available if it wasn't for these classes."
Niche User,5,"I’m currently a senior in high school and I’ve visited TCNJ about 3 times. From those times I’ve visited, everything has been great and everybody is very kind to each other. I think my most favorite part about the school is the diversity and the food places that are on campus. From what I’ve heard, their nursing program is really good, which is why it is one of the top nursing schools in New Jersey. During admitted students day, they gave all the upcoming nursing students a copy of what our classes are going to look like. When I looked at it, I felt confident that the school is going to prepare me to be the kind of nurse I want to be in the future."
Freshman,5,"The College of New Jersey was and is my dream school!!! As soon as I stepped on campus when I toured with my older brother I knew I was home! So two years later, I applied Early Decision and was accepted! These past two semesters have been more than I have ever hoped for out of my college experience! I am studying Deaf Elementary Education and English, so I get the pleasure of attending this college in a five-year graduate program! I am so excited to learn everything this college has to offer!"
Junior,5,I like the environment at TCNJ. Small classes allow students to engage in critical thinking and different view points. I wish the school was more racially diverse.
Alum,5,"I would highly recommend The College of New Jersey! The campus is beautiful, it has a great reputation for its academics, it has a community feel, and there are so many resources for students on campus."
Junior,5,"I love TCNJ. As a transfer student who came freshman spring, there were so many anxieties I had about making friends and adjusting. As soon as I moved in, I knew I was home. TCNJ is tough, and as an education (one of the most rigorous and popular majors on campus) major, I do have a lot of work to do, however it is all meaningful and makes me feel prepared for the real world. My professors really care and are so accommodating and lovely. The foods pretty good and campus town offers so many options, from Panera and fro yo to Mexican to American to Indian to Japanese, you name it. The people here are a big community, and while you’ll find jerks everywhere, they’re honestly few and far between here. If I could I’d do my undergrad experience at TCNJ over in a heartbeat."
Alum,5,small classes. Great faculty. Faculty cares about individual students. Student body generally very nice.
Niche User,5,"From my tour at the College of New Jersey the experience was a very pleasant one with me touring around the campus is very spacious and comfortable. From checking out the programs I wanted, they offered so much that I couldn't even imagine and give out lots of information on the topic I wanted. Also the students are very helpful there too."
Sophomore,5,I love the campus in general. I love how much the professors care about teaching their students. They really want to help their students enjoy and truly understand the material.
Niche User,5,"Upon a recent visitation, I intend on attending The College of New Jersey. The campus itself is well-kept and is very welcoming. Academics at this school are a priority, rather than sports. The class sizes are generally small, making it easier to know your professor 1-on-1."
Sophomore,5,The College of New Jersey was my first choice and I couldn’t be any happier going here. It is such a great school as a whole with great people. I’m honored to be a student here.
Graduate Student,5,"TCNJ is my home away from home. The small class sizes allow students to develop close relationships with professors. There are approximately 150 clubs, ranging from academic to sport to volunteering to hobbies, so everyone has something they can connect to. I have lived all four years on campus and love the community they create. The faculty, staff, and workers around campus make the campus friendly and welcoming. I would choose this school again in a heart beat."
Sophomore,5,The college of New Jersey has an outstanding education and athletics program. The freshman year experience here is incredible. TCNJ makes it very easy to meet new people and make friends. This is a very big greek life school although it does not seem as if it is. Overall it is a great school.
Junior,5,"Great environment/education and very reasonably-priced.  Athletics aren't major here, however some football/basketball games draw in a nice crowd."
Senior,5,"The College of New Jersey is an institution that works to create better individuals so that a better society will result. It is a place where all backgrounds are welcome, and it molds each one of its students to genuinely grow. By learning more about the world and simultaneously themselves, students receive a unique experience that is not regretted. Although this school is relatively small, it does an amazing job at making the students feel safe and welcome."
Sophomore,5,I loved how close the TCNJ community is and all the various resources they offer to help you succeed.
Graduate Student,5,"The ease of my application, the administration in helping me to complete my application and the professors all rank highly."
Sophomore,5,"The College of New Jersey has opened up a new experience for me. It has challengesd my learning abilities and has made me a better student. I learned how to appreciate the community around me and and to live in a hollistic mindset. I am a nursing major and the community at TCNJ has made me develop into a better person for the future as a nurse. I learn from the brilliant minds around, especially the professors and this definitely shapes my education at TCNJ."
Junior,5,"The College of New Jersey is an excellent college. The campus is gorgeous and there are different events that occur every day. The programs are rigorous and there are high expectations for each student, but every semester I feel that I have gained a significant amount of knowledge that I can apply to my future career."
Alum,5,"Excellent Biology program, made friends for life! Social aspects left to be desired, definitely not a party school. But- not the reason I went!"
Freshman,5,"The College of New Jersey is an excellent institution. Nestled in the suburban town of Ewing, NJ, TCNJ is in an excellent location by being close to major cities. The campus is beautiful and kept very well. The academics are outstanding and having small class sizes allows for each student to have individual attention. There are a plethora of ways to get involved at TCNJ. Overall, deciding to attend TCNJ has been the best choice of my life so far!"
Freshman,5,"I've been in TCNJ for one semester and it's been life-changing. I'm more social than I've ever been in my life, which probably came as a result from befriending people on my floor pretty quickly. The major I'm in (Interactive Multimedia) is a perfect fit for me!"
Freshman,5,"If you're looking for a school that has a great balance between academics and social life, this is the one for you. Though it wasn't my first choice, it truly is a hidden gem. It's the perfect size; classrooms are small enough to provide one on one attention from the professor, and you're likely to see at least 5 of your friends walking to class. If you're having a rough week, that's ok; there's always the weekend to look forward to. You can expect parties every weekend from either sports houses or frats, as well as other cool events sponsored by CUB during the week. One of the biggest mistakes that freshmen make here are not giving the school as a whole a chance. A lot of people who are unhappy with the social life or DIII athletics immediately rush to transfer to Rutgers. This school is what you make of it. Once you find your group of friends, which is so easy to do here, you will have the time of your life. I don't regret a single thing."
Freshman,5,"Overall, I love TCNJ. The classes are relevant to your major from day one freshman year, not general education classes for two years. Most of my professors have been excellent and truly care about their students. Some facilities (freshman dorms especially) are outdated, but they are working to update the campus."
Alum,5,"I loved attending TCNJ. It was a great size, very well-respected and prepared me well with a liberal arts education. I had the chance to take on new challenges and leadership roles. It is on you to make the most of it, but the resources are there. 

However, there were trends toward tightening up regulations that made it less like a college - major restrictions and rules were set on homecoming, for example, that have made it so those over 21 and those under 21 can't even be in the same area. We need to trend back toward trusting students to make smart choices and stop pseudo-babysitting."
Freshman,5,TCNJ is very diverse and focuses on academics but they offer a lot of different oppurntunities to relax from all the studying.
Freshman,5,"Every single person you meet is unique in their own way. You can always learn something new. People here are extremely nice, intelligent, and determined to succeed. The Professors truly care about you, and you are able to get help if you are struggling."
Senior,5,"I am currently attending The College of New Jersey and I absolutely love it. I lived on campus for one year and now I commute from my home in Northern NJ. Since my first major is Education of the Deaf and Hard of Hearing and my second Psychology, I have mainly spent my time in the Education Building and the Social Sciences Building. The professors here are incredibly intelligent and love to get to know the students as more than just a number. This is mainly due to the small class sizes, which I believe is one of the benefits of this institution. The professors are willing to work with you outside of class because they truly value your understanding of the subjects. I am continuously motivated to become a future educator by the professors that I have had and I can't wait to continue on in this career. I always feel safe when I am on campus and although the food isn't amazing, it is much better than other colleges that I have visited! Overall, I love TCNJ and I'm happy to be here!"
Freshman,4,"I haven't started classes yet, but the orientation was really easy and I think it will be a fun year."
Sophomore,4,"From the day you take the first tour, the community as a whole does everything it can to make you feel welcome. The only reason my experience is not higher is because it was halted by a global pandemic. You can take this as you want though because it did allow me to experience the online classes."
Sophomore,4,I finished my semester by taking classes remotely through zoom and other just through canvas. I felt that I continued to learn but do not think I benefited as much as I would have from in person classes.
Junior,4,"I love what I am learning in my classes, and there are great opportunities available to me that I feel prepared for because of academics. I feel the administration is not great at communicating with staff or students, but that makes the students work harder to figure things out and work together as a community. However, I also feel that the school, like most colleges, tends to push their political agenda on the students."
Senior,4,"Overall, I think TCNJ is a great school and community. Everyone can find where they fit in, the academics are challenging, but at the same time a student can make the most out of their four years."
Junior,4,"TCNJ typically does not offer online classes, but for COVID the professors did an amazing job switching over quickly and trying to keep the classes engaging. The  professors did their best to make sure all of us were getting our money's worth and were understanding when it came to the difficulties of online learning in a pandemic."
Junior,4,From the moment I stepped foot onto campus I fell in love with the college. People are generally super nice and I made friends easily. Freshman year in the tower dorms allowed me to make tons of friends and learn how to live on my own. The classes can be hard at times but the tutoring center can help u understand ANYTHING. I highly recommend this college for any student who wants a small campus experience without going to a smaller college.
Senior,4,I did take classes online through the use of canvas and professors using other online platforms that would allow students to get our work done was very helpful.
Alum,4,"I feel very prepared for the work field, and also enjoyed my education so much that I am returning to work on my Master's. There were a few adjunct professors that I had some questions about, however all of the full-time faculty that I had were wonderful and truly cared about my progress. A wonderful college with small class sizes (rare big lecture halls) and many opportunities to get involved on campus."
Alum,4,"My professors did the best they could with the transition to distance learning. I commend them on their dedication to trying their best to make it work. Obviously, this puts the value of in-person classes in perspective. These professors are even more wonderful face-to-face, but I truly thank them for their work on adapting to the new online platform."
Junior,4,"Good size classes and an overall friendly campus. However, the food and housing are awful and not worth the money."
Senior,4,"I transferred to TCNJ my junior year and it is like my second home. As a commuter, I'm only on campus for classes but my time there is always enjoyable. The outside spaces to study are beautiful as well as the indoor spaces. The school cares for its students and shows it by allowing us to share our opinions, beliefs, and concerns while being responsive to said concerns. TCNJ is very proactive regarding mental health issues as well as public health."
Freshman,4,"TCNJ is a very good state school. It offers rich academics, a tight-knit community and resources that will help you succeed in whatever field. Campus is beautiful during the seasons and it is a great place to be. I would have to comment on the liberal arts program, the housing, dining, social life, and LGBTQ+ community. Personally, I think the liberal arts program is wishy-washy. You can complete multiple requirements with one class: I find this personally to be a disservice to a ""liberal arts education."" The classes are extremely challenging, so be prepared to work your butt off. The freshman housing sucks, but it is a cool place to meet people. The food, do not go to EIK. Worst dining hall, some are okay with it, but I think it is nasty. If you are big partier, get involved with Greek life or else you have to pay to get into parties, yes even you girls. There also just is a lack of LGBTQ+ resources and organizations on campus, come on man! Let's have some pride."
Freshman,4,"When I visited the campus, I did not quite like the area that the school was located. However, after stepping into the campus, it felt like a different world and I forgot about the environment that I initially disliked. Each building was so perfectly structured and it made me feel at home. They were clean and kept tidy. I was able to walk to all the different buildings quickly and efficiently. It was very convenient that everywhere I needed to go was walking distance."
Senior,4,"If you want a small college that is going to prioritize education and knowledge over the party scene, this is the school for you. It is in the middle of no where and not many places to go, however it has a great community."
Sophomore,4,"TCNJ overall has interesting and academically challenging courses, as well as professors who are passionate about their job and are always available. But TCNJ is more than academics. There are so many clubs to choose from! Sports and Greek Life are also offered, but they aren't as big of a part of Campus culture as other schools. There's always something going on, so it's definitely worth it to walk around campus. There is also Campus Town, which has a Barnes and Noble, restaurants, and an Urgent Care right on campus. 
However, it is a public campus, meaning groups can come and speak, even if they are hateful (typically the campus is safe and LGBTQ+ friendly). 
The school also sometimes doesn't announce snow days until after the roads get icy, which is bad for commuters who drive all the way just for classes to be cancelled. 
For me, these cons do not outweigh the pros of going to this school. I love it here, and I do not regret choosing to attend."
Freshman,4,All of my teachers have been incredibly helpful and friendly while transitioning into this new environment.  The smaller class sizes make it easy to connect with your peers and professors. The campus is very efficient on answering emails on what ever problems or questions one may have.
Alum,4,"Loved the program, but it would be nice if the women enrolled were taken as seriously as the men were given it was a tech program."
Freshman,4,"Food could be better, dorming is fun when you have someone you like. Talking and meeting new people here is fun too, teachers are kind of annoying at times."
Sophomore,4,"Small classes allow you to build a relationship with your professor to get a better understanding of the course materials. Students, faculty, and staff are kind and courteous."
Sophomore,4,I would like to see better food options for vegetarians and vegans. Also more diversity and better use of money spending would be nice.
Junior,4,"TCNJ has provided me so many opportunities that I wouldn't have been able to partake in at other schools, like hands-on research experience and career opportunities. The professors are amazing and the campus is gorgeous! At TCNJ, you aren't a number."
Sophomore,4,"This is a very academic intense school, but mostly manageable. I have loved the student organizations and clubs here at the school, and am involved with a few. I have met do many people through these clubs, and everyone is super nice. I have had all great professors so far, and I know that there are many that everyone loves that I have yet to take a class with, which I am looking forward to. The classes are mostly interesting once you get more into your major instead of the basic curriculum courses that are required, but even those are not bad. The campus is really nice and I like the small size and smaller classes. Since this is a number 1 school for my major, I know that everything will be worth it and the program I am in is one of the best."
Freshman,4,the commuter meeting was too late for commuter students like me who had to take public transportation.
Sophomore,4,The college provides a lot of diversity to the students and wants the best for all of them. The school also has many free events that students go to when they are stressed with school work or just need some break. One thing I really love about tCNJ is that the classes are really small and you can really talk to your professors when you need help. Also many of the professors are very passionate about what they teach which helps you to be more motivated to study.
Senior,4,"I have enjoyed my time at TCNJ, it's a great school. I have had a lot f great teachers that have helped and supported me. There are a lot of clubs and activities going on somewhere on campus. Overall, I think TCNJ is worth the time and effort."
Sophomore,4,"I finished my first year at the college and had an amazing time. Its pretty rigorous but if you know how to manage your time well you'll have no problem. Social life varies depending on what you get involved in, and the only thing I would change is that there isn't much enthusiasm for sports here."
Junior,4,"I am really enjoying TCNJ! They have very good academics, especially in the education department, which I am a part of. The campus is beautiful as well! I would like to see better on campus mental health so everyone can get the help they need."
Niche User,4,"The College of New Jersey cares about their students. The professors are helpful and class sizes stay small. The campus is nice, but the surrounding area not as nice. However, the student life organization at TCNJ really tries to make the college an accepting and open-minded environment. Overall, a great college for the price."
Sophomore,4,"Freshman year was a lot of fun, but also a lot of work. The professors expect a lot from the students, but that's a good thing. I think that's what makes the school so challenging, but also so rewarding. I'm excited to see what sophomore year brings!"
Sophomore,4,"Depending on your major, you will see various levels of difficulty in your courses. The engineering department needs some work, but almost every other major is well set. With a small school, it is easy to meet people, and get familiar with the faces on campus. Once you find your group, you can have a great time at this school."
Sophomore,4,"My experience at TCNJ has been very good so far. I've become very involved in campus life, I'm on the track team, a dance club, meditation class, and have had a chance to be in a Lab. The professors I've met so far really care about their jobs, and are willing to work with you outside of class. However, I'd like to see a change in the diversity of the school. It is advertised as diverse, but sadly, it is not completely inclusive. The administration and students need to do a better job at making the campus inclusive and safe for everyone, regardless of race, ethnicity, gender, sexuality, etc."
Senior,4,"The College of New Jersey advocates for established and beneficial academics for all of their students. The class sizes are rather small, so it is easier to create relationships with your peers and professors. The only downside is that there is not much to do in the area without doing your own research and spending money on gas, a Lyft, or an Uber."
Junior,4,"Going into the campus I experienced culture shock as I was not accustomed to some of the behaviors/lifestyle of my peers. It was my first time feeling like a minority, I noticed immediately the differences between myself and the rest of my peers. Fortunately, I have met professors who understand some of the circumstances I face and believe in me. They want me to succeed and I intend to meet their expectations."
Sophomore,4,"For academics, this school is amazing! The class sizes are small so you have ample opportunities to connect with professors and most of the professors here know what they're doing and are helpful as well. However, unless you're in a sorority or a fraternity, the social life is lacking. You really have to go out of your way to find things to do. Also, the school has a clique-y vibe, so it can be difficult to make new friends. The main reason I go to this school and the reason I rated it 4 stars is for the academic programs here."
Freshman,4,The College of New Jersey offers an excellent education at a great price. People say the campus is small but I would say it's a fair size. The only downside is that it can be hard to make friends.
Freshman,4,"The only thing I would change about this school is to update the freshman dorms. The walls are very thin, so it's easy to hear everything. The bathrooms are not up-to-date and very run down, along with the rest of the building. It gets very hot very easily and very cold very easily."
Niche User,4,"I really liked the student's enthusiasm about the school, I feel like everyone genuinely enjoys going to school there.  It has a small campus, great academics as well as athletics, and the professors are great as well as easy to reach out to. It is a great school for business as well as engineering and overall is a student friendly school."
Sophomore,4,"I like the atmosphere and vibe that radiates off the campus. The professors are so helpful and they really want you to succeed. Plus, their office hours are so accommodating to a student's schedule. However, they could improve the amount of adjunct professors they have, and many of their labs/classes aren't run/offered over the summer."
Junior,4,"Absolutely love the Education department at TCNJ, all of my professors truly care about making me the best elementary school teacher that there can be. The only reason I am giving a 4 is because the History department is NOT at its peak. There are few professors who care about you and your career, very awful."
Sophomore,4,"I loved the small class sizes, allowed the professors to be able to engage with the students more. The one thing I wish would change would be the lack of diversity."
Junior,4,"TCNJ is a great school, especially if you're looking to be a teacher. The only complaint I have is that it's pretty expensive and it's a bit hard to make friends. Campus is beautiful, food is fine, and overall experience is good."
Junior,4,The College of New Jersey is a very nice school and all of the people I have met on campus were really nice. All of the teachers I had so far are very nice but I had a few that are not very good at teaching. That being said most of the teachers are helpful and respond as quickly as they can to emails. The campus is a nice size and very pretty. It takes about 15-20 minutes to get from one side of campus to the other (a lot of students use bikes to get around). Everything you really need is on campus but it can be priced kind of high.
Sophomore,4,"I have absolutely loved the time I have spent at the College of New Jersey.  Though daunting and difficult at times, I feel challenged in my course work and prepared to take on the next level of of courses to best prepare for a career.  TCNJ offers its students many great opportunities, and a wonderful community of students and staff who together are able to conquer amazing things."
Sophomore,4,A very good environment socially and academically. More majors and specializations would make this school more favorable to a wider range of students.
Junior,4,The College of New Jersey is a great liberal arts school. I love the campus. The academics in some majors are very competitive. In state tuition is worth it.
Junior,4,"The College of New Jersey is extremely academically challenging, providing me with adequate knowledge and resources to flourish post-graduation. In addition to this, the community on this campus is extremely welcoming and is where I met my life-long friends."
Sophomore,4,"Overall it is a very safe, friendly, supportive school environment  with professors who are passionate about what they teach. It is a very academically driven and provides hundreds of clubs, programs, on-campus jobs, and leadership opportunities that contribute to a wholesome student experience. Level of difficulty in classes comes down to major and the professor you have. Not a very diverse campus, but there are various cultural clubs and events so that everyone gets to feel welcomed. To experience the most of the party scene, joining Greek life or club sports helps a lot."
Freshman,4,"This mid-size school have a great engineering program.  There are many organizations for students to get involved with including various sports programs.  The class room ratio is small, which I love.  Although, I've encountered a handful of professors that are not very good in teaching but the overall teaching staff is very knowledgeable and helpful. Friendly atmosphere and a great place to learn."
Freshman,4,"TCNJ is a great school if you're looking for a school with small classes and some pretty great professors. The best thing about TCNJ is probably the small classes, since you feel obligated to show up. And if you show up to class, you'll probably do better. The professors here, for the most part, are also pretty great. But if you're looking for a school with a more urban setting with a lot of things to do around town, then TCNJ is probably not the answer. It's a pretty quiet setting, but people usually go out to Princeton or Philly if they want to go to a nearby city."
Sophomore,4,I like the overall atmosphere. It has a private university feel at a public university price. I also like the focus on academics. The average student is more focused on doing well in school than most public universities I've visited. The internet can be a bit slow at times though and the vast majority of the campus is white and middle class.
Junior,4,"The College of New Jersey, while difficult, offers a rewarding and exciting college experience for  its passionate students. The campus is a close net community of about 7,000 students allowing for professional and personal relationships. Students spend hours in the library preparing polished reports, absorbing study material, or collaborating in groups on research projects, and are well rewarded by the extensive care of student organizations. Even with numerous outlets for students, some student hit a wall, the tutoring center and writing center provide support for students to not get discouraged while trying to obtain success, however if a student does not wish to seek tutoring many professors gladly open their doors to students for questions, collaborations, support and extra help, I have never once seen a student left distressed on purpose. What is most wonderful about TCNJ is that the student is given the environment of a big school without the overwhelming numbers."
Sophomore,4,"I like the positive atmosphere and the student life.  The environment is very inclusive and friendly.  There are many clubs, sports, and Greek life organizations to be involved in.  I also admire how prestigious and rigorous the academic programs are. They effectively prepare students for future success.  The residence life provides very comfortable and clean living conditions.  One negative aspect of TCNJ is that the school does not provide many options for majors. It is also difficult for students to explore different options because they are not allowed to apply undecided, and many courses are restricted to those who are in a particular major."
Sophomore,4,"I like that TCNJ is a smaller school and the classes are more interactive and you're not just a face to your professors. I wish TCNJ had more school spirit, though."
Freshman,4,"I love the College of New Jersey. To be honest, I only chose to go here because I'm instate and the tuition was much more affordable than the other universities I was looking at. But once I started, I know I could not have made a better choice for myself. As an education major, TCNJ has an excellent reputation for producing exceptional teachers, which I was really happy about. I made friends almost right away, and the campus is beautiful. If I could change one thing, it would be the location. There's just not a lot to do in the surrounding areas, but they do provide a free bussing service to other areas to make up for it."
Sophomore,4,"I just finished my third semester at TCNJ (current sophomore) and am in the school of Nursing, Health, and Exercise Science. Overall experience has been very good. Great professors, fun and diverse student body, and many ways to get involved on campus. Amazing school for an amazing price! If you live in the state of New Jersey, definitely give TCNJ a look!"
Junior,4,"I love the culture of the college of New Jersey. Classes are very challenging, but most professors are very helpful. One thing I wish would change is the overbearing administration over Greek life."
Freshman,4,My experience has been positive thus far at the college. The small class sizes are amazing at TCNJ and really help to get you to know the professors very well. Lots of opportunities are provided through the college.
Senior,4,I transferred to TCNJ form a community college and I think it was an excellent decision. The classes here keep me busy enough so that I forget about all the stresses of being alive.
Sophomore,4,"The College of New Jersey is a great school. I'm a second-year student and have really enjoyed my experience so far. The professors and academics in general are great, and I feel engaged and challenged. We're a majority white campus, so not very diverse. The food is nothing to write home about, either way. But the grounds are beautiful, the living is comfortable, and we're directly on a bus route that can take you to the train station, and then anywhere you want to go from there."
Freshman,2,"It is a small college without much to do. The scene is very quiet and it is hard to be social in an environment that is so dead. Walk on campus and you can see how mild everything seems. Academically speaking it is very rigorous and rewarding. The professors do care, but a lot of self studying will get you through your classes. If you are looking for a strictly academically centered college experience this might be the place for you."
Junior,2,TCNJ is a laid back campus but is lacking diversity. It was hard for me to transfer in my junior year. I tried networking and getting to know people and conversing with professors but it just felt odd. Professors were not readily available for office hours and were very rude during lectures. Exams were nothing like material taught in lecture. Forcing us students to self teach. This occurred for multiple courses. Which results in no social life not being able to work. My two semesters at TCNJ sucked.
Freshman,2,"While this school has a good reputation, I had a very bad experience at TCNJ. Everyone leaves on the weekend, there's not a lot of diversity, and the staff aren't helpful. I found the classes challenging which was good but ultimately decided to transfer because I found a better a program for the career I want to pursue, on top of the reasons I listed above. Most people who stay are content with not liking it."
Alum,2,"This school is the visual representation of 5/10.
It gets you there somewhat. Administration sucks, if you’re transferring in credits be ready for a nightmare. Also dealing with R&R or the business school is painstakingly difficult. No one within the Administration replies to emails. If they do, they end up brushing you off anyways. If it weren't for the fact that certain professors within the business school were top notch, i’d give this school a zero. Also on campus recruitment is absolutely horrible. No company worth its weight recruits here. If you plan on going to the Business School, you better be a well-connected individual in order to land any decent job or internship. I wouldn’t go here again if I had the choice, and not a shot in hell i’m going to go back here for an MBA."
Freshman,2,"I am currently a freshmen science major that will be transferring next semester. TCNJ is great for students who are going into teaching or nursing. Students in STEM have to deal with a lot of adjuncts and while this isn't all bad, this means that the professors have no office hours for help. There is nothing to do on the weekends here and there are limited professors thus limited classes. Its hard to explore different classes within your major because they are simply not offered."
Freshman,2,"Oh boy. Going here was the worst decision of the first 18 years of my life. Ewing is an awful and miserable town. There is literally nothing to do. The only things to do off campus are go bowling, go to an incredibly mis managed taco bell, or buy drugs. This school is boring and everyone here is stuck up. The only reason people go here is because they are afraid to go to a big school or they are nerds. There is nothing to do here but study. Greek life here is cool but the school literally kicks every frat off campus. Only 100 students received bids this year when over 400 rushed. 
Open parties are in sketchy neighborhoods in Ewing. You need to buy tickets days in advance before parties, and they are $10, even for girls. Campus police will arrest send you to court. Please dont go here. Go somewhere interesting. Dont shelter yourself. I know you want to go here because you are afraid of a big school and want to go somewhere more academic. Dont make the same mistake I did."
Freshman,2,"I'm a freshman and I'm looking to transfer. 
This isn't a party school. There's a system unique to TCNJ parties: you need to find out from someone where ""tickets"" are being sold and purchase a ticket for $5-10. EVEN GIRLS MUST PAY. People DON'T want to tell you where tickets are being sold, it's a secretive thing around here because if parties get too crowded they get busted. 
And if you're not into parties/drinking, good luck finding something to do on weekends. The residential area of Ewing is boring, nothing to do. Campus is DEAD on weekends. I go home weekends because it's too difficult to find parties and there is nothing else to do on/around campus. 
Everyone on campus is from NJ. I have not found the student body to be open and friendly- rather, they are clique-y and not very social. 
I am looking to transfer to Rutgers to get more of a full college experience. Don't come to this school for the social aspect, as it is lacking. I wish I had chosen Rutgers in the first place."
College Sophomore,2,Just don't party if you aren't a greek. 4/5 of the parties are no good and most of the parties cost $5-$10 dollars to go to.
College Sophomore,2,"Sometimes there are as many as three or four parties in a week and sometimes there are none. Much more likely to hear about/go to a party if you are in greek life. For the rest of the student body, dorm drinking is one of your only options."
College Sophomore,2,There is not much diversity that takes place at TCNJ. More than 50% of the University consists of one ethnicity.
College Freshman,2,There is not much school spirit and that is something that is very important to me. I will be transferring to a school where school spirit and football are a huge part of the campus life.
College Freshman,2,"TCNJ is an great school and I met some of the best people that I now consider to be some of my best friends. I had an awful semester due to increased stress and anxiety which led to sleep deprivation which then caused me to give up. I will not be returning to TCNJ next semester in order to start fresh, but the school itself is perfect for anyone who would like a small school that has a great balance between having fun and being challenged."
College Junior,2,"For the first two years of my attendance at TCNJ, I was on the women's varsity swim team. I loved being a part of the team and spent all of my time with them. I met my best friend on the first day of practice. In my sophomore year, I was injured and was not able to compete with the team anymore. I did not have a positive experience after I left the team. The team completely ignored me once I stopped swimming and was very mean to me. They did not include me in anything and I felt very left out. I missed all of the friends I had made, but realized they must not have been my true friends. I think that teammates should stick together no matter what. I don't know if this is how every sports team operates at TCNJ, but I was disappointed that my swim team at college did not replace my dedicated high school team."
College Senior,2,super clique and exclusive; feels many the organizations use their philanthropies as a cover-up
College Sophomore,2,"There really aren't a lot of merit scholarships for TCNJ. The best bet is to apply for them in high school and during college. While it is cheaper if you are in-state, the room and board and other fees add up."
College Freshman,2,Not many people get scholarships unless you got a certain SAT score.
College Freshman,2,Do not go here for the parties. There are off-campus parties and some frat parties but they're house parties and you need tickets to get in. And at TCNJ the girls have to pay too. But I think there is a lot of stuff to do here other than party.
College Sophomore,2,Basically live in a bubble. If you don't have a car there's really nothing to do or anywhere to go to.
College Sophomore,2,"The football team sucks, soccer is okay. The track team is really good, and girls field hockey is too."
College Sophomore,2,"Parties honestly are crap. For the most part it's sweaty frat basements where you just get grinded on. I don't like going out unless I'm with friends I know will take care of me, and guys basically only talk to you when you go out t get with you."
College Freshman,2,The only reason I rate it lower than average is because of the football program - it sucks.
College Sophomore,2,"We are d3, we loose a lot of our own home games"
College Junior,2,"We have a terrible football team and I don't know much about other sports. We focus more on academics here. We pretty much use the games as an excuse to drink. The non-athletic gym is pretty basic and gets very crowded, but they're building a new one for next year."
College Junior,2,The closest food place for me having a religious restriction of choosing food can be found about 30 minutes driving distance from TCNJ.
College Senior,2,"Right up the road from Trenton, which is a nasty city.  Rampant poverty and crime.  Ewing isn't so bad and neither is Lawrenceville, but venture a mile or so in any direction and you'll want to carry pepper spray.  Lots of nice stuff in Philadelphia and Princeton.  Locals really don't seem to like the college.  Plenty of places to shop and eat on Route 1, but you need a car to get there unless you can navigate the NJ Transit buses full of characters from Trenton."
College Senior,2,"You either pay a lot of money or pay a little and live in a bad neighborhood.  A lot of places are expensive AND dangerous.  Relatively affordable using is only available in Trenton and sometimes Ewing, and they've often sketchy.  Better housing is available, but hard to find, is usually full, and gets further away from campus."
College Senior,2,"The nearest places are in Trenton,Philadelphia, New Brunswick, maybe Princeton.  Trenton is not somewhere I recommend students venture, but it is the closest and easiest to get to.  Lots of bars and clubs, but nobody can guarantee how safe they are."
College Sophomore,2,bad. campus police are strict and parties arent that good
College Sophomore,2,not big enough. not funded well enough. not good enough
College Sophomore,2,"theres not much around the campus, to get to anything you have to take the bus to get to places"
College Sophomore,2,division 3 isn't anything to write to your mother about
College Sophomore,2,registration process is very annoying. all the easy/good classes are taken by the upper classmen who get to choose their classes first. you are left with mediocre and hard classes in which you wont do well in
College Junior,2,"Buy rain boots! When it rains, the campus has a flooding problem. Other than that weather doesn't really affect the campus."
College Junior,2,Im still having a struggle with financial aid
College Sophomore,2,The worst thing about housing is the lottery system.  Underclassmen are guaranteed but after that it's all up in the air.  Rooming conflicts are either solved by mediation or someone moving out.  The dorms are nice but cleanliness depends on the people living on the floor.  The dorms are close to classes.
College Sophomore,2,The school does not get involved in off-campus housing.  Students can choose to get off-campus housing and after that the school generally walks away.  There are plenty of houses in the area for students to get housing but sometimes it is difficult to round up enough people to fill a house and the housing can be near bad areas.  The houses themselves are usually in good condition and the landlords seem nice enough.
College Junior,2,Wireless isn't everywhere and sometimes it doesn't work.
College Sophomore,2,"Because the area is not centered towards the college, the off campus dining options are average. There is only one late-night dining option and the food and service are consistently terrible and unhealthy."
College Sophomore,2,"There is not much to do off campus in the way of nightlife. Frat parties are small, not fun, and always get busted. The area is too residential to have a good party scene. The parties off campus often provide rides there and back, but that makes it difficult to leave a party whenever you wish. Often, you have to wait for an available ride when you wish to leave. The only bar in close proximity is a bowling alley. The other local bars and clubs are at least 15-20 minutes away and are in the middle of Trenton."
College Sophomore,2,"The wireless on campus is terrible. It constantly is going on and off, often times making school work hard to complete on time. The availability of reliable and up-to-date computers on campus is also very slim. Computer labs are often not available to students not in certain majors."
College Sophomore,2,It's a state college that's hard to get into
College Sophomore,2,I think the biggest complaint you'll hear on campus is about TCNJ wifi. Most of the dorm buildings require an ethernet cord and the internet conks out pretty regularly. 
College Sophomore,2,"TCNJ is located in Ewing, which isn't a bad place, but it does border Trenton, and that's where students start to feel a little unsafe. Most students who live on campus don't go off campus too much, and there's not a whole lot students do within close proximity to campus because it's not the safest area to do so."
College Sophomore,2,"You've got to hop on route 1, the closest highway, to get to most off campus dining options near school. They're not horribly far, just 10/15 minutes away, but getting on the highway really takes away a lot of convenience. Most of the students don't seem to mind it, but it's definitely something that could really be improved. "
College Sophomore,2,"I'm not in Greek life, and I personally don't care for most of the Greek organizations on campus. The frats don't throw parties that are all that fun and the sorority girls are very cliquey and into themselves. "
Recent Alumnus,2,"They may have upgraded the transportation since I was there, but the weekend shuttle was almost useless, to my memory. There is a train station in Hamilton, if you need to get somewhere."
College Freshman,2,"There are no clubs around, and one bar. Very little around here to do."
College Freshman,2,"There is not much peer pressure at this school, and the drug and alcohol scene is somewhat hidden because there are serious consequences if people get caught. Usage is pretty frequent as well. If you don't do drugs/ don't drink, people won't usually pressure you, and you can still have a very good social life."
College Freshman,2,"For a freshman, the housing process is pretty straight forward. Everyone finds that they like their dorms/buildings the best, but the conditions of the rooms are pretty much the same even in different buildings. The buildings are themselves kind of old, but the quality is not so bad. "
College Freshman,2,TCNJ is not that diverse. There is a little mix of all races but it is a mostly white/ Caucasian school.
College Junior,2,"Although it is easy to get a pass, if you actually want a spot you need to get there early. Because housing is only guaranteed for freshman and sophomore year many people choose to move off campus rather than risk not getting housing in the lottery. All of those who live in houses near campus and those who commute from home all compete for a certain amount of spots. You need to get there early if you want one."
College Freshman,2,"Greek life at TCNJ is pretty popular here, there are plenty of options too. Some people do it to fit in and look cool and others actually so event and for there community. But i preferably don't like the greek girls because they feel as if they are better than everyone else and only care about partying with the greek guys."
College Junior,2,it is there but no special housing is provided to them. Fraternities throw party but its mainly targeted to freshman (just trying to rush them) and only for a limited time. After sophomore year partying at frats gets boring.
College Senior,2,"The college campus is beautiful and I love it.  There is not much around off campus, and the area is not the safest."
College Senior,2,"Though I have encountered and had good experiences with a few Greeks, the overwhelmingly majority of my experience has been negative."
College Junior,2,"The school is diverse in some ways, like political beliefs, economic background and sexual orientation, but pretty homogeneous in other areas like ethnicity/race. There are tons of clubs where people can find others with similar backgrounds. For example, for different ethnic groups, like Asian American Association, Black Student Union, Caribbean Student Association and the Haitian Student Association. There are Campus Republicans and Campus Democrats. There's religious groups, like Campus Ministry Group, Christian Leadership, Hillel, and Interfaith Council. We also recently started a gay fraternity on campus. It's not hard to find a group with a background similar to yours."
College Sophomore,2,"Greek life is there for the parties, but that's about it. They don't really have a presence on campus and non-greeks really don't know much about greek life at all. The Greek students that I know are really great people though, so theres not much bad to say about Greek life in general."
College Junior,2,"There is at least 1 computer lab in each building. They're not out of date but they're definitely not the newest models either. They're usually crowded during finals and the last few weeks of the semester so plan accordingly if you absolutely need a computer. You can rent laptops in the library if you want to also. Printing on campus computers will cost you $.10 a page, so I'd suggest investing in your own. There is no wireless in the residence buildings except for the apartments so you'll need an ethernet cord. The wireless is definitely frustrating on campus though. The majority of the time it is really slow."
College Sophomore,2,"There are no fans at almost any sporting events, most freshman don't even know about the existence of a football team."
College Senior,2,"No Organization, No Fun. Basically, after freshman year if you do not join Greek Life or a sport team, night life at TCNJ disappears.  Frats and sports clubs will throw parties that cater to Freshman and become old after the first year.  If you are involved in Greek Life or on a sports team, you will be able to attend smaller and more fun get togethers to make great friends.  In the area, there are 2 close by bars and the nightclub Katmandu (now Rho).  These are pretty fun, but can get old after a while."
Niche User,1,"Do not go here. For one, you will sit alone in your asbestos contaminated room on Friday and Saturday nights. If you are condemned to live in Travers or Wolfe, good luck. If you're lucky enough to go out you will have to buy a ticket, even girls pay. On campus itself, you might see one or two people when walking around, maybe none. There no is school spirit, the football team sucks. As far as academics, some of the professors are good, and some force you to teach yourself and apply it in class. Even if the academics are ok, they don't make up for the lack of a social life and the increased stress and anxiety you will experience. If I haven't convinced you yet, give the dining hall Eick a try. It is a joke. But hey, the library's pretty."
Alum,1,"TL:DR -  I will never recommend TCNJ to ANYBODY. EVER. NO MATTER WHAT. I had such a terrible experience, and would have rather donated all my tuition money to charity so at least someone could have benefited from the thousands of wasted dollars. 100% not worth it unless you can go for free, and even then, it's questionable. Do NOT go to this school if you are completing undergrad as an Adult Learner (aka you have a full-time job, rent and bills to pay, etc). Do NOT go to this school if you are looking to become a Web Developer/Designer. 

Go to TCNJ facebook if you want to read my full review. This site only allowed 1000 words."
Junior,1,"The housing  faculty at the college is very inconsiderate and does not care about  a student's health. Also, the food at the college is very bad for you and is disgusting. Do not come to this college, it is worse than a high school."
Niche User,1,"The art staff were incredibly rude during my portfolio review. I know what a critic entails and this was not it. They commented more on the fact that the profile view of the human body is ""ugly"" and ""lumpy"" than my actual art. I left the review incredibly let down - only to get accepted four months later with a scholarship.
I'm not going here."
Freshman,1,"While the academics at TCNJ are fantastic I do not believe that this college offers a true ""college experience"".  I spent 1 semester at TCNJ and went home almost every single weekend because that is the only thing people do on the weekends.  This is a great school for commuter students and people who are just looking for an education.  But TCNJ has a terrible surrounding area and the closest mall is halfway to where I live.  
Another downfall of TCNJ is the difficulty of changing majors.  I went in as a business student because they had no undecided option and halfway through my first semester I wanted to switch to nursing.  The process of changing majors is horrendous and it is almost like TCNJ will make you keep the major you started out with because its impossible to change majors.
Lastly there is not much diversity at TCNJ, I was really disappointed in this fact and almost everyone here is stuck up and privileged."
College Freshman,1,"The food was one of the worst parts of my experience at TCNJ. Being a vegetarian, there were no options for me. The ""vegetarian"" section of the cafeteria pretty much only serves pasta and there aren't even any vegetarian sandwich options. While veggie burgers are available, they are cooked on the same grill and with the same spatula as the other food. I tried mentioning my concerns at a meeting and changes were not made."
College Sophomore,1,"Honestly I really regret going to this school. Education-wise, I'm really happy. They have great teachers and great classroom environments. However, the social scene sucks. The school feels like a bubble, and it's really hard to find things to do if you're not in greek life – and I don't think you should have to join greek because it's your only option for meeting people. For the most part people are pretty nice, but there definitely is a disadvantage to being a girl not in a sorority. If you are going to go here just for the education, then it's good. But as an overall college experience, I do not recommend."
College Freshman,1,it makes it so no one outside of greek can party except athletes because they require tickets to get into parties
College Freshman,1,the parties are ticket only so non athletes and non greek kids cant really get in to them
College Sophomore,1,"Cops walk around in the middle of the night at unreasonable times going through car after car to give tickets. Not first time warnings, tickets. And at times like 4am as well. That's ridiculous, unfair, and needs to change"
College Junior,1,There arn't alot of parties at our school at least not crazy ones it is a very nice place filled with welcoming people.
College Sophomore,1,dont like it. people who work there hate their jobs and the negativity gets to you eventually
College Junior,1,Ive never seen worse gym than the  gym at tcnj
College Junior,1,there is NOTHING to do in this area. it takes at least 15 minutes to get to nearby malls or something and you will definitely need a ride . Id rather go hang out at Rutgers or new york city during the weekends.
College Junior,1,There are hardly any good parties on campus compared to those in huge public schools..
College Junior,1,"The student parking lots are rather far from the buildings, so bad weather makes walking to the buildings miserable."
College Junior,1,Nothing to do here. Residents hate college students.
College Sophomore,1,"The local area is not good. While Trenton is the county seat, the area is unsafe. The locals often are upset with the college students because of the off campus housing situation. The off campus housing is situated in neighborhoods where the majority of the residents are not college students. The locals complain that house parties and college students' everyday life interrupts their lives."
College Sophomore,1,"Team performance is usually subpar. The most popular and usually the best teams are field hockey, girls soccer, and girls lacrosse. The school's spirit is atrocious. Almost no one goes to the football games, even on homecoming. Athletic facilities are poor. The school's physical enhancement center is a joke. Everything is broken or falling apart and the gym is so small, it's often hard to find a spot to work out."
College Junior,1,no real restaurants around... until you go into princeton which is a 25 min drive
